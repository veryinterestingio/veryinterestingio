			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants are what we call &quot;plastic&quot; in their growth, which means they deal with what their environment has to throw at them.  They can't run away, so they are very good at adapting.  On Earth, gravity is the main stimulus for the direction of growth of shoots and roots, but in space secondary stimuli will become the most important, with things like blue light guiding the direction shoots grow and things like water and oxygen gradients guiding roots.  So in general plants can grow pretty normally if the other environmental factors are maintained in the normal range.  The big challenge in microgravity is watering - plant roots need both water and oxygen because they respire like us.  Getting oxygen mixed with water in the root zone is a huge challenge because of the lack of natural convection, and so that can impact plant growth.  Other than these environmental challenges plants grow pretty normally.  We are selecting salad crops that you can pick-and-eat directly with low processing and no cooking now but in the future other types of crops can be grown.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>with no to little gravity, are the roots of plants still growing down(?) or in an orb-like fashion? are the flowers/stems showing up in one spot or is the growth omni-directional? if that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most plants the secondary stimuli take over (light, air, moisture). The leaves grow toward the light, and the roots stay in the dark areas. The root growth probably looks different than it does on Earth (a plant on Earth whose roots grown generally down might have more lateral to growth.). The leaves grow generaly toward their light source, so if that is &quot;above&quot; then they grow &quot;up&quot;. Roots also tend to follow water. So if their &quot;soil&quot; is not equally wetted the roots might favor the wet areas over the dry areas.</p></div>		</li>
