			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Canada - I have a friend who does a lot of SAR (search-and-rescue) work and I have talked to him about this, so I will add two things.</p>
<p>1) In addition to calling it in, most planes will fly back and forth over the site waggling their wings until they ensure they've been noticed.  Basically saying &quot;We see you, take hope, someone will be back.&quot;  There's tremendous morale value in conveying that message, even if the plane can't land or communicate with the people who need help.</p>
<p>2) Canadian SAR planes will also sometimes drop a &quot;care package&quot; even if they can't land.  It will have emergency supplies (food, water, shelter, and a radio.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's an example with an Airbus A350</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In reference to point 1, that is awesome and I imagine super helpful for the survivor's morale, as you said. However, I can't help but imagine if the stranded survivor is a world class pessimist the hilarious image of them going &quot;they just flapped at us and left us here to die, those assholes!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Hey buddy. I'm the SAR Tech who dropped you the radio from the C130. Glad you made it out of there in one piece, I was really relieved to finally hear your voice on comms! Well done on the video, and well done on doing what you could out there to better your outcome. Take care!</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A military helicopter landed on the beach to give them food and water until a ship arrived to pick them up...</p>
<p>Is that a weight thing?  How strict do helicopters have to be with weight capacity that it couldn't pick up even one of the men?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>. Ok guys, I get it, helicopters have strict weight limits.  I came back from dinner to 75 replies saying the exact same thing.  Thanks for your help!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It uses more fuel to hold up more weight- it  probably boils down to &quot;if we can't pick everyone up, can we drop off food for more people than would fit onto the helicopter?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The helicopter that actually landed is an ARH (Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter), which only has the capacity to seat the pilot and copilot combo. This is definitely why they weren't picked up by this crew. As part of each mission, a certain amount of rations are stored on the ARH for obvious reasons, it is my understanding that they gave them these rations. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helicopters have an extremely strict weight limit.</p>
<p>More importantly, that particular helicopter wasn't a passenger aircraft. From the photo, it looks like it was a Eurocopter Tiger - a 2-seater attack helicopter. I'm guessing they grabbed the nearest air resource and rushed it out there to deliver what they could. You can toss a couple rations and canteens in a cockpit, but you can't fit an extra person!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't understand is how that could be the first thing at the scene? Surely any ship or base that has attack helicopters also have other rotary wing assets that you'd expect them to use instead?</p>
<p>Or might the Tiger have superior range to other many non-attack helicopters if not carrying ammo or something?</p></div>		</li>
