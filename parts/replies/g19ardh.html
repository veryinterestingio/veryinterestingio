			<div class="markdown"><p>it's actually common sense, though it doesn't seem that way..</p>
<p>imagine nerves like trees.. they branch out smaller and smaller and the little tips are in the surface of the skin.. so much so that your fingertips can feel an aberration of only nanometers on a surface. They are very sensitive.</p>
<p>Now imagine 2 cuts..
a deep one will sever the &quot;tree trunks&quot;, bypassing nerves and completely severing many, turning them off..</p>
<p>This is also why really severe burns sometimes feel COLD at first.. the heat destroyed all your nerves so you cannot even feel the damage, which makes deep burns even more dangerous than they already are as you won't adequately protect the injury. </p>
<p>however a shallow cut will be RIIIIIGHT in the middle of all those little tips, hundreds and thousands of little sensors... all of them feeling the damage right next to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read a different explanation of why paper cuts hurt relatively a lot.  The cut is too shallow to bleed enough for the blood to clot and cover the wound.  This keeps the the wound exposed to air, which makes it hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human body has sensory neural receptors lathered all around. These nerves travel to your brain via your spinal cord and lay out into a small map on your brain. We call this the homonculi. Certain areas of the body have a larger “region” in the brain than others. Hence why a paper cut on the finger can sting more than the same exact cut on the forearm. Because the forearm has a smaller space on the homunculi than a finger. The brain develops this homunculi region size based on how the frequency a person uses that body part. If someone was born with no hands, and use their feet for fine motor or sensation, that persons homunculi would have a larger region to represent their feet. We call this neuroplasticity. </p>
<p>We have nerve receptors for varying stimulus, one of the is called your nociceptors. They detect noxious stimulus i.e. stimulus that can cause damage. Some areas of the body have more nociceptors than other areas. Our internal organs don’t have nociceptors, hence why a heart attack or myocardial infarction can show up as pain on a shoulder or a whole arm. </p>
<p>Additionally, in a normal functioning neural network, if a pain is so severe, the brain may even completely obliterate that pain. If someone was shot, the brain sends signals to hide that pain momentarily, evolutionarily, this helps the body get to safety e.g. fight or flight is more effective with no distraction from pain. If it’s a smaller lesion on a nerve i.e. a paper cut. The brain will bring your attention to the pain immediately to address the discomfort and recognizes that this type of pain is non-life threatening. Hence your sympathetic nervous system/fight or flight doesn’t kick in.</p></div>		</li>

The problem was the opposite tooth and due to nerve black magic fuckery I felt it on the wrong side. He was right. Pulled the other tooth and I was right as rain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That i don't know the specific cause of but it doesn't seem so strange to me that a pain could be so intense it &quot;jumps wires&quot;. I do know that dental pain in particular often shows up in the wrong place..</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>A few months ago, I accidentally crushed one of my fingernails with a door. That night I couldn't sleep because my whole hand and my arm up to the elbow hurt. It was very strange to me, since only my finger was injured. Was it because of this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.. except there's one more issue here.. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You caused damage and inflammation, which also triggers nearby nerves so there's signal to go around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You probably now held your arm and fingers odd because EVERYTHING hits a smashed finger, likely elbow slight crooked and fingers held gingerly.. this slight change will tire your muscles and tendons out because you don't usually do it, and you likely did it for hours without noticing..</p>
</li>
<li>Sleep. The chemical changes and relaxation caused right before sleep can often make pain worse or more noticeable. Your brain is trying to shut down but this.. one.. signal.. becomes your whole world. As your muscles and tendons relax, damage you were hiding by staying tense flares. And the hormones and chemical changes in your body can make certain pains worse as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>isn't pain so crazy complicated and yet so easy to feel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain is crazy complicated and why painkillers are overprescribed. Rather than seek the root cause or dig deeper into the pain, its much faster to just zap someone's nervous system with just enough drugs to not feel the pain. </p>
<p>And unfortunately medications become less effective with time (with painkillers it can literally be the second or third dose you become acclimated and lose efficacy of the drug) which leads to drug seeking behavior and dependency on painkillers in a horrid feedback loop of pain&gt; painkiller&gt; increase tolerance&gt; old dose doesn't quite mask the pain&gt; increase dose&gt; repeat....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing the hurt finger caused you to move your arm in unnatural ways throughout the day that you aren't used to which made your muscles very sore.</p>
<p>When I bruised my heels, it wasn't the heels that hurt - I was walking in an abnormal way to keep the weight off my heels, and this used my muscles in ways they've never been used before and made almost my whole freaking body ache.</p>
<p>It was basically like doing the Grinch tip-toe except all fucking day.</p></div>		</li>
