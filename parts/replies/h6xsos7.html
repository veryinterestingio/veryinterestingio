<p>Even more TL;DR:</p>
<p>Don’t have to be good, just good enough to get laid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me theory as to why non-heternormative is non uncommon among animals, especially more intelligent/social ones:</p>
<p>Having additional adults members of the species capable of the complex raising of young while being less likely to produce young on their own is a useful stopgap of surrogates for parents who die during child-rearing. It also just provides additional adult support for young members in communal, social species which tends to provide a better outcome for a species’ young overall due to the length of time investment needed to raise said young relative to their lifespan. </p>
<p>Just a theory as to why it hasn’t been selected against at least. I also think their are a lot of learned, social components to sexuality as well.</p></div>		</li>
