			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that there are 2 separate environmental benefits being considered here:</p>
<p>1 - reductions in carbon emissions (the greenhouse gases that lead to climate change - which will in turn lead to disasters, flooding, famine, war, mass migration that we can't cope with), and</p>
<p>2 - reductions in air pollutants, noxious gases and particulates that hang in the air and cause health problems for the people that breathe them in</p>
<p>In short, diesel is much better at benefit 1, while petrol is better at benefit 2. Neither are very good for either, and we really need to reduce vehicular travel, shift most remaining travel to greener public transport, and make up the rest with electric or hydrogen fuel cell cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gasoline engines used to be better at 2, ie produce less particulates and NOx.</p>
<p>But recently, with the move to smaller, direct injection engines (&quot;GDI&quot;), there has been a rise in particulates and NOx.</p>
<p>Unlike in diesel engines that use DPFs to filter out particulates (since early 2000s), gasoline engines have no regulations for filtering them, yet. (Speaking from EU viewpoint here.)</p>
<p>Also a comparable diesel engine still outperforms a gasoline engine in most scenarios when it comes to consumption. Usually the same model car with same performance saves around a liter of fuel on roadway - this makes actual CO2 calculations pretty &quot;interesting&quot; considering energy density and CO2 release per liter.</p>
<p>So the &quot;diesel bad, gasoline good&quot; is kind of flawed since in latter years diesel has been more regulated and gasoline less do and the situation is... one could say &quot;in flux&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course the unpopularity, deserved or not, of diesel will help gasoline powered engines catch up technologically, since a lot of manufacturers have either quit designing new diesel engines or have drastically reduced the amount they produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CO2 benefit is way overstated for diesels. Diesel is more energy dense, and proponents will often point to that and the accompanying decrease in CO2 generation. But diesel releases more CO2 per unit volume than gasoline. Gasoline engines have also gotten better about maximizing performance relative to their fuel consumption. The reality is that gasoline vehicles are on par, or even slightly better than diesels. <a href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/Gas%20_v%20_Diesel_%20CO2_emissions_%20EN_%20Fact%20_Sheet%202019_05_07_0.pdf" target="_blank">The ICCT did a study</a> with a couple of VW Golfs that were comparable in terms of performance but differed in engine type. They found that the gasoline engines actually emitted less CO2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, a lot of the replies I’ve seen so far are missing one key factor to the answer to your question: Dieselgate.</p>
<p>Yes, diesel still produces more energy (in BTU) per unit of volume than gasoline/petrol. Yes, that is better for the environment vis a vis CO2 emissions.</p>
<p><em>However...</em></p>
<p>Diesel, both because of its fuel content and how it’s burned in Diesel engines, produces more NOx and sulfur emissions, both of which are more <em>immediately</em> troubling for the environment than CO2 (which is more of a long-term problem).</p>
<p>Yes, there are systems like urea injection etc that not only combat these pollutants, but do it <em>rather well.</em> But they are also <em>rather expensive,</em> on top of the already-higher cost of a Diesel engine.</p>
<p>In comes Dieselgate, where engineers at VW, FCA, and Ford (that I know of off the top of my head) got caught using software cheats to choke the performance of a Diesel engine during tests, but making them run normally (and dirty) in regular driving. Basically, they were trying to sell “greener” Diesel engines <em>without</em> the anti-pollution technology, and make regulators think the pollution problem was solved.</p>
<p>It wasn’t.</p>
<p>So now that the cat is out of the bag, car companies are stuck with having to either sell diesels <em>with</em> urea injection systems etc which are more expensive and less convenient for the average driver, <strong>or</strong> invest in much cleaner, much more popular electric power trains that are more expensive (for them) up front, but will likely have a better payoff down the road.</p>
<p>So, technically, diesel is still “greener” than gas, but it’s reputation (outside commercial/heavy-hauling purposes) is tarnished enough that companies that previously were all-in on diesel are now all-in on electric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For clarification, VW, FCA, and Ford were all accused of different things.</p>
<p>VW used a hood switch. They were caught because engineers were trying to understand why they didn't need urea.</p>
<p>FCA had issues with documentation, but didn't have to change the vehicle. This is why the punishment was so small. </p>
<p>Ford was accused, but never found guilty. The online articles about this are very vague, so I don't think anything came of it. </p>
<p>VW cheated emissions on a level that we haven't seen for decades. That's why it was such a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another aspect of how the meaning of &quot;green&quot; changed: electric vehicles are now a viable transportation technology, and they blow both diesel and gas cars out of the water in their total pollution per mile statistics (especially, but not exclusively, in places with very low carbon electric grids). <del>So diesel, which was just a little bit better than gas, lost it's &quot;green&quot; designation to technology that's <em>significantly</em> better than both diesel and gas.</del></p></div>		</li>

In Germany we have the saying &quot;80 German horse powers are more than 80 french horse powers&quot; implying that for example a VW Golf with 80hp feels like it has more power than let's say a Renault Clio with 80hp because the numbers are pushed down to be beneficial for the customers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most places use horsepower, but 1 horsepower is always 745.7 watts as far as I know.</p>
<p>It also depends on the engine's power curve and where the manufacturer is measuring their listed number.  A lot of them measure a peak hp value that you'll basically never get because it happens at higher RPM than you'd ever run your engine under normal circumstances.  Some manufacturers choose to list a more realistic number that occurs in a more reasonable RPM range.  Then of course the weight of the car and the transmission have a major impact on the &quot;power&quot; you feel.  So you definitely can't judge the book by its cover when it comes to horsepower in a car.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you also get differences in the exhaust. Diesel tends to have more particulates, more NOx (contributes to smog), and more unburned hydrocarbons. You can manage that to some extent with better engine designs and emission controls but those are also pollutants and we take a lot more notice of them now than we used to.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NO2 is 300 times as potent as CO2 as a greenhouse gas, though it is more reactive than carbon so doesn't linger in the air as long (its part of the reaction to create Ozone, another greenhouse gas) Diesel produces 2-20 times as much NO2 as a gasoline car.</p>

<p>Also, it releases a lot of particulate matter in much greater volume than gas.  It's a significant contributor to Asthma, lung disease, and lung cancer.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a tough question, because it also depends where the fuel came from. Biodiesel from leftover fryer oil is probably way better, overall, than any conventional gasoline. Regular diesel from a &quot;clean&quot; crude like the Middle East has is almost certainly better than gasoline from tar sands in Alberta. But tar sand diesel is probably a train wreck compared to 85% ethanol gas, but then you have to take account of using farm land for fuel instead of food...</p>
<p>It gets messy really fast. </p>
<p>Good modern diesels are really good, if you ignore the upstream effects and just look at emissions I think they come out ahead, but there's some funky research on the long-term health impacts of particulates that might screw with that.</p></div>		</li>

Another wrinkle to this is that I believe the particulate emissions coming from tire ware are also problematic and not all that negligible if the vehicle also has a working particulate filter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Overall diesel is just as bad for the environment as gas. That it gives better fuel economy is kind of beside the point.</p>
