			<div class="markdown"><p>A question I've been wondering about: Time slows down the faster you go. So if you wanted to get somewhere as fast as possible (from the perspective of the origin and destination), lets say to another solar system, but you didn't want to travel too far into the future from the point of view of the solar systems, is there an optimal speed? You don't want to go 99.99% the speed of light because even though from your point of view you would get there fast, the time dilation would cause lots of time to pass from the point of view of the origin and destination, correct? So, is there an optimal speed between 0 and c that would get you there the fastest without traveling too far into the future? Does that make any sense? </p></div>		</li>

If there were, then the speed of light in that frame would be zero, but by the second postulate of special relativity, the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, kinda.</p>
<p>In a medium, you don't have photons but you get quasiparticles made up of photons and electromagnetic polarizations of the medium that all together act a lot like photons with a rest mass. Quasiparticles are collective behavior, so if you could look at the individual photons they would still have no rest mass and travel with the speed of light in a vaccum but their collective movement behaves as if it's a photon with a bigger mass.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT:maybe to adress this a bit in more detail before other physicists rip me a new one:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you think of glass or whatever, the light that's traveling through the glass will influence the atoms/electrons in the medium. The atoms will start to shake against each other (because they couple to the electromagnetic field of the light) and this shaking emits another electromagnetic field/photons. Via this interactions photons couple to the excitations of the glass. The collective behavior of all of this is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polariton" target="_blank">polariton</a>. The behavior of such a polariton is a mixture of the photonic behavior and the excitation of the solid. If you're close to the excitation energy of the solid, the behavior can be mostly described as similar to the &quot;pure&quot; excitation of the solid (basically just the atoms wiggling around) if you're far away in energy from this point, then the behavior is very very similar to that of a pure photon but the influence of the excitation makes the system behave like a photon with a smaller speed of light.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is btw also why glass splits visible light in different colors. The colors of light depend on it's energy from low (red) to high (blue). Since the energies of the colors are different, they are further away (or closer) from the excitation energy of the wiggling atoms and will thus behave more similar (or less similar) to &quot;normal&quot; photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kindoff. For a photon to &quot;slow down&quot; in a medium it needs to couple to other excitations in the material. The resulting quasiparticle is strictly speaking not a photon anymore and it does indeed have some non-zero effective mass.</p></div>		</li>
