			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded. How long until a working, practical reactor for power generation is built, and then how long will it take to construct a second reactor? Are they more or less easy / resource intensive to build and operate than nuclear fission? How will it convert power?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Phoenix is not directly working to develop fusion power plants today.  However, we are part of that community.  To the direct question, there is a ton of uncertainty related to many factors such as funding levels (government or private sources) and the time needed to tackle the &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; on both the plasma physics and technology development (magnets, plasma-facing surfaces, tritium breeding, etc) side of the challenge.  </p>
<p>While Phoenix's neutron generators are very different than the sort of power-producing fusion plants that others are working directly to develop, we are actively engaged with the fusion community to support the development of fusion power plants.  Our contribution is the development of even more intense DT fusion neutron generators for testing materials and components that will be used in fusion power plants.  Radiation damage is one of the key risk factor for getting to fusion energy.  We are currently working on a project with the Department of Energy on this.  I can't post our recent findings, but a couple articles can be found here (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15361055.2017.1333861" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15361055.2017.1333861" target="_blank">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15361055.2017.1333861</a></a>) and here (on slide 10) (<a href="https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-19-28131" target="_blank"><a href="https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-19-28131" target="_blank">https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-19-28131</a></a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ITER is working on net energy gain fusion in the next few years as an experimental fusion reactor. Timeframe from that to successful commercial power generation is anyones guess depending in the issues that come up. </p>
<p>Essentially the easiest way to increase your energy in/out ratio is to scale up the design. This obviously causes a very big increase in price as well as requiring even stronger magnetic fields and probably a ton of other issues im glossing over. These bring a whole host of dependencies on other tech such as superconductors which may already be available, but might need research and time to come up with (not to mention more money).</p>
<p>My guess would be somewhere between 10-20 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that guess of yours when you think fusion will replace fusion as a viable energy source? Cause if that’s the case then I think you’re significantly off the mark.</p>
<p>ITER’s existing implementation is (I believe) only designed to make it to energy neutrality and that is scheduled for 2035. The next step would be scaling it up big time. My understanding is that there will be many hurdles that come with this. Economically feasible fusion energy is not just around the corner.</p>
