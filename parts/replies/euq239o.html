			<div class="markdown"><p>Most endemic species in Hawaii are birds. There are only two endemic mammal species, a bat and a seal. There are also endemic amphibians species which are believed to have arrived in Hawaii by means of floating vegetation or other ways. The first human settlement in Hawaii originated from the Polynesians, they brought pigs and other animals. I’m no biologist but I’ve read quite a bit about Hawaii since I’m visiting in August. Cheers mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For bats, is the assumption they flew also? Seals can swim, so that makes sense to an extent, but I cannot imagine a bat is capable of flying that far?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most mammals were brought by humans and are harmful, non-native invaders.</p>
<p>But there is also the phenomenon of rafting, in which small animals living amongst pieces of debris (branches, tree trunks, masses of vegetation) washed out to sea can naturally colonize disjunct landmasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New Zealand as well! New Zealand was recently, in terms of geographical eons, completely covered by ocean. And this was after it split from Australia. So all its animals had to get there very recently through floating, being carried, flying etc.</p></div>		</li>
