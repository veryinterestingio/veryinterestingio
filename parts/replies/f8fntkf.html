			<div class="markdown"><p>When you turn on a laser, or more commonly for myself when you’re building a laser and it finally reaches the point you can call it a laser (that being when L.A.S.E.R starts happening, or more simply when you get a beam out of it) is called “lasing”or “finding lasing.” I’m not sure if this is standard but it is at my company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as the dictionary definitions seem to go, the device itself will lase, or be lasing, like you're saying, while the device will laser the target - as far as use as a verb goes.  Like the difference between throwing and hitting, but from the same root of the noun laser.</p></div>		</li>
