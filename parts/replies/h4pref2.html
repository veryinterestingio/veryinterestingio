			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there are some less ethical reasons, in Barcelona there is a hospital that was sued because apparently forces labour during the week because if the delivery is during a weekend they had to pay extra to the workers doing extra time or so there weren't a lot of people delivering simultaneously and they needed extra people, or inducing drugs so they make the delivery faster and it's cheaper, you get the point. </p>
<p>There are obviously legitimate reasons to induce labour, but since health is a business there are a lot of reasons not medically related and a lot of places that are really unethical in this regard. </p>
<p>Edit: added stuff</p></div>		</li>
