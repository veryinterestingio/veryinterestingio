			<div class="markdown"><p>I once get a dozen eggs that were all double yolks... So it wasn't a crazy fluke? Probably just a bunch of young chickens that laid the eggs? One or two is whatever but all 12 blew my mind</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you just bought the jumbo packet which contains abnormally large eggs. They weigh eggs and put all of the same weight together</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it was probably not young chickens.  Young birds lay small eggs. The first eggs can be as small as a robin's egg.  The eggs get larger as the bird gets older.  You don't see small eggs in the store because those are sorted out.  Consumers mistakenly believe that small eggs are inferior.  Often small and misshapen eggs are sent to &quot;breakers&quot; which then send the liquid, frozen, or dried eggs to commercial bakeries or kitchens for processed foods.</p></div>		</li>
