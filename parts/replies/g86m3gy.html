<p>Elevated- 120-129 / 80</p>
<p>Stage 1 Hypertension- 130-139 / 80-89. </p>
<p>Stage 2 Hypertension- 140-149 / &gt;90. </p>
<p>Very high blood pressure can damage the organs.
If the person is experiencing symptoms, or if there’s evidence of organ damage- that’s called a hypertensive crisis and it’s a medical emergency. </p>
<p>Lower is not always better. It can be normal for some people and they don’t have any problems. But a slightly or somewhat low BP can cause dizziness, fainting, etc., for some. Blood pressure is the force that makes sure your blood actually gets to all your organs and delivers oxygen and nutrients to them. If blood pressure is suuuper low, your organs won’t get enough blood- leading to organ failure and death. However, that kind of dangerously low blood pressure is usually related to severe bleeding, brain damage, serious infection, etc.</p>

<p>Blood pressure rises and falls with exercise or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Therefore it is important to clarify if the patient is in rest or was physically active before the measurement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suffer from very low blood pressure in the morning. It's fine, once I get up or am awake for a little while, but if you wake me and immediately take my blood pressure it is way low. I need to mention this everytime I have a procedure in hospital, because they come round at 5am to take blood pressure and panic, or have to do it again, after they woke me up with their panic. Last time, they started waking me up when they came in and then measured everyone else in the room, before they did me. Worked a treat and thankfully I have no issues falling back to sleep (who wants to be awake from 5am in hospital). </p>
<p>An absolute pain though, if I oversleep and try to rush out of bed in the morning. It just isn't happening, as I get dizzy and can faint.</p></div>		</li>
