			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is correct, it doesn't answer OP's actual question.</p>
<p>I guess you can boil the OP's question down to &quot;Why does P = I * V hold true?&quot; and how that would work in the water pipe analogy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like the guy you replied to, the answer &quot;because P=IV&quot; isn't really the answer.  The Law isn't the cause, the Law just describes the situation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another interesting example of laws vs causes that I stumbled across recently: quantum mechanics seems so mysterious because it was largely discovered by using math to describe what we observe in experiments. So we've largely got the laws figured out, but the causes aren't as clear. Hence all the wildly different &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics" target="_blank">interpretations</a>&quot;. I was shocked at how many there are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As no one has stated it: because of the definitions of current and p.d. </p>
<p>I = Q/t
V = W/Q</p>
<p>=&gt; I x V = W/t = power. </p>
<p>What I don't understand for AC myself is how the voltage and current can be changed by transformers, and why it is decoupled from the resistance. </p>
<p>I don't think I actually understand anything of any depth about AC.  Three phase current is another big red flag for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's basically putting the power out into the  changing magnetic field around the core and pulling it back into the secondary coil. </p>
<p>Just like doubling the number of turns in a given coil will double the magnetic flux (all else being equal), a coil with twice the number of turns in a given changing magnetic field will produce half the amount of current. Since we're talking about an ideal transformer, all the power coming in has to go out through the lines on the secondary side (so that we have 100% efficiency). This requires the voltage on the secondary to double. </p>
<p>Intuitively it's a ton easier to think of transformers transforming current rather than voltage, even though doing one implies doing the other. We usually think about transformers in terms of voltage because our power grid is designed to maintain a constant line voltage (magnitude).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thickness of the wire tells you how much current is safe to pass through it, but if you want to calculate the current, you need to know the supply voltage and the total resistance that voltage is being applied across. </p>
<p>In most situations, you want the resistance of whatever load you're supplying to be much, much greater than the resistance of the lines, since burning a lot of power in the lines wastes power that could otherwise be supplied to your load. Ideally the resistance of the lines should be small enough in comparison to the load that making the wires thicker shouldn't have a big effect on the current, but you can definitely create situations where this isn't true.  </p>
<p>If you directly connect a wire across the voltage source, the only resistance the voltage sees is the resistance of the wire, so the gauge should tell you exactly how much current is flowing. In practice this current is going to be enormous compared to what most voltage sources are designed for, so something will have to break. In an average household circuit, the circuit breaker should shut off power before anything gets too hot, but if you pick a small enough wire, it might look like a normal load to the circuit breaker, and you'll add heat until the wire melts. </p>
<p>This is why the thickness of a wire usually tells you how much power you should be putting through it more so than the amount of current you can expect to flow. If you know the current and the how much resistance each meter/inch/cm/foot of wire has, you know how much heat is being delivered to that length. With a bit of math, you can calculate what temperature the wire needs to be at to get that heat through the insulation and into the air, and if that temp is high enough that the insulation softens or melts, you're putting too much current through.</p></div>		</li>
