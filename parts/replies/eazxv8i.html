			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you for that explanation! </p>
<p>It seems you must know a lot about this stuff. Quite funny how you inserted the just in this sentence.</p>

<p>You <strong>just</strong> come up with some operator that represents the electromagnetic transition, use some approximation of the nuclear wavefunction, and calculate the decay rate from Fermi's golden rule</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So given a theoretical nucleus could we calculate the type of decay it would undergo and its half life without the need for experimentally measuring it?  I mean, I think it's a different question.  That we can account for how decay works in theory is not the same as being able to predict it.  I don't know that our theories are precise enough to calculate the half life of strontium 90 without ever encountering it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can try, but the fundamental theory underlying nuclei is quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is a strong-coupling theory at nuclear energies. A large coupling constant means you can't work out the results using perturbation theory. Rather, you have to use immense computational power to work out the results of the path integrals numerically. For nuclei bigger than about helium-4, that's not possible on current machines.</p>
<p>You can instead apply approximations to make the problem easier. For example, you can ignore the quarks of QCD and make nucleons the fundamental units of your theory. These are called &quot;ab initio&quot; methods, because they don't start from fundamental particles and giving things confusing names is hilarious. Even that's too hard for large nuclei, so you can make larger clusters of nuclei (alpha particles are a good candidate) fundamental. Each layer of approximation requires experimental input to set up the effective couplings correctly to reproduce the real world, but for many applications, you can get interesting results.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>sorry, can you do a quick primer on what the large coupling factors are in this case, and what perturbation theory is / how it works well in other scenarios.   </p>
<p>From your context I assume perturbation theory is something like ignoring higher-order effects that don't materially change results?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can, yes. But there are uncertainties involved with the calculations, and they should really be measured to test the theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To determined the probability of pre-formation is another beast. For individual nucleons, it's easy, because nothing has to &quot;form&quot;. But for alphas, clusters, or fission fragments, it's not so straightforward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of alpha decay, I think what you're describing here as the pre-factor A in the rate expression, where the rate R = A*P and P is the probability of tunneling.</p>
<p>Isn't &quot;A&quot; well approximated by the round-trip travel time of the alpha within the nuclear potential well, i.e. \~ 10^(21) s^(-1)? (c.f. <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Nuclear/alptun2.html#c1" target="_blank">hyperphysics</a>) That is to say, you don't seem to need to invoke some separate process to approximately model the correct decay rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think it does a decent job. But one has to remember that ultimately, you just have some complicated many-body wavefunction describing <strong>all</strong> A nucleons and their mutual correlations, and somehow you have to cluster them up into an alpha particle, which then has to tunnel out of the nucleus, in this simplified picture.</p></div>		</li>
