			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a tricky thing, your body does not know this &quot;foreign protein&quot; belongs to a virus or could be damaging to the body. It will express it on the surface of the cell, but not necessarily build an immune response to the expressed epitope(s). However, I am unsure how this could be properly done - usually a secondary compound is injected together with the foreign parts, to activate the immune response. I'm not sure this approach can also be done with mRNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to make sure it's presented on the right complex (mca2? I don't remember which is which) but one is presenting intra cellular debris and the other samples from what an antigen presenting cell has phagocytosed.</p>
<p>Depending on what you want to train the immune cells Tor recognize you should be able to target them differently. Not 100 sure tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peptides from proteasome processes intracellular proteins are generally expressed on MHC class I, whereas endolysosomal peptides are expressed on MHC 2. </p>
<p>All cells use the MHC class I pathway but generally only specialized antigen presenting cells use the MHC class II pathway. However, cells that express non-self peptides are liable to be killed (eg, by NK cells), and that dead cell debris will then be processed for MHC 2 presentation by antigen presenting cells. </p>
<p>Activated antigen presenting cells then “look for” the T and B cells in the body which already have a receptor that matches this peptide. When they have a match, and several signals come together, you have a process of B and T cell activation. The T cells generally proliferate and go out to seek and destroy cells expressing that viral peptide on its MHC class 1, while activated B cells begin to make antibody against the epitope. These antibodies bind to the peptide (or virus), which stimulates antibody directed cell killing (through FcγR signaling and complement pathways) and neutralization of virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For quick recall, not bad.
The complex you wanted is MHC class I (MHC I) which shows a sample of the protein being actively made inside this cell. MHC II is present on phagocytic cells to show what they have ingested</p></div>		</li>

<p>At least in principle your first point is actually a selling point for the mRNA platform. Producing the immunogen in your own cells most closely mirrors how the real virus will behave in your cells, as opposed to producing the immunogen of interest in an external system where any number of post-translational modifications may differ from the real system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It will express it on the surface of the cell, but not necessarily build an immune response to the expressed epitope(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mRNA in principle should only coding for the epitope of interest, plus required associated secondary and tertiary structures nessecary for protein folding. Thus you would expect to see a much more specific neutralizing response compared to using whole (inert) virus or being challenged with wild virus.</p>
<p>Honestly I haven't read up to confirm/deny your concern that the Covid protein would remain bound in the cell surface. My natural assumption however would be that it would shed normally and circulate similar to the natural virus, with some portion of the shed virus going on to occupy their natural receptor target.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>usually a secondary compound is injected together with the foreign parts, to activate the immune response. I'm not sure this approach can also be done with mRNA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is my understanding that the current clinical trials are evaluating versions with or without a adjuvant to enhance the immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Various groups are working on ways to deliver mRNA to specific cell types, like cancer cells, but there's no good way yet. A common approach is to take blood from a patient, and grow dendritic cells from their blood. Dendritic cells are specialised in presenting bits of protein on their surface. So you transfect this specific kind of cell safely outside of the body, then put them back into the patient. Generally speaking though, vaccines of any sort are very safe, because the immune system ignores any protein bits it recognises from normal cells. This is why the biggest hurdle for developing vaccines is not safety, but efficacy (making them actually stimulate an immune response without being ignored)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, miRNA is usually cell/tissue-specific, you can use those micro RNAs, for example, to narrow down the primary tumor in metastatic neoplasia (according to my molecular biology professor, not sure if is being used clinically or how advanced its use is), using it to target something is a whole other story and depends on what is your molecule you want to deliver and exactly where. Also, note that ssRNA/DNA's main path is being degraded if not protected with a second strand or some protein complex (mRNA usually with cap, PBP (poly-A binding protein on the 3' end) and later the ribosomal complex, at least in eukaryotes), it's not an easy topic. Lastly delivering mRNA might not be enough or might not even be translated, you're adding a finite quantity, not a way for the cell to make it and translate it, there might be a better vector (viral or not). If the goal is only to translate it a few times and then recognize the peptide as foreign (as per OP question) it should be doable although it heavily depends on the size and target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is complex, but yes it is doable. You could encapsulate the mRNA and have targets expressed on the outside of your encapsulate, which would interact with the cell you are trying to target - they bind to receptors expressed on your target cell for example, which can then trigger endocytosis and release the mRNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do that, you might as well just use an inactivated virus like a normal vaccine.</p>
<p>mRNA is hard to produce at scale because it gunks up filters, and likes to stick to things. </p>
<p>Your assay might detect it's there but another assay can say that it's not functional or it percipitates out of solution.</p></div>		</li>
