			<div class="markdown"><p>i've travelled through ely on my way to battle mountain, nevada is basically one huge test site, which is a shame because the great basin has some of the oldest trees in the entire world, and is a beautiful national park (that extends far past the official boundaries)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've lived in Northern Nevada my whole life and I think the whole thing is beautiful. I grew up in Elko so I got to see the Ruby mountains, now I live in Reno at the foot of the Sierras, I spent lots of time in Ely visiting my grandparents, and got spoiled by having access to so much public land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like Chernobyl - nature seems able to survive radiation far better then it can survive over exploitation by people. It's possible that these trees are doing better BECAUSE of the bomb tests making the area undesireable for people to live there rather then in spite of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad was a 5-pack-a-day smoker before he finally quit in 2006. That's from morning to night, one after another. He was always smoking. In the car. In the house. It was the first thing he did in the morning after he put on pants. You use your last cigarette to light your next cigarette. He only stopped to eat, sleep, and shower. He went on Chantix and hasn't touched one since.</p>
<p>EDIT: And he only quit because they were getting too expensive, almost $10 a pack where he lives. When I was a kid in the 80s, he was a 2 pack smoker. Just extrapolate how much money he spent over that time...</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm on mobile so I'll link later if you like, but he spearheaded a large cancer awareness movement and founded the John Wayne foundation for cancer patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radionuclides come from the ore-smelting process, which uses air or straight oxygen, both of which contain the stuff. Low-background steel can be recast, rolled or stamped without introducing much more...great for making anything that has to detect radiation.</p></div>		</li>
