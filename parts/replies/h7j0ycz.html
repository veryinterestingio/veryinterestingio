			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious to know why fire outranks communication and tool-making.  Not criticizing, but genuinely curious.  I can definitely see how tool making and communication would contribute to the advancement of human civilization, but fire not so much.</p>
<p>As far as I know, fire is good for two things mainly: keeping warm and cooking food.  But I don't see how either of those things is essential to the development of <em>advanced</em> civilizations, assuming underwater life is adapted to its own environment and to eating food raw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because fire led to cooking of food which led to bigger more developed brains as our diets evolved IIRC.</p>
<p>Humans ability to collectively imagine concepts that aren't physically real is also pretty unique...as far as we know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One pence more: beyond the nutritious benefits of cooking, and the obvious protection it offered from cold (expanding our ancestors habitable range), fire also enabled pottery. What good is all that revolutionary Neolithic grain if you’ve no where mouse-proof to store it? It also meant comparatively low labor cooking vessels, enabling sterilized liquids in stews/soups/brewing, preserved proteins and veggies through pickling and salting, among other things.  As technology evolved, fire also enabled metal smelting and glass blowing. </p>
<p>It’s the vital element in providing the early food security needed for permanent settlement, which in turn enabled specialization and catalyzed technological advancement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding, the theory in anthropology is that fire allowed for two major things; like you said, cooking food and warmth. Cooking food frees up more usable energy/nutrition in food, and takes less energy to digest. Fire also kept us warm at night/in the cold, so less energy had to be devoted to homeostasis. This likely allowed for our larger brains, which take a whole lot of energy to maintain and power. It may not be the most important part of becoming an advanced civilization, but it’s likely what allowed us to become a civilization at all. (This is discounting that fire powers nearly all of industry)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond cooked food is changing properties of things using fire, or heat. Coal or charred things can write. More advanced you can combine elements like coal and iron to make steel and smelt things into shapes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny how the two examples you picked are mammals. I thought I read that whales’ ancestor went from water to land and back to water.<br />
Anyway, what I really want to say is: Suck it fish and invertebrates (except maybe Mr. Octopus)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have a strange addiction and to progress. At this point it’s hard to tell what we’re even working towards.  I sometimes wonder if there could be intelligent life like dolphins who are just content with what they have and don’t feel the need to populate beyond what their natural ecosystem can provide them with. Or build factories, trade etc.  Sort of how aboriginals did however they did seem to make some progress with tools weapons and agriculture.  Just not  close to the rate we are moving now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure we, like any other animal, are addicted to working. Animals have to work for their food, security, their procreation, and sometimes their childrens survival all day. We got so good at efficiently doing all those things, or outsourcing them to other members of our communities, that we have plenty of time to work towards more long-term goals. If there would be life forms content with just chilling all day, I would ask how they even got to a point where they can afford that. Essentially, we work and progress so our children or their children will be able to have better lives than we do. Or at least, thats what we should be working towards.</p></div>		</li>
