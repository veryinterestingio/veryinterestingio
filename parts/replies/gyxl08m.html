<p>It’s pretty simple. Each breath takes in more oxygen than is needed to keep the body functioning until the next breath. When holding your breath your body continues to use oxygen but fresh supply has been cut off. As it uses oxygen your body produces CO2. The CO2 builds up which your body senses and causes the urge to breath. Your body is very conservative with this urge and makes it feel like you are dying to breath way before you run out of O2. With practice freedivers learn to suppress/ignore these signals. Once the level of O2 drops low enough you pass out. This is a safety mechanism to use less O2. The level is still not at 0. Eventually the level of O2 drops low enough that brain function cannot continue and damage starts to occur. This is when the timer starts. 4-6 min after this you are dead. </p>
<p>These are all average numbers. Individual physiology and environmental conditions can have a big impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we all know it, how come those people don't know it and end up offing themselves? I've never been near a hard drug but know about overdosing when you do your old dose that your body isn't used to anymore.</p></div>		</li>
