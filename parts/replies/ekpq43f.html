			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about that, at lemon farms.</p>
<p>But Citric acid is quite potential stuff. At work we use it to clean steel parts of oil, grease, paint, rust, glues, rubber...  </p>
<p>Hell you can use it to restore the passive oxide layer on stainless steel.  </p>
<p>And considering the warning the cans have, I wouldn't fuck around much with it.  </p>
<p>So I guess constant long term exposure from citrus fruits, could cause same kind of damage it can cause if misused as a concentrated form?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I don't think you ate this stuff. This is some sort of unholy concentrate that actually melts down rubber. Hell just using it irritates my eyes and nose, but still it has a very pleasant aroma to it.   </p>
<p>I get clean parts, and a fresh smell to my work station.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a plausible scenario. Its called citric ACID for a reason. Maybe not as strong as other acids, but its still a weaker acid. The more you handle products containing citric acid, the more you risk erosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, this is me. I work in a factory dealing with cardboard all day, definitely dry-handitis. But though my fingerprints are still there, the fingerprint machine they make us use to clock in takes me 2-3 mins to get it to read. It only has about 10 people on the floor and I'm the main picker so I definitely have the worst fingers but because it's only me they just keep the fingerprint twat.</p></div>		</li>
