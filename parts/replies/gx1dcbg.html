			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s why they need to ween people off social security and at birth and the government makes a one-time investment of $50,000 into a low cost index fund like VTI or VOO. The beneficiary then can’t touch it until age 65. Imagine what that could grow into! And it would save the gov/tax payers money because we aren’t spending nearly as much money on monthly payments to millions of people</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be vast transition cost for all the people who weren't funded at birth, like you.  </p>
<p>The concept of investment to grow requires it to be productive along the way, which means it has to have workers to pay.  Money is just markers for keeping score.  It doesn't actually produce anything.  It is the people who get paid who make anything of value.   If there aren't enough, the old people can't hire anyone to do the things they no longer can no matter how much everyone has invested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m thinking of it as $50,000 as a one time payment vs $50,000 every year for 30 years. Assuming they made enough to get $50k and live into their 90s- even if it was $30k and 10 years-that’s still a massive savings and the recipient makes much more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do realize that for the same reason what SS will eventually go bankrupt, the markets will also eventually stagnate in valuation? Decreasing work force, exponentially increasing resource costs, exponentially increasing cost of innovation, etc. will eventually stop economic growth. Your system is basically the exact same pyramid scheme, except with the additional step of putting the money in stocks first.</p></div>		</li>
