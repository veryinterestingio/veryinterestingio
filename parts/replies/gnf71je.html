			<div class="markdown"><p>People agree more easily to spend $5 per month for 2 years rather than $120</p>
<p>Also it's more flexible:<br />
person 1 plan to use it for 2 months and pay only $10<br />
person 2 plan to use it 2 years and pay $120.  </p>
<p>With a 1 time cost of $65, person 1 would not make the purchase, and person 2 would, and you'd only get $65 instead of $130</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also about support: For a lot of companies; more and more the largest cost of developing isn't the initial costs - it's the ongoing costs. Photoshop is adding new features constantly. Games like Fortnite need servers - that's a lot of money when you need servers for tens to hundreds of thousands of games being played at once. The complexity of all of these mean that bugs keep showing up - and while most of those bugs can be ignored; some can't, and need to be fixed.</p>
<p>All of these ongoing costs need to be paid for. One-time payments don't cover that. Subscriptions do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imma disagree with you on Photoshop. It was developed in the early 90s and they managed to keep afloat and turn a handsome profit (even with all the piracy). </p>

<p>The subscription models for some companies is a blatant cash grab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adobe figured out that if they can sell 20 people subscriptions basically forever that weren't willing to pay $600 for Photoshop that they would make more money.</p>
<p>Back in the day I used pirated Photoshop. Now I pay because the deal is quite reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Once you add a cloud component (storage/access/etc) to any app, you have to move to a service-fee based sales model, otherwise you have a Ponzi Scheme where the new users are paying for the upkeep for the old users... and that's gonna fall apart quickly.</p>
<p>As soon as things started costing the COMPANY monthly fees, they had to pass that payment model on to their customers, or else every new user put undue stress on the finances of the company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DUDE. I got bored last week and went through my credit card bill and tried to identify everything that I'm getting billed for every month.</p>
<p>There was a time when I thought I was going to be drawing on my iPad a LOT more... two years ago... and I don't think I've opened that app since then... but I'm still paying the monthly fee for it! Sheesh...</p></div>		</li>
