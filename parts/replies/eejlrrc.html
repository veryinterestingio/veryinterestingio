			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the math you're explaining, but the concepts behind it are still opaque to me. </p>
<p>If it takes light for years to reach something, why would it not take the passengers 4 years the same? (at least, from their point of view. I get that from our perspective it would) Is it something perceptual? Something about how we measure time? People have mentioned relative time-frames... is it that nothing &quot;new&quot; could happen to something travelling at the speed of light, since nothing can catch it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on when it's sent. If they send it anytime while the spaceship is traveling then the crew will receive it in the same amount of time after they left it was sent. For example, if a message is sent a month after they leave, then the crew will receive it a month after arriving.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you'd have to do the math to figure it out, and even if the message arrives after the ship arrives, it won't be the same amount of time as the delay in sending the message. </p>
<p>If, for example (ignoring acceleration) you send the message 1 second after the ship leaves, and the ship goes 99% C, the message can easily catch up to the ship in transit during it's 4 year voyage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if the people on the spaceship could somehow watch the people on earth, would the people on earth appear to be moving faster? the people on the spaceship would see eight years pass over six minutes. if the people on earth could somehow watch the people on the spaceship, would the people on earth appear to be moving faster? the people on earth would see six minutes pass over eight years.</p>
<p>my intuition is also that as the distance between the earth and the spaceship increases, the rate at which light information gets from one to the other also decreases. say two photons leave earth one minute apart and travel to the spaceship, which is moving away. the first photon has a shorter distance to travel than the second photon, so the second photon arrives more than a minute later than the first photon. how does that factor in? how does the perceived relative time passage due to information lag relate to actual relative time passage due to relativity?</p>
<p>and, due to frame of reference, how is the spaceship speeding away from earth any different than the earth speeding away from the spaceship? how do we know who experiences the time dilation and who experiences the time expansion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd really like to see this answered. It seems to me that there's no difference between a spaceship moving very quickly away from earth, and earth moving very quickly away from the spaceship, yet the spaceship experiences time more slowly relative to earth. Why doesn't the opposite occur?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, actually. It's really crazy, but if you know the math you can put it up on a blackboard and it works perfectly despite being the complete opposite of what logic tells you.</p>
<p>The key part is that you always observe light moving at the speed of light. So if the ship is moving away from Earth at .5c, they observe the light <em>catching up to them</em> as passing them at 1c. The math is really complicated, but if you do it, if they point a telescope back at Earth and watch a clock, and compensate for the speed of light delay, they'd say the clock on Earth is ticking slower than the clock on their ship, and people with a telescope on Earth would say the opposite.</p>
<p>It gets weirder since if the ship gets to Alpha Centauri and turns around and flies back, then more time would have passed on Earth despite the people on the ship being able to correctly say that time was passing slower on Earth the entire time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Time travel to the future is very much possible.</p>
<p>Simple even:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get into a spacecraft</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go really fast for a month or 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to Earth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realize we still don't have flying cars</p>
</li>
<li>Repeat until you return to the world Back to the Future II promised us</li>
</ul>
<p>Just need to figure out how to generate more energy than all the stars in our galaxy, but once you got that little detail figured out you are good to go.</p></div>		</li>
