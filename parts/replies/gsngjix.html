			<div class="markdown"><p>As soon as you try to transmit information, like by manipulating the spin state of one particle to change the spin state of the other, you'll find out that your action breaks the entanglement and the two particles are no longer paired.  This means that communication via entanglement isn't possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So its not about changing the spin of entangled particles.</p>
<p>Say you have 2 particles that have a 50/50 chance of being up or down. A big deal in quantum is that things are truly random, and you can prove that there isnt some hidden variable inside keeping track of whether the thing should be up or down. So these particles have a completely random 50/50 of being up or down. If you entangle these particles, then move them to opposite sides of the galaxy, they remain entangled. Then if you measure one of them it collapses into just one state (say up), and measure the other one in the same way it will also be up.</p>
<p>This seems to mean either: that there is a hidden variable that decides up or down that became synced upon entanglement (which is provably false), or one particle communicated to the other which state to collapse into.</p>
<p>This is also why you cant actually transfer information using this method; because you need to manually transfer both the particles, and the information of how to measure them.  You can take a measurement, but it doesnt mean anything unless you know how the other one was measured.</p>
<p>It's a lot less impressive when you break it down, but theres something wonky going on with entanglement.</p>
<p>(This is after a year of college qm from a professor in the field who had us do the internal variable proof, so i dont know the gritty particle physics of entanglement. But he wanted us to properly understand quantum teleportation to have a basis of understanding for conversations about it/know why people are wrong when they say you can teleport information with entangled particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The description is flawed - until a measurement occurs both entangled particles are in a superposition and could be either spin when measured, but even though the measurement of the first entangled particle has a random result the other particle, when measured, will &quot;know&quot; to be the other spin. This is what is referred to as spooky action at a distance. We can't use it to send information because it only tells us the relationship between 2 entangled particles, if we interact with one of them to alter it it will no longer be an entangled system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you have a little lamp. It is off. When you press the button, it will turn on, and randomly be red or blue with equal probability. This is your basic quantum particle.</p>
<p>You can &quot;pair&quot; two of these lamps. They are both off. After you &quot;pair&quot; them, they get a special property. If you press the button on one (call it lamp A), and it turns red, you know the other one (lamp B) will turn blue when its button is next pressed, and vice versa.</p>
<p>But you <em>don't</em> know whether A will turn red or blue; that is still 50/50. And you can't <em>force</em> it to turn red or blue.</p>
<p>So, suppose you separate them very far away from each other. You have lamp A. You press the button, it turns red.</p>
<p>Maybe that means you are the first one to press the button, and now B will be locked into blue. Or maybe side B pressed their button, and got blue, and locked you in. There is no way to know. That's why you can't transmit information - there is no way to tell the difference between &quot;I pressed it (and locked the state)&quot; vs &quot;the other side pressed it (and locked the state)&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
