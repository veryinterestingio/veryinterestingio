<p>The Earth gets the right amount of sunlight that when it's covered in water, it absorbs enough sunlight to stay above freezing, and when it's covered in ice, it absorbs little enough sunlight to stay frozen.  But if it were closer to the Sun, even an ice-covered Earth would be too hot to be frozen, and so only the water-covered Earth is possible.  If it were farther away, only the frozen Earth is possible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And let's not forget the scariest fact of all: as long as there is still ice melting in the water, temperature remains stable at around 0degC (32 F). Once all ice is melted, if you re-apply the same amount of heat to the liquid water, you raise its temperature from zero to 80°C. The runaway effect will be brutal once we reach the first ice-less arctic summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But increased water amounts and increased temperature should also lead to increased evaporation and thus cloud cover. Which provides a cooling effect by the same mechanism as ice. </p>
<p>It's pretty obvious that there are natural negative feedback loops that help regulate the environment or we'd never have left past ice ages or past warm cycles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Goldilocks zone simply means warm enough for liquid water to be on the surface. Earth is actually outside the ideal area, which is pretty much between Venus and Earth. The conservative zone (where Earth sits) extends to about the asteroid belt past Mars from what I recall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly, the fact I quote says Earth is in a particular place even in the Goldilocks zone. </p>
<p>The Goldilocks zone is equivalent to the habitable zone as in &quot;there can be surface liquid water&quot;. It is only dependant on the amount of light a star emits and doesn't necessarily imply you can actually live there easily. </p>
<p>Mars for example is inside the goldilocks zone too (near the edge) and we suspect there was running water there at some point in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the sun expands over its lifetime it will eventually reach a point where it no longer emits nearly the amount of heat it will during its primary life which is where we are currently (it’s about half way through
It’s lifetime currently) so if humanity can last another 5b years, we may have to make other planets habitable, during the expansion of the sun as it does, we may have to move to outer planets (mars primarily) after it has expanded and shrinks in size and produces less heat, we may have to move closer to the sun to find that “Goldilocks” zone.</p>
<p>I’m regard to those moons though, no. If we can get through the ice sheet to the liquid water beneath it which is there because of the squishing of the planet which generates heat under that ice sheet, we may find life, but as far as humanity being able to live under that ice, that’s a long shot to say the least. However a nuclear powered space craft with a “nuclear, uranium powered drill” would be able to get there and get through at ice sheet to see the watery abyss below and hopefully discover life in other parts of the solar system. Everywhere we’ve found water, we’ve found life. But those moons will never reach a habitual temperature to my knowledge. Not without incredible human intervention. But even then, we NEED sunlight. We’ve evolved with it. Same with gravity. Our bodies are designed to operate under our current atmospheric pressure. It’s why astronauts in space for long periods of time experience atrophy and why on planets with larger mass and density, creating a “heavier” gravitational pull could simply compress your body and organs the same way fighter pilots experience during fast maneuvers, and that constant G force alone could completely annihilate a human when sustained simply because we didn’t evolve there under those circumstances to handle those pressures or lack thereof.</p>

<p>At that point we will evolve to become actual dwarves.</p>
<p>EDIT: See my post below to detail evolutionary adaptions of humans to their environment. Also, please be able to detect hyperbole. Obviously actual dwarves with beards and hairy feet are not going to magically appear, but adaptions to environments by humans DO occur under selective pressures much like gravity might select for denser, squatter bones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The moons of Saturn could very well reach a habitable temperature when the Sun becomes a red giant.</p>
<p>The moons of Jupiter would probably be too hot by then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as the Sun is on the main sequence, Europa will be too cold for liquid water at the surface. It may already be habitable underneath due to tidal heating though.</p>
<p>Once the Sun becomes a red giant, Europa will heat up enough to melt and boil off all its water. There would be a window of (semi)habitability, but it would be temporary. Also bear in mind it takes a lot more than just the right temperature for human habitability.</p>
<p>Enceladus is also too cold for liquid water at the surface. But once the Sun goes red giant, it would fall into the habitable zone around the Sun, because it's more distant from the Sun. Then it could have liquid water at the surface.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're asking The Big Question about Snowball Earth.  We're still trying to answer it.</p>
<p>The leading hypothesis is that a crucial reaction between atmospheric carbon dioxide and rocks that removes CO2 from the atmosphere would shut down in very cold climates.  The CO2 emitted by volcanoes would then gradually build up over millions of years until it was able to heat the planet past the tipping point, and it would transition back to a warm climate.</p>
<p>The second leading explanation is that we're wrong about all of this and the Earth didn't really freeze over completely.  The geological evidence is a bit spotty so this is entirely possible.</p>
<p>A third explanation is a variant on the first: in addition to CO2, windblown and glacier-carried dirt and dust would gradually build up on the ice sheets, darkening them and making the transition to a warm climate easier.  (This one I've published some research on.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PBS Eons had a bit on that and the theory that it was really Slush ball Earth with some open water being exposed and giving necessary sunlight to marine life to keep growing and create a greenhouse effect with increased byproducts from that life. On that note...</p>
<p>Isn't it theorized that Europa could have liquid water and heat vents and stuff under the surface?  Is it possible that if life evolved there it could trigger some kind of greenhouse with their byproducts like we've had on earth? If yes, is it possible, at all, that it could greenhouse enough to melt the ice and become a water world? I'm thinking about how Venus has its runaway greenhouse effect, but if that could happen on Europa could it possibly warm up and hold a good temp for liquid surface water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists hypothesize that volcanic activity was able to counteract the total ice cover.  You can google Snowball Earth theory to learn more.  Roughly, volcanoes spew dark clouds of ash into the air and on the ground, lowering earth's albedo (ie the Earth absorbs more sunlight instead of reflecting it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traps more heat maybe, but sunlight doesn’t move as well through cloud cover than it does clear skies. Is it easier to tan on a sunny day or a rainy one? For photosynthesis to occur (which obviously acts as a scrubber) plants NEED sunlight. No sun, no scrubbing. </p>
<p>I can see this increasing global temperatures, but I’ve honestly never looked into that part in particular. I may have to retract my above statement about the cloud cover from volcanisms cooling the earth like nuclear winter would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were no land plants to pull CO2 out of the air at the time if snowball Earth (over 600mya). Other than plants, another major CO2 drain is the weathering of silicate rocks. I couldn't explain the process, but for some reason wind and rain erosion of certain rocks causes a chemical reaction which pulls CO2 out of the air. During snowball Earth, there were no plants AND no erosion because of all the ice and snow. This allowed greenhouse gases from volcanism to build up which eventually overcame the reflection of sunlight and warmed the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
