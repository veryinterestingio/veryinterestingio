			<div class="markdown"><p>The SARS vaccines were one of the reasons the COVID vaccines got developed so fast since they're both SARS viruses.</p>
<p>That's how these new mRNA vaccines were &quot;developed&quot; so quickly. Scientists had already been working on them and studying them for over a decade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to point out that some of the femoral head necrosis that you had pointed out is more than likely related to the high dose methylprednisolone that patients were treated with. The original SARS had a substantially higher death rate than the current form. To try to help with survivability, patients were treated with upwards of a 150mg of methylprednisolone a day. Totally daily dosing shouldn't exceed 64mg/day. There are many studies that show that high dose of methylprednisolone has a myriad of problems associated with it. </p>
<p>So the current studies that are out there are questioning whether the high steroids vs viral infection caused it.</p></div>		</li>
