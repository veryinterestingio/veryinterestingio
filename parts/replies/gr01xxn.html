<p>This is a really interesting topic. It also is not really science fiction. If you take a torch and put it in space and turn it on, the torch will move as the light emitted will 'push' the torch away from the emitter end (Newton's 3rd Law).</p>
<p>So it does already exist in a way but we would need a rather large emitter to actually make a 'warp drive'!</p></div>		</li>
