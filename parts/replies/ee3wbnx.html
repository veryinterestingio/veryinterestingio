			<div class="markdown"><p>The bank doesn't need to hold the money in limbo in order to invest it or lend it out. That's exactly what they do with all of the money you have in your accounts at any given time. They only keep a small fraction of their customers money as cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure they are. We're talking hundreds if not thousands of restaurants that switched from paying people in cash to the card. A lot of people at my restaurant were pissed bc they preferred cash. I don't mind tho it keeps me from making tons of bank runs and I use to walk past a homeless shelter to get to my downtown apartment and sometimes I would have hundreds of dollars of cash in my pocket. Just wish I could transfer it to my bank quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to take days, you can send a same day transfer via multiple systems. It's just if you use a commercial bank, they've decided to monetize it so, for example with Bank of America, if you want to send a same-day ETF, they charge you $50. My credit union however allows me 1 a year for free and unlimited next day, which is really just &quot;midnight.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>In some countries, for instance Thailand, the Buddhist calendar is still used which predates the Gregorian calendar by 543 years. I was born in 2501 (1958). Happy new year 2562! </p></div>		</li>
