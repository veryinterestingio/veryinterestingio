			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not just words though, it can happen with images of complex objects. it has one of my favorite informal names ever: gestaltzerfall.  It happens when you keep staring at a complex image. Eventually you'll stop seeing it as a single image, and instead start seeing it as a collection of the components that make it up.</p>
<p>If you've ever played Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum it can happen really easily. Using the slot machines in the game corner, because you have to stare at the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bwd19aijeLM/hqdefault.jpg" target="_blank">Clefairy</a> on the bottom screen during bonus stages, and press buttons in the order it indicates. this can go on for like five or ten minutes at a time. Eventually you'll just switch between seeing it as a clefairy and seeing it as the parts that make up a clefairy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me when I was a young teen. I had just got out the shower and could only stare at my reflection in the mirror for what felt like an hour. It was the first time I experienced what I would consider an 'out of body experience'. It wasn't fun, lemme tell ya. But now that I know it's likely a psychological misfire I feel less weirded out by it.</p></div>		</li>
