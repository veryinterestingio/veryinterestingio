			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that while anesthetics do knock you out pretty quick, it is not nearly as quick as you experience it to be. This is because the anesthetics affects your memory. You probably take longer to dose off than you think, you just don't remember it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so does that mean we’re actually getting to count all the way down to zero and then hanging around conscious for a while, we just don’t remember anything beyond 7? (Or whatever) Because I suspect not, but I’ve got sod-all medical training so would be interested in if that is actually the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. I've been under a bunch of times and always try this. It's legitimately impossible. </p>
<p>One time I actually saw the darkness come over me with my eyes still open. The nurse said my eyes stayed open, staring blankly. </p>
<p>It's like someone just hits the power off button and you shut down.</p></div>		</li>
