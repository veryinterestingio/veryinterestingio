			<div class="markdown"><p>I love how we essentially use basic computer language to describe the human brain. It really helps explain it, where 100 years ago, they would have had to create more abstract analogies. </p>
<p>Or maybe this a chicken or egg deal and the language we use was actually constructed based on our understanding of the brain. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used the most reccent tech to explain our physiology. During the industrial revolution it was all about mechanics and today we use computer based analogies. Curious to see what our next technological revolution and frame of thinking about ourselves will be or if the computer comparisons will persist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our modern understanding of psychology (i.e. the computationalist paradigm) is actually younger than computer theory. Before computers and the subsequent cognitive revolution, Behaviorism was the contemporary view and it explicitly did not concern itself with the inner workings of the mind. In broad strokes, psychologists only cared to observe the relationships between stimulus inputs and behavioral outputs. Some behaviorists (eliminative behaviorists) posited that internal mental states don't exist at all.</p>
<p>With computers we finally had a more rigorous analogy we could use to hypothesize and study the internal workings of the mind. The main concern beforehand was that there was no rigorous method for studying the internals of the mind, relying primarily on the Freudian concept of introspection (something even  psychologists of the era discredited). Computationalism still involves a lot of guess work, but our neuroimaging technology along with our new way of thinking gives us a lot more to work with than we had before.</p>
<p>People really underestimate how interconnected computer science and psychology are today. We more or less view the mind as an incredibly complex computer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It‚Äôs nice that we have ‚Äúbetter‚Äù terms to describe the processes going on, that however doesn‚Äôt mean the mind works like a computer.</p>
<p>By adopting the computer analogy, you run the risk of ‚ÄúHereininterpretierung‚Äù, pardon my German, the risk of interpreting according to your presupposed assumptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah indeed. Similes or analogies are useful for explaining complex things, but are in no way evidence that the things actually work the same. I think a more accurate answer to the question would've been 'we don't know, but maybe it's like how it is in a computer'.</p></div>		</li>
