			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking the top comment to say there is a book called &quot;Feeling good&quot; by david burns. He's the guy who worked on cognitive behavioural therapy for the first time. This book is really good, teaches you cognitive behavioural therapy and to be your own therapist. Anyone can read it, especially someone who can't afford therapy or is going through it at the moment.</p>
<p>Edit: i don't think I'm allowed to post a download link here, so if anyone wants it, you can pm me and I can send you the pdf link</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also recommend this book, it literally saved my life. I used cognitive therapy to push the idea that people were constantly talking about me and making fun of me. </p>
<p>It used to destroy me and keep me up at night. Know even when I know someone was actually talking about me or making fun of me, I just shrug it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation.</p>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma-ebook/dp/B00G3L1C2K/" target="_blank">“The Body Keeps the Score” by Dr. Bessel van der Kolk</a> goes into the physical, physiological and psychological processes involved in experiencing trauma, storing it, and what happens later on in life as a result.  I’ve been doing EMDR therapy for some time now, and it has really helped to start to heal the damage.  The brain is an amazing thing, truly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This book is life-changing, not only in helping you to understand your own traumas and giving you really helpful information on potentially helpful treatments as well as treatments that are unlikely to work, but it also helped me to see in every day life how sometimes when other people do or say certain things it's not always rooted in some personality flaw. Sometimes the way other people interact with the world is via trauma response. </p>
<p>I believe that when you pin it down in yourself and start to see it in others, it greatly increases not only your empathy, but also your ability to either recommend or offer help to others who are suffering, or know when to walk away from someone who isn't ready for it.</p></div>		</li>
