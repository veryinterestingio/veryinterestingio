<p>So what I gather from all the responses is that it's either local conventions or pretty much the wild west by developers + some bureaucratic stamping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm familiar with this. It was fun learning to get around there when I moved there. In KS now and it's much better. Just like the commenter you responded to we have ave EW and street NS. Plus the avenues are numbered and streets have names or letters. Might be the opposite depending on the locality or county, but mostly it's that way. What gets real fun is when there's a numbered street\ave that runs parallel to a US numbered highway with the same number. People not from here(and some who are) lose their minds when you have to give directions using both roads.</p></div>		</li>
