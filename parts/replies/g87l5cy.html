			<div class="markdown"><p><em>What a great question!  Educators are increasingly becoming exposed to mental health education and resources, so they are becoming more facile with learning how to teach on it.  Without teacher buy in, a curriculum is likely destined to fail.  Many elementary, middle, and high schools have school mental health resources “on site” to provide support to youth who might be experiencing significant symptoms and require support to learn in a least restrictive environment.  For general mental health education, it is never too early to start the conversation to talk about feelings and noticing behaviors without judgement, and helping youth develop skills in regulating their emotions and behaviors that is appropriate to their age and developmental stage.  A curriculum that is sensitive to those unique developmental stages would likely be more successful than one that is static and insensitive to meeting children where they are.
