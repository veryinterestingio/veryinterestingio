			<div class="markdown"><p>In that video, once the clamps are removed blood appears to “leak” from the newly stitched join. Intuitively this makes sense as a few stitches don’t seem to be “water tight”. How does this work? Over time I presume healing would occur at the join site but in the meantime it just leaks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually within a few minutes, small clots form at the anastomotic line which stop the bleeding. Also, as the vessel fills, it stretches, which puts tension on the sutures and snugs the vessel ends together to occlude any leaks.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it does continue to leak. If it leaks a little, and the patient is doing ok, you can usually watch and transfuse blood as needed, and wait for clotting to do the trick. If it leaks a lot, you're going back in to fix it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the body isn't moving in the sense that muscles are moving, since the patient is put under the skeletal muscles of the body will relax. What we see in this clip is movement caused by the lungs inflating, blood pulsing through major bloodvessels and the heart pumping. These things obviously cannot be stopped without the patient dying, so surgeons just have to operate with things moving around slightly. The how is through lots of practice! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes me think of a joke I read once, where a heart surgeon takes his car to a mechanic for a service, and the mechanic asks the surgeon what he does for a living, the surgeon replies that he's a heart surgeon and what that involves. The mechanic thinks about that and says what he does with cars and how it's very similar to the surgeons job. The surgeon thinks about that and tells the mechanic, &quot;try doing it with the engine running&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Practice! Years of practice and repetition. One of my teachers once said &quot;I can teach a monkey how to do surgery&quot;. He may or may not have been referring to me, but I think the point stands. There is no secret, extraordinary gift that you need to have to be a surgeon. </p>
<p>Some people are born with a natural talent for surgery, but no matter how talented you are, you have to work extraordinarily hard. Personally, I think that the hard work and good judgement required are the most important factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watching that video, I see that arterial reconstruction is like sewing a meat pipe, and I don't know what else to say except that. Surgery is weird. It's weird that somebody figured out that doing that works. And it's also a bit disconcerting thinking about the earliest surgeons who experimented in almost certainly horrifying fashion on people when they didn't even have anesthesia or ways to inhibit blood flow. And that wasn't even that long ago! Modern surgical techniques are really incredible, but 50 years or so from now, they will also probably seem incredibly crude.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you guys figured out how to make sharkbite fittings that work on humans yet, or do you have to stitch <del>and solder</del> every one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what sharkbite fittings are, but a lot of surgeries use sutures (string) with hooks along the side so you can pull tight, and once the tissue recoils back, the suture digs in and &quot;locks&quot; in place. Not a surgeon, just something I came across during my med school training, so not sure exactly which procedures call for this special suture, best I can figure are those that you do a repeating stitch due to it being hard to do individual tie-offs over and over again (ex. if youre doing a robotic procedure from inside the person and putting up  mesh).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I and my colleagues in my field are essentially glorified plumbers, it's actually a running joke in the hospital.</p>
<p>Had to google sharkbite fittings. They would be cool! I think the issue is that making some that work in humans would require fixing synthetic ends to the blood vessels, and synthetics in the body always carry the risk of clotting, getting infected, etc. Also, you would have to suture the fittings to each of your vessels anyways, so why not just suture the ends together directly? Also, sutures are cheap and they work, and surgeons like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sharkbites use little 'claws' on the inside of the fitting to grab onto the pipe, and a o-ring to make the seal </p>
<p>a organic equivalent.. You'd need some insert to keep the vessel from crushing, then slip the sharkbite over?</p>
<p>Maybe save time and just have the sharkbite teeth on the interior fitting and skip the exterior fitting? Sorta like a hose barb coupler, except with little teeth instead of ridges.</p>
<p>Several hundred bonus points if its made outta some organic material the body can reabsorb in a couple months after the vessel heals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On smaller stuff you usually have to stitch everything by hand (or by hand using a robot). On larger stuff (like an intestine for example) you can either stitch or use a surgical stapler (which is quicker to do, so maybe more like a sharkbite fitting i guess) such as here <a href="https://youtu.be/y65IacrsHtA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/y65IacrsHtA</a> (skip to 1:04)</p></div>		</li>
