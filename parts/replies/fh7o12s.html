			<div class="markdown"><p>And now there’s OptiX after CUDA, which takes advantage of RTX cards’ ray tracing tech. Blender doesn’t work “better” with a CPU. OP is referring to the blender benchmark which uses CPU and thinks that’s just how Blender works. That’s not true, it’s just simply a benchmark to test your CPU. Anyone who uses blender would prefer to render with a good gpu if they had one. This thread is full of misinformation.</p></div>		</li>
