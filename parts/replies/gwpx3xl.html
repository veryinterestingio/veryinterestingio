			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had 3 for pain caused by 2 ruptured lumbar disks and they are great but you can tell when the nerve has begun to regrown after about 10 months. </p>
<p>50 minites on your front in theatre, local anaesthetic, countless X-rays as they position the needles and trigger the nerve with electrical impulses to check they are in the right place. Then in with some anaesthetic before threading in the electrode and zap, painless nerve end death. </p>
<p>Honestly, life changing stuff but when it wears off you all of a sudden find yourself on the floor on all fours screaming in pain because it’s so effective. </p>
<p>I’ve got another consult in 2 weeks but I remember them telling me something about only getting a limited number of the ablations, I just hope I haven’t reached my limit.</p></div>		</li>
