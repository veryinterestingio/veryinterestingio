			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t even think about clothing. But for sure. </p>
<p>And the AC blowing is the same reason windy days outside feel cooler than still days, regardless of actual temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>good point about the AC,  because it is trying to make the thermostat 68 degrees,  and the air coming out is not exactly 68, it will be much colder.  And it blows on the hard wood floor right beside the vents, which feels colder anyways,  but is probably well below 68.</p>
<p>You don't get any of that outdoors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last answer is the right one. The constant motion of particles against ur skin coupled with the ac constantly running makes u give off more heat thus fell cooler indoors. Tbh it’s a compendium of all the answers here tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air from the AC is also generally pretty dry. Outside there will usually be some % of humidity, which can make it feel hotter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just AC. If it’s winter and you’re heating to 68, that air is also dry as heck.</p></div>		</li>
