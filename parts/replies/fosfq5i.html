			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass of the black holes does not change from GW emission (note: there are other processes by which BHs can lose mass). But the energy of the whole system (the BH binary) gets reduced, leading to a de facto reduction in mass of the entire post-merger system.</p></div>		</li>
