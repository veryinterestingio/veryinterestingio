			<div class="markdown"><p>I get so scared during the proper lens test though. Like I start second guessing myself; &quot;wait did that one really seem better? Maybe the last one was enough and this one is too strong. What if I answer wrong, i'll get the wrong glasses and waste all this money&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: Can I ask you guys, before you got glasses did you start feeling all weird and lightheaded when looking at the computer screen? I saw the optometrist 5 months ago (never worn glasses before) and did the eye test and he said I had a very slight astigmatism. Vision seemed fine so I didn't get the glasses. Now 5 months later i've started feeling super weird, lightheaded and a bit dizzy when looking at my computer screen and I can't work out if it's my eyes or something else because I recently swapped monitors. I upgraded to a 27&quot; 144hz and it wasn't long after that the symptoms started happening. I then found out that monitor used Pulse Width Modulation which could have been causing it so I sold it and bought a flicker free one but it didn't help. Could it be something to do with the higher refresh rate, the larger screen size or something with the monitor itself or is it more than likely my eyes getting worse? Going back to the optometrist soon but thought i'd see if anyone else experienced this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is that how they make glasses for infants and other really young kids? I see all these videos along the lines of “baby sees mother clearly for the first time”, and I’ve always wondered how they were able to get glasses for a kid that young because I knew there was no way they were getting input from the kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I just learned about these our last visit.  </p>
<p>We had always gone to Walmart for glasses, but hey, new life new me right? So I took my daughter to a fancy place since we found out it costs the same through our insurance.  </p>
<p>Holy shit was it a weird experience.  First off, it was automated.  The nurse would take you into one room, and have you sit. They would do the air puff (ugh i hate that one), then the refractometer, then a camera.  The nurse literally hit one button and everything auto adjusted, gave warnings in a cold mechanical voice, everything.  </p>
<p>Then you go into the exam room, with the normal big swinging chair and chart you expect.  Nurse goes &quot;the doctor will be right with you&quot;.  Closes the door. And the machine moved on it's own. like... holy shit. The arm swung close, I hear a voice... &quot;Hey, up here in the corner&quot; - The doctor wasn't actually there.  She was working remotely. Had me adjust the rig to a comfortable spot and all the normal &quot;which looks better, 1 or 2&quot; crud, and was done within 5 minutes.  asked to go sit back in the waiting room. 10 minutes later a nurse strolls up with a packet with the prescriptions and recommendations (no more contacts for me... eyes finally got bad enough I can't wear em).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old ones are like that</p>
<p>Modern ones can measure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront" target="_blank">wavefront</a> of light passing through the eye, e.g. with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shack–Hartmann_wavefront_sensor" target="_blank">Shack–Hartmann sensor</a>. Then it does not need to try different lenses, but measures the phase changes of the light wave at like 1000 points of the eye. Then it can calculate how strong the lenses need to be to correct those phase changes</p>
<p>This can even go beyond classical lenses and prescriptions. Normal glasses have like two shapes, spherical or cylindrical. But you can make lenses in any shape. So they use the 1000 phase measurement to describe the thickness of the glass at 1000 points</p></div>		</li>

When I was a kid, you'd sit there for hours while the optometrist rotated between lenses and asked if things looked better or worse, eventually determining your prescription when you couldn't tell the difference between options any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 1999-2000 I was stationed in South Korea as a US soldier.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>While there the army told us not to go to the Korean doctors for anything as the army would take care of it.  Well, I wanted contacts and glasses that didn't look like dog shit so the army docs where out.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I went downtown to see a Korean Optometrist and it was the greatest experience ever.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First of all, the man didn't speak English and I didn't speak Hangeul but none of that was necessary.  He motioned for me to sit in a chair next to a machine like described in this article.  He put it up to my face and did something until a road with a sign showed up very clearly for me.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With that done he quickly wrote down my prescription and managed to tell me in broken english to come back tomorrow.  I did and got two pairs of glasses and 6 months worth of contacts for 80 dollars, plus, the exam was free, I think, and took all of two minutes.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I kind of miss Korea sometimes, lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was maybe 6 years or so ago I went for my first eye exam in years. My wife needed to be evaluated for glasses, and we had the insurance, so may as well right?</p>
<p>Its the first time I encountered one. The eye doctor who has been checking my mother since probably the 60s, checked me out with his machine and said &quot;You don't have perfect vision, but I can only tell because this machine is so sensitive&quot;.</p>
<p>He then started gushing about his setup like a kid at Christmas time who just got the toy he always wanted. He apparently even got the vendor to customize it for him so he could throw the display up on a big screen TV to show off to patients.</p></div>		</li>
