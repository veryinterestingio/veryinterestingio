<p>On a car, going from straight to full left means less than one turn of the wheel</p>

<p>I drive Mercedes Atego trucks and 27 ton airport pushback vehicles and forklifts and my car and some friend’s sport car. I don’t want to measure it but I can tell there is a massive difference between what you want from a heavy vehicle wheel than what you want from a car wheel. Ok, there is a difference between Honda Integra type S and a Panda, but still, you don’t need to turn the wheel that far that often on cars.</p></div>		</li>
