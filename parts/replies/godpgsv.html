			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but given a concern at a particular point on the parachute, it may be more challenging to localize without the asymmetric pattern; especially if the chute isn't oriented orthogonal to the camera axis in a particular frame; and/or if it is not completely unfolded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, was there a way to get video back to Earth in a failure situation?  I know there were lots of cameras on the lander, and telemetry was sent to MRO, but if it craters, was video sent back to something like the MRO before it hit the planet and ended up 10 feet below the surface?</p>
<p>I have to admit, the video is quite interesting considering it's on another freakin' planet and made it back here just days later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take what i'm about to say with a grain of salt: i dont follow this stuff super closely and i'm definitely no expert, so experts please do correct me</p>
<p>The reason it takes so long to get the data to earth is because of the way they teansmit and encode the data from the orbiter to earth. They have to account for data integrity, signal strength, interference from universal background noise, and a bunch of other stuff too</p>
<p>But between the orbiter and the rover they can use more traditional transmissions, and so get more data up to the orbiter faster. The orbiter has a decent amount of storage space for the data from the rover, so it can recieve and store as much data as the rover transmits before impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The UHF uplinks to MRO and MAVEN should have sufficient bandwidth to relay low quality video and picture feeds alongside telemetry in real time from where they can be transmitted to the DSN for further analysis in case of critical failure, even if relaying HQ material is only an option during scheduled data dumps. Probably another reason why you want clear visual patterns on mission critical equipment monitored by cameras.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are tools in engineering used to try and come up with things like this.  I don't know what NASA uses, but it is likely some more grand version of FMEA or failure modes and effect analysis. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Basically, you go through how something is supposed to work, like every little thing, every event that happens when everything is working as planned.  One step you may actually want to happen in this case may be, &quot;confirm all parachute lines are taut.&quot;  Sounds simple right? but the next step in the engineering tool is likely going through the failure modes of that process of confirming the lines are taught.  What is the first way to think this process can fail? probably camera failing, and they would then determine how important it is to see with a camera, maybe they decide on a second camera, etc.  Then they think of another way this process will fail... second might be &quot;if we notice one line is not taught, we don't have a way to identify it to each other clearly and concisely.  A couple risk management steps later, and the way to reduce the risk of this failure is to put a pattern on the chute to be able to identify to others which line is not taut.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you sometimes wonder what can differentiate company A being known for quality and company B not so much, it may because one company chooses to do these or is really good at them, and others do not or are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can see their methodology in how they program the space shuttle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff" target="_blank">https://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff</a> Goes over the process they do, but suffice to say it's extensive research and planning before any code is actually written.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing in the specs is changed without agreement and understanding from both sides. And no coder changes a single line of code without specs carefully outlining the change. Take the upgrade of the software to permit the shuttle to navigate with Global Positioning Satellites, a change that involves just 1.5% of the program, or 6,366 lines of code. The specs for that one change run 2,500 pages, a volume thicker than a phone book. The specs for the current program fill 30 volumes and run 40,000 pages.</p>
