			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really true.  While the primary function is to lubricate, we definitely take advantage in the design for the thermal transport due to oil recirculation. Without that, the top end criteria for continuous high load operation wouldn't be met.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are true.</p>
<p>Take the Cummins 855 series engines. The lower power NHC-250 is subtly different than the other engines in the series that it doesnâ€™t have oil squirt nozzles under each piston. This can radically effect piston temperature under high power. Most everything else in the engine series is fuel supply and turbo... and the other models go to 150HP more.</p></div>		</li>
