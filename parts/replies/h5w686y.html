			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re asking at the population level: you still run into the problem of not enough people having been infected who developed immunity such that the pandemic has ended on its own. And it’s not just about time either: trying to achieve herd immunity by just getting enough people sick would kill a whole bunch of people in the process who would not die if we instead achieved community immunity by vaccination, and more infections leads to more chances for the virus to mutate and immune-evading strains to emerge. </p>
<p>If you’re asking at the individual level: some recent papers suggest that giving convalescent patients at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine may increase their protection from some of the variants.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural killer cells will attack cells coated with antibodies, so the antibodies are important for the proper function of the NK cells. Without the antibodies, NK cells don't know which cells are infected, and don't help much with a viral infection.<br />
But severely ill covid patients have been found to have fewer NK cells, compared to patients who quickly recover, so they must play a fairly important role.  </p>
<p>T cells are similar, they kill infected cells, but they are targeted to a specific virus, and the vaccine stimulates them and teaches them to recognize covid.</p></div>		</li>
