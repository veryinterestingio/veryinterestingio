			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is extremely simplified and not really true. There are many other factors like animal size, whether it is nocturnal, or simply the history of their evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The history of their evolution probably matters less than animal size.  Cats are a great example because all cats are similar in hunting habits yet differ in eyes.  So there’s a kind of soft control already in place.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tigers, Lions, Leopards, Jaguars, and Cougars have circular pupils.</p>
</li>
<li>House cats have vertical slit pupils.</li>
</ul>
<p>But some interesting things worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bobcats who’s size is between those 2 groups have a pupil that’s a shape between the two kinds:  a kind of shorter rounder slit.</p>
</li>
<li>Cougars are more closely related to house cats than lions/tigers/leopards/jaguars. Cougars aren’t even in the <em>panthera</em> taxon.  Yet their eyes are still identical to the big panthera species.  The history of their evolution doesn’t seem to matter as much as size.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will say that some birds of prey get around distance limitations by having two foveas. So a hawk will turn its head slightly to access distant vision but look straight on to see closeup movement. This is true of hawks, hummingbirds, and swallows. </p>
