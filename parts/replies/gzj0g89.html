			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain cells start dying after ~3 minutes, organ cells (liver, kidneys) ~20 minutes, muscles (arms, legs) ~3 hours. Since brain cells die first and everything we are is in the brain then person also dies after 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>Even if you start the heart after 10 minutes the brain is dead and all you have is human body but person and their brain are gone.</p>
<p>All cells need oxygen (except for cancer cells, they just need sugars).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think you’re right about cancer cells needing just sugars, they do sometimes get starved of oxygen and develop ways to survive with less oxygen, but they generally make new blood vessels by hijacking other systems to create new blood vessels to bring oxygen in. </p>
<p>Interesting other facts though, thanks for sharing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction there is also part of you in your spine not only the brain so not only the brain is you.</p>
<p>This is one of many reasons why we don't do brain transplants. (Another would be ethical reason but there is a long list why we don't do it.)</p></div>		</li>
