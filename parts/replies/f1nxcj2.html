			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. I think of the biggest problems right now is that I -as a layman- am supposed to know that global warming is true 100% without any question about results or methodology, even though I'm not qualified to make a scientific claim. Otherwise I'm accused of ignorance or having a political agenda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess that maybe 1 in 4 members of the public actually understands global warming.</p>
<p>Most people know what global warming IS, and can give you a vague answer about it (greenhouse gases emitted by humans are causing the world to get warmer) but I'd wager a lot of them don't even know why greenhouse gases work.</p>
<p>The thing is, knowing that global warming is real is actually fairly trivial once you understand the physics of it.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is much more opaque to infrared radiation than nitrogen is. This can be rather trivially demonstrated by shining an IR laser into an environment full of CO2 and another full of N2 and seeing how much it is absorbed in each environment.</p>
<p>As such, if you increase the amount of CO2 in the atmopshere, more infrared light is absorbed by it. And whatever is absorbed is thus not radiating off into space, and thus, keeps that energy in the Earth's vicinity.</p>
<p>So why is the Earth giving off infrared radiation? Well, all objects emit radiation based on their temperature - this is known as black body radiation. The hotter something is, the more energy it radiates off in the form of electromagnetic radiation. For most things, this is in the infrared spectrum, but for very hot things, you get into visible light - this is why fires and the sun create light, they're hot enough that they emit light into the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>Because the earth cools off primarily via radiation of energy into space, increasing the amount of energy trapped by the atmosphere increases the temperature of the earth. The hotter the earth gets, the more black body radiation it emits, so when you add more insulation in the form of more carbon dioxide, the Earth will heat up until it reaches equilibrium again, which is the point at which the amount of heat escaping into space equals the amount of heat being generated by the Earth via radioactive decay plus the amount of heat energy that the Sun is putting onto the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>So obviously, global warming is real. And because we can monitor the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, we know that the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is changing, and we know that humans are driving that because the composition of the extra carbon reflects the fossil fuels we're burning (plus there's no other really plausible source of it).</p>
<p>Actually calculating <em>by how much</em> the Earth warms due to this, however, is a nightmare. The reason for this is that there's a huge number of feedback loops involved - for instance, water vapor is actually a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 is, but it leaves the atmosphere very rapidly, meaning that it doesn't accumulate for a long time. Higher temperatures increases water evaporation, so increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which increases the amount of heat trapped.</p>
<p>But wait! Water vapor can form clouds in the atmosphere, and clouds are very lightly colored. Lightly colored objects are lightly colored because they reflect most light that hits them rather than absorb it. As such, having more clouds makes it so that more energy hits them and then is reflected off back into space, and decreases the amount of energy that the Earth is taking in.</p>
<p>Add in about twenty other things, and you've got a climate model.</p>
<p>Increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will almost certainly cause the Earth to warm, but the amount by which it will warm is very difficult to determine, which is why most estimates of future temperatures are ranges and have various assumptions built into them. Using the wrong model can cause you to overshoot or undershoot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting reply.</p>
<p>Regarding the Noami Oreskes part, you mention that she only analysed 928 papers.</p>
<p>I was speaking with someone earlier and they brought her study up, claiming that she ignored circa 2,000 papers.  Is that number connected to the 3,000 surveys at all?</p>
<p>If not, why only 928 papers?  Roughly, how many should it have been?  Why were they discarded?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No connection.  The ~3000 number is the number of people who completed the survey, from the ~10,000 who were invited.  The 77 are those who answered the first question in the affirmative, and the 75 are those who also answered the second question in the affirmative.  I have not heard anything about Oreskes ignoring papers, but 928 papers does seem like a small number.  It is possible that may have been part of the motivation for the Cook study.  Cook and Oreskes are known to each other.</p>
<p>BTW I did supply links to both papers.</p></div>		</li>
