<p>I’m going to buy a better mic than the $10 one I have now.</p>
<p>I’m just recording speech and I’ll use a mic when video conferencing should I skip this filter or should I get it because it’s cheap enough to just purchase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I record YouTube videos indoors using a Rode VideoMicro (a cheapish but not terrible mic).  I once was listening to what I thought was a good take, and a loud POP from a word with a letter p made me rip off my headphones.  I now <em>always</em> put the deadcat that came with the mic on it (and probably should just get a cheap pop filter).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t worry about it for live videoconferencing. Anything recorded, and especially things that will get a lot of traffic should be recorded well, including a pop filter and possibly some post processing. Also, keep in mind how end users are going to be listening. Earbuds, cheap corporate Bluetooth headsets, laptop speakers are all shit and will hide imperfections. Any decent pair of headphones will quickly highlight crap recordings.</p></div>		</li>
