			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great read, what they talk about with the transferring of hot and cold water and the intense wind currents is exactly the type of thing I was looking for. I must've overlooked this one when I was googling. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be slightly more interesting is a planet that's <em>almost</em> tidal locked. The weather and heating effects will still occur, and there may be habitability around the terminator line, but since it's still rotating <em>a little,</em> that habitable zone will move every year. The population has to be mobile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, one possibility I’m starting to really like is a planet that had been tidally locked for centuries, but it gets hit by a meteor and then begins to slowly spin, and thus darkness is slowly starting to cover the world that they’ve built, and now they have to figure out how to uproot their society and stay one step ahead of the looming darkness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually have considered this as well, and also a planet that tilts drastically during its orbit so that the dramatic changes from summer to winter cause humans and their societies to be migratory. There’s certainly a wealth of possibilities to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury is like this... It rotates 3 times for every two times around the sun.  Obviously it's not in the habitable zone but still pretty cool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t the weather be extremely volatile on tidally locked worlds. Especially with the presence of liquid water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No we do not &quot;know&quot; that tidally locked planets exist...we have a strong theory and some partial evidence but we do not &quot;know&quot;.</p>
<p>Googling confirms only that they really probably actually might exist.</p></div>		</li>
