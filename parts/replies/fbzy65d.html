			<div class="markdown"><p>I am actually a chemical salesman that sells specialty chemicals to paper mills. To add on to what he said about looking at the fibers in the paper I can explain a bit about why that is. A (very) simplified look at the process in an integrated paper mill.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mill gets logs in on a truck/rail. They strip the bark off in a debarker and chip the logs in a uniform manner at an angle to maximize surface area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chips are loaded into a 'digester' where they cook for 2 hours around 300 degrees F with steam and &quot;black liquor&quot;. The black liquor is a mixture of water and lignin from the wood which is what gives it its dark color. The liquor is highly caustic and penetrates into the wood chips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After cooking the chips go through a blowtank by opening the highly pressurized digester to atmospheric pressure so the wood chips are violently 'blown' apart into tiny individual fibers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fibers go through a series of countercurrent washers to rinse out the lignin and lighten the color of the pulp. The washed out lignin goes through a recovery cycle to recover the spent chemicals (soda and caustic) and is also evaporated to a high enough consistency that it can then be exploded to create steam to spin turbines and create power for the mill. Water is added to the reclaimed chemical to create more liquor which is what is sent into the digesters to cook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) if you're making white paper, a bleach plant that uses (most often) chlorine dioxide is used to bring the light brown pulp to a nearly pure white.</p>
</li>
<li>To the paper machines! The pulp is thinned down with water to about a 1% consistency (100 lbs of stock will have 99 lbs of water and 1 lb of wood fiber) this thin pulp is sent to the headbox where it is distributed onto a wire probably around 30 feet wide going about 4000 feet/min. The wire has very small holes so the water drains through and the fibers remain. This is then goes through a press section and dryer section to squeeze and evaporate out any leftover water, coated if it needs to be for whatever paper is being made (think of glossy calendars or magazines), cut, and put into rolls.</li>
</ol>
<p>So steps 3 and 6 are why the paper is just very small fibers oreiented in random ways. The length of fibers, orientation, amount of cross linking, etc. all contribute to how strong the paper is whether that means how much tension it takes to tear it or for packaging grades how much weight to crush it or whatever test they aim for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this! I've been working in paper mills for ten years.</p>
<p>Yes, paper made on modern paper machines has a grain. The individual fibers are extremely thin, but up to a millimeter or two long (sometimes longer) depending on the species of tree.</p>
<p>Most paper machines apply a highly dilute pulp - less than one percent dry solids by weight - to a moving screen where 90% or more of the water is removed in a few seconds. The flow is turbulent, and there are all sorts of little tricks paper mills will use to achieve an even and random disbursement of fibers, but they will generally align to the direction of flow. When doing quality control tests, the sheet is often specified if being tested in the machine direction (MD) along the fibers, or the cross direction (CD) across the fibers.</p>
<p>This is why paper always tears easily and cleanly in one direction, but 90° to that will tear messily and unevenly. If you think of each paper fiber as half of a tiny zipper, tearing in the MD is like undoing a bunch of zippers at once - but tearing in the CD is like trying to rip each zipper in half. You're more likely to pull out a whole zipper on one side or the other than to rip the individual ones.</p>
<p>This also makes paper more resistant to pulling forces in the MD than in the CD. CD it's like you're pulling open a zipper from the side, but in the MD, it takes a lot of force to make all those zippers slide past each other until they all fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in quality for a graphic paper company on the claims side. I don't get why customers think that paper will print the same after it has been cut and turned perpendicular to the MD. Of course that is going to curl, turns out it would have been cheaper to buy the correct paper in the first place after all!</p></div>		</li>
