			<div class="markdown"><p>Man. Few years ago I saw a guy sitting on a bus stop bench just puking all over the place. He stops, picks up a big ass bottle of Listerine and takes a big old chug. Poor fucking guy was pounding that shit to get drunk, but kept throwing up. It was one of the more fucked up sad things I’ve seen. I tried asking him if he needed some help, but he was too incoherent to talk to me. Light turned green and I had to go. Called a local service that handles picking up intoxicated people, giving them a place to sober up, and then try to get them help if they need it. Hope that guy got some help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that isopropanol supplies were depleted pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic, and ethanol was readily available/faster to produce to fill the gap. I don't know if isopropanol stocks have returned - I haven't checked since May or June since ethanol-based products are everywhere now - but back then a bottle of rubbing alcohol was impossible to find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a lot of hand santizers use isopropyl alcohol. However I was answering in the context of a question &quot;when disileries switched to producting hand sanitizer&quot;. When they switched they did not switch to producing isopropyl, they still produced ethanol, just resulting product had higher proportion of ethanol to water (if previously they produced vodka for example).</p>
<p>That's one of a reasons ethanol based hand sanitizers are so much more popular now then isopropyl based ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle, yes, but in practice, if you are distilling ethanol from a naturally fermented source, there will be different fractions with different impurities. If you hit 85% ethanol on your first try, you can throw in some water and additives to make a hand sanitizer and call it a day. If you take that same stuff, water it down and call it vodka, it will be disgusting, you will get a lot of bad reviews, and some people will get more sick than the usually do from regular vodka.</p>
<p>Even more to the point, ethanol works, but so does isopropyl (even methanol if you are careful -- <del>be careful</del> edit: okay fine, don't even consider using it) but you don't want to drink isopropyl or methanol.</p>
<p>In other words, the alcohol people want to drink 10-100 ml of watered down is of a very different quality than the alcohol people rub on their skin 1-5 ml at a time to kill stuff -- in other words still, it is a lot easier to find poison you can be relatively safe touching in small quantities than it is to find poison you can drink and enjoy in larger quantities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To eli5  your comment: </p>
<p>When you add yeast which is a tiny creature to something with sugar in it, it eats the sugar and pees alcohol and farts carbon dioxide. To separate the alcohol you boil it in a pot. There are lots of different types of alcohol, they boil off at different temperatures. The first one to boil off is methanol, the last are the amyl-alcohols (then water). Some of these alcohols have bad flavors and smells, they will make you sick if you drink them, and are not desirable. The one that doesn't smell or taste like anything (ethanol) is the one that becomes vodka, the rest gets redistilled (as there is still lots of ethanol) or reused (as hand sanitizer, fuel, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There shouldn't be a lot of methanol if treat your yeasties right.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think they actually use the bad fractions (the different mixes of alcohol that come of at different stages as you describe -- which are not as perfectly separated as one might imagine from your description) as hand sanitizer..., but if someone ran a distillery during a run on hand sanitizer, it seems like a very reasonable thing to do.</p></div>		</li>
