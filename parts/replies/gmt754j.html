			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a people-o-logist, but I feel its the manifestation of grooming behaviour. All monkeys seem to spend quality time cleaning each other's fur, and the feeling I get after petting a dog is largely similar to the feeling I get while running my fingers through my SO's hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my companions always been top priority.  i'm not into petting, licking, blah.  i am into connecting but not on those levels - i can't cope with an animal on me.  i couldn't survive without a companion animal - i don't want soft cute n fuzzy.  i need a buddy - always have a buddy. they have traits i do not have - they are helpful and respect one another always.</p></div>		</li>
