			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak to the taste but I absolutely get a not subtle reminder of what I ate earlier or the day before. </p>
<p>Actually, I have tasted it!</p>
<p>When my older sister came back from college she introduced the family to roasted garlic. It was a hit! I mean everyone in the family ate a head of garlic or more the night we had our first taste. Fast forward to the next morning and I'm tasked with waking up my brother for breakfast. I open the door to his room and am hit with this incredible aroma that is so strong I can taste it. Roasted garlic! Is he making some in his room somehow? It's literally making me hungry until the horrible realization that this odor that I can quite literally taste on the tip of my tongue is the farts he'd been marinating in all night. I HAD LICKED MY LIPS in hunger for my disgusting brother's roasted garlic flatulence.</p></div>		</li>
