			<div class="markdown"><p>Small claims court doesn't eliminate the advantage, it just changes the dynamic. It is always more beneficial to have a lawyer in any legal situation. Hell, even in traffic court a lawyer will almost always get a more favorable outcome, but is spending $500 to save $40 worth it? For you, maybe not, for google it absolutely is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m surprised there aren’t a few retired lawyers looking for a hobby that will take on such a case.  Still not the same as having near endless funds but also not the same as someone clueless taking on the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure I'm too late to the game to expect an answer, and in all honesty this may very well be a genuinely dumb question, but I don't know anything at all about anything involving the legal system.</p>
<p>With that said - could this be managed in the same way that the legal battles that they run those cheap TV advertisements for? The whole &quot;if you have been affected by blah blah blah&quot; shit? Because, as far as I know (which, like I said, isn't much), the way those work is finding a LOT of people to contribute enough to take on a larger corporation.</p>
<p>This is the third time I've said it, but I want to stress how ready I am to be wrong about this, but nonetheless, could the same not be done by all of these YouTubers that are having these issues? I'm not involved deep enough in any aspect of this to <em>really</em> know what I'm talking about, but it seems to me like a good handful of legitimate YouTubers are feeling the need to post videos talking about this shit happening to them, and some of those even talk about other channels that it has happened to in addition to their own. I don't see why this would be such a widespread issue if it weren't literally that - some bullshit that everyone is dealing with, but no one can actually do anything about.</p>
<p>I say all that to ask whether or not it is a real option for these YouTubers to team up in one legal battle against Google (or Alphabet or just Youtube or whoever the fuck it would be). If the main issue is just that the company in question has more resources to throw at it than the YouTubers, would it be possible for them to collectively sue without being worse-off, financially, just to go through with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important thing about class action lawsuits is that, at the end of the day, it's simply an opportunity for the lawyers to make money. The lawsuit may end up getting millions in compensation from the corporation, but a sizeable chunk goes to the lawyers for fees &amp; services rendered.</p>
<p>YouTube creators are a very very thin slice of the population, with a lot fewer that have a case, and are willing to use the time to back a class action lawsuit. Combine that with how deep Google's pockets are, and whether this case has precedence (I.e. how easy it would be to sue), it's quite likely that nobody felt like there's an opportunity to make a bunch of money, if any at all.</p></div>		</li>
