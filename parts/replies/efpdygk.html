			<div class="markdown"><p>The soot is supposed to come from the burning cities, not the bomb itself.</p>
<p>The bomb just triggers the firestorm and at most the heat contributes to the soot getting into the upper atmosphere (as in volcanic eruptions).
It isn't the effects of the bomb itself that are thought to cause the issue. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Fire experts suggest that unlike Hiroshima, due to the nature of modern U.S. city design and construction, a firestorm in modern times is unlikely after a nuclear detonation. This does not exclude fires from being started, but means that these fires will not form into a firestorm, due largely to the differences between modern building materials and those used in World War II era Hiroshima.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The soot thing would need to put more pollutants in the jet stream than volcanoes and burning oil fields have over the past century. The might have a computer model showing that's the case, but what sort of assumptions went into making the model? How accurate is the model?</p></div>		</li>
