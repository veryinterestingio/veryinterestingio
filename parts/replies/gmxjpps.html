<p>Most of the vaccines we've been getting in the US are spike protein mRNA only.  The reactions could be to the preparations - the oily mixtures that help that mRNA reach the target cells, or it could be from the mRNA itself, or the spike protein encoded by the mRNA.  The length of time between vaccination and reaction - typically 24-48hrs suggests it's either the oil suspension or the spike protein.  The &quot;Covid arm&quot; thing a week later is probably a type III hypersensitivity reaction, but to what?  Easy to speculate on, hard to know at this stage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moderna seems to more commonly have &quot;covid arm&quot; symptoms (10% I think I read?). That seems to imply it's the suspension makeup, not the mRNA/protein itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, though it's impossible to say conclusively at this moment. Some of the damage caused by covid 19 is caused by the immune system itself, so people who are at risk of this kind of damage could also be the people who might have very strong reactions to the vaccine. However, this isn't the case for most of the people who are at high risk from covid 19 - the sick, the elderly, smokers, and those with otherwise weakened immune or respiratory systems.</p></div>		</li>
