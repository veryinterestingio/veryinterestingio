			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you know those white zigzag lines that you see on big webs?  Those make the web's easier to see, bad for catching bugs.  But other animals see them too and steer clear.  So the spider has to abandon ship and rebuild the web less often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to walk through a gap in a hedge. During summer, every year, a spiders web appears. It starts at about waist level, then after I've walked through it the next time it is a bit higher until one day the web is above my head and remains in that same place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk if understand is the word I'd use, but webs placed out of the way of larger animals and such tend to last longer. Spiders can also definitely sense vibrations from us walking around, and naturally try to avoid us to begin with. So  I would imagine it's no coincidence that most spiders place webs more out of the way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a spider right outside my door. Biggest spider I've ever seen (Canada doesn't have very large spiders). She makes a web every single night, and it's gone by morning. Watching her work is one of the most fascinating things I've seen in years. I once threw a piece of grass into her web to see how she'd react. She came to examine it, then after a few minutes of holding it, trying to figure out what it was, she untangled it from her web and let it fall to the ground.</p>
<p>The dexterity of her legs was mesmerising. She also clearly has favourite foods - she has a tendency to eat some bugs almost right away, and will straight up let others go. She completely ignores mosquitoes, but will pounce on flies and immediately wrap them up.</p></div>		</li>
