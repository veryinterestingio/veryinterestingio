			<div class="markdown"><p>One suggestion is that these structures are signatures of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_reconnection" target="_blank">magnetic reconnection</a> events in the Sun's atmosphere. -Marc Pulupa</p>
<p>WISPR may have actually seen such a reconnection (Figure 4 of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1807-x" target="_blank">the Nature paper</a>). WISPR doesn’t see magnetic fields - only the scattering from electrons. -Russ Howard</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do NASA scientists like you guys/gals really enjoy seeing those new pictures of stars and planets and space, for instance, the same way that a wildlife photographer or nature photographer enjoys seeing nature on earth? Is it that same relaxing, curious, calming feeling that what you're doing is making a difference because-look-how beautiful-the-universe is sort of thing? Do NASA scientists get super excited about new footage or pictures that might point to more mysteries of the universe or even just our galaxy?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hope it's not a silly question. It's the one thing I'd ask a NASA scientist if I could meet one, but I don't work in that field and the chances are slim of that ever occurring naturally to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person, these pictures are fascinating! As a scientist, you don't really get excited about the pictures, so much as you get attracted to the intrigue of the details, and the problems that need to be solved. - Nour Raouafi</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely true.  There are two aspects - one is that you are taking a picture of something from a brand new position - one that has never been seen.  But also when we opened our door and took a picture for the first time, we saw the milky way.  That was absolutely beautiful - our camera was working!  What a relief and what a beautiful image. -Russ Howard  </p>
<p>I absolutely enjoy and still am in awe when I see the Sun.  We have a video wall that displays the images from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory over a huge screen and I sometimes take a minute or two at work just to sit and look at the dynamic Sun and appreciate how wonderful it is!  I have worked on telescopes as well as particle detectors and all the data is exciting and we need both viewpoints in order to get the full picture of what is going on.  --Kelly Korreck</p></div>		</li>
