			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:
Beyond pH 0 and 14, even strong acids/bases tend to not completely dissociate anymore. Take concentrated hydrochloric acid for example: it's 37% HCl in Water. Much more then 1mol/L. But because of that, it's not completely dissociated.</p>
<p>pH can also be very different in organic solvents, but here measuring it with traditional methods doesn't always work anymore. Often it's just theoretical and comparative measurements.</p>
<p>All that said, the strongest (non hypothetical) acid known to man is CH5+ (which is just Methane bombarded with protons) which has a pH of around -50.
The strongest bases on the other hand are substances like n-Buthyllithium or t-BuLi which have a pka of around 40 if I'm not misremembering.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure. I don't see the contradiction. In the pedagogy-related &quot;<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed083p1465" target="_blank">Negative pH does exist</a>,&quot; Lim suggests showing the scale with limits of -1 and 15 to reflect these tendencies while avoiding the implication of hard limits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this is just a coincidence. There is no reason it becomes high at 0. If someone historically would have chosen 1, we would use that. There is no actual reason it’s exactly 0.</p>
<p>Edit: if you forget the word “no”, a sentence will get a totally different meaning, surprisingly!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That constant has units of (mol/L)^(2); the fact that it contains an exponent near -14 around room temperature is a complete coincidence arising from how we define the mole and the liter. &quot;Artefact&quot; is being used here to describe a number whose convenience depends on using a certain set of units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the sort of answer I was looking for. I assumed that there was some aesthetic choice involved. I guess it's similar to how 0 to 100C is based on water. I was too specific in my choice of language.</p>
<p>Could you elaborate on this in an ELI5/ELIUndergrad way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think there was an aesthetic choice. It’s just based on the units of concentration.</p>
<p>The pH of 7 being neutral stems from the fact that water is always in equilibrium with its dissociated products: a proton and a hydroxide. Each has an approximate concentration of 10^-7 M at room temperature for pure water.</p>
<p>So if your water has pH approximately 7 then it’s got a proton concentration of that of pure water at room temperature.</p>
<p>I hope that helps. Ask further questions here if needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bookends for the pH scale I learned were the pKa of H3O+ (-1.7) and OH- (15.7), since classically, any solution with a pH below -1.7 or above 15.7 would have protonated/deprotonated half of the water molecules in solution, where you stop being able to think of it as an aqueous solution in a meaningful way.</p></div>		</li>
