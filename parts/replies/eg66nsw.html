			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans don't tend to dissolve and transform, it's a relatively slow and incremental process. AFAIK it takes many years for neurons to die and be replaced. This larva example seems like Theseus had to rebuild a ship from steel after it was melted down  (let's imagine it was steel). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to google what a <em>Theseus ship</em> is. As a cyclist, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it's (just) a bicycle analogy. </p>
<p>Cyclists often say that the <em>soul</em> of a bicycle resides in the frame. Replace the frame, and you have a completely new bike. Theseus bicycle.</p></div>		</li>
