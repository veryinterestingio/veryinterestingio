			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, caving your own cheese isn't hard. </p>
<p>If you're going to do so, it really is best to just buy full wheels, since those will already have rinds. </p>
<p>If you want to do it for sane portions of cheese, like 1 pound each, then vacuum sealing them and then storing them in a fridge that's about 50 degrees F works well. You could also coat the cheese in cheese wax instead of a vacuum sealed bag, but wax is a lot messier to work with. </p>
<p>If you don't want to block out the oxygen, then you're just going to be growing your own mold cultures. Even the giant wheels of cheese usually have a lot of mold growing on them that has to be removed. <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/05/dining/05CHEESE_SPAN/05CHEESE-jumbo.jpg" target="_blank">https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/05/dining/05CHEESE_SPAN/05CHEESE-jumbo.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try putting opened cheese in a Ziploc bag (and squeeze all the air out). It makes a huge difference over leaving opened cheese exposed to the circulating air (and microbes) that live in your fridge.</p>
<p>Also, don’t mix cheeses together or cheese and other foods in the same container/bag</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that, for whatever reason, if you keep opened cheese wrapped in the packaging that it came with, even if you put it all in another container or baggie, it will keep a lot longer before going moldy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a taste for cheddar that has been in the back of the fridge for so long it has blue/green mold on it. So did my dad. (He didn’t have mold on him, he just liked moldy cheese).It’s quite yummy. Am I wrong to eat this gift from the cheese gods?</p></div>		</li>
