			<div class="markdown"><p>It's useful to also add to all this what the relationship is between the sense of &quot;timelike&quot; used here and the sense seen in terms of spacetime intervals: the spacetime intervals along that axis are timelike intervals, while the intervals along a spacelike axis are spacelike intervals. Since a timelike interval has ds\^2 &lt; 0 by definition (equiv. ds is imaginary), and a spacelike interval has ds\^2 &gt; 0 (equiv. ds is real), then the axes with negative signs in the metric are timelike axes, and those with positive signs are spacelike axes, because for a movement strictly along the axis, only that axis's differential elements will be nonzero, and hence they will produce spacetime intervals according to their own sign. (Note that we may alternatively give the metric in terms of dtau, in which case these sign correspondences are exactly reversed.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This set of coordinates has a coordinate singularity at r = 2M. There are other sets of coordinates which behave perfectly fine at the horizon, so this bad behavior is just an artifact of the choice of coordinates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What other sets of coordinates do you refer to? I'm not exactly sure I see how we could use the same Schwartzschild metric but different coordinates to avoid the discontinuity along the horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well then you’ve missed one of the major points of general relativity, coordinate invariance. There’s nothing special about a set of coordinates, they’re just labels for points in spacetime. You can choose to label the points in your spacetime however you want, and it should not affect any physics. As a corollary, coordinate singularities are not physical, they just reflect the fact that your set of coordinates fails to work at certain points.</p>
<p>But anyway, a specific example of a set of coordinates for a Schwarzschild black hole that works fine at the horizon is Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates.</p></div>		</li>
