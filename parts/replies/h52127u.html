<p>This is why the majority of serological tests for SARS are against N protein (strongest signal of prior infection) and why you should not get a serology test to see if your vaccination worked (the vaccines are against S, serology will not detect those antibodies).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's interesting</p>
<p>Edit: never mind, the most common tests target the N protein</p>
<p>So, follow up question, why do PCR tests target the S protein predominantly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, Im pretty sure the qPCR primers are against N protein but I could be wrong. Anyway -</p>
<p>Good question. This is outside my expertise so I cant tell you why the specific primers for SARS2 were chosen but I can tell you what considerations have to be made when designing primers.</p>
<p>All living things have a lot of relatives whose genomic sequence bears some resemblance. Since PCR is a genome based technique any test has to target a sequence that is unique to the organism (or virus if you dont count that as an organism). Primers for SARS2 had to be on a sequence that is distinct enough from other coronaviruses that you would not get a false positive. On the other hand, every virus will have strains and variants and you want to make sure that your primers are in an area that does not change for this virus in particular. </p>
<p>Its a fine balance to strike, you want a spot that is highly variable between viruses but stable within this virus. Probably doesnt leave you with many options since some genomic areas are hotspots. Aside from that there are some straightforward biochemical constraints in designing qPCR primers - CG content, amplicon length and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, makes sense. You're right, I thought it was the S protein but  it seems most target the N protein</p>
<p>It seems that are tests that target different genes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345211/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345211/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit outside my field, but I'm working on SARS-COV-2 testing (using the spike, not PCR) and have been to some interesting webinars and online events.</p>
<p>One was a guy from Thermo Fisher in the UK talking about the discovery of the alpha variant. Their PCR test detected three regions in the virus genome to avoid false positives or negatives, one being in the spike protein and the others in other areas. The change in the spike in alpha meant they started seeing only two matching out of three, which still meant a positive but was obviously a mutation in the spike protein. So they looked further and could report the alpha variant pretty early.</p>
<p>A PCR specialist can explain how this works exactly. But this was at least my understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the great explanation! I understand why creating a vaccine to target the spike protein is most effective, but why not make a combination vaccine that also targets the other proteins even if it's not as effective (but still somewhat helpful as you said). Is there any downside to targeting multiple proteins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As unindicted war criminal and current resident of hell Donald Rumsfeld would say, there are unknown unknowns. Biology is complicated, there are more variables than we can predict and when you are making a biological therapeutic you go for the simplest possible system that will get the job done, because you do not know how things will go when you introduce new complexity to the system. For instance, what if making a two-target mRNA vaccine results in one of those being dominant? And what if the wrong one became dominant?</p>
<p>In the case of this particular vaccine its hard to argue they did anything wrong. The flu vaccine often has efficacy of 40-80% and it is still very useful to limiting the spread of the flu. This one's upwards of 90%. If it aint broke...</p>
<p>On the other hand there may be other cases where multiple targets need to be hit for effective protection and making a mixed mRNA vaccine seems like a nice way to do it. Its a fine idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially related and I might be a bit late to the discussion but is there any causative effect related to the # of different types of antibodies your body is attempting to make for a single virus (ex: nucleocapsid, spike, membrane, envelope, etc) and your overall immunity for that singular virus? In other words, is vaccine immunity considered stronger because your immune was, to put it bluntly, &quot;hyper-focused&quot; on only leaning how to make spike protein antibodies?</p>
<p>I ask this because I keep trying to find a solid source for why vaccine immunity is preferable to natural (since when you're naturally infected with COVID your body is trying to make antibodies for all the different viral components) but none of the answers I've found go into very much depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the reason might be related to the side-effects of the vaccine. mRNA vaccines have pretty strong side-effects, and they increase with the dosage. For example, the low effectiveness of the curevac vaccine seems to be related to the low dose of mRNA they had to use, since they use different RNA than the other ones, and using more of it per vaccination would have resulted in unacceptably strong side-effects. So if you wanted to target different proteins, while keeping the immune response to the spike protein the same, you would have to use more mRNA overall and likely increase the side-effects even further. Given that they are already highly effective, that does not seem to be worth the trade-off.</p></div>		</li>
