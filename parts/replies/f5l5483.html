			<div class="markdown"><p>Does methane also &quot;linger&quot; around longer than CO2? I'm totally dumb on things, but I do know(?) that vegetation will consume at least some CO2, but is there something in the world that also uses / eliminates / converts methane as well?</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow TIL! Thanks for all the info Reddit folks!</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/16/greenhouse-gases-remain-air" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/16/greenhouse-gases-remain-air</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lifetime in the air of CO2, the most significant man-made greenhouse gas, is probably the most difficult to determine, because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Between 65% and 80% of CO2 released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 20–200 years. The rest is removed by slower processes that take up to several hundreds of thousands of years, including chemical weathering and rock formation. This means that once in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide can continue to affect climate for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Methane, by contrast, is mostly removed from the atmosphere by chemical reaction, persisting for about 12 years. Thus although methane is a potent greenhouse gas, its effect is relatively short-lived.</p>
<p>Nitrous oxide is destroyed in the stratosphere and removed from the atmosphere more slowly than methane, persisting for around 114 years.</p>
<p>Compounds containing chlorine and/or fluorine (CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs) include a huge number of different chemical species, each of which can last in the atmosphere for a specific length of time – from less than a year to many thousands of years. The IPCC has published a comprehensive list of the atmospheric lifetime of the various CFCs and other greenhouse gases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last thing about the chlorine is important and why top scientists view proper disposal of refrigeration units that use things like CFC is far more important then converting cars to electric. Based on project drawdown if we could properly remove CFCs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction (Plausible Scenario): 89.74 gigatons (GT) of reduced CO2-equivalent (CO2-e—the common measure for all greenhouse gases) by 2050.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Versus for converting most vehicles to electric would only remove about 10.80 gigatons from the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  </p>
<p>Our atmosphere is oxidizing - it has a lot of oxygen that can form free radical odd oxygen species (OH, O3, O(1D)).  Those radicals attack hydrocarbons like methane and &quot;combust&quot; them to CO2.  Methane is a very long-lived hydrocarbon with an atmospheric residence half-life of about 7 years.   </p>
<p>CO2 is fully oxidized.  It is removed from the atmosphere through interactions with the ocean and uptake into plants.  An average molecule of CO2 lasts ~300 years in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the answer is no, not yes, right?  As you and the article both say, CO2 lingers for much longer than CH4.  Or are you saying that CH4 is itself converted to CO2 so in a sense indirectly lingers longer in the new form?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a bit misleading. Methane is much more potent than CO2, but also lasts much shorter. IIRC about a decade, while CO2 can stay for centuries.</p>
<p>Which is bad because heat spikes can still cause damage, but it is temporary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lifetime of CO2 is already factored in: these equivalence calculations are always done with a particular time-horizon in mind.  /u/mmmmmmBacon12345 's number (34x CO2) is for a 100-year timeframe, which is the usual standard.  Methane is 86 times as potent as CO2 on a 20-year timeframe.</p>

<p>Fof example here in eastern europe we have pigs that eat garbage and chicken that are small. Both are much more environment-friendly in large numbers than cows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's more burps than farts.   cows digest grass by fermenting it in their multiple stomachs.   that produces methane.   i think there's a wide margin of estimates but it's like 50-100 gallons per day per cow.</p></div>		</li>
