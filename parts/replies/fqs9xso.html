			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting...my blood is Type A but mosquitos FEAST on me. It’s now a joke with my family and friends. I can be the only one in the group wearing light clothes + bug spray and still walk away with more bites than anyone else. </p>
<p>The article you shared also mentions that mosquitos prefer people who emit more carbon dioxide - usually from being overweight or pregnant. Another mystery because I don’t fit either of those descriptions. Maybe I just emit an abnormal amount to begin with...weird.</p>
<p>Can anyone else relate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mosquitoes land on people with Type O blood nearly twice as often as those with Type A. People with Type B blood fell somewhere in the middle of this itchy spectrum. Additionally, based on other genes, about 85 percent of people secrete a chemical signal through their skin that indicates which blood type they have, while 15 percent do not, and mosquitoes are also more attracted to secretors than nonsecretors regardless of which type they are. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an unscientific pet theory that rhesus factor repels mosquitoes. I have a friend with A+ blood, and a friend with A- blood, and the A- guy is always mosquito central. My father in law is also negative and he gets bit bad too. </p>
<p>Completely unscientific, I know, but interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stinky people get bit more. Wearing scents seems to keep them away. I can rub a scented dyer sheet on my skin and avoid being bitten. They do seem to find a place that I missed though. I once tested this by rubbing a few sheets over all my exposed skin and went out into mosquito central near my apartment. I was laughing because mosquitoes were all around and some of them would briefly touch me before flying off again. Then I saw my ankle. I missed that spot. There were about 8 mosquitoes in one small area.</p></div>		</li>
