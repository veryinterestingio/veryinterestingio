<p>However as Siamese twins are so connected it is often the case that whatever kills one of them also kills the other one within a short time.</p>

<p>I know this sounds horrible, but would that include if one of them was shot in the head? I know it's dark, but I always thought the reason they died within a short period of time would be because the dead half is just stagnant and rotting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not every day someone gets shot in the head. However as I said it depends on the specific case. It can be that the surviving twin will die from blood loss. It is possible that one of the organs it relied on were controlled by the other twin. It is also possible that the living twin will act as a heart lung machine and keep the dead twin alive but brain dead. But it might also be possible to separate them now that they do not have to worry about keeping them both alive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is incredibly interesting, and I never thought of that. This takes the issue to a whole other level. </p></div>		</li>
