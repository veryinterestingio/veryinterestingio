			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought &quot;2 phase&quot; was in every home (in the USA) for dryers and ovens . It's still just called single phase. They use 2 individual phases of 110vac  out of phase to generate 220.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although the term &quot;2 phase&quot; is common it's technically not correct.<br />
The transformer generates a single phase with 240V.  The voltage between the 2 ends of the transformer has 240V.<br />
But there's another connection in the middle of the transformer.
Each end of the transformer to this middle connection has 120V. And this is how your typical appliances are connected.<br />
.<br />
Combined with a 3 phase system it would look like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/High_leg_delta_transformer.svg" target="_blank">this</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is the 110v in normal outlets just the voltage between one of the phases and ground? Doesn't that mean the load on the two phases will be unequal? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the power in is a sine wave with peaks at plus/minus 120 volts, and you tap into one of those, aren’t you missing the other half of the cycle? like, each period is 1/60 seconds, right? so wouldn’t you only be tapping into half a period?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it was a tradeoff of complexity and material costs.   A long time ago someone made a costs-basis decision of how to best wire millions of homes that had no wiring.  They came up with center tapped (split phase) that was 30% less conductor material and 30% less complex (to wire the home) and ran with it then it became a standard.    These were the days before AC (air conditioning).  Had AC been a big thing when this was being wired up the decisions may have been different but once a standard is set it's hard to move away.</p>
<p>THree phase is generated and transported in the USA all the way to your transformer.   Look up at the top of telephone poles, the highest part usually, and you'll see three power lines.  One for each phase. Household transformers are fed with one of the phases.  The transformer converts that single phase into center tapped which supply homes.</p>
<p>In march we had a big storm roll through.  One third of my development was out of power.    That's because the phase those houses were on was the only line that was damaged.   Power companies always work to balance the load on each phase so you will see houses pretty well divided up 1/3  - 1/3  - 1/3 on each of the separate phases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I thought the same until recently 220V is just two 110V lines of the same phase.  The extra phases are only really brought in for high-load motors more than what a regular clothes dryer would need.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Home supply is called split phase or center tapped.   USA home supply usually has two hot legs at 120v 180\^ out of phase.    If you open a household load center (breaker box) you will see that there are two separate busses (where the breakers plug into).  The left and right side busses are 180 out of phase.  If you need 240 volts you put in a two pole breaker that sends both phases to the appliance.  SInce the phases are 120 volts at opposite phases the full potential is 240volts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two lines are exactly opposite phase. If they were the same phase there would be no voltage between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, two lines of different phase. In a two phase system they are 180 degrees out of phase and the voltage adds directly. In a three phase system they are 120 degrees out of phase and the math gets more complicated. 120V three phase produces 208 between lines. If the lines were of the same phase there would be no voltage between them and you have only increased current capacity, which is just bigger wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might offer some explanation as to why we use 3 phase power.</p>
<p>Essentially it boils down to the fact that more phases makes it more efficient to transmit power, however for each phase that is added it increases the infrastructure cost dramatically.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All US homes have what many people refer to as 2-phase power. The house transformer converts the single phase utility voltage (~7200V) to 240V. The neutral is taken off at the mid-point of the winding generating L1(think +120V) == Neutral (0V) == L2(think -120V). </p>
<p>L1 to Neutral is 120V single phase. L2 to Neutral is 120V single phase. L1 to L2 is 240 single phase (sometimes referred to as 2-phase).</p></div>		</li>
