			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol kind of. For most people, income and expenses are fairly predictable and so you know what brackets you’ll be in. For variable income or commission workers like myself, taxes can be a nightmare to figure out, so many people save and either pay quarterly estimates or one lump sum at the end of the year.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The government wants their money sooner than that, so if you underpay  you get penalized on top of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.</p>
<p>When you get a job you fill out a W-4.</p>
<p>The W-4 ask you questions and when filled out properly tells your employer how much to withhold in taxes.</p>
<p>If you answer accurately then you should be within a few dollars of what you owe per year in tax. When I filled my taxes for last year I have owed like $4.</p>
<p>Most people have their employer withhold more money so that when they file their taxes they get a big rebate check. They do this because they prefer having the government basically put money in a savings account for them to spend later.</p>
<p>Also, Every major life event that effects taxes like having a kid or getting married should be reported to the IRS by filling out a new W-4 but a lot of people forget that and when they file their taxes they get money back as the government didn’t know they had a kid.</p></div>		</li>
