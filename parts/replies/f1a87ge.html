			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere that one indicator they got of glitem being the problem
For celiacs was during WWI or WWII. Kids that were really sick before the war actually got better as bread supply ran out, and then when the war was over and bread supply returned they got sick again. </p>
<p>Thought it was pretty interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the third one, there is a good chance that a lot of the legitimate issues relating to gluten is the result of a microbiome (primarily bacteria and yeasts) that do well on a high grain/high sugar diet but have negative symptoms when present in humans as a dominant microbiome constituent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s kind of a weird cartoon, but it’s a great quick summary of what we know so far. Understanding the microbiome is going to be one of the next frontiers of health science equally important to individual genetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
<p>For millions of Years our ancestors have eaten things like fruit, nuts, seeds, roots, etc. Things with lots of fiber that therefore encourage a diverse microbiome. A lot of modern food will have refined sugar or carbs, but without the fiber to balance it. For example: white bread, which is starchy, but doesn't have as much fiber as whole grain wheat bread. Some people can find relief by cutting out things with wheat, or by reducing their carb intake, but Fiber is super important to keeping a healthy microbiome, and dietary fiber is generally only found in foods that have carbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure and well said. I would not remotely advocate cutting carbs, but rather just not getting all of your carbs from processed grains. Add some oatmeal in there and a good handful of raw fruits and vegetables. Definitely some beans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of your information is excellent, but the statistics you quote are actually correct for Celiac disease by itself, not all forms of gluten intolerance. Also, while it is possible to be allergic to wheat, Celiac disease in not an allergy but an autoimmune disease. There is still a lot of debate about non celiac gluten sensitivity, since there is no objective way to confirm it exists. Celiac disease is the most common genetic autoimmune disease worldwide, with some countries estimating rates as high as 1.5%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of &quot;non celiac&quot; gluten sensitivity is just undiagnosed IBS. For instance, I can eat gluten free oats, while regular ones gives me IBS symptoms, and I have been cleared of celiac disease</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder about this. I can say that I try and skip most gluten. Eating even a little, is VERY noticeable. I feel like dying if I eat too much, my stomach feels bloated, going to the washroom is painful, and so on.</p>
<p>Wheat in general seems to have all sorts of negative effects. I've had really good results cutting it as much as possible.</p>
<p>But.. It could be IBS too. How would I even tell?</p>
<p>I went to the doctor and told him I felt better when I didn't eat gluten, and he went &quot;Well, don't eat gluten then&quot;.</p>
<p>Which, I guess, works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very accurate. I’d like to add that I don’t have celiac but an autoimmune disease called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. My body attacks my thyroid causing hypothyroidism. There are many inflammatory triggers like, cheese, soy and gluten. When consistently eating any of these for prolonged period of time I start to notice many symptoms of hypothyroidism. Going from a gluten rich to a gluten free diet is night and day for me. I’ve tested negative for the antibodies associated with celiac disease. What I’m trying to say is that I can attest to the fact there are non-celiac gluten sensitivities, especially when it comes to thyroid problems. There is a well known endocrinologist, Dr. Westin Childs, that can go into more detail on his podcast about the biological explication on why this happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hashimoto's is awful, yay for autoimmune diseases right? I definitely feel you on the night and day difference going gluten free, I was sick for 10 years before I found out I had Celiac. I should have been more specific, what I meant to say is that non celiac gluten sensitivity on it's own, without other contributing factors, is still a topic of hot debate. There's as of yet no way to objectively prove it exists. I'm not in any way trying to belittle those who report having it, just saying that we don't understand what's behind it yet and it certainly confuses the issue. One theory I've heard is that it might actually be a FODMAP problem, since foods rich in gluten are often also rich in FODMAPs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, so why are you surprised OP didn't include statistics about it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you misunderstood. OP stated those numbers for &quot;some form of gluten intolerance&quot;, of which Celiac is only a part. I was pointing out that CD by itself accounts for those numbers, and so numbers for all gluten related issues would actually be higher.</p></div>		</li>
