			<div class="markdown"><p>Well given an average pair of lungs have give or take a hundred times the volume of the average mouth i think purely from an oxygen amount there's no competition given that the air you breathe in is 20% oxygen and what you breathe out is still around 15%. Also keep in mind that means youd have to make a hundred 'trips' to fill someones lungs one time (you obviously dont need a full lung to breathe but it does put things into perspective). All that effort will never be worth the 33% more 'oxygen' youd end up with in the end.</p></div>		</li>
