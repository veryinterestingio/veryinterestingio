			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, the sounds you'd typically associate with being outside are hampered by the presence of snow.</p>
<p>The sound of wind blowing is more likely to be leaves or other debris blowing around. That's all pinned to the ground by snow.</p>
<p>And birds/insects aren't going to be chirping as part of their mating rituals because it's too damn cold for that nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is extremely noticeable when you live fairly close to a major thoroughfare.  I'm in Alpharetta, GA, about 3/4 of a mile from GA-400 as the crow flies.  Even at 3 a.m. on a Sunday, you can hear some traffic, but when we've had substantial snow (it's actually ice, but I digress) for the area, it's eerily silent throughout the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the bird.</p>
<p>Some types of bird nest in pre-prepared nests or within tree cavities, or perhaps beneath man-made structures like bridges. Some of them seek out &quot;micro habitats&quot;, like evergreen trees or hedgerows where the internal temperature is going to be slightly higher due to protection from the wind and rain.</p>
<p>For the most part though the birds will simply hunker down in place on tree branches. Sometimes together, sometimes not, but certainly out of reach of predators. And then they just stay there to conserve energy until they can forage once more.</p>
<p>They're okay though. Bird legs have very little circulation going through them, so not much heat is lost. And correctly oiled and preened feathers are water-resistant and able to keep in a lot of heat when they sit still. So the rain and snow just falls off them and they stay toasty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trains also seem to be oddly quiet from directly in front. Long story, but at Times Square in New York, there's a gap in the tunnel wall between the shuttle platform and the 1/2/3 trains, so you can stand there and watch them pass by just feet away from you. I was standing there, not facing the train, and all of a sudden it was just <em>there</em>, and of course it was much louder once it was passing. It's weird how little I noticed the sound before the train passed though. </p></div>		</li>
