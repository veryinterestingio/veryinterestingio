			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s kind of like what we have going on with video games right now. Console makers want to sell their systems and want them on shelves for people to see. Physical games is where the profit is for retailers as they don’t make much on the systems. Console makers want to go digital to maximize profit and cut back on the secondhand market and could sell digital games for cheaper than physical games, but they don’t want to piss off retailers. A relationship that was built before digital games and selling consoles online directly to consumers was possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The manufacturer doesn't have to go build hundreds of showrooms all across the US, and doesn't have to keep thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of vehicles &quot;in stock&quot; all the time.  The manufacturer sells to the dealer and books the profit at the time the dealer takes the car, not when a consumer buys the car.</p></div>		</li>
