			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing which can be a big cause of water getting into abandoned places (at least in colder climates) are burst pipes. It’s why it’s good practice to leave the heating on minimum if you go on holiday and don’t have a house sitter.</p>
<p>Water in the pipe freezes, expands, bursts the pipe. As soon as the water pressure is enough to overcome the ice, boom, flood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't that the water pressure overcomes the ice so much as the ice melting.</p>
<p>Freezing pipes is actually a legit way to cut off the water to a house while doing maintenance. If the main cutoff valve to your house is malfunctioning, a plumber may freeze a section of pipe above the valve  before replacing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, I've done it myself while working on radiators and stuff. </p>
<p>When I said &quot;the water pressure overcomes it&quot;, I meant &quot;when the plug is melted enough that the water pressure can move it&quot;. When that happens, the plug moves and the water starts coming out of the pipe.</p></div>		</li>
