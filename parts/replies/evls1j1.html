			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't be as good as an actual steam oven though. Home ovens arent designed to hold humidity, so they dry out extremely fast. When you make a loaf of bread in a home oven you're significantly better off making the bread in something like a Dutch oven because it will trap moisture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every oven I've owned has had a little steam tray in the bottom. I've never bothered to use it though. I bet most people commenting have it and don't know it. Just look at the bottom of your oven for a recessed area in the metal.</p></div>		</li>
