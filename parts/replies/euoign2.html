			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this, too. Like the thing about how you aren't supposed to read if you're losing your voice or have had throat surgery, because your vocal cords will move minutely when you're reading even if you don't realize it. I wonder if that's true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as Iâ€™m aware that does happen with most people, but you can learn to read without moving your vocal cords to get a better experience out of it. So I can only assume it can be applied to the internal monologue as well.</p></div>		</li>
