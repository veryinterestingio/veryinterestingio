			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love for this to be right but there isn’t a “pain hormone”  to spread like butter unfortunately. It’s just nerve transmission directly to the brain. Now you can distract the brain from pain with other stimulation, particularly in nearby areas, since the brain struggles to accurately process multiple inputs at once. Or motion could help increase blood flow  to help drain the area quicker and reduce inflammation which reduces pain. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so no pain hormone. But what I was aiming for in what I said was that inflammation. There are certainly bodily fluids that induce pain and shaking certainly helps move those so they don't concentrate in one area. Though I was definitely wrong in thinking that getting kicked in the balls hurts &quot;because fluid&quot;</p></div>		</li>
