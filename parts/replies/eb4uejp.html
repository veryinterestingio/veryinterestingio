			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue on the point, the reason the antarctic is special (The polar vortex), is because the antarctic is a giant landmass surrounded by ocean. This allows the polar vortex to form above the sea surrounding the landmass, and surround it like a giant wall.</p>
<p>On the north pole on the other hand, you have a (frozen) ocean surrounded by landmasses (Northern canada, Greenland, Norway and Northern russia). The landmasses disrupt the winds enough that they do not get as severe as in the antarctic, and do not form the same vortex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might seem like a stupid question with a &quot;just because&quot; answer but I'll ask anyway..... Why is there a land mass underneath the Antarctic but not one underneath the Arctic? Why did it turn out that way? Was there originally land at the Arctic but it shifted away into pieces and drifted apart like the continents did when they originally formed? Sorry if that's a stupid question.... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's happenstance for our current time period.  Continents move around all over the earth, for example at the time of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodinia" target="_blank">supercontinent Rodinia</a> both the arctic and antarctic were open ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that has to do with continental drift, part of Pangea drifted south and ended up forming Antarctic while Arctic doesn't have that, then both places are cold enought to freeze the ocean and that's completely independent. So Antarctic is an actual continent covered in ice while Arctic isn't (just ice)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a stupid question but the answer kinda boils down to &quot;because that's how the land shifted&quot;.  The movement of plate tectonics resulted in land masses shifting in such a way that there is land in the Antarctic but not the Arctic much like they resulted in land masses that are separated by a large Pacific ocean but a smaller Atlantic.</p>
<p>The direction of the movement is a result of temperature differences in the mantle of the Earth.  Those differences result in fluid flow and currents in the molten parts of the earth, but I don't have a great explanation for why those hot (and cold) zones form precisely where they do.  If you measured those currents you could predict where movement would go, but I don't know if we have great tools for predicting changes in those currents and thus changes in movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also worth mentioning that polar regions are so hella cold for so long, that they have special clouds that provide solid surfaces that facilitate the chemical reactions that destroy atmospheric ozone, and these reactions have a long time to proceed and ratchet up ozone depletion over the long polar winters.</p>
<p>So, just to tie it up, the Antarctic ozone hole is special because it’s a perfect storm for ozone destruction.
Special clouds that facilitate the chemistry of it that last a long time (so the hole can form in the first place and continue to form for a long time)
A polar vortex that is remarkably stable and thus shields Antarctic air from mixing very much with the rest of the globe (so the hole can just get worse and worse in one spot). Contrast that with the Arctic polar cell which regularly (and increasingly with climate change) dips into temperate zones (remember those recent hella cold winters in the eastern US) and gets pockets of warm temperate air that migrate poleward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also several different “holes”, but they’re more like when your sock gets worn down to the threads so you can barely see through it and it’s not actually a hole. There’s one over Europe, the poles (due to the coriolis effect), and a few other places that are either heavily populated or wind patterns tend to accumulate pollutants. Just some more information to help out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing about the science of ozone holes, but if I had to guess, I'd say that it's what you're getting at, but instead of just Everest causing the effect it's the entire Tibetan plateau. It's such a large expanse as such a high elevation that maybe it circulates chlorinated air in a similar vortex as Antarctica?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apologize for the super late response - as far as I know it was due to changing air circulation triggered by global warming. This definitely isn’t my area of expertise so I’m not sure I can elaborate. It is over the plateau (I saw someone mention Everest).</p></div>		</li>
