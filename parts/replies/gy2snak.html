			<div class="markdown"><p>sort of. it technically could be tracked. I'm over simplifying things in the last comment.</p>
<p>like with any cryptographic protocols, they technically can be traced back, but the more levels of obscurity you have over the channels used, the more expensive it gets to figure it out.</p>
<p>if it ends up costing more than the loss to figure out who did it is it worth it? or is it better to just invest in security measures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the main appeals of crypto. Even though it <strong>can</strong> be tracked in the end, there's automated processes that make it so damn hard that it's not even worth it.</p>
<p>You know how they say on TV when trying to trace something how it went through &quot;several servers around the world&quot; and eventually hit a dead-end? That usually means that you just couldn't figure out where the path went after that point, for whatever reason, it's obviously more complicated than what they say on TV but in the end there's so many layers that it might end up proving next to impossible to know where something even came from. Still possible, but certainty goes down and cost goes up exponentially.</p>
<p>Multiply that by a gazillion and that's what they do to &quot;launder&quot; crypto. You have dirty crypto, there's services that will make it go around <strong>a lot</strong> through lots of wallets all over the world, and eventually you get it back, good luck tracing all of that, and now you can't really taint those coins because as far as the network is concerned that's all legitimate, unless you decide to flag lots of wallets.</p></div>		</li>
