			<div class="markdown"><p>There are going to be a lot of answers to this that are contradictory, misleading, irrelevant, or myth,  The truth is, while lots of people have theories, there is no simple answer that everyone agrees about. </p>
<p>(I’m not picking on your answer particularly; I had to pick one to reply to as my comment cannot be top level).</p>
<p>The simple momentum argument doesn’t hold up. Forward momentum doesn’t directly affect sideways stability. Think of it another way: even when you are stationary, you are moving at hundreds of mph is some reference frame. Simple momentum can be whatever you want it to be. </p>
<p>The angle of the front wheel isn’t true either. In fact the angle and the bend in the front fork makes the bike less stable, but more maneuverable. Generally you can’t have stability and maneuverability at the same time. You can only improve one at the cost of the other. </p>
<p>The gyroscope argument seems like it makes sense. But then why does the same effect exist for things that don’t have spinning wheels? It’s much easier to ice skate on one foot if you have picked up speed first, than if you are are stationary. </p>
<p>But what do I know? I’m just repeating the theories I see on the internet just like everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fair point, this is a complicated subject and there's really no simple answer that can accurately explain everything. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>and at a large enough reference frame where you'd consider a stationary thing (relative to the ground) to be moving near 1000 mph (roughly the rotational speed of the earth at the equator) small changes from walking/biking are going to be near negligible, so picking that reference frame isn't very useful in explaining what's happening.</p>

<p>This is actually part of why I chose the momentum explanation and not the gyroscope one, which kind of boils down to a spinning wheel wanting to conserve angular momentum. So in the bicycle example both your forward momentum and the angular momentum from your wheels help to keep you balanced, but ice-skating only has the forward momentum</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually one of the comments further doen has it with the contact point with the ground. Think about what happens if you're stationary (on a bike, skate, whatever) and start to fall. You either have to move your (foot, bike, whatever) to catch yourself, do some hard rebalancing, or you fall down. If you're already moving, that first option becomes a lot easier. If you start to fall sjdeways, you can just steer a tiny bit sideways to get your foot back under you. Falling forwards? Speed up a bit. Backwards? Slow down. You make these corrections constantly and without thinking about it when you're moving, and that keeps you upright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion it's inertia either way, gyroscopic or not. To go along with your ice skating example let's recall Newton's first law and concurrent forces. If you are stationary standing on one leg on ice skates it's takes less force to topple you over in comparison to if you are in motion because your forward inertia has to be counteracted and since you put work into skating faster (work=force x distance) it would be reasonable to assume that more force would be required to set you off balance therefore you feel more stable in motion. This effect is increased on a bicycle due to the added gyroscopic effect of the spinning wheels. </p>
<p>Full disclaimer I have no formal education and I don't know this for a fact it's just how I think about it in such a way that actually makes sense to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scrolled down to find someone say it and yes it is about the gyroscopic effect of the wheels. Here is a video which explains better <a href="https://youtu.be/GeyDf4ooPdo" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/GeyDf4ooPdo</a>. Momentum has nothing to do with being able to keep the bike upright. If you see new people who ride a skateboard they tend to be tilted and moving faster does not help at all.</p></div>		</li>
