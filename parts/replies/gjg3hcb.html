<p>This isn't the English government, this is the British/UK government. England doesn't have it's own government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I meant when I said &quot;England has the main body&quot; - is that the main branch of government is seated here - though the argument could be made that they are the English government, as they handle all of the policy etc for England that the devolved parliaments handle for their respective countries. If the main body of parliament <em>wasn't</em> the &quot;English government&quot;, I doubt our sibling nations would have cared so much about having devolved parliamentary powers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This 100%. Westminster is England's parliament, and also the UK government, because in the eyes of the establishment, those are one and the same thing. Scottish, Welsh and Irish MPs are simply allowed to sit in England's parliament (for now - hopefully not much longer)</p></div>		</li>
