<p>Interesting that pursuit predators like a cheetah have round pupils and ambush predators like domestic cats and lizards have vertical pupils.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be to do with size ratio of predator to prey. Domestic cars go after very small prey in relation to their body. So a mouse darting side to side that horizontal sharpness is really important. Big cats I think go after larger prey even when you take into account their larger size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It likely has to do with when they hunt. Predominantly nocturnal cats need the benefit of increased light (and give up clarity in one axis to get this), while daytime hunters see evolutionary benefit with round pupils (and perfectly focused prey).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheetahs were actually kept in ancient Mesopotamia as hunting companions because they were considered superior to dogs in that regard. Alas, due to other biological constraints, they were never truly domesticated.</p>
<p>Basically, if you think cheetahs and dogs have a lot in common, you're not wrong and not the first person to think so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe all &quot;big cats&quot; have round pupils. That includes the five members of the genus <em>panthera</em> (lions, tigers, leopards, snow leopards and jaguars) as well as others not in that genus, such as cheetahs, lynx, and clouded leopards. &quot;Small cats&quot;, like the domestic cat, the black-footed cat, the European wildcat and more have slitted eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that when they lower their head down to eat grass or whatever, they can rotate their eyeballs and keep the horizontal slits parallel to the ground. </p>
<p>The positioning of their eyeballs and the width of the slits allows them to see 320 degrees around if they keep their ears out the way.</p>
<p>Then if something comes for them they can peg it out of there and climb a dam or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never considered this. But yes, a cat's ears can only rotate horizontally, so tilting their head would give them that extra dimension when it comes to locating the source of a sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>agreed with the other commenter. foxes will do this while listening for prey beneath the snow, too—the sound waves hit each ear at different times and volumes depending on the location of the source, that's how you can tell whether a sound is coming from your left or right. in animals with sharp hearing this difference is more pronounced, and shifting the ears helps triangulate the sound. this is also why some animals have ears that move!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs do that too. Just talk to them in a high pitched voice while looking at them. They'll move their head back and forth as a way to determine more information about the sound you're making.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody knows why dogs tilt their heads. Some people think it's because of sound, some people think it's because of visuals, some people think it's because they're simply puzzled. They have been shown to sometimes tilt their heads at clearly spoken words or commands that they know and completely understand, which serves as evidence against the fact that it is done to help with interpreting sound. There are several theories, but we don't actually know for sure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was very intrigued as well, from the sources I've seen it appears this is for extreme peripheral vision, to maintain as much awareness as possible of approaching predators (almost the exact opposite of the cat it appears).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further this, presumably they went towards a rectangle to maintain both vertical and horizontal dispersion since they're often on cliffsides, where deer species (and many other prey species) tend to have horizontally longer ovular pupils that extend the peripheral range just along the horizontal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are horizontal and wide to give them maximum horizontal vision which is where predators come from. Their eyes even rotate in the sockets to stay more parallel when bending to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human eyes rotate in the socket too, when the head is tiltet sideways. It just not as obvious as in goats.
If one has a distinct spot/pattern to track on the iris, it's easier to observe in the mirror.</p></div>		</li>
