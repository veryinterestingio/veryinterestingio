<p>That's not quite right - the <em>atmosphere</em> of Neptune is still primarily hydrogen and helium, though it does have a fair bit more methane than Jupiter. The real answer here is temperature at cloud-top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really want to believe you and your <em>incredibly</em>-relevant flair. It makes me feel like I'm probably wrong. But the thing I just linked, published by NASA's JPL, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The predominant blue color of the planet is a result of the absorption of red and infrared light by Neptune's methane atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with no mention of temperatures or the atmosphere not being mostly methane.</p>
<p>Can you explain how your answer of cloud temp fits with this? Is NASA wrong and/or glossing over details when they say &quot;Neptune's <em>methane atmosphere</em>&quot;? Because that wording sure makes me think it's majority methane, not &quot;primarily hydrogen and helium&quot; like you said. Not trying to argue here, honestly trying to learn! Your &quot;giant planet atmospheres&quot; flair makes me think you know as much as JPL on this, if not more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are 100% glossing over details. The atmospheres of both Neptune and Uranus are still primarily hydrogen. From Lodders &amp; Fegley, 1998, &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Planetary-Scientists-Companion-Katharina-Lodders/dp/0195116941" target="_blank">The Planetary Scientist's Companion</a>&quot; that I have sitting in front of me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Table 11.3 Chemical Composition of the Atmosphere of Neptune</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>H<em><em>2</em></em>: ~80%</p>

<li>

</li>
<li>

<p>Those numbers are a little old at this point - more recent numbers have slightly tweaked the helium content - but they're still basically correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly there is a lot of sketchy language in press releases. In NASA's releases probably much less than in most, given the exposure, but still. It should be &quot;atmospheric methane&quot; or &quot;methane in the atmosphere&quot;, not &quot;methane atmosphere&quot;</p></div>		</li>
