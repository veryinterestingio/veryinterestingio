			<div class="markdown"><p>My main concerns are about the consensus today, since there are a couple of open questions here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the SQL fundamental (as the HUP is) in the case of repetitive measurement of a free mass? In the case of the optical SQL, the so called shot noise, I know that it is not, and has been breached, theoretically. The review article by Giovanetti et al (2004) says that it is not, even after equaling the SQL to HUP between x(0) and x(T). How is it not fundamental then? (Maybe I should email the authors and ask them!)</li>
<li>The definition of precision Caves uses is that it is the spread of the wavefunction <em>after</em> the measurement. But this is regarded as ambiguous by the papers I've read. They claim that there is no consensus on whether the measurement gives us the state the system as <em>just before</em> the measurement, or the state that it has reduced into <em>after</em> the measurement?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm asking whether the SQL in the case of the repetitive measurement of the free mass has yet been breached? Is anybody trying? If SQL= HUP then it is not going to be broken, but then why is it not fundamental? Is Caves' derivation valid? I realize that answer really is that all this concerns relatively newly published literature and many people may not have read all those and I should do it myself, but just in case they have...</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The uncertainty principle is fundamental (because it’s trivially true).</p>
<p>A SQL is specific to measurement situation.  In the example you provided in the other thread, the “SQL” in question was the variance in measurements of the position observable of a traveling wave-packet.  The proposed “contractive state” had a position uncertainty below that of the archetypical “minimum-uncertainty wave-packet” that’s described in textbooks, and indeed could be made arbitrarily small; ergo it was below the SQL for wave-packets.</p>
<p>However notice that the uncertainty principle was never violated, because higher momentum uncertainty balanced it out (indeed over-balanced) at all times.</p>
<p>The SQL is different from the uncertainty principle, tho often related.  To the extent it‘s constrained by the uncertainty principle in a given situation, it will never violate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well contractive states are just a particular state for a free-particle system that unusual property.  I found a few papers on google explaining them (e.g. <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.51.719" target="_blank">this</a>).  The “standard quantum limit” is an experimental physics term.  </p>
<p>But I’d caution: nothing in QM makes sense except in light of the math, and everything in QM makes perfect sense under the math.  Learn QM if you can.  Griffith’s “Introduction to Quantum Mechanics” is the gold standard today.  (1 year of calculus-based physics, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and differential equations are QM prereqs.)</p>
<p>If you’re just casually interested, a good starting point is to no longer think of a particle as a point “x̅(t): ℛ → ℛ^(3)” with mass “m” that moves according Newton’s 2nd law given initial conditions x̅(0) and x̅'(0), but rather as a <em>wavefunction</em> “Ψ(x̅, t): (ℛ^(3), ℛ) → ℂ” with mass “m” that moves according to the Schrödinger equation (which is just an expression of <del>energy conservation</del> Galilean invariance) given an initial condition Ψ(x̅,0) subject to the restriction that ∭ Ψ*(x̅, t) Ψ(x̅, t) dV = 1.</p></div>		</li>

<p>which is just an expression of energy conservation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are lots of ways to conserve energy, and while the Schrödinger equation in a static potential will, it's not a statement of it.  (In a non-static potential, energy conservation will be violated).  The Schrödinger equation must always conserve <em>density</em>, but that's a property it must have, not what it fundamentally does or means.  What it does is directly express energy being the generator of time-translation, but that's almost a tautology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, this is an emerging field, so you will not find many text books or even popular science sites taking about it. That's really unfair though, since the entire field of quantum metrology, the science if quantum measurements, to which my post pertains, came into being after a paper by CM Caves about improving the sensitivity of the Gravitational Wave detectors, the detection of which was big news recently. Quantum Metrology is a really exciting field that exploits quantum effects to overcome limits of classical apparatuses. But if you want to read about it, you'll have to go directly to the research papers, mostly. (And it involves a lot of math)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used squeezed states to improve the SNR of LIGO measurements by approx 2.15 dB (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nphoton.2013.177" target="_blank">doi:10.1038/nphoton.2013.177</a>). </p>
<p>But it seems like it was not used for the big paper about the actual confirmation of gravitational waves (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102" target="_blank">doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102</a>). I can't find any mention of squeezing, or the results of the former paper, being used in the latter paper.</p></div>		</li>
