			<div class="markdown"><p>They're proprietary so ¯_( ツ)_/¯, but Moderna's entire company is built off of mRNA delivery so they probably dumped more R&amp;D into their liposome formulations so they have a more stable formulation than pfizer hence the <em>slightly</em> less stringent cold storage conditions. Also mRNA vaccines usually use RNA that has been slightly altered to improve stability since humans have a lot of rna eating enzymes. These slight chemical alterations are probably different between Pfizer's and Moderna's again with probably Moderna's being a bit more stable. Unfortunately, these stability differences seem to be negligible as both need extremely cold storage conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know at least Moderna uses a T7 RNA Polymerase, using a plasmid template to make the in vitro (IVT) mRNA. 5-methyluridine is the primary modification used to improve stability of the trascript mRNA; my understanding is that the entire sequence of RNA uses this modified nucleotide. </p>
<p>Other tidbits- not sure where they get the modified nucleotides, as TriLink is the main supplier of modified nucleotides and a  big contract manufacturer for mRNAs....but really, they don't have the capabilities to supply that amount of raw material to support a global pandemic. So I imagine both BioNTech and Moderna are getting NTPs (modified or otherwise) from a Chinese Supplier. </p>
<p>Regarding the lipid nanoparticles, these are definitely part of the IP for each respective company but fundamentally, these contain cationic lipids, as well as other polymers (PEGs and whatnot), perhaps with a specific cleavable functionality to facilitate the delivery upon endosomal uptake. The LNPs are self assembling and are probably, my guess, the biggest difference between Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, why do you consider the difference between the cold storage requirements to be slight?  The difference between a $15,000 ultralow freezer for the Pfizer and a freezer kept at the same temp as a regular home freezer for the Moderna strikes me as a substantial quantitative and qualitative difference. Plus the Moderna can be stored at 4 C for up to a month after being thawed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, PhD Candidate in nucleic acid chemistry here. Thought I'd throw in my two cents.</p>
<p>Good summary, but you say that there's chemical alterations in the RNA itself, but the scale they're producing these, I can't imagine there is (correct me if I'm wrong?). They must be making them in vitro to keep up with demand (and affordability). Chemical modifications requires synthetic RNA and that's just out of the question here. Unless you're talking about sequence differences at the 5' and 3' end; in that case I'd agree completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The structure of the lipids is a bit different, but both vaccines have a cocktail of lipids including cholesterol (listed in a nice format <a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a35002158/pfizer-vs-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-ingredients/" target="_blank">here</a>) to help get the mRNA into cells. Also, the salts/buffer solutions are different between the two, which plays into fridge vs freezer stability. Lipids are often stored in the lab (to my knowledge- I don't really do anything with them) at 4C, whereas mRNA is stored at -80C. I'm guessing each company focused on how to keep the component stored at the other temperature stable for the other component, which is where a lot of the salts involved come in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes. But the way they're made makes it trivial to make small alterations to the spike protein sequence. That's what makes these way more powerful than all of our previous vaccines. They're already preparing formulas for the third shot booster to go after the bad variants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very likely. If a mutation came in that altered the spike protein target significantly enough, both mRNA vaccines would likely not do much (some, but not much). The spike protein was picked in part because it's not likely to mutate dramatically quickly, iirc. But making a booster, now that the mRNA vaccine techniques have been worked out, would be relatively easy. Plus, the j&amp;j and AZ work differently, and would likely still be pretty effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the particular hope is that since the spike seems so unique to its infectivity, any mutation of the spike that is significant enough to render the vaccine ineffective would also render the virus variant itself significantly less effective.</p>
<p>But it's still a gamble, and every bit of continued/increased community spread means more and more generations of virus churning out chances for us to get another bad surprise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Moderna is already running human trials on a booster that targets the South African variant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. JnJ and AZ both use Adenoviruses that are genetically modified to express spike proteins. If the spikes change, those are equally negated. </p>
<p>The spikes are the mechanism for entry. So, if they change, they would have to change to be something that is also still effective at invasion. This should resist mutation because it is under two selective pressures now.</p></div>		</li>
