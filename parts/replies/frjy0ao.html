<p>What you see in a digital photograph is being seen with a microchip, a bunch of computer programming, and an artificial two dimensional projection of what it thinks the light should be, at a very limited resolution.</p>
<p>Cameras are awesome, but nearly two centuries of development and countless billions of dollars still haven't replicated what people actually see</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take that as being the former of my question then! That's somewhat of a relief. What about supermodels and ridiculously photogenic people? Is it all thanks to more expensive equipment or does it lean heavily on having a symmetrical face as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the advent of photoshop it was almost all on expensive equipment and the brains of highly skilled photographers who can use the effects of photograph equipment to combat the inherent issues the photograph equipment creates. </p>
<p>I don't think a single professional photograph I have seen in a while didn't have at least some level of photoshop applied to it. Even if to just correct the light source.</p></div>		</li>
