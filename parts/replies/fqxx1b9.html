			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, when antibodies aren't good enough they might actually help viruses invade immune cells and create a much worse infection by speeding up their proliferative cycles. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement" target="_blank">antibody-dependent enhancement</a> (ADE) and the best-known example of this is with Dengue virus reinfection and the failures of its candidate vaccines.  SARS and other betacoronaviruses have been shown to be capable of utilizing antibody-dependent pathways for immune cell entry too, which is potentially worrying for vaccine development.  There are multiple theories as to the exact mechanism by which ADE occurs but the long and short of it is that this is not yet a well-understood phenomenon on a mechanistic level.  This was, however, a heavily stressed topic of study when we learned about vaccine development in medical school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t lose hope though. I wouldn’t say we “failed” to develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-1. In fact we were pretty close and ready to send it to clinical trials, but the virus had died out by that time so nobody cared. I. E. There was no more money to continue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only no more money. But also no more need for vaccination. No new infections since 2004 means it is dead in humans. SARS-CoV-1 would need to be transmitted from animal to human again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. But given the current situation that doesn’t seem improbable. Not only that, but continuing the development may have led to better understanding of immunity to coronaviruses, and some immunologists speculate that a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine would have provided some cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;pretty close&quot; Is really overstating it. We had vaccines that proved mostly safe. However, no SARS-like virus vaccine has ever been tested for efficacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whos. I wonder if that one might have some efficacy, based on the fact that some people previously infected with other corona viruses (the “common cold type” have T cells targeted against SARS-CoV-2 (specifically the S protein that is common to all corona viruses) (and therefore that immunity to one corona virus might give some immunity against others).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We haven’t failed so much as funding dried up because the disease was no longer a threat before any could be declared safe through human trials... it wasn’t a danger for long enough and without current cases it wasn’t going to get human trials.  It’s not that it’s particularly harder to make a vaccine for the SARS  type... it was very difficult to come up with the first flu vaccines as well.  This is more a supply and demand problem than a research wall problem.  Over stimulating the immune system is a common complication with vaccine development.  It’s just that these sorts of problems typically have to be solved with super expensive shotgun type approaches to research where you literally try everything and see what works best... it’s just not worth it when there’s no demand and smaller institutional grant funded research labs make much slower progress than those funded by investors hoping to see massive returns.  It’s sad... but if SARS had been a slightly longer burning outbreak we might have a vaccine for Covid-19 much closer to/ if not in/ later stage human trials and likely efficacy.</p></div>		</li>
