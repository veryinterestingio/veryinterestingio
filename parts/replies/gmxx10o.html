			<div class="markdown"><p>This is semi unrelated, and if it doesn't fit here I'll delete it. In the early 2000s when I was in elementary school, they would make us drink milk with breakfast and lunch. The real kicker is that we had to finish everything (including the milk) to go to recess. Kids tried to tell people they don't like it, or they are allergic and supervisors thought it was some excuse to get to recess. It's somewhat surreal to look back on kids who were severely lactose intolerant being forced to drink milk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm extremely sensitive to plant fiber, if I eat the tiniest bit of legumes, tomato, orange... I will shit violently for days (blood and mucus and all the whole gorefest included). Even soup made with chickpeas, where the peas have been removed, causes me gastrointestinal distress. </p>
<p>Kiwis are straight up suicidal.</p>
<p>Which is funny, because my base state is &quot;constipated&quot;. Maybe it's some form of mild allergy causing the shitshow. One day, once I'm old and doctors finally take me seriously, I'll figure it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah if I had a dollar for every doctor that said &quot;you're young and you look healthy!&quot; I'd have like 10 bucks. But seriously, I'm not healthy. That's why I'm at the doctor. Again. Something is wrong, help! </p>
<p>I figured it out myself after 8 years. Fun times.</p></div>		</li>
