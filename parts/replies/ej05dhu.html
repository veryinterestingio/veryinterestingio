			<div class="markdown"><p>Pangea is pretty well-understood due to being so young (geologically speaking). There are plenty of Pangea-aged rocks still preserved, the compositions and structures of which tell us about the environment they were deposited in. We also have loads of relevant faults and old subduction zones mapped, as well as lots of paleomagnetic data which tells us about the location and orientation of ocean crust when it was formed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a fairly accurate prediction of what Pangaea looked like because of fossil records, glacier erosion, igneous rock magnetic orientation, rock composition, tectonic subduction/divergence boundaries, and other measurable geologic features. For example, if we look at Africa and South America, we can see that despite the vast distance between them today, they both have fossils of animals that couldn't possible have traveled the distance between them, and that the fossils are of a similar age. This supports the idea that these fossils were at one point close to each other, and the continents later separated into modern Africa and South America. As for glacier erosion, we can see erosion that is specific to glacier movement across multiple continents. When compared to glacier erosion on other landmasses, they line up very neatly. Imagine you took a piece of paper and drew a couple of lines down it, and ripped it in half. You could easily take that paper and re-create it just using those lines, which is essentially what scientist do when matching up geological features to show what Pangaea looked like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, the more recent the period the more confidence there is in the reconstruction. Pangaea is pretty well understood, but the supercontinents before that have less confidence in their reconstructions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had humans been alive then, most of the landmass would have been in the northern hemisphere, because we like being on top and would have just labeled our map differently. </p>
<p>So the anomaly would be if for most of the time the land were evenly distributed, not that it was on the other side. Our label of north and south is completely arbitrary, but the heart of the question is &quot;why it stuff on one half?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is &quot;north&quot;? It's just a name for a particular direction on earth. I suspect the real question you're asking is why is north depicted as up or the top of a map or globe. That's purely a longstanding cultural convention that has became deeply ingrained. Many ancient maps depicted east as up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>East as up? Interesting, that seems counterintuitive to me. And not because I happen to live an a north-up culture. Things that rotate (throwing disc, frisbee, spinning top) have their own up and down, due to gravity. Some things might spin sideways, but not perfectly so. I guess with an East-up map, you could imagine Earth as a ball, rolling along an orbit around the sun?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can easily find north in the night sky by looking for the North Star and it was used for navigation before magnetism was discovered. It makes sense to align a map with that fixed point. Imagine otherwise: the star would be in your back where you can’t see it or you have to constantly turn around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could just as easily decide that the star would lead to the bottom of a map. It doesn’t explain why we decided on the orientation of a map to be the way it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the confluence of the role of the North Star and early work in the development of accurate charts for renaissance navigators on the Mediterranean.  </p>
<p>Before this point in European map history, East was traditionally “oriented” up (get it?  That IS the etymology btw).  East was considered important because of the significance of Christianity to those people and Jerusalem being that-a-way, this East was up.  Something similar happened with navigators and cartographers who at first would draw their charts pretty much any way up that they thought would be useful, but they always added the compass rose with North getting prominent attention, often a litttle Star on it.  North had become important and slowly became up on the map.</p>
<p>I would argue that north and south always made more sense than east anyway; the medieval way of doing things always had numbered days imo.</p></div>		</li>
