			<div class="markdown"><p>If you get 6 hours of sleep I would expect you to have bags because that's not enough sleep for most people. Try getting 8 hours of sleep for a month and I bet they'll go away. I think you're probably sleep deprived and you should do whatever you can to try to make sure you get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation causes all kinds of problems including greatly increasing your risk of early onset dementia, making you gain weight, and inhibiting your impulse control.</p></div>		</li>
