			<div class="markdown"><p>Great analogy. And to further it, rain and few are created when the suitcase shrinks due to temperature. Regardless of how much water is actually inside, if the suitcase shrinks enough the water will overflow and cause rain or dew depending on the circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly.  &quot;Dew point&quot; is the temperature where the current amount of water in the air would be 100% relative humidity. If the temperature falls below the dew point, that water is going to condense: as dew, rain, fog, snow, etc.   </p>
<p>You can <em>estimate</em> the height of clouds based on dew point. Clouds form where water condenses, and water condenses when when the air temperature drops below the dew point.  Air temperature falls as altitude increases, about 4 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 feet. So, if the dew point is 8 degrees <em>below the ambient temperature</em> on a cloudy day, the base of the clouds is going to be about 2000 feet.   If the base of the clouds is 1000 feet, you can estimate that the dew point is about 4 degrees below the current temperature.</p>
<p>(&quot;Estimate&quot;, because there are several other factors that can affect cloud formation.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is my understanding. Dew point is the temperature where the suitcase would be at capacity as per the current amount of water in the suitcase.</p>
<p>For example: at 40¬∞C the suitcase is half full or 50% relative humidity. At 10¬∞C the suitcase would have shrunk and the water now fills it completely, or 100% humidity. This the dew point of 40¬∞C with 50% humidity is 10¬∞C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. When the temperature in the suitcase drops to the dew point temperature, droplets on the inside form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rain takes a few more steps like nucleosis. More like fog/clouds start to form IF additional conditions are right. Weather is a weird thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UrgghUsername" target="_blank">UrgghUsername</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. The air is colder up higher so they're more likely to form up their first (this causes rain). However at night the air cools down low to the ground and they form at low altitudes (this causes dew). Water needs a catalyst (non-water thing) to form the droplet on, which is why dew appears on things as opposed to low altitude rain.</p></div>		</li>
