			<div class="markdown"><p>It is important to clarify that the process of rifting involves both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility_(Earth_science\)" target="_blank">ductile deformation</a> of the lower crust and portions of upper mantle (for which taffy is a decent analogue) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittleness" target="_blank">brittle deformation</a> of the upper crust through the formation of discrete normal faults. Even with significant crustal thinning, not all rifting leads to magmatism and the development of sea floor, e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basin_and_Range_Province" target="_blank">Basin and Range</a> is a classic example of a 'wide rift', which has accommodated significant amounts of extension and thinning, but within which deformation was never localized enough to develop into a spreading center.</p>
<p>It's also important to clarify that you're sort of describing rifting via one particular model that has been proposed for rift geometries, specifically the 'pure shear' or 'McKenzie' model for which there is no through going 'master structure'. The alternative end member 'simple shear' or 'Wernicke' model of rifting does argue for a lithospheric scale structure that could be considered a 'single crack' (although again, deformation will be accommodated via both brittle and ductile means along this structure, whereas at the word 'crack' kind of implies brittle behavior), but certainly not one that develops quickly or results in sudden separation of two continents.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broadly correct, but there might actually have been some cracks pretty much exactly as OP is probably visualising. Þingvellir in Iceland is splitting apart and is full of parallel fissures and cracks that you can walk into and see the layers of vesicular basalt. It's one of the coolest geological sites I've ever visited.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Normal faulting is an intrinsic part of continental rifting (it's one of the central mechanisms by which it is facilitated) and Þingvellir is just a picturesque example. But these are just geologically ephemeral and small-scale, <em>generally</em> local features. So you're not wrong, but it's not accurate to think of a feature like Þingvellir as the rift.</p></div>		</li>
