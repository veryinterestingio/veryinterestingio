			<div class="markdown"><p>These are called dictionary attacks! Plus rules (add a ! on the end for each guess or etc.) guessing becomes easy.</p>
<p>Also the important thing to note is that it's a computer guessing to begin with, and password attacks aren't usually &quot;guess the password in the login&quot; but &quot;I have a list of encrypted passwords and know the algorithm used to encrypt them. If I guess right I can decrypt them&quot;. Thus a computer guessing 26^(4) possibilities is doable very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Add a few extra characters to the password, include characters and numbers, and suddenly it's like 50^(8), far, far more than any current computer, probably even a super computer, can guess in a lifetime, or even the entire life of the universe, if the encryption scheme chosen is good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't decrypt them, but if you now that password &quot;Open&quot; is &quot;a2rj452hr56nv2e5&quot; when encrypted, then if you find a user with &quot;a2rj452hr56nv2e5&quot; in the database you know it's &quot;Open&quot;. Though, if the encryption algorithm uses salting, then you it's harder.  </p>
<p>But yes, if you use only 4 characters than it is very easy to build a list of all  <strong>456,976</strong> passwords and their encrypted version. By setting the password length to a minimum of 8 charactes, and haveing 62 types of characters (26 small + 26 big case letter and 10 numbers) you go to 218 000 billion combinations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those rainbow tables still exist though.</p>
<p>There are hobbyists with far too much processing power to spare who have &quot;build a table of every 8 character password with the following characteristics&quot; as a goal and they spend years on it.  And if they ever finish that, you bet your ass they'll move straight to 9 character or a different hashing algorithm.</p>
<p>I know these people exist because I'm friends with a couple of them, and I've seen them talking about the economics of storage requirements measured in the petabyte for weird problems like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much easier to just add more digits, isn't it? </p>
<p>At 26 vs 62 symbols, you just need 3 more digits at 26 symbols to overtake the 62 in the usual password length (8-12 digits).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but how does adding numbers, special characters, and a requirement to change your password every two months help? At a certain point, people just add a sequential number And there less “randomness”. One just can’t come up with so many unique passwords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that forcing people to change password is to reduce risk in case they were compromised and the company did not realize?</p>
<p>Although unless the attackers just attack a lot of places and wait 2 months to see which worked and use the password... I am not sure it really helps. They would usually enter your account/computer, change the password and either steal everything or lock everything up and ask for money (ransomware).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UK Government research has shown that changing passwords on a regular basis actually makes a system <em>less</em> secure.</p>
<p>As people change their passwords, either </p>
<ul>
<li>they become more and more guessable </li>
</ul>
<p>or, if they are constrained to non-readable passwords (e.g.  L*dtCSwl2lih()YT ) then they are either </p>
<ul>
<li>more likely to write them down and thus become less secure - or </li>
<li>they forget them more often and end up requesting a password change which in itself is high risk.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the assumption is that there's no reason to assume that they have been hacked within x period, and there's no reason to assume that someone will actually crack a password within y amount of time, but if you extend those out to infinity then eventually it will happen. Change regularly and you have a good chance of changing passwords before the hackers succeed in cracking anything. Which is all well and good except that humans aren't going to handle coming up with new passwords all the time well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forced regular password change is an anti pattern and encourages bad passwords.</p>
<p>Especially for your main login. Ideally you have a reasonable login passwords and a separate account for logging into sensitive stuff (usually work IT access type things) and that can have a rotating password that you can store in a password manager.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most major security authorities recommend that you do NOT force rotating passwords on users. It's a very outdated idea and in practice results in reduced security. People re-use passwords, modify them in a predictable manner, or write them down.</p></div>		</li>
