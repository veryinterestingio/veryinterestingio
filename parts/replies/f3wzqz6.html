			<div class="markdown"><p>Measles and immune system “amnesia” is one of the most interesting, unique, and dangerous things about the measles virus (MV).<br />
When the measles virus (which is HIGHLY contagious) enters our body, one of the first defenses from our immune system are cells called macrophages at the very ends of our airways (where the air sacs are). Macrophages works by gobbling up and destroying invaders like bacteria, viral particles, and dust. The MV is unique because it hijacks these cells and travels with them to our lymph nodes where the MV infects the memory cells of our immune system (memory B and T- cells-- these are the cells that remember past infections that we’ve had and attack repeat invaders to knock them out faster).<br />
In order to recover from measles our body has to kill of these infected memory cells.. Causing an “amnesia” for past infections that we have had. It can take 2-3 years after a measles infection to return to previous levels of immune system memory.<br />
And you are right.. This is really terrifying! I takes all of us that are concerned about getting evidence-based messages out to the general public to make sure that people are aware of all of the dangers associated with measles. -Neha Pathak</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there other diseases that similarly lurk in your body years after the initial sickness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! It can take 2-3 years, and some evidence suggests up to 5 years to develop a healthy immune system again. It’s essentially like the virus “reset” immunity so revaccination and exposure to previously encountered infections (cold viruses, flu viruses, etc) are needed to rebuild the proper immune function that was lost. - Neha Pathak, MD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That measles can start your immune system back from scratch and you can catch all the things again.</p>
<p>Maybe like respawning with a wiped defense skillset?</p></div>		</li>
