<p>but doesn't this encourage your immune system to target and kill those muscle cells, since it detects the unrecognised &quot;foreign&quot; protein?!</p>

<p>Some of them, and that's a probably good thing - training T cells to recognise infected cells and deal with them is likely to be an important part of how these vaccines do their job.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But the downside of that isn't so much that you lose some muscle cells, it's more that once there are few cells left producing the protein, then the immune system can begin forgetting about making antibodies if that's going to happen.</p></div>		</li>
