			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it IS actually the only answer that actually answers the question, I've no idea how other BS answers have gotten so much traction which are no way near to what actually happens. Perhaps actual 5-year old thought those answers to be real and upvoted them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe SanDisk claims they can store info for 100 years, and a Magnetic field shouldn't be a problem.  A strong Electrical field on the other hand oriented properly might be a problem.</p>
<p>They do have a finite amount of write cycles in them (1000ish?) depending on manufacture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YEAH i dont think they will last 10 years, but perhaps they can make em so they do. But most ive seen will have serious memory loss after 15-20 years or so. Point is, store things for very long term storage on differnt mediums!</p></div>		</li>
