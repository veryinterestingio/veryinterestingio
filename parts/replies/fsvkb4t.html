<p>Damage to roads doesn't go up linear to weight, its an exponential function.</p>
<p>A large truck will do the same damage as thousands of cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a bit to say on that: cracks aren't bad. They happen, you cover them up and that's it. Potholes are more problematic, but those happened a lot with the old roads too either way, it's just that, if you've ever been on a cobblestone or dirt road, you'll notice that it's so bumpy you barely notice the potholes either way.</p>
<p>But brick/cobblestone roads do crack less. They do crack though. The cracks happen for a lot of reasons. Weight affects it, but so does speed, turning wheels and such put strain on the asphalt that helps it to crack. You will notice that even human walkways with asphalt will crack. That's because as temperature changes the asphalt shrinks or expands, because it will do this at a rate and direction separate of the earth it's on, the asphalt then squeezes and tears at itself with its surroundings. A brick road has each brick expand, but the change in size is less, and the surrounding space gives it areas to expand and shrink without cracking. This also helps: cracks happen and are limited to individual bricks, in an asphalt road the crack can keep expanding through the street, on a brick road it's just a small hole where the brick should be.</p>
<p>Finally the last issue is how cheap asphalt roads are vs brick/cobblestone. This means that cheap, badly made roads, that crack easily and gain pot holes, will probably be asphalt, while all brick/cobblestone roads will be done with intention, and enough will be spent on them to do them right. So it makes sense that a very well made brick road handles cracking better than a crappy made asphalt road. Which is the other reason that people overestimate the effect of vehicle weight. When we think of cracked road we generally imagine some residential road, but trailers are generally on highways which do not look as cracked. It's simply because there's more of a chance that residential roads will have corners cut and people will ignore it, while people invest a lot in making highways right the first time around.</p></div>		</li>
