			<div class="markdown"><p>That's partly correct but even holding your breath is a good prevention for the bends. Free divers regularly dive to depths that could (and do) cause the bends for scuba divers but don't suffer the bends. The danger is actually breathing at different pressures. When whales and free divers swim their body isn't taking in any extra nitrogen, meaning the amount of nitrogen the body needs to get rid of still fits in the lungs and can be expelled in a single breath. Scuba divers build up very large amounts of nitrogen in their blood that has to be let out slowly through a controlled depressurizing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason free divers don't suffer the bends as often is simply because they don't stay down long enough to absorb that much nitrogen. When a free diver is deep, the rate of dissolution of Nitrogen in the blood is the same as it is for a diver breathing compressed air at the same depth. Elite free divers who can hold their breath way longer than a normal person require surface decompression (in a hyperbaric chamber) immediately after surfacing from long, deep free dives.</p></div>		</li>
