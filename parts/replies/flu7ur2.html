			<div class="markdown"><p>The one that drives me crazy is Excedrin extra strength and Excedrin migraine. It is the same thing - aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine - in the same exact dosage. Most places I've seen they also cost the exact same. What is the point??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related: I wanted a thermometer to keep at home during this virus lockdown, and they were all either sold out or price-gouged. I searched for “fertility thermometer” and found one for normal price and it was in stock. It’s labeled differently and is pink, but otherwise identical to a regular fever thermometer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should measure your temp to at least two decimal places (if it doesn’t, it isn’t useful as a fertility thermometer and the company is scamming people who actually want one). A real fertility thermometer is actually a different product from a standard home thermometer that only measures it to one decimal place, it’s not just a color or packaging difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because people with migranes are only go to buy a product that says it's for migraines because they assume it is better than one that is not.  If they didn't do this one of their competitors would and they would lose the sales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first started getting migraines, and I saw that they were the same thing, I bought the extra strength because the green on the bottle is so much more pleasant than the abrasive red packaging for the migraine version. Who wants to see that angry red package with a pounding migraine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this is a good point I hadn't thought of. So it's not always about squeezing more money out of a customer for one of their products vs another, but about drawing in a customer to choose their product vs another brand which might might be cheaper but doesn't slap that specific symptom on their label (i.e. migraine). It's slightly less maddening now that I understand the reasoning. Still, I wish consumers would pay enough attention to the drug info labels that this wouldn't be necessary or effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there's a placebo affect going on here as well. I mean, yeah the aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine are doing what they do...but as far as believing a 'specialized/specific' medicine for migraines will be more effective will make it more effective.</p></div>		</li>

There was someone who posted all this regular party decor type stuff for one price and then the literal exact same pieces were labeled &quot;wedding xyz&quot; and had upcharged it like 200%.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have really sensitive skin, if I used hand soap on my whole body, my skin would be irritated. It’s not the big difference and you are right, most of it it because of marketing, but when you wash your body you’re mainly washing off dead skin cells and sweat, whereas when you wash your hand you also need to get rid of extra bacteria that comes when you wipe after a toilet visit etc. So it kinda makes sense that hand soap is stronger than body soap, but you could just use hand soap all over. Face soap is also different from hand soap and even milder than body soap I believe because the skin on the face is so sensitive. I cannot use hand soap on my face, it depends on the brand but my skins does not(!) like it.
Intimate soap for woman is different because the ph on woman’s private parts are more acidic than the rest of the body, in that case it’s not about marketing it’s because you cannot use regular sop without disturbing then ph balance and creating some major issues. </p>
<p>So mostly marketing yes, but there are some slight differences that are beneficial and appreciated by some of us :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sorry, I didn’t mean to sound like I didn’t agree with you.</p>
<p>My point was that even though it is probably mostly about marketing there are some differences between the products and how they are used and they cannot all be used as the same :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not stronger. If it is soap, that isn't possible. But handsoap (sometimes called toilet soap) can be strongly perfumed. That can be irritating to some and certainly to women.</p></div>		</li>
