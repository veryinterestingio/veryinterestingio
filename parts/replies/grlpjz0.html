			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2519061/" target="_blank">Scientists are still studying how your receptors respond to histamine.</a> According to this study they have identified 4 different types of itch receptors and study what happens when they are sedated versus when they are antagonized.</p>
<p>There are lots of remedies to counteract the itching sensation, of which scratching is the worst. If you didn’t feel a response in the area where a foreign substance entered your body, you would not be able to treat it effectively to prevent further irritation or infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body can only produce a set amount of histamine at a given time. Scratching triggers the release of more histamine, and can deplete the supply enough to calm the itch for a while.  </p>
<p>Another way of doing that that does not break the skin and cause further damage is to blast the area with a hot hair dryer - not long enough to cause a burn, but just a bit short of that. The itching will stop for hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's annoying this thread is getting replies just uselessly explaining the entire concept of itching/scratching, instead of questioning how we as a species made it this far without evolving the instinct <em>not</em> to scratch in the <em>specific</em> case of wound-healing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The itch response is still curious from an evolutionary perspective. Presumably, there's either some adaptive advantage to animals scratching themselves, or, it is an evolutionary by-product of the mutation that created the histamine response, a second order effect that, while annoying to the individual, did not negatively impact the individual's likelihood of reproducing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it ease the itching if someone took antihistamines, like for against an allergic reaction? </p>
<p>I remember when we had the chickenpox as kids, we eventually used hair brushes to scratch, because the itching was so bad (ones with those rounded tips, but still…). Would also be good to know for a bad case of mosquito bites, for example.</p></div>		</li>
