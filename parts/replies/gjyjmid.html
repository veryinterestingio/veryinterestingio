			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to add about why breathing in crack is more bioavailable. It has to do with how quickly it can be absorbed by the body into the bloodstream. Snorted cocaine would have to cross through the membranes of the nasal passages which has a relatively limited surface area when compared to the immense surface area within the lungs. The lungs have a surface area of somewhere between 500 and 800 square feet and being able to absorb cocaine across such a large surface is what makes it more &quot;powerful&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, to start, nothing is ever in absolutes. There are varying degrees of solubility or what can referred to as polar(water soluble) and non polar (not water soluble). As a substance is more nonpolar, it is actually easier for it to traverse cellular membranes. A cellular membrane consists of a lipid bilayer in which the center of the sandwich is nonpolar with the sides being polar. This prevents polar substances from easily traversing the membranes without a transport system or a pore. Nonpolar substances can diffuse across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/Arcturus1981 explained it well enough below.      </p>
<p>the thing that gets cocaine from point A to B (when snorted) is the mucous area on your nose (actually the pockets sitting bellow your eyes, which i think would be your sinuses), from there it gets absorbed into your bloodstream (more or less, that's why there's a tingling/numbing effect on the nose/palate). you might swallow some of it (remember you're snorting it, think of it like forcing mucus/snot from your nose into your throat, which you will eventually swallow or spit) and it will get to your stomach/digestive tract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not much if any at all. The difference in size scale would be like saying how far a baseball can travel through the air vs a baseball stadium traveling through the air. Then whatever that does make it past the trachea would have to make it through the intricate maze that is your lungs. Imagine each molecule having to make a tight turn around a bend on a race track. A fat stadium sized piece of cocaine dust would slam into the wall of a juncture, never quite making it to the vast network of alveoli.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I think it's more that base forms of drugs (like crack) tend to be more soluble in fats whereas acid forms (like snorted coke) are more water soluble.  The fat solubility allows the drug to penetrate the blood brain barrier quicker having a more immediate effect on the brain (if you smoke something it may enter the body faster but still needs to get past the blood brain barrier). This makes it more addicting because it's easier to associate the action (taking a drug) with the reward (release of dopamine). Think of those psychology experiments where an animal presses a lever and then a food pellet drops. The closer the association between the lever press and food release the stronger the conditioning. However, the longer the delay before reward the weaker the conditioning becomes. So the immediacy of reward leads to stronger conditioning/addition (although other factors are at play also).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't disagree with your premise, but the idea that an ionizable compound will stay unionized after getting into a system with tightly controlled pH regimes (like blood) is poorly informed, at best. It's all about absorption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you suggesting that doing a drug such as, lets say meth, if one were to consume it orally swallowing some shards in a capsule, and thus taking a longer time for the effects to set in would be less addicting than say shooting, snorting, or smoking the same meth? Simply because the delay in the effects when you eat it? Just curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a great response, and leads me to a further question; how do coco puffs work (putting cocaine HCl in the end of a cigarette before smoking it)? Based on the people I know that use cocaine in its powder form and do that, I can’t imagine they are imagining the effects (knowing their self what the effects are from other forms of use) and seems pricey to waste if it didn’t work. </p>
<p>How would that provide a high if the cocaine HCl breaks down before nearing an evaporation point ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a different mechanism. Cocaine HCl starts to break down at its boiling point, which is roughly double that of water (but way lower than the temp tobacco burns at). I'm guessing here, but since Cocaine HCl is water soluble, it is probably dissolving into the water vapor that would be inhaled when smoking the cigarette. Or, since you drag on the cigarette while lighting, you are just pulling the crystals through... with some being inhaled directly and some being absorbed into the water vapor. </p>
<p>Also, nicotine has very similar effects to cocaine HCl. The combination of the two might compound and explain the increased rush users might feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer, and I’m thinking a likely hypothesis. I would not be surprised if those two  (three with the compounding tobacco effects) mechanisms cause the effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another possible mechanism is that combustion of organic compounds (tobacco for example) forms a lot of different products. I imagine some of these products are stronger bases than cocaine (a weak base) and function to convert the salt into a freebase which is then vaporized.</p></div>		</li>
