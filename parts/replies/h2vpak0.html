			<div class="markdown"><p>^ Exactly. The reason we call it a burn is it is similar in the kind of damage it causes. Heat causes cells to rupture due to steam, ice causes cells to rupture due to freezing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Proteins denature at temperatures less than the vapor point of water. Your cells do have “heat shock proteins” which can hold proteins together when it starts to get too hot, but at a certain point these fail too. </p>
<p>Some organisms are very well adapted with heat shock proteins, however, and can survive in extreme environments like hydrothermal vents.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They would most likely still happen. The expansion is &lt;10%, and the plasma membrane isn't like a sealed bottle ready to shatter. The problem is that the freezing forms a crystal that's jagged and ultimately injurious because of the manner in which the water molecules assemble into a near-rigid lattice. The membrane is no match for ice's sharp finger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have much to do with size changes, only crystallization. If you freeze water cold enough and fast enough ( to about −137 °C in less than 1/75 a second) the water freezes amorphously; it doesn't form crystals and therefor doesn't rupture the cell, but it still expands pretty much the same amount as normal ice. Cryoprotectants like glycerine interfer with waters crystallization and greatly reduce the speed needed for this, and are  required to make this practical with anything beyond a fine mist. Sperm, egg cells, and embryos are frozen by mixing them with glycerine and flash freezing them in narrow tubes dipped in a liquid nitrogen bath. More advanced cryoprotectants capable of flooding whole organs for long term storage are in development, with promising results in animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the result would be the same, as the ice crystals formed the cell would most likely contract due to a lower internal volume and the ice would just as easily rupture the membrane</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it freezes because &quot;cold&quot; is below the ambient equilibrium temp.  The substance that is cold absorbs energy to warm up from the object it touches.  The body cannot provide additional heat energy fast enough to overcome what's needed, so localized freezing occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a transfer of heat between any two bodies of different temperature which is proportional to the difference in temperature and other factors like the conductivity of each body. </p>
<p>Simple version is that if you put a molecule that’s vibrating a lot right next to a molecule that’s completely still, the vibrating one will bounce off the stationary one and provide it with energy, like bumper cars. Eventually both molecules are moving as much and we have equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blast freezers used in industrial frozen food production aim to freeze as rapidly as possible. The goal is to minimize the time the food spends within the temperature window for ice crystal growth. Smaller crystals do less mechanical cell damage. I once tried to home freeze some vegetables before I knew this. I was very disappointed, and confused, and curious!
The same principal is why liquid nitrogen freezing ice-cream in certain top end restaurants is more than a gimmick. Instant freezing makes nano crystals which make for smoother texture. You will find the opposite if you refreeze partially thawed ice-cream in a home freezer.</p></div>		</li>
