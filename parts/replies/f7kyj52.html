			<div class="markdown"><p>Most mountaineer I‚Äôve been around call it the ‚Äúscreaming mimi‚Äôs‚Äù although not sure of the exact spelling. Haha.  I have heard some use ‚Äúbarfies‚Äù too. I do know it hurts like fuuuuuuck. Took a glove off at 18k to fix a line for a few seconds. Hand went white and when the glove came back on it felt like someone had a blowtorch to my hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also sort of what Raynaud‚Äôs phenomenon/disease is. Except that with Raynauds, it can happen any time of day and sometimes for no real clear reason. Type 2 is typically associated with autoimmune diseases. It is unpleasant and annoying. Sometimes I have to wear mittens inside the house or tuck my hands into a heating pad, and it can trigger daily sometimes multiple times a day. I am on medication too. Just like wiith frostbite, people with Raynauds have to be aware as amputations do occur in severe cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine manifests in a few of my toes. It doesn't make them go clammy, rather I lose all sensation - not just thermal, but pressure, pain, etc. - I literally feel <em>nothing</em> from the affected digits. Mind, they also go <em>dead</em> white from the complete lack of blood flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine used to do this.. now they just go a sickening pale white color and I can not feel them. I can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù pressure on them like if I push them down into my shoe but that‚Äôs it. Its like the nerves go dead. I have actually tripped going up stairs from it. Way to faceplant and eat shit üòÇ</p></div>		</li>
