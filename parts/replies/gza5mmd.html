			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all childhood vaccines render lifetime immunity. For example, the effectiveness of the whooping cough vaccine wanes significantly after a few years. The old version of the vaccine induced a much longer immunity but it had greater side effects. So it was changed to improve its side effect profile but then effectiveness dropped a bit. Anyway, immunology is incredibly complicated. Inducing lasting immune memory so that the immune cells continue to make adequate number and type of antibodies is complicated and every type of bacteria/virus requires a different approach in attempt to induce immunity. I consider the human race very lucky that we figured out the COvid vaccine and made it effective. Source - I am a board certified pediatrician.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunity to the vaccinated/exposed strain IS likely to last decades. There is nothing special about COVID in that regard. The claim that the antibodies titres are going to decay to zero is not based on any scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The problem with COVID is protection against one variant doesn't guarantee immunity against other variants.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>While the current COVID-19 vaccines will likely last for at least about a year, they probably won’t offer lifelong protection, as with measles shots, said Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be somewhere in the middle of that very wide range,” she said.</p>
<p>Variants are another reason we might need an additional shot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Granted that is one person, but to say it is likely to last decades seems premature since we have very little information on these particular vaccines regarding time.</p>
<p>There is also no scientific evidence that it will last decades either. </p>
<p>Remember current effectiveness is against symptoms, so after some point you could contract covid with symptoms but it would be far less severe as the vaccine effectiveness drops.  Right now it is 6 months because that is all the data we have.  We will know more as time moves on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a pretty common phenomenon where respiratory viruses, including several coronas, don't tend to give us long term immunity.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unclear at this stage, it depends on factors such as mutation rate and how &quot;optimized&quot; the current strains are.</p>
<p>It is entire plausible that COVID becomes a seasonal disease, but there are also reasons to think it will not (and a lot of reason to HOPE it will not!). We simply don't know yet. FYI, even in a seasonal scenario, my guess is that boosters every 6 months seems unlikely -- the schedule would likely be longer.</p>
<p>I have another post in this thread that touches upon duration of immunity in a bit more detail, it might provide more context for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's entirely possible that a vaccine or prior infection which doesn't protect you against infection anymore will still protect against severe disease.  There are several common cold coronaviruses which circulate in the population and cause mild disease usually, but might be more deadly if you caught them for the first time as an adult.</p></div>		</li>
