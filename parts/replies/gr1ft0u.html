			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydraulics are great because if the system loses power, all the valves close and everything just stops moving. I worked at a factory for a summer a couple of years ago and working under gigantic hydraulic presses when they were raised was making me nervous until one of the maintainers completely disconnected the valves and said &quot;there's no way that thing can possibly move, so don't worry about it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you were understandably nervous.  Your co-worker was relying on the valves to seal properly.  A failed o-ring could ruin his day.</p></div>		</li>

I suppose the spring could fail, but the springs were visible, so it was pretty easy to see if they had failed. There were also multiple valves controlling fluid flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You were right to be nervous and that guy was dead wrong. Valves can leak, you guys should have put some schedule 80 steel pipes beneath the press to hold it up. That's what we do when working on elevators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. They are cheaper to installer and maintain, but more expensive to operate. So they are typically installed in buildings with lower passenger volumes. </p>
<p>A cable elevator has a counter weight which balances the elevator cab. This means the motor only needs to lift the difference between counter weight and the loaded cab, which is the weight of the passengers. </p>
<p>A hydraulic elevator needs to lift the weight of the cab and passengers each time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am coming away with more questions from having read this. </p>
<p>1). What system did the WTC have?  I took the express all the time and that thing left the ground like a cannon. </p>
<p>2). My dads friend died in a falling elevator. (Not WTC). How could that have happened?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. More height requires the more complex counterweight and pulley systems.</p></div>		</li>
