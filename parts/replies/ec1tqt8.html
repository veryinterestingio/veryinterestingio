			<div class="markdown"><p>As a pediatric endocrinologist, I see a lot of patients with type 1 diabetes. I think the biggest change in the near future is the tremendous advances in technology. I anticipate that within a few years, everyone will have access to continuous glucose monitor technology and that these will be seamlessly connected to insulin pumps or artificial pancreas technologies. I also think that there will be a lot more virtual interaction between medical providers and patients with doctors and nurses reviewing blood sugar data in the cloud. We need to get away from a hospital/office based model for our interactions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gene therapy is going to be tricky with type 1 diabetes since there isn't a single gene defect in type 1. It is an autoimmune disease with multiple genetic variants that increase one's risk. Gene therapy could fix certain genetic forms of diabetes (i.e. MODY) but then researchers will need to figure out how to get the corrected gene into the beta cells which is not an easy task. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The increase in type 2 diabetes is very worrisome. This is a true epidemic. The number of children being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is rapidly rising, reflecting the current obesity epidemic. Also, we know that type 2 diabetes in children is more aggressive than in adults. See <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/two-diabetes-medications-dont-slow-progression-type-2-diabetes-youth" target="_blank">https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/two-diabetes-medications-dont-slow-progression-type-2-diabetes-youth</a> . Unfortunately, this means that we need to be more aggressive in treating and preventing type 2 diabetes in children before they suffer the complications as young adults. I think bariatric surgery is going to play a larger role in treatment until we can figure out the hormonal mechanisms that are underlying the improvements seen with surgery and can better target those mechanisms. </p></div>		</li>
