<p>The moderna vaccine (and also Pfizer's I think) skip the viral vector step and directly introduce the mRNA encoding for the spike protein into your cells via some other delivery method (which I dont know about but sounds hard since mRNA is readily degraded outside cells). </p>

<p>IIRC they use a type of lipid encapsulation to protect the mRNA after administration. Similar encapsulation platforms have been used for GTx programs. There are some pitfalls in the GTx context like how the lipid falls apart, but in the Vaccine context it mostly matters that the vector is non-immunogenic since you're injecting it right into your target (muscle) tissue and you don't really need to worry about optimizing for perfect on-target transfection.</p>

<p>I would not really consider this to be the case as there are no approved adenovirus vector vaccines available to date, though there is a live adenovirus vaccine that sees limited use by the military.</p>
<p>I've never worked with an adenovirus vector personally, but off the top of my head I could see there being significant immunological safety issues . Specifically, if you have an existing antibody titer against the adenovirus vector that could provoke a lifethreatening immune response.</p>
<p>Thus far, that fear seems somewhat borne out in the Phase 1/2 trial where a small percentage of the patients in both the Low and Medium dose groups experienced Grade 3 Fevers. It's not unreasonable to expect that as you scale that from 10s of people to 10s of thousands that outlier individuals will experience Grade 4 (life-threatening) Fever, presumably due to vector immunogenicity. This also most likely makes a booster shot impractical.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Grade 3 symptoms in both the Pfizer and Moderna trials were limited to muscle aches and chills in the Low/Moderate dose groups, primarily occuring after the second &quot;booster&quot; dose; which is actually a good thing because it's a sign of your immune system responding to the viral protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Oxford vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus so that people have no preexisting immunity. Interestingly in their study with the 10 prime-boost patients, the symptoms after the second shot seemed to be lesser in comparison to the first shot (which is kinda the opposite of what we'd expect). I wonder what's going on there.</p>
<p>Also a bit of an immune response to the vector is probably a good thing so that it stimulates inflammation and gets antigen presenting cells to take up the spike protein fragments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder what will happen if they use that vector later on for other vaccines. A too strong response to the vector may prevent the vector from working again or increase the required dose with all the safety implications of that. While there are enough different animal adenoviruses around, I don't think using that many of them is a good idea regarding safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What keeps the mRNA vaccines from being presented as self antigens? Like with the adenovirus vaccine your body is recognizing that it’s a virus and presenting the spike antigen, but unless I’m missing something the mRNA being given would be presented on APCs but what keeps it from being presented at self? I think there is a celiac treatment that actually works pretty similar to that in trials</p></div>		</li>

<p>First, mRNA vaccine doesn't mean immune response is elicited against mRNA. The mRNA enters the host, gets translated into proteins and the proteins (peptides) are presented as antigens. Also &quot;antigen&quot; presenting cells don't present genetic material (DNA/RNA) they only present antigens which are peptide (proteins). Plus antigen presenting cells don't differentiate between self antigen (misfolded proteins for example) and foreign antigen (pathogenic). Their job is only to present antigen and co-stimulatory signals. It's the job of B-cells and T-cells to recognize whether the antigen is self or foreign. When B-cells or T-cells come in contact with the antigen, they will recognize whether its our own antigen as they learn to differentiate between self antigens and foreign antigens when they develop.</p></div>		</li>
