			<div class="markdown"><p>Because decay is a random process, half life means:</p>
<p>After this time passed, we expect that only half of it remains.</p>
<p>So of 1000kg uranium, after 1 million years 500kg will be left.
After another million years, that will be halved again to 250kg</p></div>		</li>
