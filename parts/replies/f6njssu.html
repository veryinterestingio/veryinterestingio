			<div class="markdown"><p>My cat digs all the dirt out of my plants, knocks things of shelves, and knocks over glasses of water when heâ€™s bored. And heâ€™s bored pretty much any time youâ€™re not actively playing with him.
And then my other cat sits in the same spot for 72 hours. I just want an in between ðŸ˜­</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey my male cat also digs the dirt out of my plants. It's the first time I have a cat that does this and I was kinda worried. First time I have cats full time indoors (with large balcony terrasse though) in a flat. I was thinking that it was some natural attraction to digging dirt as he otherwise is pretty calm, affective and overall very cute and not destructive at all. His sister doesn't do it either.</p>
<p>I guess cats just develop their own personality and weird habits. Even if you educate both in exactly the same way haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lolol cats are so odd. I'm sooooo lucky mine leaves all of the plants alone (there's tons). We recently have had great success walking him in a leash! Except it's at night and he loves to loiter in dark alleys or inaide the bush under someone's window. Makes us look sketchy af.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds scary haha. I get a very adorable little tap on the arm from the ground near the couch that catches me off guard. The first one is gentle. The next one...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha sounds like he starts by asking politely before going full crazy cat style. Mine directly goes into the full power nose to nose headbutt. To this day I don't know what happens if I don't obey after the first one... and at this point I'm to afraid to ask !</p></div>		</li>
