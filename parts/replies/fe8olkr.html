			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that 470mpg/ton?  </p>
<p>As in, if a 100 ton train is traveling 470 miles, it will consume 100 gallons of fuel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  They are incredibly fuel efficient.</p>
<p>But don't let that statistic lie to you.  If you had an engine and a single car behind it, lets say 10 tons, it wouldn't get nearly the same efficiency as a train with 100 10-ton cars behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m presuming it’s because of the engine running at certain RPMs which are close to under max load, fuel being injected at close to the same amounts, etc.  </p>
<p>Basically that it’s still producing almost all of that power, but it’s only using 10% of it while still incurring those higher costs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Which is pretty good, although not stunning: your typical semi truck hauls 40t of cargo at 6mpg, for 240 mpg/t. </p>
<p>The train offers other efficiencies, though. 2 engineers drive the equivalent of 300 semis, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for confirming that for me.  Trains are exceptionally neat.  The sheer amount of material they can haul is mind-boggling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it's 470 ton-mpg (ton-miles per gallon), not mpg/ton.</p></div>		</li>
