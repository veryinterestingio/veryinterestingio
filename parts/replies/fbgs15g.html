			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluorination is the process that enables plastic containers to be used to package many different chemicals and solvents that otherwise could only be packaged in glass. Without fluorination, plastic containers can panel, distort, and lead to product deterioration.</p>
<p>Essentially fluoropolymers create a barrier around plastics to give the plastic resistance to things it may not normally be resistant to, like acids for example.  That resistance in turn makes it difficult for standard adhesives (made of chemicals) to stick to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it’s much harder to make good clear packaging tapes than it is to make brown ones.  Tackifying resins are typically brown.  The ones that aren’t, don’t have the same properties and usually don’t stick as well.</p></div>		</li>
