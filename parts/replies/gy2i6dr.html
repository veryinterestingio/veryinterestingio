			<div class="markdown"><p>Every crypto but Monero could be traced since the beginning. The issue is trying to tie the wallets to the owner. But quite a lot of crypto developers will flag wallets of known hackers so that it can be extremely easy to track illegally made money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, ransom is usually paid in Bitcoin. It's more important that the victim knows what you're talking about and that they can find (read: google) a way to get some coins than the coins being untrackable. The attackers are usually sitting in safe places anyway.</p>
<p>Monero is used on the dark web a lot, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, bitcoin is still pseudonymous and as long as you don't have a big criminal network, using bitcoin is still fine for them. It only starts getting problematic for them if they have connections to other criminal activities. If one group gets busted and transactions of other criminals can get linked together with you - that's where it starts to get problematic. If ransomers only use their wallet to collect ransoms and then wash the money, it doesn't really matter which currency they use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small ransomware is usually paid in Bitcoin, you're right. Because they can just rely on it being too difficult for a US company to chase down a Russian address for a $50,000 payout; but big ransoms are being demanded in Monero now.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most important thing for them is to not bring the crypto assets into their name. One way of doing this is to trade those coins for cash. There are some sites that offer this type of service. You send them the crypto, they send you cash via usps or something. However the hacker needs to trust those exchanges. Another option is to make so many transactions, it becomes Shere impossible to trace those coins. This way the hacker needs to be careful as the government is able to look at your online bank account. So you'll need a good reasonsing on where you got your money from.</p></div>		</li>
