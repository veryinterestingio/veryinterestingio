			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. The kind of commercial energy reactors we build today also lend themselves greatly to production of weapons material. So it is encouraged by the U.S. Government. If we didn't give a shit about making nuclear weapons, we'd have much better, safer, more efficient nuclear reactors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Light water reactors can easily synthesize suitable isotopes for weapons production.</p>

<p>This is a big part of why in the USA and USSR, uranium is used.  And since the USA was one of the largest exporters of nuclear power plants, the rest of the world went along with their design sooner than create their own from scratch.</p>
<p>Canada went the heavy water route, and their design has some advantages, but when a foreign government can purchase a heavy water plant or a light water plant, and the light water has the advantage of being easily (sort of) able to create weapons-grade uranium and plutonium, they went with the american design (plus it was usually cheaper).  Canada's Can-Do reactors never sold well, and they scrapped pretty much all research into new designs able to burn Thorium as a result.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Canada has cornered the market on certain radioactive isotopes, as their breeder plant at Chalk River is one of a very few (almost unique) plants that are capable of breeding certain isotopes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary reason why the CANDU was developed was twofold. Canada had plenty of uranium, but not the enrichment infrastructure, and also did not have the heavy manufacturing capability required to make the large pressure vessels needed for a PWR. One of the early CANDU reactors actually had one side of the calandra replaced with oil filled glass so that the reactor core could be directly observed. The main part of the reactor operates at atmospheric pressure.</p></div>		</li>
