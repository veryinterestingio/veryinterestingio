			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, &quot;roughly&quot; the speed of light means something around <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_factor" target="_blank">58-99%</a> the speed of light. In a coaxial cable, I used as a rule of thumb that the speed of electricity was about 66% the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. You can test this with a pulse generator, oscilloscope, and coaxial cable. Back in university, we did a lab like this and we got around 66% the speed of light. Cool lab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say 66% the speed of light are you refering to the speed of light in a vacuum or the speed of light in whatever metal is the conductor in a coax cable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cool note;  in superconductors it can be very slow because of something called kinetic inductance.  You can pretty easily make transmission lines with propagation velocities that are like 10% of C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind, could you expand on what you mean when you say the waves are &quot;transmitted through the electrons?&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: All your responses have been wonderful, but unfortunately my question might not have been as clear as I'd hoped. What I was most curious about was what the actual electrons are doing when a wave passes through them, not how wave propagation works in general. Nevertheless, I am grateful to anyone who took the time to respond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but to give an analogy - it is similar to how sound waves move through air. The speed of sound (in air at sea level) is about 765 mph or 1,235 km/h. However the air itself isn’t moving that fast, the speed of sound measures the speed waves of pressure that we hear. You could think of electricity as waves of electrical charge propagating through electrons similar to how sound is waves of pressure propagating through the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A professor of mine gave a good analogy: imagine having a very long hose, filled with marbles. When you put an additional marble in the hose, all the other marbles move forward relatively slowly, but the end marble falls out almost instantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a wave moving on the ocean. A wave might move for miles and miles, but that doesn't mean a bunch of water molecules have moved from point A to point B, which are separated by a mile. You get some pushing against others, which push against the next, which... and the end result is the movement of a &quot;wave&quot; but not the actual water molecules. Same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a garden hose, you turn on the water and water comes out the other end instantly. This isn't because the water moved through the hose very quickly. It's because the hose was already filled with water and so as soon as you turn it on a wave of pressure flows through the hose and pushes the water out the other side. </p>
<p>When electricity moves through an object, the electrons don't move very fast but they react with each other very fast so the electromagnetic wave moves through the object quickly.</p>
<p>In this analogy, the a metallic object is the hose, the electrons are the water and the electromagnetic wave is the pressure.</p></div>		</li>
