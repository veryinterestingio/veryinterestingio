<p>In order to bond to the glass, the surface is treated and acts as an intermediate layer between the glass and the adhesive/sealant (well and reliably) to keep the glass on your car and keep the elements out. </p>
<p>The lines that go across the back glass are heater elements that defrost the rear glass by heating it just slightly. You can also find this on fixed rear side windows as well. </p>
<p>Additionally, some cars have heating bands on the wind screen underneath the wipers to help defrost them in frosty conditions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have dots on my windshield around the rearview mirror (which I notice because that's where I want to put my dashcam, but the dots make it so that the suction cup won't stick). What are those for? They're in a thin line (~1/2&quot;) along the top, but then drop down in a trapezoid shape (like this: \__/) behind the mirror. Are those the frits referred to by m3atcurt4ins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are a new form of &quot;shading&quot; that is done by the manufacturer. Instead of applying a tint as an additional manufacturing step, they chose to put those &quot;dots&quot; in to help reduce the amount of sun that enters the cabin. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, things like suction cups don't stick to them ?</p></div>		</li>
