			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a disease would be devastating.</p>
<p>But with ~7 billion humans on the planet, very unlikely you'll get a disease with 100% mortality rate. Some people will have some immunity and they will survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabies mortality is pretty damn close to 100% if not given early prophylaxis. We are talking llike 10-20 cases of survival, and that's with aggressive medical care that may not be possible, and that's with neurological sequlae that may not permit long-term survival even if the illness itself is survived. </p>
<p>Now, infectivity is not 100%, so not everyone with even a high-risk exposure will develop disease. But for a hypothetical disease with extremely high infectivity that would not be the case. </p>
<p>I suppose we may be missing some people who were truly infected and fought off the virus themselves early and never developed evidence of disease and so were never diagnosed but would be immune going forward.</p>
<p>(Edit: however, there are some extremely isolated individuals and populations, some of which who might never be exposed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, some isolated small pockets of humanity might avoid the virus. Perhaps scientists in the arctic, for instance.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> I mean, they'd starve and die if the rest of the world was gone, but there might be other more self-sustaining groups out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very likely true. It would be like zombie apocalypse movies where human civilization collapses. With such high mortality rate, there will be only few people left to restore human civilization. Hopefully, their immunity can transfer to their offsprings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically the winning strategy for Plague, Inc. Make a disease that isn't deadly at all for a year, and has no symptoms. Then just as it is getting everywhere, suddenly flip on the deadly switch, killing the whole world. </p>
<p>The good news is, it'd be really hard to make that work in practice. Also, there are enough people that are isolated enough that it wouldn't be the end of humanity. Still, it'd be a very very bad day...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why Plague, Inc. isn't realistic is because an infectious agent does not evolve as a singular entity.  If a virus becomes more lethal, then that particular strain is effectively starting from scratch - it needs to re-infect, and possibly even compete with its predecessor, in order to spread.</p>
<p>It would be like sneaking a trojan horse into every castle in (insert European country here), then if one of them mutates into a battle tank, it's not like every other trojan horse also simultaneously mutates into a battle tank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the worst transgressions of plauge inc is the weird idea that that game has that if a new strain of desease mutates, all of the viruses/bateria/fungus now have that trait. In reality if a strain of virus suddenly developed the ability to cause total organ failure, that strain would only start with one person and you'd have to reinfecte the entire world. And anyone that was already sick with the non-deadly strain would pretty much be immune</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a strategy that usually works, in normal mode, depending on the pathogen - but it won't get you high score mega brutal difficulty wins. Also bad to let something spread to other countries without a few symptoms, because with no or too few symptoms you miss out on points to use for mutations.</p>
<p>If you wanna win with a really high score, or beat mega brutal versions of certain scenarios or with certain pathogens, you have to start killing before it's even finished entering every country. Like, total organ failure before your map is even mostly red, and hoping it works out. Gotta find that razor thin edge of just enough deadliness to wipe everyone out as fast as you can, without burning out before you infect everyone, and hitting fast and hard enough that you can keep the cure percentage low. It can be a real pain in the ass depending on scenario/pathogen.</p>
<p>The method you describe is the safe, but slow and low scoring way to go about things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that was the case with the 1918 flu. </p>
<p>The key to how well something can spread is how long a host can be simultaneously 'healthy enough to function' and capable of spreading the disease.</p>
<p>For the common cold (ignoring years with an active pandemic), this is basically the entire duration of the illness unless you are in the minority who get bedridden by the disease. This is why it is such a successful virus.</p>
<p>To take an absolute counterexample to your point though - consider HIV back in 1985, when it was a death sentence to contract the disease (CFR &gt; 80%, and the only reason it wasn't 100% was that some people caught it then died of an unrelated reason before HIV/AIDS killed them).</p>
<p>Despite a CFR in the stratosphere, it still spread worldwide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be slightly more specific, it's the fast-acting high-fatality diseases that kill off their hosts before those hosts have a chance to infect other people. A virus like HIV can have incredibly high fatality rate without modern medication, but even then that's only over the span of years. You could easily live 1-5 years without any medication, which is a lot of time to pass it on to other people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of the 1918 flu, World War I played a role in the spread of the disease.  Governments were more concerned with winning a war than fighting disease.  Soldiers were grouped together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a bit over-simplifying a very nuanced topic with multiple factors.</p>
<p>Fatality of a disease is not the only determinant in whether a disease is able to spread.</p>
<p>Take time for example: A disease with a high case fatality rate might have a low mortality rate, because the disease kills 9 out of every 10 infected, but does so over a long period of time.</p>
<p>We cannot assume that all high-fatality diseases have short infection windows. We have to be vigilant in case one day, there's a disease that's 100% fatal, but only kills a patient after a very long incubation period where the patient has spread it to everyone they've met in every country they traveled to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always. HIV is an example of the worst of all worlds. 100% fatality, but a long incubation period allowing it to spread. Imagine if HIV spread through coughs instead of fluids.</p></div>		</li>
