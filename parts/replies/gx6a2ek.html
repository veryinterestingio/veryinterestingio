			<div class="markdown"><p>While I do believe you correctly identified the cause, I think it is worth discussing the processes at play.  While many people have already mentioned the higher prevalence of exposed bedrock due to glaciers, and how this aids the longevity of a crater, there are certainly other factors at play.  There are plenty of examples of craters in other regions of the earth, as well as deep pits that formed from non-astronomical sources that aren't filled with water.  So where do these lakes get their water?  Even in the wettest regions of earth you will never fill a lake with rainwater alone.  At the very least you will need a large amount of runoff from surrounding areas.  Snow melt, and glacial melt, are better sources for filling lakes, since liquid water evaporates much faster than ice sublimates, allowing for a larger buildup of water rapidly entering the lake.</p></div>		</li>

<p>More land, more lakes. There's more land in the northern hemisphere, more ocean in the southern.</p></div>		</li>
