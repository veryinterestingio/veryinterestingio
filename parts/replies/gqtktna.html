			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to generalize, infection and disease can be thought of as a three-part equation, with the three parts being the individual, the pathogen, and the environment. You can have a fairly resistant individual but challenge them with a very big pathogen dose (a toddler coughs in their face) in a bad environment (low airflow, low humidity) and that might override the immunity. Or the dose and environment might be middling but the individual might have missed sleep and be mildly immune suppressed. And so on. It would be unusual to have a single simple issue to point at - most often it would be some combination of everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand your point, but I seriously doubt that birth control has manufacturing defect levels anywhere near approaching single digit percentages. I would expect defects (out of spec) on the order of one part per million, and would still expect out of spec pills to be effective most of the time (e.g., 1.06 mg in the pill instead of 1.00 +/-5%). I expect the issue is the person forgetting to take their pills 90+% of the time, and other forms of human error (wrong dose prescribed or filled, drug interactions, etc.) For almost all of the remaining cases.</p>
<p>I don't work in pharma manufacturing and can't seem to find the answer online, so it would be good to get confirmation from someone with better knowledge. But in my industry, which is less critical to health than pharma, defects must be in the low ppm level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're exactly right - human error, the tangible part of technical error. Forgot to take it, lied about taking it, intentionally tampered with, whatever. All could realistically fit. We've already heard about underdosing in the field (LA last week) and spoiled doses ((TX maybe?) how much did that happen in the field and go unreported? Did anyone lie about other treatments they were receiving?</p>
<p>At 95%+ effective, we start to get near the territory of &quot;someone fucked up&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
