			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually have an appointment with a dermatologist coming up because I've got some moles that concerned my doctor at my last check up (and skin cancer runs in my family, yay). </p>
<p>So I'm not looking forward to that, but I have to admit, &quot;thinking about whether they should be cancer when they grow up&quot; cracked me up. Now I need to find an excuse to use that sentence during my appointment.</p></div>		</li>
