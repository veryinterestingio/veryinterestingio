			<div class="markdown"><p>They are starting to forecast flu variants similar to how modeling is used in weather forecasting. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwTjWAkW_Ko" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>The flu vaccination is a cocktail targeting a limited number of variants to keep costs of manufacture down so this kind of info is used to select strains with the highest likelihood for a given flu season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the CDC is reporting here is within-year variation. When looking at the evolution and movement of influenza strains across years, the strains mix pretty much completely on a global scale every 2-4 years. In other words, which strain was dominant in your neck of the woods this year, doesn't predict which strain will be dominant two or three years from now. So there shouldn't really be &quot;local strains&quot; in the sense OP is asking about that would strongly affect someone who moves from one country to another.</p>
<p>I'm only speaking of influenza, though, since that's the only virus whose evolution I have much knowledge of. It's possible that cold viruses are different and do have more persistent local strains, though offhand I can't really think of why that would be the case.</p></div>		</li>
