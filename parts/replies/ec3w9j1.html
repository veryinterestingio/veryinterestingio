			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I believe this based on the fact I was 2 and have no memories prior to that incident. While all of my eidetic memories seem to have been retained over time, they are triggered less and less. My ability to form them automatically has also faded somewhat though I do have a day here and there in which I still close my eyes and see my entire day playing back to me in film-like sequence from wake to sleep.</p>
