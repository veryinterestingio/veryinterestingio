<p>Me: There is no true speed, and there is no universal fixed point. We can only ever measure movement in relation to something. This is sometimes called Newtonian relativity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which dictates that physics have to work at any reference frame. If you’re on a train going a constant speed and throw a ball up it must come right back down like normal. If you’re on that same train and shine a flashlight it must go the speed of light like normal, relative to you. In order for it to not go faster for a stationary observer, each person’s experience of time is affected at the perfect rate such that light moves at the speed of light for both of them. </p>
<p>And so Galilean Relativity leads us to time dilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. Acceleration is absolute and always has been. That is you can only apply these ideas to an inertial observer, since acceleration is not relative. Either you are accelerating or you are not. Its velocity and position which are relative.</p></div>		</li>
