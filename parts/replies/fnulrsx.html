			<div class="markdown"><p>Also just a little sense of security coming from someone in med school. Doctors, well mainly any medical staff knows that a lot of what goes on in the body, to the average bear, is gross. But its not really tmi for your doctor, RN, LPN, etc. Trust me we heard it all in med school and the last thing that we want to do is make you uncomfortable to tell us whats really wrong out of embarrassment. Its one profession where we prefer tmi to tli (too little info). As gross as it may be the more detailed you are the more it helps. Categorically a lot of similar illnesses have a number of the same symptoms except for the specific unique symptoms.</p>
<p>Edit: to even prove the point of how details help a little more, because even illnesses that aren't in the same family that aren't even very similar can have general kind of common symptoms, honestly the details that you think mean nothing could mean a lot more than you think, remember that doctor spent 8 years researching all of this, its those little nuances that separate diagnosis. Okay TED talk over thank you for attending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a simple on/off switch. Things like a UTI/bladder infection can cause an &quot;urge to go&quot;, as can swings in blood sugar. There's a bunch of other things that can do it too, including medication side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that these can all be causes of increased urinary frequency, but generally there will be other symptoms that come along with it than just an increase in bathroom breaks. And believe it or not, if you read one of my other posts, I mention how the PNS, peripheral nervous system, actually is an on/off switch that your body flips in response to your fight or flight response. So you're right in the sense that you can't necessarily force your body to do that, but there is, situationally a master switch to halt all bathroom breaks and meals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Med student here. Your urinary tract has 2 circular discs made of muscle that wrap around your urethra. Those are called sphincters, you have 2 for your urethra and 2 for your colon. That's why when you get the urge to use the bathroom you can ignore it, the initial urge is your internal (closer to the bladder) sphincter opening which you have no control over. That is an involuntary muscle. The external sphincter you have control over and thats you not pissing your pants. Long story short your body can ignore the signal its just on you to do it not automatic nervous response. Hope I explained it well enough for yall.</p>
<p>Edit: didn't realize I only halfway answered. You get that urge and only urinate a small amount because that's the minimum amount of fluid required to send a signal to the brain that there's pressure on the internal sphincter so its needs to open. I believe its somewhere around 50-100 ml I'm not sure its been about a year since I've taken anatomy and my books are somewhere not being found tonight. Lol. I could be a little wrong, I'm still a student but I'm pretty sure that should answer everything.</p>
<p>Edit 2: phrasing.</p>
<p>Edit 3: if anyone had wondered the 2 sphincters that control your colon work the exact same way, the internal is involuntary muscle and the external voluntary muscle. The human body has quite the conscientious design in some aspects. Itd be rather scary to go out in public if you had no control over when you were gonna go to the bathroom imo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tbf if no one had control then it wouldn't be scary, society would accommodate it.</p>
<p>Interesting example: guinea pigs can control when/where they pee, and can supposedly be taught to pee on paper, but they just poop wherever.  They don't even seem to notice.  A guinea pig society would overlook pooping in the street.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd still be scary, we would've never gotten rid of the bubonic plague. It literally came about because there was no sewage system so everyone shit in the streets or in alleys. It ended up infecting the rats which eventually spread it to humans and we all know the rest. Maybe not embarrassing but scary nonetheless</p></div>		</li>
