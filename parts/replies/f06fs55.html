			<div class="markdown"><p>My therapist told me when I first confessed to automatically thinking about killing myself anu time shit went wrong that it's possible that I didn't actually want to die; I just wanted the situation to end. Whether it was the pain or shame or disappointment in myself or just not being where I needed to be in life. </p>
<p>I'm not quite all the way there yet but I'm learning that I CAN change my life. And it doesnt have to end to get what I want</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you first admitted to wanting to self harm to a professional, did they immediately move to institutionalize you? I feel like there may be people out there who need to be able to have an open conversation about whatâ€™s going on, but the fear of hospitalization feeds into what they see as a stigma and it keeps them silent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideation and planning are very different. Fantasizing about an end to your suffering is typically not grounds for involuntary institutionalization afaik. I think that a decent therapist would only take action to hospitalize you against your will if they think you are likely to actually follow through on the fantasy. Suicidal ideation is a lot more common than a lot of people realize and a lot of people who have the fantasy never go any further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where does this happen? I've seen multiple therapists and doctors over the years for this, and made somewhat of an attempt, but not once has an institution even been discussed. I'm curious if you asked that question because that is a standard approach where you are. I'm in Australia, by the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter's 22 year old boyfriend of 5 years took his own life in July.  He planned it meticulously and did not warn anyone.  He had just graduated from college and had his whole life ahead of him, but he and my daughter were breaking up. I wish that he could have seen or experienced what you say here.  I am so devastated that he was in so much pain that he thought this was the only way out.  I couldn't help but wonder and think about how he overrode the instinct for survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've experienced the same thing and I feel like you said it very well. Even at my worst, I was just as scared of death as anyone else, I was just experiencing so much depression and physical illness that death seemed like the lesser of two evils. It's not that death itself is appealing, it's that life can become so bad that death, as scary as it, actually seems less scary than living in that kind of pain for any longer.</p></div>		</li>
