<p>What would be some reasons that a developer choose to make a program native to Linux over Windows instead? I assume Linux native programs don't run on Windows unless they're also developed to allow it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason both are rarely supported is simple. Money and marketshare. And No. You generally cannot take a GUI linux program and run it on Windows. Adding support for Linux is much more difficult to do after you've already written the game for Windows speficially. You can keep like 95% of the game code the same but need to substitute windows only libraries <strong>If you don't know. Libraries are sets of files that contain specific functions that are commonly used when writing a program</strong> with opensource ones. When it'd have been easier to use opensource libraries to start with since they usually work on Linux, Windows, And sometimes MacOS. This would also make it much easier for your program to run on cpu types like ARM or RISC-V in the future because the libraries could be compiled on those architectures.</p>
<p>There is different versions of the Opensource Libraries for each platform <strong>Like OpenGL and SDL2</strong> that all have the same functions that do the same thing. But handle them differently so it'll actually work as intended on the platform you're using.  That'll <strong>usually</strong> allow you to port your game to Linux and have it atleast work within a few days and much less effort than converting a program that used things like the <strong>WindowsAPI</strong> and <strong>DirectX.</strong></p></div>		</li>
