			<div class="markdown"><p>IDK about bigger transformers...they rectify the line voltage to SELV (typically 5 -12 V).  However, they need higher current which means greater power dissipated which means a bigger heat sink.</p>
<p>Edit: <em>Crudely speaking, the Capaicty of Transformer increases as Fourth Power of Linear Dimension.</em> So to expand a little bit you won't need a transformer to be much bigger going from phone to laptop charger to get the capacity needed </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transformer size is related to power. IIRC the area of a transformer's core follows A=sqrt(Ps), with Ps being the power on the secondary. As laptops require more power than phones, the charger will need a bigger transformer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can think of a few reasons why your old power brick would be larger.</p>
<p>A big one is, electronic components have been trending toward being smaller and more power-efficient, while performing the same function. Smaller saves space on the circuit, so you can fit the power circuit in a smaller box. Power efficiency means you can do the same job while producing less heat -- less heat means  you need a less-beefy cooling solution, again letting the overall charger housing become smaller.</p>
<p>Likewise, the components in the display he is using might be using more efficient components. Even the same overall display technology implemented with newer parts could have a smaller circuit. (So both the power brick and display might get a bit more efficient or smaller just from using newer parts.)</p>
<p>What would make a huge difference would be which display technologies you are both using. If you have a big, blocky monitor, it's probably a CRT or some other technology that shoots electron beams at the front panel of your screen. These are really power-hungry. By contrast, flat-panel displays are all much more power-sipping. Flat panel screens usually have a backlight of LEDs instead of lighting the front with electron beams. (There's more to it than that which I'm not expert enough to explain, but Technology Connections on YouTube does a great job of explaining all the nitty-gritty details.)</p>
<p>If his display is a lot more efficient, his display might not need to draw as much power in the first place, so his power brick can be a less heavy-duty design.</p>
<p>Lastly, some older hardware was over-engineered to last a lifetime. Modern tech has been influenced by a trend toward the minimum expense of manufacturing (and in some ways the minimum quality) that consumers will buy. But this is a bit less technical and more &quot;the economy&quot; so I can't really be 100% sure how much that plays into it.</p>
<p>On another note, almost every household device has to convert from AC wall power to DC power, and to a lower-voltage than wall power. This power conversion can happen anywhere between the wall and the device, usually at the wall plug in a small brick (often nicknamed a &quot;wall wart&quot;)... On a brick with a cord on both ends (like many laptop chargers)... Or inside the device being powered.</p>
<p>So it's possible your boyfriend's monitor has a little circuit that converts power inside the screen housing.</p></div>		</li>
