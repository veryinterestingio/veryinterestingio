			<div class="markdown"><p>You're comparing grams to litres here. 1 gram may be equivalent to 24 litres but it doesn't tell me the volume of 1 gram in comparison, and the weight is going to be the same no matter what state it's in. 1 gram compressed into an ingot or 1 gram spread all over the room as a gas is still 1 gram.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The weight of the hydrogen is the same, but the weight of the container needed is going to decrease, thus increasing the fuel to weight ratio overall</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1g of hydrogen is roughly 6x10^23 atoms. So however much space is required to hold that many atoms as a solid is the volume.</p>
<p>Lithium (the least dense solid at room temperature and pressure) takes about 1.87cc to hold one gram, and it's roughly 7x as dense as hydrogen, atom for atom. So assuming the same packing efficiency, you can figure that storing metallic hydrogen will take around 13cc per gram.<br />
Edit: Given the compression that would be necessary to get it to a metallic state, it could  take significantly less room. Or the bonding may end up being some weird crystalline structure, and it could take more. We just don't know. </p>
<p>As the other poster said, we don't know for sure, because nobody has observed it in a way that we can measure it effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The import thing to note is that just having solid hydrogen doesn't gain you anything in the field of rocketry. 100 kg of metallic hydrogen is just as hard to lift to orbit as 100 kg of liquid hydrogen. </p>
<p>On top of that liquids are much vastly easier to manage and to pump into an engine. The only time solids are on par for ease of use if the rocket is not designed to be reused.</p>
<p>The benefit comes from having more energy available in a given mass, as for rockets the mass you have to bring with you (fuel+structure) greatly determines how hard it is to move the rocket around.</p></div>		</li>
