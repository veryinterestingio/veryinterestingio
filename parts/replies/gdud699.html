<p>From what I can tell, it’s something that’s instilled in you based on your positive care-taker figures growing up. Like, not neccesarilly your parents, but the people you form a positive emotional bond with growing up, who take care of you. You are attracted to similar characteristics because these are the characteristics of people who, not only you can form positive bonds with and are good to be around, but are also capable of raising children.</p>
<p>An example of this is how people who grow up with abusive parents are more likely to date someone of a different race than themselves. The way I see it, they didn’t form a positive relationship with their parents, and so, they aren’t attracted to the traits their parents had (their race), and may even be repelled by it.</p>
<p>Think of it as kind of being a reverse halo-effect. You find people attractive because your brain looks at these traits and thinks “huh, they must be like these other people who I have formed a positive bond with, and have traits that would make for a goodnlife partner; since this person has similar traits to them, and correlation =causation, that must mean they might make a good life partner, so I should pursue them!”</p></div>		</li>
