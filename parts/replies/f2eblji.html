			<div class="markdown"><p>But water isn't really &quot;stable&quot;. They swap hydrogen atoms with other stuff fairly often. They get broken down by biological processes. They get made by biological processes. </p>
<p>So the better question might be what is the &quot;lifespan&quot; of the average water molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct and overlooked. Plants take in water and co2 and make sugars and oxygen. Sugar isn't water. Animals take that sugar and digest it, reversing the equation. So they end up with water which they excrete and co2 that they exhale as a gas. Not all of the water an animal drinks is destroyed but a good amount is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  In the liquid state, water consists of H2O, H3O+ and OH- and the extra H+ is constantly being passed around when molecules bump into each other.  If you leave a glass of water out overnight, in the morning few if any of the water molecules will have the exact same atoms they started with.  In addition, photosynthesis, metabolism, fire, and geological processes are changing the oxygen atoms from one compound to another.</p></div>		</li>

<p>no part of the water cycle traps water for more than a few hundred thousand years.</p>

<p>Correct - &quot;Permafrost&quot; is a bit of a misnomer, don't get caught up in the terminology; it's only permanent in the eyes of the human lifespan.  Even the deepest, darkest parts which are frozen will one day see either a global warming cycle, tectonic movement, or some other process which will cause it to melt/evap. and reenter the cycle, even if it takes 100k years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: In geological terms, we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Cenozoic_Ice_Age?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">currently</a> living in an ice age. For most of Earth's life, permafrost wasn't a thing. (For most of Earth's life, humans weren't a thing either. Pointing it out in case someone gets the silly idea that global warming is good...)</p></div>		</li>
