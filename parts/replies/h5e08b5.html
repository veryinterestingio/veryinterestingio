			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually you’re describing keenness, sharpness would be how many rows of soldiers does the transition from one soldier to e.g. 20 soldiers. Sharper would be more rows, i.e. a steeper bevel angle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great analogy.  You could extend it by having people holding hands and soldiers push through and break their grip as an analogy for breaking bonds between molecules.  Not perfect, but decent.</p></div>		</li>
