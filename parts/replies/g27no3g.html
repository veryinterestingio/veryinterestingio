<blockquote>
<p>The speeds of light</p>
<p>We think of light as waves that travel in straight lines at a constant speed — 300,000 kilometres per second. But that's only true for light travelling in a vacuum, like empty space. Whenever light has to travel through anything with actual molecules floating around in it — like air, water or fabric — it slows down.</p>
<p>The slowing down happens because whenever light bumps into an atom or molecule, it gets absorbed and spat out on the other side. And all that absorbing and spitting takes a tiny fraction of time, so the light passes through any material more slowly than it would through empty space.
Air doesn't have too many molecules to bump into, so it only slows light down a tiny bit (0.03 per cent). But water has way more molecules than the same volume of air, so light really has to work the room when it goes through the wet stuff — it's 25 per cent slower in water than it is in space.</p>
<p>And fabric is even more dense than water, so light slows down by a massive 33 per cent travelling through your t-shirt. The speed of light through a material compared to its speed in a vacuum is called its refractive index. The refractive index of empty space is 1, and air is 1.0003. Water has a refractive index of 1.33, and fabrics are all about 1.53.</p>
<p>But it's not the speed that light's travelling through water, fabric or air that makes wet things look darker — it's what happens when light changes speed that does the trick. And light changes speed whenever it moves from one refractive index to another. If a beam of light moves from air into fabric, it has to slow down from 300,000 kilometres per hour to 225,000 kilometres per hour instantly. And putting on the brakes like that makes light do the equivalent of an electromagnetic skid. It bends.</p>
<p>Light gets the bends</p>
<p>Why things look darker when wet
The bigger the change in refractive index when light moves from one medium to another, the bigger the change in speed, and the bigger the angle that light bends at. So when light passes from air into fabric it bends at a much bigger angle than when it goes from water into fabric.
And light doesn't just bend once when it goes from, say, air into fabric. Clothes are made up of fibres and air. Light passing through a t-shirt is going to constantly move in and out of the fibres and the air, and it bends every time it does. Because the refractive indexes of air and cotton are so different, the angle of the bend is pretty big. All those big angles mean that a lot of light ends up bouncing back out of the fabric — and some of it will head straight for your eyes.
When your clothes are wet, all those air gaps get filled with water. So when light hits a wet patch it's moving in and out of water and fibres, not air and fibres. The refractive index of fabric is a lot closer to that of water than it is to air, so the light doesn't change speed quite as dramatically going between water and fibres. And that means it bends at a smaller angle when it goes from one to the other.</p>
<p>It's those small angles that are behind the darkness of the wet spot. With small angles, it takes a lot more bends for light to turn right around and head back out to our eyes, so more of the light ends up travelling forward into the fabric. And that patch looks darker.</p>
<p>Spend a few minutes under a hand dryer or sunshine, and you'll see the t-shirt lighten up again. As the water evaporates, air comes back into the water/fibre mix, and brings some bigger angles to the light, so more of it makes it back to our eyes. And we can face the world with crisp dry confidence again …</p>

<p>The light hits the surface of a dry rock and bounces back, appearing normal. The light hits a very thin layer of water, gets diffused before hitting the actual rock, and less light bounces back, making the rock appear darker. </p>
<p>Does that make the above answer make more sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also makes reflections from otherwise rough surfaces more specular, which can also affect the apparent brightness of a surface. Under diffuse lighting it won’t make much of a difference, but if the light is directional the result can be a brighter or dimmer look. That’s why wet roads tend to look so dark at night under headlights; very little of the light reflects backwards to the driver’s eyes compared to the diffuse reflection of dry asphalt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah it’s not necessarily always the predominant effect, and as I said, in ambient lighting conditions it’s not an effect at all. </p>
<p>It’s not that the road as a whole becomes more transparent, it’s that the surface layer of the asphalt becomes more transparent in that more of the light that hits it enters into the asphalt instead of reflecting away. Most/all of that light is subsequently absorbed by the asphalt. So it is more accurate to say that the surface layer of asphalt becomes more transparent, ultimately resulting in greater absorption. </p>
<p>A very thin layer of asphalt would behave similarly to a sheet of paper. Think about it like the difference between paper and a thick card stock or cardboard: it also will look darker when wet, but probably not see-through, because unlike the paper there is still enough material that light will not noticeably pass all the way through from the opposite side even if it is technically a bit more transparent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you're not getting &quot;a road&quot; wet, you're getting the top layer of a road wet. This top layer becomes more transparent, letting more light through than usual (but still absorbing a lot, because it's blacktop), and of the light that gets in, most of it becomes absorbed by the second layer, and what's left bounces back out (again, a lot of it being absorbed on the way back out)</p></div>		</li>
