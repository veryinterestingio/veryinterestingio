			<div class="markdown"><p>Outside of some very isolated locations, the locations of ridges/peaks are rarely related to the underlying faults in the way you describe. At best this sort of works for extremely young fold-thrust belts or fold-thrust belts with widely spaced individual structures (e.g. the Zagros simple folded zone), but for almost any major mountain range, the location of ridges and peaks are not in any direct way related to the underlying fault geometry.</p></div>		</li>
