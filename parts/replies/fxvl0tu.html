<p>This is generally the answer when any consumer says &quot;Why can't company x just implement said feature or fix said bug.&quot;</p>
<p>There's often more than just the developers going &quot;meh, maybe one day...&quot;</p>
<p>Enterprise or commercial applications are behemoths of code, the tax software I work on is 10s of millions of lines of code, that has had teams of developers working on it for more than 20 years. Our program has legacy c++ code that no currently employed developer has had to look at in over 10 years. To go back to fix or implement new feature in that area of the application would be a monumental task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s even harder to understand the complexity when you cut your teeth on basic HTML, where background and text color are each a single variable that doesn’t really affect anything else.</p>
<p>I remember wanting to use tables like the Cool Kids, but being absolutely terrible at guessing how wide to make the cells.  I think at one point I managed the whole “Home/About Me/Links” menu on the left, and the rest of the page on the right. In HTML, because I never learned CSS.   Best viewed in 800x600 resolution.  (Oh man, now I kind of wanna get on Angelfire and make myself a website that works like my old, long-forgotten one did in 2002.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works on implementing design systems for a large internet marketing company, and dabbles in open source web UI development, having usable light and dark mode at the flick of a switch requires designing the system to support that from the beginning. Color management is a “cross-cutting” concern, a standard behavior that every otherwise unrelated component of the system shares, and making it dynamic (e.g. toggle dark mode) squares that complexity because it now does more things, and also does them everywhere. Older systems that were not optimized for this level of comprehensive dynamic behavior just make this unmanageable.</p>
<p>In a real world setting, implementing all that complexity requires the customer to care enough to pay for a feature that provides basically no value to them. Before dark mode became common enough that off-the-shelf libraries supported it, that didn’t happen. Now that it’s more common, customers are starting to care more because their competitors or idols are starting to have it. And now you have more complexity and the risk of presenting something ugly to the user requires more testing and attention that never goes away.</p>
<p>TL;DR Making something that looks good, feels natural, and is easy to maintain is difficult but does little to increase value or conversion, but that may change over time as it becomes more standard.</p>
<p>Edit to clarify that I’m a big proponent of “dark mode” both for the user experience and on a technical level because it encourages a more dynamic model for designing user experiences in general, which is good for the user. I kind of came across as “it’s too hard” which is not at all the case. It’s about complexity vs how much money that complexity makes you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having overseen dark mode on a very prominent app, this and the fact that usually (for consumer apps) you add features not because a user is asking for it, but because you believe the feature will make the user use the app more.  For dark mode, it was initially quite unclear that implementing this feature would lead to enough of an increase in usage to make it worth prioritizing and it actually only happened because it was a particular developer's passion project. Surprisingly, it did increase usage and we ended up doing it on all of our platforms as a result..</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is exactly it. It's hard if not impossible to put a dollar value on such a feature, and hence hard to prioritise unless you have excess resources.</p></div>		</li>
