<p>Another fun fact: “whiskey” is the American and Irish spelling. Outside of that it’s spelled “whisky”</p>
<p>1more:  all Scotch is Whisky, but not all Whisky is Scotch. Originally made from malted barley only and made in Scotland</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a cheat sheet for the non-drinkers who happen across this thread:</p>
<p>Whiskey is a distilled alcohol made from malted grain, aged in barrels.  Though not all distilled alcohol made from malted grain is whiskey... For instance, vodka and gin are often made from malted grain.</p>
<p>Bourbon is whiskey made with over 50% corn</p>
<p>Rye is whiskey made with over 50% rye</p>
<p>Wheat whiskey is whiskey made with over 50% wheat.  </p>
<p>Some bourbons are known as &quot;wheaters&quot; which means it's over 50% corn but a lot of the not-corn is wheat.  </p>
<p>Single malt scotch is a whiskey made with 100% barley, in Scotland.  Outside of Scotland, it'd be called something like single malt whiskey, just like how Champagne not made in the Champagne region of France is often called &quot;sparkling wine&quot;</p>
<p>There's a bunch of other rules about the exact distilling process, how they're barreled, how much alcohol must be in them, etc, but that's the gist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that the &quot;single&quot; in single malt refers to a single distillery. Otherwise it would be &quot;blended&quot;.</p>
<p>There are also scotches that are made from mostly barley with other grains, those become &quot;grain&quot; scotches.</p>
<p>So while we usually see single malt scotches, there are technically a few other categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single grain - One distillery, multiple grains</li>
<li>Blended grain - Multiple distilleries, multiple grains</li>
<li>Blended malt - Multiple distilleries, only barley</li>
<li>Blended scotch - The &quot;everything else&quot; category, covering one or more single malt and single grain whiskies blended together</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's room for misappropriation, but it really is more about the <em>purpose</em> of the murder than the <em>rank</em> of the person murdered.</p>
<p>Business people may be assasinated so someone can take over their company, do something with it that person wouldn't allow while they lived, or make more money than was possible with that person alive (not just steal the victim's money, but increase profits).</p>
<p>Athletes have been assasinated for a number of reasons: as a warning to other players when they lost a game (borderline ordinary murder), for using their celebrity status to take on a political issue someone didn't agree with (definitely assassination), etc.</p>
<p>If a celebrity is murdered in response to doing something political, that's an assassination. If someone kills them just to take their money, that's just a murder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that it's purpose, rather than rank. A political activist without any ranking might be assassinated. A journalist with a damaging story might be assassinated, or a novelist who has written a book the state doesn't like.</p>
<p>A high-ranking political figure could just be murdered, if their spouse did it in a fit of anger one day. But if it's a member of the public (even if they're a stalker rather than a foreign agent), and they were stalking them because of their political rank, it becomes an assassination.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aye, all languages are pretty fluid.</p>
<p>Worth noting the origin, though: </p>
<p><em>The word “assassin” derives from a secretive murder cult in the 11th and 12th centuries called the “Hashishin”,</em> <strong><em>meaning</em></strong> <em>“hashish eaters”. While much of the origin of this cult has been lost, the original leader was Hasan Ben Sabah, a prominent devotee of Isma'ili beliefs</em></p></div>		</li>
