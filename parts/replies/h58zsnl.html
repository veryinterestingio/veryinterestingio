<p>I emphasise the last part since what you currently possess is merely a subset of the cells your DNA can give life to. Many of these cells you don't really produce anymore belong to simpler times, fetal times. Some such cells are those that we nowadays, so carefully collect from the umbilical cord of our newborns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a note - most of the time, when you hear of stem cells being collected from umbilical cord blood, people mean hematopoietic (bone marrow) stem cells, not the pluripotent stem cells you are referring to. AFAIK, the existence of the cells you mentioned in cord blood is still somewhat controversial, and collecting them isn't routine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some nerve tissue <em>does</em> regenerate, though. Not a <em>complete</em> recovery, mind, but assuming that the conditions are good, damaged nerves in other areas of the body may grow back very, very slowly.</p>
<p>I'd venture a layman's guess for brain cells not regenerating having to do with consistent activity sparing no time or resources for regeneration. Some search engine results I'm finding show that connections can be <em>reworked</em>, which is sort of a form of healing, but it's not '<em>re</em>generation', nor is it perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re both right sort of. Neurons of the peripheral nervous system DO have the ability to repair themselves if the cell body remains intact. This is why you can sever a finger, reattach it, and eventually the nerves grow back. It actually is the same cell, not just plasticity. </p>
<p>However, in the central nervous system (edit: brain and inside spinal cord)repair of neurons is actively inhibited. So if you regain function after a brain injury that’s not because the neuron repaired itself, but because the brain re-wired itself to compensate for the dead neuron. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peripheral nerves can regrow. Central ones do not. New Acp all connections can be made, but the cns neurons are pretty much never replaced (at least in adults). Interestingly it seems to be the cns environment that causes this rather than an inherent property of the cell. I believe experiments have been done that show peripheral nerves will not divide in a cns like environment, and cns cells can divide outside of the cns environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There any theories on why this is done?</p>
<p>Some inhibiting factor to try avoiding cancers, maybe? Or that the CNS is just too busy to spare resources/time to regeneration?</p></div>		</li>

<p>i thought all cells have similar structure and stem cells designate themselves according to cells you put around them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really. Think about people at work - were all people, so we all have similar structure, but we all do different jobs and have different training. If you were to pick up an accountant and drop him in a surgical suite, he wouldn't suddenly become a surgeon, he'd just be a very confused accountant. Same with cells - they might start out the same when you're an embryo, but they really quickly learn different jobs and specialize. Stem cells aren't all the same - in adult bodies, they are also specialized to some extent, so there are bone marrow stem cells, skin stem cells, muscle stem cells, etc. While each type of stem cell can make several different cell types, they are still limited to making cells specific to their &quot;job&quot;. For example, a bone marrow stem cell can make different types of blood and immune cells, but it can't make skin or muscle cells. </p>
<p>Furthermore, these cells need to relieve the right types of signals from the body before they make anything - Send the wrong signal, and you make the wrong thing, or even kill the stem cell.</p>
<p>So you couldn't really take any random stem cell, put it in the brain, and expect it to make nerve cells. It has to be the right type of stem cell, and it has to be signaled correctly by the cells around it. Not only are we not very good at finding/making nerve stem cells, the adult human brain isn't good at signaling them correctly to repair damage, and we don't know how to do that artificially, either.</p></div>		</li>
