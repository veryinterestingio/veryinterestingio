<p>Social media tends to depersonalize interactions. If you've ever gotten into a crazy argument on reddit, or twitter, you'l see what I mean. People will say things they'd never say to someone in person. </p>
<p>In the past I've been guilty of getting to a lot of pointless online arguments, myself. I've been making a conscious effort to step back and think &quot;would I say this in person?&quot; </p>
<p>So that's the different approach-- treat everyone you meet online as well as if you were meeting them in person.</p></div>		</li>
