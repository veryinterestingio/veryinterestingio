			<div class="markdown"><p>All your eggs in a padded, locked box that you make the key for. If you make a trash, standard key, someone can reasonably obtain access to your lovely eggs with low skill attacks (like a common-password brute force with some luck). If you make a funky, complex key, it'll be real tough for anyone to obtain access without you giving it to them (phishing, for instance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's still one basket. If someone gets a hold of that basket I now have no eggs. What's stopping a hacker from just removing all the passwords and giving them back in exchange for Bitcoin and if not paid all of the millions of users passwords are now gone and millions of people can't access there bank accounts, email, anything they saved on there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good idea, but they thought about it. The services keep backups, but in case of total breach, the backups might get wiped out as well.</p>
<p>If you’re unfortunate enough to not be currently using password manager anywhere at the time when everything was deleted from a server (password manager saves passwords on your computer as well), you might lose everything, that’s true.</p>
<p>However, I have password manager on three devices and make all passwords backup on two different locations every few months, and I suggest you to do the same, just to be sure. If you use this setup, in order to lose everything:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone would need to hack the server and delete the database of passwords</li>
<li>Someone would at the same time need to hack backup server and delete backups of the database</li>
<li>At the same time, you don’t have password manager installed at all</li>
<li>And you lose or don’t have your personal backup</li>
</ol>
<p>If all the four points above are true, at the same time, you would lose all your passwords. But it’s very unlikely and it’s a risk I’m willing to take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And who stores that hash?</p>
<p>If your key is stored somewhere, it's insecure.  If decryption is not performed locally, a compromise of the service means a compromise of the database.</p></div>		</li>
