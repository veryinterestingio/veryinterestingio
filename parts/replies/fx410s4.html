			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, a little late to the party, but the Oxford AAV approach has caught my curiosity. Are approaches such as AAV well established, or is it cutting edge where we have a high degree of confidence but as yet have no long term data?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s cutting edge being used this way. The last time I know this was used was w the MERS virus - by the same group of course. The vaccine is in Clinical Trials but because of this pandemic, it’s been (obviously) put on hold so we can all concentrate our efforts towards the novel coronavirus. From what I have read, adenoviruses have been studied closely got their use in gene therapy research.</p></div>		</li>
