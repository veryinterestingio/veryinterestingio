&quot;Why do we rub our eyes when tired?&quot;
It's a completely voluntary action which I don't engage in, nor do I ever have the desire to so. In fact I always found it odd that people do it. So... You rub your eyes because you decided to.
Another note: when I'm tired I yawn a lot. Idk about others, but yawning always activates tears for me. So that speaks to the eye dryness issue.
I'm not trying to be facetious or sarcastic.</p></div>		</li>
