<p>E: Forgot to mention I'm a surveyor and we have to designate the points the compaction testing is done at about every 25 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. In Texas we don’t like asphalt on most high volume roadways. (Freeways tollways etc)
On residential streets we also prefer concrete. Mostly because we have an arrid to semi moist climate and that tends to have expansive properties on asplault.
We do use asphalt quite often though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the area I live (which also happens to be in Texas) there's a lot of clay in the soil, which tends to expand and contract a lot with moisture. While I have no special insight, education, or experience in road construction or maintenance, I've always assumed this was part of why our asphalt streets are often so lousy (source: I live on a rarely-maintained asphalt street)</p>
<p>To keep this ELI5, imagine how a sponge gets bigger when you pour water on it, then smaller when it dries out. Then imagine that you painted a sponge and kept pouring water over it and then letting it dry lots of times. Paint is a little stretchy, and it keeps most of the water out of the sponge, so it might be okay for awhile.  But some water will still get in, at least at the edges. This makes the sponge get bigger and smaller lots of times. So eventually the paint will start getting little cracks. Those cracks let in even more water that make that part of the sponge get even bigger when it is wet.  So unless you paint back over the cracks right away, they get bigger and turn into chips. The chips are like potholes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Project manager in New Jersey.  We have all asphalt and main roadways and highways have concrete under the asphalt but not many.  The winters here are brutal on the roads and they just use cold path to &quot;temporarily fix&quot; the potholes until the township can get funding to reconstruct the roadway.  Concrete is significantly more expensive I would assume to do a whole roadway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would think that, but I'm pretty sure 97% of our roads are asphalt, including the interstates and freeways.  Asphalt is far cheaper to install.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the road. A lot of 40 through Winston is concrete. Overall we mostly use asphalt in NC. But the testing regimen is general about once every 500 sq ft. Additionally, soil compaction proctors are only valid at specific moisture content levels. These change wildly.</p>
<p>You can take brown/yellow sand that will not get above 85% compaction at 5% moisture content and dump a couple thousand gallons of water on it and magically get it to 12% moisture and 98% compaction without additional rolling. Testing is only valid so long as the conditions stay the same. It may be days or weeks before rock is even placed on the subgrade. Even once the asphalt is down those conditions continue to change and you can develop soft spots over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true: proctors change wildly </p>
<p>Expanding on that: the process to create a proctor, a tech in the lab uses roughly ~3000g of air dried soils and then adds increments of water depending on the absorptive nature (PI - plastic index, &amp; LL - liquid limit)of the soil.
Once the dryback is completed you plot the points ( moisture to density ratio) on a chart and create a parabola. Then you place a straight line (0%air void line) and that tells you at what moisture content the soil will have the highest density. </p>
<p>Sorry that isn’t ver ELI5 but I can expand on this more after I get off work if so wished. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean this is part of it, but it's not the whole story. </p>
<p>The much bigger part is that once the asphalt cracks water seeps in. If the water freezes, it expands which pushes against the asphalt and breaks it apart. Repeat this over and over with the water freezing, melting, freezing again over and over, breaking the asphalt a little more each time, and those cracks start causing chunks to break off, which become holes. </p>
<p>Even if the water doesn't freeze, it can still seep down below the asphalt  and erode the soil below. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I could tell that op didn't have to worry about weather related potholes when he started talking about the soil being compacted and the city replacing the sections around the pothole instead of just throwing a bag of asphalt in and calling it a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In northern climates potholes are also formed from freeze-thaw cycles. Water seeps into the cracks, it freezes, then it thaws. And we know that when things freeze they contract and when they get warmer they expand, making the crack wider.</p></div>		</li>
