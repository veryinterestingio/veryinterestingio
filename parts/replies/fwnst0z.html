			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconding all this. I lived in southern Italy for two years and ran into all kinds of dialects that were nearly impossible to understand because they sounded so different from modern Italian. </p>
<p>And to OP, I’m the same way. I used to be fluent in Italian and reading it was always so much easier than listening to it or speaking it. Being surrounded by it all day obviously helped with my speaking skill, but it was never on the level of my reading. I do blame part of it on the fact that southern Italians use lots of dialects, their accents do vary from city to city, and southerners are known throughout Italy for not using correct grammar. So when I would hear them talk, it wouldn’t click in my brain because I wasn’t hearing what I thought was correct Italian, and likewise it was difficult to talk like them because I couldn’t override using correct grammar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting the northern vs southern Italy dialect dichotomy.
Same could be said for the US. So many dialects across the US, but southern ones seem to be the hardest for outsiders (for lack of a better word) to understand. </p>
<p>Im wondering if in Italy, there are similar stereotypes associated with southern vs northern dialects. I ask because of the idea of 'correct' vs 'incorrect' grammar. </p>
<p>In the US, often times, a southern accent is associated with inferior intelligence and may not be taken as seriously. (Obviosuly not always, but it happends enough that i don't think anybody would argue with me on it).  </p>
<p>Anecdote you dontnhave to read:
I went to a tiny elitist college.  My third year, the school hired a new econ professor. She was from the Midwest and had a strong accent. I heard her speak and she was great, and i was interested in some of her past research, so i registered for her class as soon as I could. After she gave that talk though, i heard several of my peers remark that the college should have gotten someone more educated, more credentialed.  I engaged, asking what they meant and sharing with them her past research. We talked a bit before they finally said what they really meant &quot;I /know/ intellectually that she's smart, but I just cant sit in a classroom and learn from someone who sounds dumb&quot; . Forget her 3 degrees and accolades, her accent nullified all of that for these kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's sad..shows how little effort people actually wanna make to understand or connect with people who're different..I like the Texas accent, once you've heard it for a little while it's no trouble..still English, same words..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember where I read this, but it's my understanding that Italian as a unified single national language is quite young.  Supposedly it's not uncommon for people who emigrated from Italy to the US who grew up speaking &quot;Italian&quot; with their Parents and Grandparents to go to Italy and find out that what they'd been speaking all those years was actually a regional language, not Italian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya I ve seen Italian videos before.. though I don't understand it, it has a nice musical ring to it..and you can make out some words..I once read that Italian is easiest for English speakers to learn and that every word ends with a vowel..but Gomorrah, worse than Mexican Spanish..
ps. Many Italians even said they needed subtitles..whoa! Kinda interesting, Sicilians can understand mainland Italian just fine but the opposite is not true..and Sicily is the birthplace of the Mafia.... intriguing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait a minute..I just read that Gomorrah is actually not in Italian but in napoletano or Neapolitan, which apparently is more of a distinct language on its own rather than a dialect..most southern Italians understand 90% of it..not 100%, for which you gotta be a local person who speaks the dialect. Italians from north/central Italy can apparently only understand 50-60% of it!</p></div>		</li>
