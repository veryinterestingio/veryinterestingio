			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. You don't need to wait until it is in the same place again, three observations a few months (better: years) apart are sufficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is backwards. Kepler formulated his 3rd law after comparing Tycho Brahe's observations of the distances for each planet and their orbital period, and landing on the realization that the ratio of T\^2 to R\^3 was nearly constant for each planet (within about 3% error in his data, and now refined to about .1% error today).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow, so this is what he made of it!</p>
<p>i've been wondering ever since i saw a few pages of Brahe's records a few months back... finding any rhyme and rhythm felt completely impossible to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The OP asked how one might compute the distance to a planet without using a probe. He did not ask how Kepler did it, although that's certainly an intriguing question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the length of a planet's &quot;year&quot; is proportional to it's distance from the star.
The length of its &quot;day&quot;, or how fast it spins depends on a lot of factors including its size, what it's made of, its moons, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean all planets in our solar system that revolve around our sun are all traveling the same speed? </p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lejefferson" target="_blank">lejefferson</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. The year depends on how long it takes to do one full revolution around the sun. Which can vary according to how fast it is orbiting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I won’t repeat the other answers, but I can tell you that it’s for the same reasons that all things fall at the same speed regardless of their mass. An orbit is just a fancy way of falling </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but misses the point.</p>
<p>On earth, you can approximate g=9.8 m/s^2. But in outer space where distances are much larger, g isn’t constant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass of the star, yes. Mass of the planet, no, as long as it's tiny compared to the mass of the star.</p>
<p>And the length of year is proportional to the cube root of the distance squared. It's not directly proportional to the distance.</p></div>		</li>
