			<div class="markdown"><p>The area in your brain responsible for triggering vomiting is called the area postrema. It’s located at the base of the 4th ventricle in the brain stem and is special because it doesn’t have a blood brain barrier (like most of the rest of your brain) and can directly sample the blood for hormones and other chemicals. Certain chemicals and signals cause the area postrema to initiate the vomiting process. There are many different inputs that trigger vomiting but some known ones are various chemicals that stimulate chemoreceptors (including dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, substance P, etc), vestibular input (comes from cranial nerve VIII in the ear and is responsible for motion sickness), cranial nerve IX (comes from the pharynx and is response for gag reflex), enteric nervous system (comes from the GI tract and is caused by distention, irritation, infection, etc), higher level CNS signals (stress, psych disorders), and increased intracranial pressure such as in head trauma. The area prostrema then coordinates the vomiting process and sends signals that cause salivation (prevents dental erosion from stomach acid), tells the body to take a deep breath (prevents aspiration), and ultimately triggers retroperistalsis which is the contraction of the smooth muscle lining your stomach/esophagus starting from the bottom and rolling up. And that briefly sums it up. Keep in mind this is a very cursory overview of a complicated subject, but hopefully this helps at least partially explain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t know there was any part of the brain that didn’t have the blood brain barrier.  It makes complete sense tho with the awesome way you explained it!  Thank you</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is sort of true, it's not your normal blood brain barrier but it's more accurate to think of this as a very thin blood brain barrier. The technical term for this in the context of the area postrema is &quot;tancyte barrier&quot; as it is made of Tancytes which are a type of glial cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many different pathways that can cause vomiting. Your brain has a region called “The Chemo Trigger Zone” that will tell your stomach to vomit if it senses toxins in your blood or digestive tract. But some people vomit as a result of anxiety and that doesn’t involve any toxins, just emotions. And people vomit when their gag reflex in their throat is triggered by physical stimulation, and that doesn’t have a chemical or emotional component.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s always a chemical component to how the body responds, even if it’s emotional. Gag reflex is triggered by nerves, which use chemicals to signal the appropriate part of your brain, which uses chemicals to send to a signal to your stomach muscles to tighten (overly simplified explanation). Nothing ever “just happens” in biology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also be triggered by a reflex, gag reflex for example. It has evolutionary origins where something which smelled bad/off or looked bad/off would trigger a gag/vomit reflex so to avoid eating it (and thus becoming sick later). </p>
<p>And of course vomiting is a quick way of excreting stomach content. Certain cells in the stomach and digestive system can detect certain peptides or enzymes (or bacteria toxins) which trigger vomiting reflex to get rid of the stomach content to avoid the body becoming sick/infected/poisoned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and also the gag reflex is overly sensitive in babies so as to prevent them swallowing something that the brain thinks the baby might be unable to digest, simply put. As we grow older this sensitivity reduces and it becomes as it is in most of us. However interestingly you can train your soft palate to not gag (not completely but to a good extent) by just providing it a regular stimulus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes no sense at all.  What is meant by &quot;forcing the stomach's contents through a digestive enzyme called 'foregut-fermenting enzymes'&quot;?  Not only is this a complete non sequitur and ungrammatical besides, &quot;foregut-fermenting enzymes&quot; aren't even a real thing.  This answer sounds like it was generated by one of those generative speech models that produce superficially coherent text until they go off the rails.</p></div>		</li>
