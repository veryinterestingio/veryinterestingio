			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's actually the opposite. Younger people have more tastebuds that are very sensitive, and even basic flavors are very intense to them. Older people have less tastebuds, and so they don't notice that olives are fucking disgusting why would you eat that you goddamn savage what is wrong with you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing happened to me with turnip greens. I went to lunch one and it was like I HAD to have turnip greens. I loved them even though I grew up hating them. It was so strange.
Another weird thing is I sometimes crave a cigarette even though I've never smoked. I never smoked one but I swear the craving is bad! Can't figure that one out!</p></div>		</li>
