<p>I've asked this question before on r/askscience and apparently, when up there, there are countless stars visible all around you.  </p>
<p>Because the Earth is so riddiculously bright when the sun is hitting it, most photos out in space do not capture the light of all the stars I'm the background as they get drowned out, but the human eye can see them fine when up there (also if/when not riddiculously close to the Earth)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The same can be said during the day here on Earth. Stars other than the Sun are still present during the day, it's just that the Sun is so bright that the light from other stars is virtually imperceptible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ever want to get the full realization of how empty space is, here's the very <a href="https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html" target="_blank">best demonstration I've ever run across</a>.</p>
<p>It's a scale rendering of just our solar system. Our moon is 1 pixel. You scroll right to move from the sun to the planets. The scale speed of the scrolling is actually faster than light speed.</p>
<p>If you have the patience to get to Saturn, you're a better person than me.</p>
<p>Then you realize that the planets don't line up. That this is a perfect line through a sphere of immense volume, and that the tiny little pixels on your screen are the ONLY solid places to land in that sphere. And that you are only 1 of 7 billion humans on the barely noticeable clump of pixels that make up earth.</p>
<p>Perspective is tough.</p></div>		</li>

I love you for providing that link, truly great material. And I hate you for providing that link, my hand hurts and I wasted 30+ minutes reading the text that scrolled by. Either way, thanks for that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wish i could remember the link, but it was a similar thing, but showing light speed in real time. Started with how long it takes for light to get around the earth, then scales out from there. Watching it go from the sun to earth was long enough, but then out to Saturn was crazy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I Hope that helps to illustrate why they take up so much of the field of view in each direction.</p>
<p>I approximated the altitude at 1/32 the diameter of earth (ISS @ \~250mi, diameter of earth @ \~8000mi).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have time to draw a picture, but neither illustration really captures the optics very well.</p>
<p>In the image in the OP, the Earth's horizon is in the middle of the image. That means that the camera should be aimed at the horizon (in 2-D). </p>
<p>Also, the reflection of the Earth is coming from a point more behind the astronaut.  That's possible because if the angle of reflection is something like 70 degrees then the angle of incidence is also 70 degrees, so the angle between the incident and reflected rays is something like 140 degrees. In principle, if there were no equipment blocking the light, the angle between the incident and reflected rays could be almost 180 degrees. Both of your illustrations show maximum angles of less than 90 degrees.</p></div>		</li>
