Tap water is significantly more expensive than fresh spring water. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder how septic tanks play into this. Most of the water that goes into a septic gets pushed out into the drainfield and absorbed back into the earth. I wonder if that is any better or worse than it going through municipal water systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly think the solution for large costal cities is desalinization and recycling sewer water. Once wastewater has been treated its basically potable, but not legally so. Make some standards and reuse the water and top yourself off with seawater (which costs ~3x water from traditional sources. But people go &quot;poo water, eww&quot;. </p>
<p>I have yet to meet a person who would refuse recycled water, but every time it's brought up the News cameras walk down a street asking people until they find someone.</p>
<p>For agriculture, farmers need to pay the true cost of water rather than pennies. Food will be more expensive, but it will force farmers to start making hard choices about water management. The farmers need an incentive to conserve that goes beyond a single drought. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy costs for desalination are the main issue with this method, although it will likely become more feasible in the future as energy technologies improve.</p>
<p>As for the recycling of gray water, this has been used successfully in Los Angeles, where it is injected into the aquifer and recaptured downgradient, which both acts as a natural filter and removes the “yuck” factor because now it is just groundwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then there's the entire category of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_water" target="_blank"><em>fossil aquifers</em></a>, aquifers which formed thousands of years ago and essentially do not recharge, either because the storage is essentially impermeable and precipitations don't penetrate or because there are no recharge sources above the aquifer anymore (desertification, rivers moved or dried out, …).</p>
<p>And recharge can bring its own issues e.g. bring minerals and pollutants into the aquifer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you mentioned California, I'd like to elaborate a bit there. Let's just say that California has access to X amount of water. 50% of that is dedicated to environmental uses: protected water in rivers (which is <em>half</em> of the 50%), preservation of wetlands and streams and animal habitats, used in the water treatment process, etc. Then, 40% of California's water is used for agriculture. This leaves about 10% for urban use in homes and businesses. </p>
<p>During droughts and dry spells, X (the total amount of available water) drops, and it becomes difficult to satisfy the state's water needs. So how do you address that?  Can't exactly tell a river or protected environment to use less water. Can't stop treating the water. Can't stop the farming that generates money and jobs and trade.  So we ask the people to reduce their usage as much as possible.  Of the 10% used in urban environments, about half of that is just landscape watering, so there is definitely the potential for water savings. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You CAN stop farming for a season or a year (a lost crop is nothing new to farmers and IMHO government insurance for that is the only legitimate ag subsidy) but the big problem that is specific to California agriculture is the amount of almonds that would die off for good if not watered through a drought.</p></div>		</li>
