			<div class="markdown"><p>You came very close to hitting this point, but the effect of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity" target="_blank">herd immunity</a> needs to be explicitly addressed, as it’s the best non-selfish reason to get immunized, and I don’t see anyone else mentioning it in this thread. </p>
<p>Essentially, you don’t get vaccines just for yourself. You also get vaccines to reduce the chances of a disease spreading to people who cannot get vaccines because they’re too young or they’re immunocompromised. Or children and elderly people who might have gotten vaccinated, but it didn’t take for them.</p>
<p>What if you only interact with healthy young people? It doesn’t matter. Maybe one of your athletic 20-something coworkers visits their mawmaw in the retirement home every Sunday. Maybe your coworker and mawmaw both got vaccinated, but the vaccine was only 50% effective this year and it didn’t take for them. Well, every person in your coworker’s life who gets a vaccine marginally increases mawmaw’s chances of surviving the flu season. </p>
<p>There are a lot of people in the nursing home with a lot of family members, caretakers, and friends who themselves have extended networks, though, so the effects of herd immunity work exponentially well the more people who get vaccinated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to ask the question: Why is it that the flu shot seems far more common and advertised in the United States then in Europe?</p>
<p>I live in Germany, and here there is no push each season for everyone to get a flu shot, but &quot;only&quot; certain groups (Chronically ill, senior citizens, pregnant women, and people working in areas of higher oinfection risk)</p>
<p>I always wonderd about that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s just how your government runs.  For a manufacturer they’d have to get a tender from the Germany government, and your govt probably only allocated X amount to acquire flu vaccines each season.  Influenza also can vary based on hemisphere, so your strains will be different from what WHO recommends as strains in the US, this can deincentive manufacturers as it is extremely expensive to just manufacture a ‘Europe’ flu vaccine when the market is in the US.</p></div>		</li>
