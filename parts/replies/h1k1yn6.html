			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, 3G is barely left anywhere in Norway too. 2G and 4G are left with 5G starting to become useable day to day in cities.. The few remaining 3G frequencies are going up for auction very soon, but the same big boys (Telenor, Telia and Ice) are expected to grab the rest somewhat evenly between themselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There’s a lot of wireless equipment that isn’t a phone, sim router or laptop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Compared to 3G and 4G better coverage? You don't want to completely lose all communication just because your in the middle of nowhere. Or because your building is a semi functional Faraday cage.  </p>
<p>Also in my experience the battery life of a phone is incredibly prolonged when switching to only 2G. It impacts my devices much more than turning off WiFi and Bluetooth. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if 5G fixes that. If so, we could finally say goodbye to 2G. But telecommunications in today's world are incredibly important, and it would be foolish to not have a rugged robust fallback. That does not necessarily mean an old technology, but those are often the ones perfected and improved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much only used to make sure people can make (emergency) calls. Topology in Norway makes covering the places people live a pretty special task (but requirement if you do wanna lease frequency spectrum from the government).</p>
<p>Back when DVB-T was rolled out there even was a requirement that every single home (not cabins, only where people actually reside permanently) got coverage (and a lot of single homes are so deep in valleys and fjords that they didn't get satelite or DVB-T), and to do that, a small company (Paneda) had to invent a way to set up super small base stations in super weird locations where they got satelite coverage on a mountain top and broadcast that down to the few homes (or in some case singke home). Sure, it's expensive, but having to build a normal huge base station (with proper power and fiber to it) would be a lot more expensive for that few residenses).</p>
<p>In short, the mountains and fjords of Norway make telecom a super interesting mission. Making sure Eurocae-ED 138 is met at my job is a lot of fun with some special challenges (stable power supply at Svalbard and oil platforms especially).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Urban areas get 5G first, yeah (and loose 3G last). I often drive west coast up and down and I after I leave the big city there's barely any 3G left (and my '13 Audi somehow came without 4G, so it reverts to 2G for pretty much the entire trip)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rogers (Canada) is only keeping 3G around for all those large enterprise machine-to-machine &quot;IoT&quot; (think, tracking/weather devices, sensors on transport trucks, fleet management, mobile card payment machines, etc), not for consumers/mobile phones.  And even then, there isn't a lot of incentive to keep it around vs. moving those customers to 4G/LTE devices/SIMs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At&amp;t did something similar albeit in the opposite direction with 4G by having some phones say &quot;4G&quot; instead of &quot;3G LTE&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, some customers just don’t want to change and many companies are just slooooowly nudging them towards 4G. Something a lot of the hangers-on don’t realize, though, is that 3G devices are very easy to clone, even remotely, compared to 4G &amp; 5G. It’s always been an issue but fraud involving international calls using cloned devices has had a huge uptick the last few years and many people are shocked to see their bill when that happens. That’s a big reason for the push to new devices.</p>
<p>If you or a loved one love their old Samsung Convoy and can’t bare to part with the simplicity of a flip phone, I promise you there are some newer 4G flip phones that are right up your alley and you won’t have to break the bank!</p></div>		</li>
