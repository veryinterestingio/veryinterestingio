<p>Second, female sexual pleasure is an important part of human mating, and encourages more frequent reproduction opportunities compared to animals that don’t have this trait. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elisabeth Loyd, [in her study] (<a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674022461&content=reviews" target="_blank">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674022461&content=reviews</a>) argues that female sexual pleasure is a biologically pointless artifact of male sexuality. What are your thoughts on her work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen the video you referenced and I tend to agree with that theory. The action of cervix rhythmically dipping into the semen pool during orgasm - <em>to me</em> - seems to strongly suggest that that motion coupled with strong euphoric orgasm greatly promotes the odds and paths of sperm reaching the fallopian tubes as well as encouraging further copulation due to the pleasure, further improving odds, as well as bonding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read this recently!  So my impression of her work was that it <em>was</em> a great analysis of how androcentrism has colored work on female sexuality, <em>but</em> I think she went to great lengths to convince herself and her reader that the female orgasm is a developmental byproduct of the male orgasm that happens to be fun.  A fun accident, as it were.  </p>
<p>The thing is, though, she seems to ignore the idea that <em>even if</em> the female orgasm is just the developmental byproduct of the male orgasm, pleasure from the female side <em>could have</em> put positive pressure on the ‘happy orgasm’ trait in general.</p>
<p>Her work is better viewed as a lesson in biases, personally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t read her book but her argument as blurbed on the above site reminds me of Steven J Gould’s <em>Spandrels of San Marco</em> argument (which I disagree with). He argued that we see spandrels in a church as features when they’re actually the byproduct of having two arches meet. But just because something came about as a byproduct of another evolutionary feature, doesn’t mean it isn’t acted on by natural selection. Spandrels wouldn’t exist if they caused churches to fall down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not pointless if not having female sexual pleasure meant even stricter sexual selection - such a pressure could just breed humans into extinction.<br />
With a social species you need some degree of buy-in or consent for activities.<br />
Without female sexual pleasure - aren't we basically converting all sex into rape (if not done as an exchange for resources)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually the gene that creates a big penis is the same one that makes men generous and send money to random internet strangers who give them good news.</p></div>		</li>
