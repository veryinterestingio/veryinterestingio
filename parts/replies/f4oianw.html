			<div class="markdown"><p>How many cell towers are there in a given area? I always figured they were pretty spaced out. </p>
<p>I feel like the amount of people at a Rays game isn't any greater than the amount of people downtown St. Pete on a Friday night, but my signal is at a snail pace when I'm at a game vs a random bar. Downtown is only a few block radius so I have to imagine we're all using the same tower. </p>
<p>I always figured it was just poor reception due to the stadium itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot more &quot;towers&quot; than you think in downtown areas. Most of them probably aren't even towers. Small cells (think giant wifi antennas) might be on street poles, there might be base stations on rooftops that you have never seen, and the stadium likely has cells built into it's structure. The problem with stadium coverage is it's very tricky to evenly distribute the crowd and in general, your phone wants to connect to the cell with the strongest signal. </p>
<p>Think about one section of a stadium (probably around 500-1000 people). If even half of those are connected to the same cell, and their phone are pulling/pushing data (requesting radio bandwidth), you're going to have a lot of not just congestion, but also interference, because the more radio signals the antenna is trying to decode, the more confusing it becomes to see the signal through the noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most stadiums and similar large buildings have several &quot;towers&quot; built in, typically placed along with WiFi.  They'd have several over the seating areas and probably major hall ways with fairly right antennas compared to a traditional cell tower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the number of phones... It's the number of phones actively requesting and using a slice of the radio signal. In an event like the game many people are actively using their phones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The number of bars is basically just telling you how far away your cell tower is. Nothing more.</p>
<p>Whether you can get service depends on whether the tower has available channels and how strong the signal is in whichever of those channels is available. The bars on your phone tells you nothing about this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, how strong the signal is.  You can be quite far away from a rural tower on open, flat terrain (or if it or you are on a hilltop) and have five bars of signal - maybe tens of km/miles away.  At my house, I'm 3 blocks from my nearest cell site but I only get one bar of signal.  It works perfectly - because I'm near and it's not congested - but mobile phone networks increase capacity by turning down the power of sites and putting them closer together.  Think of it as people being near each other and whispering instead of being far and yelling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just mobile networks. WiFi is the same way. More access points and lower signal strength is how you increase WiFi capacity in densely packed areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bars are very much linked to the signal strength and have nothing directly to do with distance from a tower at all, beyond distance tends to equate to lower received signal strength.  You can generally drill down in your device to find the actual RSSI value in something like -XdBm or similar.  You are correct that they generally do not tell you your own SnR, certainly do not tell you the SnR at the far end, and don't show anything about RF or backhaul contention.</p></div>		</li>
