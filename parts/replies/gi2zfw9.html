			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s definitely not dangerous because of hackers. Otherwise, open source software would be less secure than closed source software and, by and large, the opposite is true. The “danger” of a source code leak is competitors having access to your intellectual property, future plans, etc. Protecting source code is a business decision, not a security one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're forgetting about the good guys.</p>
<p>With closed source software, if hackers would get the source code they can look for ways to abuse any security issues they can find. But only they do that, most companies barely invest in reviewing something that works for security concerns.</p>
<p>However with open source software both the good guys and the bad guys can look for security issues in the code. Making it much less likely for the issue to be found o my by folks with bad intentions.</p>
<p>Hackers getting source code on closed source software is still bad news.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Security through obscurity&quot; is still used by some companies. Automotive industry is notorious for using it to hide their poor code. &quot;Security by design&quot; is great for open source stuff since it will create trust in the software, but open source software is such a big field that you shouldn't make generalized statements about it being more or less secure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This can be dangerous to have source code leaked because its easier for hackers to find holes in the security when they can see exactly how the system works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is why there is an argument that &quot;open source&quot; software can be more secure. When the source code is readily available to the public, the public can check it out and with more eyes on it, security holes can be found and fixed.</p>
<p>With &quot;closed source&quot; where a company develops the software and keeps the source code private, there is always a chance the source code could leak and hackers can find weaknesses and the company isn't aware of it. Hackers can even find weaknesses without having the source code. But again, if the public can look at, for large important applications, like for example, voting machines, concerned software engineers can take a very critical eye to the source code and look for mistakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While yes, <em>in theory</em> this would seem to be the case, the problem is, no one is actually looking at it for the most part. Extremely critical open source projects (like OpenSSL) were found to have crippling security holes because everyone thought someone else was reviewing it.</p>
<p>When you have a for-profit company, you are incentivized to find bugs and close them and can even pay those same hackers to let you know first (bug bounty programs).</p>
<p>The tl;dr is it's not quite to black and white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's pretty clear it's not &quot;those same&quot; hackers who would actually exploit a weakness who instead will participate in a bug bounty program. </p>
<p>The profit motive does go both ways. There have been plenty of examples of companies spending time and resources to hide flaws in their software and products rather than fix those issue because the fixes would be too costly or would reveal that the thing they are selling can't actually be done safely at all. </p>
<p>Personally I'd rather deal with &quot;no one looking&quot; than trusting a company to look hard enough. </p>
<p>Also you can't really hide sneaky data gathering in open-source software.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be like saying a translator translates English into words. English is already made up of words and the translation is into another language, e.g. Italian.</p>
<p>The source code is already binary. In fact, every bit of data inside a computer is binary, including source codes and compiled programs.</p>
<p>The translation is from one (programming) language to another (usually executable) language.</p></div>		</li>
