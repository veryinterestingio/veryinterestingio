			<div class="markdown"><p>Heres a followup. If the Colombic interaction drives protons away, what is it that keeps the neutrons from coalescing? They should have only attractive interactions, without Colombic  repulsion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The residual strong force is extremely strongly repulsive at very short distances, becomes strongly attractive at short distances, and then falls off as distance increases.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we know why this is? Never seen a force that can be both attractive and repulsive depending only upon distance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutron-neutron interactions are generally attractive, except at very short distances. But they’re not strong enough to support neutron-only bound states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum mechanics.  Just like electrons, nucleons have a quantum state in the nucleus.  If there aren't enough protons, then neutrons &quot;get in the way&quot; of nuclear stability. They can be emitted (e.g., as part of heavy atom fission as in uranium decay) or undergo beta decay to turn into protons via emission of an electron and a neutrino.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do protons and neutrons have a van der waals analog within the nucleus? Considering that they're all made of up and down quarks, do the constituent quarks have a local influence outside of the proton/neutron they comprise?</p></div>		</li>
