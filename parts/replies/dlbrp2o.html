			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that the way exponents are explained in school is unintuitive and wrong.</p>
<p>The way it was explained to me was 'how many times you multiply a number by itself'</p>
<p>2^3 = 2×2×2×2 because you multiply three times, right?</p>
<p>In reality, as long as we ignore non-integers as exponents, the way it should be explained is 'how many times you multiply 1 by the number'.</p>
<p>2^3 = 1×2×2×2</p>
<p>2^0 = 1</p>
<p>Intuitive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never been able to put this idea into words but I've been using it for years, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>All of my years of trick questions on multiple choice tests have prepared me for this moment. </p></div>		</li>

<p>so x0 must be equal to 1.</p>

<p>I have a feeling people are going to read this and not understand how, as if you had explained it.</p>
<p>A better way to phrase it would be,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to keep our math rules consistent we have decided X^0 should equal 1, and we can let 0! equal 1 for the same reason.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I should've explained it like you describe.</p>
<p>I'm not too knowledgeable on math but I imagine there are similar cases for other stuff where there's two or more possible choices but we pick the one that keeps everything consistent or at least break them down into different systems </p>
<p>I've edited my main post for both x^0 and 0!, let me know if it's good in your opinion 👍 </p></div>		</li>
