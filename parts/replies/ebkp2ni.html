			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the main factor here here. While the other comments make reasonable points, the majority of the &quot;tiredness&quot; comes from the pursuit of the ball carrier during a play, and to be more specific, it is the defensive lineman that suffer the most from this. Having to push on a 300lb man for 3 seconds, and then run 25 yards chasing a 180 pound man as fast as possible all while carrying your own 300lb body weight multiple times a minute, wears you down if you don't get a break to catch your breath. After a long game, it only takes 1 or two plays to get exhausted, and the offense takes advantage by continually calling run plays, and also by trying to stay in no-huddle to not allow the defense a chance to substitute.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or you could just try to prevent another shovel pass instead and not actually tackle Kenyan Drake. </p></div>		</li>
