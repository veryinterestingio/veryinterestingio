			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, yes. Evolutionarily speaking, the goal of any life form is to reproduce - to pass their genes to the next generation. Anything that helps that is more likely to be passed on and anything that hurts that is less likely to be passed on. </p>
<p>On the other hand, &quot;new features&quot; also can have costs. If a creature has a gene that results in it producing 10x more offspring, that's good. However, if this feature meant that the creature needed to consume 100x more resources before reproducing, then the &quot;less offspring but less resource intensive&quot; creatures would likely thrive.</p>
<p>Going back to humans, when we're 40+ we're typically past our prime child producing years. People can still have kids after 40, but evolutionarily speaking our child rearing ages tend to be in our 20's to 30's. So everything after 40 isn't really needed as far as evolution is concerned. </p>
<p>Yes, staying alive longer could mean raising/teaching your offspring more which could mean they pass their genes on. There's a diminishing returns aspect, though. A gene might extend a human's life past 110, but would any cost involved be worth the miniscule benefit? Would it aid in that gene being passed to the next generation? Or would it just be more cost when this generation's model is obsolete (is already finished passing its genes on).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>genetically speaking, as a single individual and its ability to procreate and warrant the success of its successors, higher lifespan means very little, however as a specie, living 200 years might make people reconsider how they look at the world and the consequences of their action more carefully, leading to increase success for humanity as a whole</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you had kids in your late 30's they are going to need you for awhile yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but I wonder why we don't clean the copies and start new sometimes, say every 20 years. When we make a kid, the kid has a clean copy of our chromosomes so it's doable.</p></div>		</li>
