			<div class="markdown"><p>Solo, this might be my first upvote for you, SIR! I was an ELT back in 1992 on the US CGN Virginia and since decommissioned. Nuclear is in my opinion the best options to move past 'fossil fuels' or simply the giant past gone sea/ocean beds - which one day, we will run out of. Obviously, if we keep resourcing very rare nuclear material, the same will happen. I get the idea of 'natural renewable' energies, but in the long..... run, the world has too many people to house. We as a whole, cannot continue the people input and energy output. Eventually, we will run out of sectors of land to house either windmills and/or solar fields and still provide crops for food consumption, and the energy we consume - sure not in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>Just a private glimpse into more of my personal life, I was driving back from the gas fields out in PA (marcellus IIRC) and I noticed outside of Chicago, just a huge giant wind farm. As traffic was bad, and in the middle of summer I noticed only a couple of literally hundreds of windmills turning. And then, I remembered something from long ago, where hundreds of people died in Chicago during an extreme heat wave. I know, why should I conflate the two, but..... I could only imagine all the air conditioners running on a 'hot summer day'? My bet, they had to burn coal to continue some sort of funding. It literally made me remember this moment from 2012 when traveling and in a way sick to my stomach for how we use 'renewable energies'!</p>
<p>The TL;DR is that we have to figure a way to consume less energy, or produce less people in the world. I doubt either are coming around soon. All things aside Sir, I will be more pleasant to you per the future. A sincere PEACE!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the premise that we might be burning fossil nearly 100% of the time, it would still make sense to have renewable options that partially work and fallback to fossil only when no renewable alternative is available and that could still help, right?
E.g. a city with solar panel on every house would be able to cover low usage during the day and/or even cover offices/basic work environment and fallback to fossil only at night when everyone gets home and use a lot of energy.
I'm guessing we're not actively doing that because it's a high investment that don't fully pay off due to the need to still burn fossil at important times?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Two problems here.  First, a fossil fuel plant has a huge capital cost to build it in the first place, and if you run it only part of the time, it's harder to recoup that initial investment.  The less you use a power plant, the more each kilowatt-hour costs.</p>
<p>Second, fossil fuel plants can't turn on instantly: all the cost-competitive ones take hours to warm up before they can produce power.  And that's literally warming up, burning fuel but producing no electricity.  So turning them on and off in response to changing demand is something you want to avoid if you can: it's often not physically possible, and even when it is it's wasteful and expensive.</p>
<p>Point being: yes, fossil fuel plants can and will be used as a backup system to deal with the unreliability of renewable energy.  But when operating this way, they're much more expensive and inefficient.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly. They won't pay themselves off for several years at least and many people see it as trying to solve a problem they don't have; to the average person electricity is electricity, there is no difference where it comes from.</p>
<p>There are also some legal and practical challenges to consider. Suppose the power company, a private business, decides that solar panels will save them some money over the long term and are willing to drop the cash to build out the infrastructure. They inform you, a homeowner, that they want to build a series of solar panels on your roof. You won't own those solar panels of course, and the power company will want to reserve the right to access your property and roof at any time for things such as maintenance on their equipment, as well as prohibiting you from doing work or modification on your roof which could interfere with them. Of course this will involve adding a few poles and suspended line across your property (burying power cables would be far too expensive) which again you cannot mess with and they can access at their discretion. This agreement will last for 10 years and anyone you want to sell the property to will also need to accept it. For this you get... nothing. Are you OK with that?</p>
<p>For many people probably not. So even if a power company thought it might be a nice idea the chances they can actually pull it off as an overall transition are slim. The main issue is that the major benefit of renewable energy, benefits to the environment, are not actually tangible benefits to the entities making the decisions and paying the bills. If renewable energy was actually less expensive and these companies as greedy as commonly portrayed then nothing would be stopping them from making it happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even so, wouldn’t having a large solar panel system reduce costs for businesses and government buildings that are operating during the day? </p>
<p>Even if we have to use fossil fuels during the evening for residential areas wouldn’t that make a massive cut in our emissions?</p></div>		</li>
