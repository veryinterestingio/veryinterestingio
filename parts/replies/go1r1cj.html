			<div class="markdown"><p>Cytokine storms is the explanation I've always been taught. This is the first time I've ever heard anything at all about a flu outbreak in the late 1880's allegedly accounting for the low mortality among middle-aged people during the 1918 flu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a well established theory. I think the relevant outbreak was called “Russian flu”. There have been attempts to acquire samples of the virus from graves in the Arctic to compare it with Spanish Flu, but without success so far. Both theories are reasonable, and we simply don’t have the evidence yet.</p></div>		</li>
