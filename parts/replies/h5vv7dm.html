			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an example....</p>
<p>Let's say my father buys $100 of apple stock in 1980, and by 2020, its worth $5,000,000. If he sells this stock, he will have to pay capital gains on the increase in value from the cost basis (the original price it was bought at ... $100), so he'll have to pay capital gains on a $4,999,900 gain. If instead, he never sells, and when he dies, that stock passes to me... The stock's cost basis is revalued at $5,000,000 which means that if I sell it then... I have to pay $0 in capital gains.</p>
<p>TLDR w/out example the step up basis resets the cost basis and allows those who hold a stock for their lifetime to pass the gains on to whoever inherits their assets tax free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally you have to pay (capital gains) taxes on the profit you make from selling an asset, like stocks. Say you buy $1 million of stocks and sell it for $2 million. The $1 million profit you made is subject to taxes. Step up basis essentially readjusts your &quot;buying price&quot; to the current value. So now there is no difference between your buying and selling price, and you don't have to pay (capital gains) tax when you sell the stock.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I'm not pissed bc I wish I were the one on the yacht, tbh not really into rich people stuff and I'm happy with my garden and my cat. I'm pissed bc I have to see the ways the bright, hardworking kids I volunteer with are locked into a system takes advantage of them because their parents are poor immigrants who can't help them navigate our college and career systems. Meanwhile, the rich kids I knew in university cheated their way through shit and failed up. I'm pissed because we've taken out a massive ecological debt which is coming due not only during my lifetime but even more so during the lifetime of people who are children right now. I'm pissed because I live in a country where the ultra wealthy can buy space flights while people with cancer end up homeless. I'm pissed because the cops in my city recently blew up a poor minority neighborhood due to sheer incompetence and the survivors are trying to scrape together money on GoFundMe so they don't become homeless due to repair costs and medical bills. </p>
<p>If you're working to middle class and you think people in our societies just need to work harder/smarter and put their minds to it, congrats, that's what they want you to believe and you've been suckered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be pissed that our tax dollars go to nothing useful. We have out military sure, but that only eats up about a third of our budget. Even if you include police, fire departments, roads and schools, you still have around 40% waste on failed government programs.</p>
<p>I come inequality is needs to exist. It's a choice we make, sure some people have it easier to do better, but we always have the choice to do worse than we're currently doing (unless you're trapped in the welfare state, then you need to work up)</p>
<p>If you're calling people suckers for giving effort to succeed just note that you're mad that the government isn't stealing enough money from someone else because they're stealing a large percentage from you and wasting it. Be mad about the waste. Be mad about the inflated taxes. Get mad at those before you get mad at other people for avoiding paying into the corrupt system.</p></div>		</li>
