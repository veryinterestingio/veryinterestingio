<p>No developmental issues that i know of. Post grad in neuroscience, play competitive soccer, and i like to think I'm socially fairly normal!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My reason for being like this is that I'm naturally left handed, but when I was a kid there was no lefty sports gear available to me. So I had no choice but to learn to play hockey as a righty. Maybe that's why 20 years later, I'm a good skater but bad at stick handling. Tennis and other single-handed things though can be used right or left with the same racket so I had no problem being a lefty there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In racket sports I serve left handed but play right handed.</p>
<p>I throw a rugby Ball left handed but American football right handed.</p>
<p>In general I do finesse things left handed (writing, snooker/pool, shooting, screwdriver, hammering a nail) and force things right handed (throwing, golf / cricket, hammering something that's stuck,)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually beneficial in hockey to play &quot;opposite&quot; handed when compared to baseball, golf, etc. This is because there is an advantage in having your dominant hand on the back end of the stick.. stick handling is 90% your back end hand, and their are many situations where you only have your one hand on the stick to do a wide move or poke check etc. </p>
<p>If you watch the NHL, almost all the players play left handed - it's not that hockey strangely attracts left handed people, it's that properly taught right handed kids learn hockey &quot;left&quot; handed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the difference in your pistol and rifle shooting to do with eye dominance? I'm right handed, but shoot a rifle left handed because my left eye is super dominant and I basically can't look down a scope with my right eye. Also use a camera with my left eye.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cross dominance </p>
</blockquote>
<p>that's normally how its determined because most people have a dominant eye on their strongest side however a lot of people have the opposite eye dominant to the side they shoot with.
The youtuber hicock45 shoots right handed but is left eye dominant for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can confirm, I'm cross-dominant, and I'm a shit developer. I mostly just blame being taught Java as my first programming language though, which makes me feel better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ambidexterity is fairly commonplace among people who struggle with Developmental Coordination Disorder (or dyspraxia). It's pretty much the way you described: because of developmental issues, both sides are kind of equally wonky; because the learning curve is so steep for both hands, kids with dyspraxia will often switch from one to the other, or use each hand in a task-specific manner. (Source: I have this dyspraxia shit.)</p>
<p>I grew up writing equally well (or equally poorly) no matter which hand I used, so I used to write with one hand until it got tired and switch to the other. Because the doctors encouraged me to play a lot of sports as a kid to develop my coordination skills, I got <em>really</em> good at soccer (right foot dominant) and catching/throwing a baseball (both of which I do left-handed). As I've gotten older, I've skewed further to right-handedness, but there are definitely little vestiges of my childhood ambidexterity that I don't really notice until I actually sit down to do something. (My handwriting remains absolutely atrocious no matter which or how many hands I use.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've basically trained myself to use whichever hand is closer if I'm picking up one object.</p>
<p>Recently I work towards drawing utilizing both hands, which are very challenging to synchronize.</p>
<p>My experience is always different than others, but I find choosing a proper writing utensil and focusing on a style of script can help improve your actual ability to write.  Usually I'd do this for calligraphy practice.</p>
<p>You really do have to practice better handwriting if you want it though.  I would think the best way is repeating the process we learned as a child so you focus on letters and repetition alone to improve similarity in each letter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much how I came across it! I'd struggled with this nonsense for about thirty years, but had no real explanation for why I was <em>different</em>. I just knew that I struggled with very basic things (cleaning, cooking, holding objects without dropping them) but was otherwise fairly bright and was definitely <em>aware</em> that I had these issues. </p>
<p>A few years back, I was working for an insurance company, and my job involved researching medical conditions and assessing their severity. I was reading up on Omega-3 fish oil, which was listed as a potential treatment for something called &quot;dyspraxia&quot; or &quot;Developmental Coordination Disorder.&quot; The second name really struck a nerve, and brought to mind my confusing (and uncoordinated) childhood, when my doctor was (briefly) concerned that I had something like cerebral palsy. Reading a list of symptoms was like reading my own biography. I forwarded the page to both of my parents who immediately responded with versions of &quot;This is definitely you.&quot; I later received a proper diagnosis from my GP, but the tricky thing with dyspraxia is that, even if you do have it diagnosed, there really isn't much in the way of treatment outside of practice, practice, practice and the patience of a saint. (I often lack the latter.) Fish oil doesn't do much of anything, either. ;-) </p>
<p>Certain of the ways dyspraxia manifests itself (disorganized thoughts and behavior, poor time management skills) do resemble ADHD. I hope that learning about dyspraxia helps you better address those issues: it's best to think of dyspraxia less as a grievance or a sentence and more as a framework for understanding what you're struggling with and how best to work on those things.</p></div>		</li>
