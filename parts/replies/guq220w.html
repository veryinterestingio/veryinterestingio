Unless you’re in a ship, for some reason I’m imagining all of this as a lone astronaut powerlessly flying through space because you fucked up ages ago and got detached</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thought of seeing the stars slowly get blacked out while this dark spot gets bigger and bigger terrifies me, especially because this whole time I’ve been picturing myself floating through space alone in a spacesuit. Just yup, flying towards this dark spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Im imagining being adrift in a space ship with no means of propulsion, and slowly realizing that more and more stars are going dark. I start wondering if Im losing my mind from some kind of space cabin fever, and then realizing that its a gargantuan object ahead of me.</p>
<p>And that's how I end up getting eaten by a space whale.</p>
<p>(also r/megalophobia is kinda relevant I think)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That planet with the water tornados was always the worst for me, when I played I went there first. Went for a little walk and then a tornado hit the island.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! The question was about visibility and illumination and all the responses are just focusing on the space between objects and the idea of hitting something, which OP only used as an hypothetical result of no visibility.</p></div>		</li>
