			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, is SARS 2.0 different from COVID-19? Asking because Iâ€™ve only heard of one SARS.</p>
<p>Edit: Comments below indicate that SARS 2.0 is the same as SARS-CoV-2, the disease that causes COVID-19, the current coronavirus pandemic. Thank you everyone for your helpful replies!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. COVID19 is the title of the disease but the actual virus is SARS-Cov2. AKA SARS 2.0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are calling the virus SARS-CoV2 thus some call it SARS 2.0. The disease you get is COVID-19.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>COVID-19 is a very similar disease to the one that causes SARS, and the virus itself is very similar.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The push to call it COVID-19 was a deliberate move by the WHO in mid-late February (after scientists had already decided to call the virus SARS-CoV-2). They didn't want to create a mass panic in southeast Asia by dredging up the spectre of SARS (which was mostly infecting people already in hospitals, and had a terribly high mortality rate).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why the WHO often refer to &quot;the virus that causes Covid-19&quot; rather than giving the name.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, because SARS stands for Severe Accute Respiratory Syndrome, which is a syndrome, and COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS CoV-2) is a form of SARS.</p></div>		</li>
