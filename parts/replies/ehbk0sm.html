			<div class="markdown"><p>“I can tell it’s shopped by the pixels” </p>
<p>Answer but it’s kind of similar to how HDR on phones can make pictures look crazy and unnatural (as dictated by ‘older’ style cameras)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its actually often easy to see. You can often tell if background blur is real or fake by looking closely at the edges of the near motive, especially if there is some background visible through some long hair or similar, maybe a «hole» inbetween an arm and the body, etc, then you can often see unblurred background behind the hair, through the hole and so on. </p>
<p>On a camera with an aperture setting and focal length that gives low depth of field the background would of course be blurry in these places too, but the AI that on phones that tries to fake it does often not catch these areas.</p>
<p>This is not 100% of course, some motives are easier for the AI to isolate than others, but very often the motive of these shots are a human, and hair can be a real bitch to isolate. So if you look closely you can actually very often tell by some of the pixels and having seen a lot of computational photography ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how much guesswork is involved in the specific algorithm. Artificial background blur will often leave a trace, as fine detail like hair <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/9077521352/iphone-xs-how-does-the-variable-bokeh-effect-compare-to-a-real-lens" target="_blank">doesn't get blurred correctly</a>. HDR and multiple exposures (e.g. panorama) will have trouble dealing with fast moving objects.</p>
<p>But fundamentally there is nothing that separates a photo done via computational photography from a 'real' photo, as photography has <a href="https://petapixel.com/2013/09/12/marked-photographs-show-iconic-prints-edited-darkroom/" target="_blank">employed many similar tricks</a> long before digital was even a thing. Today you just get it automated and at the press of a button.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its very linked to marketing also. The fact that more cameras allow you to have better pictures does not mean that you will have better pictures with more cameras. As you said, the amount of computational photography is very important for picture quality, not so much for marketing. Having more cameras make people believe the image quality has to be better because of all the reasons why it CAN be better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reminds me of the Megapixel craze of the mid-late 2000's. Everyone believed that the higher the Megapixel output of your camera, the better the pictures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sufficient levels of camera shittiness, no amount of skill can overcome how bad the camera is; and most early digitals <em>were</em> that shitty. The &quot;megapixel wars&quot; were just the cameras going from shitty to decent. (They went on long after the cameras caught up and became decent, sure, because people were trained to care about megapixels. But it was <em>originally</em> a good measure for &quot;progress away from too-shitty-to-use cameras.&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Erm, depends on what you want for a low light photo. With the correct exposure settings, you could get fantastic low light photos on a Lumia 1020. Google's newest Night Sight does a great job, but it's not quite a those levels. That said, I can actually take pictures quickly on my Pixel 2, something I could do on my (now retired) Lumia 1020.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want a camera that is good at everything, it's not going to be small because you need multiple lenses in a row to correct for the spherical distortion, chromatic distortions etc. Since they can't put a bulky lens on a phone, instead they added more cameras that are good at different things, then take many pictures with each at different settings and use the computer in the phone to combine them together in a particular way to make an image that looks like a picture taken with a good camera. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about the number of lenses, it's about the amount of light coming in. That's the dominant factor in your signal to noise ratio at the end of the day. It's also why even the low-level DSLRs (Nikon d3300 for example) can't perform very well indoors with their kit lenses. Sensor isn't good enough, and the lenses don't let very much light in.</p></div>		</li>
