			<div class="markdown"><p>I have Crohn's disease and I am unable to take NSAIDs, I believe this might be the missing link between the varying ideas behind this. My inflammatory disease reacts to the drug and perforates my stomach and intestinal lining. Perhaps with the way this virus attacks our bodies, people's immune systems are reacting to these drugs more like someone with an inflammatory disease.</p>
<p>Anyway, just food for thought. Crohn's flare-ups have been worse since having Coronavirus and it's pretty clear in these experiences the virus hurts our immune systems.</p></div>		</li>

Complications that would normally be extremely rare could become much more prevalent once the virus is attack the endothelial cells of blood-vessels or the gut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, all the NSAIDs inhibit the action of the same two enzymes (COX1 and 2), though some more strongly one than the other.<br />
Steroids act through a different mechanism, though, and at least dexamethasone has been shown to reduce the risk of death in seriously ill patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't going for 95-99.9 confidence margins they typically go for. They are looking for stuff with 1-2 standard deviations of helping and hurting. </p>
<p>Right now it's often more important to be fast then accurate. The accuracy will come in time but right now it's much more a odds game then we have ever seen.</p>
<p>That does leave us open for other problems like the Lancet retraction of a bunk study ok HCQ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you expect NSAIDs to have a very large absolute effect on COVID severity, you don't need a cohort in the thousands to detect it. If it can't be determined within a few hundred patients, it either does not exist, is too small of an effect to pick up with that sample size, or the study was flawed methodologically. I see no reason to suspect the latter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on the type of study. If you're trying to prove the efficacy of a drug or hunt for a specific interaction or mechanism, i.e. if you <em>reject</em> the null hypothesis, you will need a larger sample size. What this study does is the opposite--it proves no statistical correlation, or <em>affirms</em> the null hypothesis with a P-value of 0.95. In other words, given the conditions of their study and the outcome, their sample set was sufficient to affirm the absence of a statistical correlation between ibuprofen use and worse health outcomes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not related to ibuprofen, but aspirin. As they learn more about Covid19, they're discovering a large cause of respiratory failure, myocardial infarcts, strokes, and kidney failure is due to clotting in the microvasculature of very vascular organs. Apparently taking baby aspirin (also an nsaid) has proven relatively effective in reducing complications for those attempting to manage covid while at home/pre hospitalization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is rather misleading. The trial that you linked to hasn't posted results, so it's unclear if there is any effect for aspirin.</p>
<p>In a hospital settings, anticoagulants are clearly used regularly and successfully in the context of Covid, but from my understanding there are differences between deep vein and arterial thrombosis, and different blood thinners affect these differently - so it might be somewhat premature to just tell people to take aspirin left and right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>aspirin is well-known in the medical field to increase the amount of time that blood needs to clot.  when we need &quot;normal blood samples&quot; to run on the coagulation analyzers, they specifically look for our healthy co-workers that have not taken any painkillers (particularly aspirin) for at least 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Source: i work in a hospital lab and they do this every year to help prove the instrument is putting out expected results.</p>
<p>That being said, the purpose of taking the aspirin would likely be to delay the onset of body-wide microclotting (which has been observed in many COVID patient autopsies) long enough to get proper treatment at a hospital.</p>
<p>edit: covered a missed point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am aware of the anti clotting properties of Aspirin, that is literally the logic behind these studies, that there is reduced clotting in the microvasculature of highly vascular organs, reducing complications and lowering mortality rate. </p>
<p>Read the comment first. I'm not comparing aspirin to ibuprofen for their prostaglandin inhibiting effects.</p></div>		</li>
