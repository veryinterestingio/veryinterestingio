			<div class="markdown"><p>More &quot;unstable&quot; would suit it better. It basically mean it's prone to vaporizing, the more volatile, the more prone to vaporize it is.</p>
<p>Iirc, what makes it more volatile is a mixture of the molecule's weight and the strength of the bonds between them.</p>
<p>And what are you asking with the carbon based thing? (Fix, apparently yeah, they all contain carbon)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! And yeah. That was a dumb question - obviously they contain carbon (My chemistry knowledge is so limited). What I am trying to ask I guess is: are animal and plant proteins/oils, living things that we eat, more likely to have volatile compounds? The examples I’m think of all seem to. Mostly because nothing we heat up to eat is like a rock. Like most things I’m thinking of now that we eat change their texture or state easily.</p></div>		</li>
