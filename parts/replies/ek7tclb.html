They did have one persons pressure suit fail in a test and he actually passed out before they could get to him, he said he could fell the saliva in his tongue evaporate before he lost consciousness.  I don’t remember his name though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is the only well-documented case of a human exposed to a strong vacuum. While the crew of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_11" target="_blank">Soyuz 11</a> experienced vacuum as well they died and we don't know what exactly happened to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's the only well documented case of the <em>inside</em> of a human being exposed to hard vacuum. People have stuck their arms in vacuum chambers, mostly for internet points and I'm sure that some doctor in the early space race probably shoved a guy's entire lower body into vacuum, for science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to Soyuz 11, it's crazy to me to read &quot;The three crew members of Soyuz 11 are the only humans known to have died in space.&quot;</p>
<p>It instantly makes me think of the future and what might be in store for humans and space travel. I'm not saying human deaths because of the vacuum of space is a good thing, but I just picture a group of young people who live with space-travel on a daily basis and maybe take it for granted because of everything humans have learned from people perishing.</p>
<p>I mean think about the things we take for granted now, clean water, job safety standards, etc. Space travel is an incredible concept just to fantasize about, but it's very possible that one day some kid is gonna be traveling for work to some remote moon and it'll be just another day for him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just vacuum, the room is sprayed down with liquid nitrogen first to get the interior surface temperature to -180 C or so, then they vacuum out the room. So you can test for cold tolerance and pressure at the same time; they really wanted to mimic the moon conditions as best they could. Source: went to NASA and took the tour the other day. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: the largest chamber is at NASA GSC.</p>
<p>Edit 2: asked a friend that gets to work with the vacuum chambers at JSC, the chamber Jim Leblanc was in is probably chamber b. She also said that Johnson may have other man rated chambers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Developing pressure suits and pressurized cabins was a long running process started in the 1920 when aircraft were being developed to reach higher altitudes.  When it came time to build spacesuits there was plenty of existing R&amp;D already done by the military already reaching the edge of space in experimental aircraft. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The direct parent of the space suit was a suit developed for ppl to work in a large vacuum chamber and test vacuum tube components without sealing them individually: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/24/us/siegfried-hansen-space-suit-father-inventor-was-90.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/24/us/siegfried-hansen-space-suit-father-inventor-was-90.html</a></p>
<p>Interestingly this means that the vacuum chambers were created first and the suits were made after so people could work in them (as opposed to creating the vacuum chamber to test the suits. :) )</p></div>		</li>
