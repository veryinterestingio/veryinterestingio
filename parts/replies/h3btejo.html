			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I’m putting my kids to bed, their white noise machine has a lot more noises to it when you actually listen to it.  I’m pretty sure it uses the same “noise” that static is made up of, and it has all these weird “tings” “beeps” and “tones” in it.  </p>
<p>Kinda trippy</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don’t have cable or live near enough to a city, so all the tv channels are The Big Bang Show. </p>
<p>(Actually all the stations here are broadcasting in digital now.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They broadcast silence.</p>
<p>Think of it like the number 0 in math. 0 is something, it’s a number but it doesn’t hold the value that positive and negative numbers.</p>
<p>Where as an answer being undefined is like no broadcast. There is nothing measurable going on.</p>
<p>Or how you can tell someone that nothing is going on, which is different than not telling them anything. You’ve still shared information</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get the same static when you use an analog tv receiver without a set channel or without an antenna. I loved to look at it and listen, kinda like rain sounds on a window or such.</p></div>		</li>
