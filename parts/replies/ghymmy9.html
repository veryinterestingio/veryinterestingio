			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit off topic but even that the majority of the soy is for cattle consumption, with a change in habits of the world population the production in mostly rural countries like mine (Brazil) would still increase due to developed countries focusing their land into another products. A example is the fact that 2020 increase in soy production in Brazil was caused by China reduction, now imagine this in a world scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely a population issue. The earth could handle 7 billion humans, but the &quot;true&quot; human population is much higher due to the tens of billions of animals we use for food. In fact, livestock accounts for 60% of the earth's mammalian biomass.</p></div>		</li>
