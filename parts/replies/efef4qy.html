<p>Adding to this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_mirabile" target="_blank">birds have a special heat exchange system</a> in their feet that allows them to have blood circulating in their feet without a lot of heat loss. The fast circulation of birds is also helping with this so there are no critically cold parts. </p>
<p>Besides that there isn't that much liquid in their feet anyways and their feet are mostly tendons and bones with little muscle or nerve tissue.</p>
<p>And of course, standing on one leg is also helping some birds. </p></div>		</li>
