			<div class="markdown"><p>This is difficult for a few reasons. First, to my knowledge the only studies on this have been based on questionnaires and/or self-reporting (a new preprint from Iran recently appeared finding a strong correlation between self-reported anosmia and COVID-19, for example: <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041889v1.article-metrics" target="_blank">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041889v1.article-metrics</a>). We don't have yet have quantitative data with actual taste or smell testing.
Second, We don't have good data on how prevalent smell loss is with other viral infections of the upper respiratory system (we know ~20% anosmia cases result from viral infections). So it is hard to compare COVID-19 to other URIs.</p></div>		</li>
