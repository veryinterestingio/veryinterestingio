			<div class="markdown"><p>The important distinction between gaslighting and lying is the induced self doubt.</p>
<p>When you tell someone a lie, that's... well, lying.  When they find a counterexample and you convince them to trust you over their own observations, <em>that's</em> gaslighting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Qualified yes.</p>
<p>If someone is legitimately psychotic, obviously convincing them that what they believe isn't real in the interest of helping them in good faith isn't gaslighting, but I hesitate to bring that up because it could easily cause someone to justify their shitty actions.</p>
<p>I also don’t know enough about psychosis to say whether or not that’s actually a good idea anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains why the term seems so overused today. A lot of people being accused of gaslighting today are just lying and happen to be lying to people who just learned a new word.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a liar goes out of his way to craft believable lies that won’t be contradicted in an attempt to undermine your understanding of the truth.</p>
<p>A gaslighter repeatedly tells you things you both know aren’t true as he’s saying them in an attempt to undermine your trust in your own faculties.</p>
<p>They both involve lies, but they’re vastly different in how they work and what they’re attempting to do.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like give a man a fish/teach a man to fish, but the opposite.</p>
<p>Lying is leading you away from truth.  Gaslighting is leading you away from the ability to tell what’s true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is overused on reddit nowadays. Recently I saw it used because a person was lying about stealing something. That simply is lying, every lie is told with the intention of making someone believe it over the actual truth. Gaslighting is defined over repetition and the intention to make the victim question their own perception in general, not to get away with one single incident. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do interviews at a company for additional members to join my team. </p>
<p>The company was bought out by someone else. I was also taken off of the interview team. </p>
<p>The new owner would constantly tell people that he had &quot;You are not as great at your job as you think you are. I have stacks of resumes of people more qualified than us and willing to work for less pay&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I kept my eye on a job listing, because I thought I was useless now. However after 6 months of the same job listing staying up it struck me. New owner guy kept using the same job description and requirements on the job sites, so I knew that the quality of resumes he must be getting, which means he had to be lying. My team and I were still fucking awesome. This job listing must be getting the same quality of resumes. So I applied and knocked it out of the park, ended up getting hired at over double my old pay. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>From then on I decided only I can tell me what I am worth and I will not be told otherwise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just came from a relationship like this and I would also like to note that it can have the ability to cause a person to commit suicide over the self-doubt. It can truly destroy a person to their very core. Trusting oneself is something we don't think about until we're attacking ourselves over someone else's manipulation 'game'. It truly fucks with your head.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gaslighting is not just lying to someone so they question what is true or not. All lies will make you question what is true or not (unless they're unbelievable lies.)</p>
<p>It is manipulating someone so they question their own sanity. </p>
<p>Basically every psychological thriller you have ever seen is based around gaslighting. Most Hitchcock movies, Gone Girl, A Simple Favor, Sleeping with the Enemy, Fear... etc.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's a personal attack on the subject's self confidence about their recollection of past actions and words.  The gaslighter will contradict the subject's recollections - small details to big - usually over an extended period - to erode and chip away at the victim's sense of sanity by constantly saying that what they remember is untrue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He isn't dimming the lights on purpose.</p>
<p>He is working on his murders in the attick, and when he turns his gaslight on, the pressure drops in the house and thus the lights dim.</p>
<p>He lies to cover his tracks but this in turn causes his spouse to doubt her sanity, which gives him unparalleled leverage to dictate an allabi - which she parrots to the police.</p>
<p>Gaslighting is a term for when one person lies to cover their own sins by placing the onus onto others typically the one calling them out, in doing so they attempt to convert them into their narrative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boss - Where is the report I asked you for.</p>
<p>GL - You never asked me</p>
<p>Boss - I emailed you</p>
<p>GL - I never saw an email you should ask me over the phone</p>
<p>Boss - I did call you</p>
<p>GL - Maybe you thought about calling, but I never got a call.</p>
<p>Boss - Well I need that report</p>
<p>GL - I will have it to you by COB on Friday</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gaslighter dictates his terms and the doubt raised in the victims mind gives him leverage.</p>
<p>In turn the victim internalises the issue and tries to correct themselves, however, they will never succeed and it takes a third party to break the cycle of manipulation.</p>
<p>This is why a psychological manipulator tries to isolate you from your friends and family. Through disapproval or direct altercation.</p>
<p>Food for thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Relative strangers giving lavish gifts including partners early in the relationship. Usually it is a seed for future manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partner cancelling plans with your relatives or friend groups but able to go out with thiers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>having nights in on your own when they are out as you have no social group?</p>
<ul>
<li>Always keep in touch with people you care about!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hiding their phone or being happy until they see you, to them you are stressful, as they have to make effort to control you.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are worried about being gaslighted you need to get a third party involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes... And no.  This might be the original sense of gaslighting, but now the term is used more generally to refer to people who maliciously manipulate the sense of truth and reality of people close to them.  The ulterior purpose is of no relevance to that definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. I started seeing a therapist specifically because I was starting to doubt what I would otherwise believe was reality without question, eg things I directly saw, said, heard, or experienced but my partner was frequently convincing me my recollection was totally wrong and the cognitive dissonance I was starting to feel on a regular basis was frightening. I started seeing the therapist and started writing things down (especially after arguments) so that I would be able to look back at the writing or confer with the therapist to confirm my recollection of events. Dating someone with borderline personality disorder can be a harrowing experience. I credit the therapist with giving me the unbiased observations that I needed to hear to confirm that I could both trust my own mind and experiences and that I needed to get out of that relationship immediately.</p></div>		</li>
