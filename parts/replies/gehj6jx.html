			<div class="markdown"><p>Landlord here in Canada, I'm also interested in an answer to this (although it's probably different than in the US). My tenant seems good and I'd be happy to help them out with building their credit, especially since their credit isn't great right now. I did a credit check before they moved in and it feels only fair that if they are paying rent on time it should help improve their credit score.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same with most utility bills (phone, electricity, etc.).</p>

<p>This might be different around the world but in the UK pretty much all utilities (including internet and mobile phone contracts) are usually reported, as long as they're contracted rather than pay as you go or credit based.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eRentPayments . com is one site that can do that for free. But your landlord/property manager has to use their service for you to pay your rent. Then you can go in and submit to have it reported on your credit, and your landlord/property manager can agree.</p></div>		</li>
