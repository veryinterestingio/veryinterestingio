<p>Yes, an organisms body prioritizing efficiency by atrophy is a popular method of them maximizing their fitness, but it wasnt caused by Evolution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you saying their muscles don’t atrophy because they’re way more physically active than humans or are you saying it’s physically impossible for their muscles to atrophy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually on this one I would argue you could reduce it to a body level. Your statement about evolution is correct, but the talk between the motor neuron and the muscle fiber does stimulate rest/repair/stay ready to work activities in the muscle fiber. If that discussion isn't occuring, the muscle itself will no longer maintain itself as well. It's an evolutionary born process, but the causative Agent is your body.</p></div>		</li>
