			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes, for better batery life you should keep your phone at 50 to 90 % of its battery capacity.</p>
<p>Also never let it drain, as this puts a lot of stress on the battery.</p>
<p>I would have liked that manufacturers made customers more aware of this info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although there is an entire layer of circuitry between the battery and the charging port that changes depending on battery chemistry. I believe most devices already take things like that into account, so when your phone says 100% or 0% it does not nessicarly mean that the battery is actually at that exact charge.</p>
<p>Look at your phones manual, it should tell you what practices you should take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern Li-Ion battery management/charging integrated circuits do this automatically. 100% on you phone does not indicate 4.2V necessarily. It can be programmed via registers on the power management IC. Any phone after about 2015 should manage it's battery life automatically, so no need to be neurotic about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The optimal scenario is you only charge it to the level you actually need so you end your use around 20% remaining. In practice without software that allows you to set max charge level (such as on a Tesla) this is extremely impractical.  </p>
<p>For longer term storage 30-70% is best</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The battery is only going to last a limited number of cycles even using it at 20%-70% charge, and it's not going to last forever plugged in at 100% indicated.</p>
<p>Some options:</p>
<p>A. leave plugged in, phone stops charging at 70%<br />
B. charge to 70%, then unplug charger, but plugged in while watching video/app updates/games/etc<br />
C. charge to 100%, leave plugged as much as possible<br />
D. charge to 70%, then unplug charger, use unplugged  </p>
<p>How do these rank?  Obviously A is the best, but it's not an option on most phones.</p>
<p>After that seems unclear.  For instance, if just cell and background apps drain the battery in 2 days is that doing more damage from use than plugged in at 100% indicated?  I guess it depends on what 100% indicated actually means, how bad your coverage is, how much energy it uses on standby, and a lot of other variables.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would say the optimal scenario is to develop a battery that can actually handle a 100% charge instead of pussy-footing around with this partial charge nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My new laptop has options for setting the max charge of the battery. If you're planning on leaving it hooked up to the wall semi-permanently, they recommend setting it at 60% capacity and only switching it to full charge when you plan to take it somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The manufacturer has to give you the software because apparently charging is a BIOS related function. You can get apps that play a sound at certain levels to remind you to unplug, not as carefree that way though.</p></div>		</li>
