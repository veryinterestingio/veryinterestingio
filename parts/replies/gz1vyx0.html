			<div class="markdown"><p>The house wouldn't take that bet, especially with fights unless it was king Kong vs your 4 year old nephew.   You can bet some other guy directly, but gambling places and casinos don't give odds that will bankrupt them</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. Seriously. The house is really quiet and I'm beginning to get worried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do give some crazy high odds. The year Leicester won the Premiere League the odds at the start of the season were 5000 to 1. But it was also so very unlikely to happen. Heck a few years ago the Oriels had 1,000 to 1 odds to make the playoffs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thr house sets the odds, so they know whats up. If you come in with different odds, they'll know immediately you tried to changed it and probably kick you out (or worse) for trying to cheat, even if you did win the original bet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the odds determined by the bets coming in?  Like if everyone starts to bet on red, will the odds change in Redâ€™s favor for future bets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the workers are told by the bosses you can't accept a bet over x to prevent this. If its the mob for example they might take a bet like this with approval from a low level boss in charge of the area who know for a fact they can collect on it when they lose. Why waste your time and resources on a bet you'll lose or cant collect on when you have a line out the door for easy bets</p></div>		</li>
