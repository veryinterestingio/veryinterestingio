<p>A turbine is installed at the bottom of pipe and the effluent water reconnects with the original creek/river. </p>
<p>This is common for river/creeks with significant natural elevation changes, where the hydrostatic pressure is the main energy driver instead of volumetric flowrate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good addition, there are definately many installations like that around the world. Another one to add to the conversation would be 'microhydro' systems. I didnt include them simply because of the mention of river in the question. These systems are typically very small, less than 10kw, with many at the lower end of the range. You could build a micro hydro setup with a small portion of a river, but they typically use most or all of a small mountain creek, atleast in the installations ive been familiar with. A great technology for remote/mountainous areas nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am very happy to have opened even one more mind to hydrokinetics. There are many places around the world where the population is not served by a power grid but lives on the edge of a river. These people would be very well served by hydrokinetics, however, it is still an industry in its infancy.</p></div>		</li>
