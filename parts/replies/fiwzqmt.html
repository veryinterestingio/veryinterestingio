			<div class="markdown"><p>For a tasty example have a glass of Pinot Noir and really focus on the taste and the effect it has on your tongue and mouth.  Then sip some water to clear your palette, and have a glass of Malbec.  The Malbec should make your mouth pucker a little, your tongue feel chappy, and any sweetness or fruitiness should be mild, if not altogether vacant.  </p>
<p>There <em>are</em> fruity, dry wines as well, but any sweetness will take away that dry taste immediately, especially in the case of white wines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may be confusing “dry” for “tannic”. That chapped puckered feeling is caused by high tannins. Malbec can be both fruity and tannic, but in my experience they are more jammy than dry. Whereas a Cab Sauv, or a Bordeaux blend is dry and tannic, which is to say the flavor profile is more earthy and leathery than it is jammy and sweet, thus making it a “dry” wine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Fruity” doesn’t generally refer to sweetness but to the presence of fruit esters, which give a fruity <em>aroma</em>. Obviously some people may use “fruity” to imply sweetness, but that usage is by no means universal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Norton varieties you find here in the midwest are quite dry and very fruity (blackberry/cherry). There are some sweet ones but my favorites are super dry.</p>
<p>They're also not very tannic at all, so it's an overall pleasant experience if you're not a fan of sweet reds.</p>
<p>I'm particularly fond of the Montelle Vinyard Cynthiana.</p></div>		</li>
