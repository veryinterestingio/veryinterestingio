			<div class="markdown"><p>The true subtractive primary are Cyan, Magenta, Yellow.   But red and blue are familiar to young children, and close to Magenta and Cyan.  So they are taught instead</p>
<p>The apparent overlap in RGB and RYB is part of what makes it hard to teach about  additive and subtractive.</p>
<p>Red + Blue = White minus green = Magenta</p>
<p>Red + Green = White minus Blue = Yellow</p>
<p>Blue + Green = White minus Red = Cyan</p>
<p>Reverse that to subtractive:</p>
<p>Magenta + Yellow = Black minus Cyan = Red</p>
<p>Magenta + Cyan = Black minus Yellow = Blue</p>
<p>Yellow + Cyan = Black minus Magenta = Green</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect answer from OP and you. One cool fact I think people who are not familiar with color and how it works will find interesting is technically you only see in RGB. It sounds intuitive but what that means is when yellow light waves hit your retina, which have no sensors that specifically pick up yellow light, it stimulates the Red and Green cones but the blue cones are like, &quot;What? I don't see anything.&quot; Your brain then takes this signal and says, &quot;That's yellow,&quot; and you perceive it. I just think it's cool that evolution basically compressed the amount of sensors to see visible light down to 3 distinct ones and they can pick up millions of colors.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you’re like me your red/green cones are damaged so your brain says “that’s red. Or green. It’s red and green. Both. Neither. Okay, it WAS red but now it’s green but now that you’re thinking about it, it’s red again”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although, there are many limitations with trichromatic theory (in assuming that's what you're referring to) . For example, the cones aren't maximally sensitive to R, G, or B light. One of them, can't remember which one, is pretty far off. Color vision still isn't fully understood. Retinex theory is a more current major player.</p>
<p>BTW, one of the cooler things, IMHO, is that our rods produce only B&amp;W colors (in our minds), but are actually maximally stimulated by green wavelengths of light. That's why we see green things better than other colors at night. I've always thought that must be a legacy of our ancient ancestors who roamed at night and ate vegetation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subtractive coloring happens because physical materials mainly only reflect their color.  So when you have, say, yellow and blue paint mixed together, then green is reflected because that's reflected by both yellow nd blue.</p></div>		</li>
