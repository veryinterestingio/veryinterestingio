			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh good analogy! I can hear a song in my head, that doesn't mean my voice is able to hit the right notes, just as I can see a thing in my head, which doesn't mean my hand can reproduce the shapes in pencil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems the ability to draw is not necessarily linked to the ability to see things in your head. My daughter has aphantasia but can draw to a pretty decent degree. Either making it up as she goes or drawing from a picture or real life thing in front of her. My wife can picture things but can't draw the things. </p>
<p>Maybe that's analogous to my inability to imagine music beyond the most simplistic yet I can read music and play it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a way better comparison for me than putting imagination on paper, coming from someone that has problems visualizing images. I do however have incredible ability of replicating songs in my head, but I have 0 instrument ability. It all comes down to practice</p></div>		</li>
