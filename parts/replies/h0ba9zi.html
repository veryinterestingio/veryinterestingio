<p>I think you get a second level of anxiety at night too.  (On work/school nights at least.)  You get in bed and think &quot;OMG, as soon as I wake up, here's all the responsibilities I have to take care of!&quot; Where with a nap it's usually at a time when you would wake up and not have a lot on your plate.</p></div>		</li>
