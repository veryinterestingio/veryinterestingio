			<div class="markdown"><p>The port shouldn't weaken, as the springs and pins are in the (ideally) cheap cable. If the port itself is weakening, I recommend never buying from that manufacturer again. What's next, a touchscreen that wears through?</p></div>		</li>

Mine are both loose, took it to Apple, have to replace the whole main board so I passed.. if you have the USB ports on both sides model one side can be replaced easily. Inexpensively</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so the port itself is breaking away from the circuit board? If so, that's shitty apple engineering as ports shouldn't just be lifting from the pcb.</p>
<p>As far as the repair goes, it should be easy enough to reflow new ports on. Any mildly competent laptop repair shop should be able to do this relatively cheaply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Pixel 2 (Port: USB-C) over time got worse and worse at having the cable slip out, and eventually got to the point where it wouldn't charge unless I held it in my hand and constantly held pressure to push the cable in.</p>
<p>I eventually spotted a comment on reddit where someone mentioned dust/lint buildup in a usb c device port causing similar issues. I pulled a boatload of what must have been pocket lint out using a needle to carefully scrape around in the port and it's been going strong with no issues for about 2 years since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, I own a USB-C device for 4 years that is still going strong. I went to UBreakIFix and instead of replacing the port, the tech told me he's going to try cleaning it first. It worked consistently afterwards, he didn't even charge me, nice fellow. (Didn't think about cleaning the port before bringing it in)</p>
<p>Mileage may vary but the cables will probably break first rather than the port. I've had shitty Belkin cables that just simply stopped working, Anker has still been going strong through many years, I still use their MicroUSB cable that I got 7 odd years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a Pixel 3 and the only cable that will reliably stay in it is the charger for my Thinkpad. Every other cable just wants to pop right out. I've cleaned the shit out of that port with everything I can think of, it doesn't help. The Thinkpad charger stays in just fine, nothing else will. I am starting to wonder if the notches on the port are worn down.</p></div>		</li>
