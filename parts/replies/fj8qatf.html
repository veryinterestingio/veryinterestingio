			<div class="markdown"><p>It could likely contribute, but probably not that much.</p>
<p>The difference in &quot;wiring&quot; in an ADHD brain is such that when doing something which is perceived as &quot;work&quot;, AKA &quot;anything you think you have to do but don't want to&quot;, the brain basically goes on strike and doesn't want to focus or put energy toward that activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when doing something which is interesting, or in other ways is an activity the ADHD person wants to do, the brain gets <em>more</em> active than normal and likes to stay focused on that activity for <em>longer</em> than normal.</p>
<p>So you end up with someone who can't find the energy to go to the grocery store, because this hypothetical person perceives grocery shopping as a &quot;chore&quot;. However, at the <em>same</em> time they would be able to talk with great enthusiasm for hours about their hobbies, until suddenly they run out of energy in about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I'm basically doing this right now... have spent the last 8 hours failing to make significant progress on a difficult homework assignment, but I've spent a good 20 minutes writing (and then revising about 4 times) this comment because my I found the act of explaining ADHD behavior accurately but in a concise manner an interesting challenge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's not entirely accurate. ADHD is believed to be an executive function disorder. So its not that your brain goes on strike for work, but rather your brain simply cannot prioritize its focus in an organized manner. This means that your brain will unpredictably focus on whatever is around. your just as able to hyperfocus on work as anything else, except there's way more &quot;everything else&quot; so it's much less likely. Of course it's not completely random either so some activities will draw your attention more easily than other, but it's difficult to control or predict. For example, I love to read and was an avid reader all through my childhood. As I got older my ADHD got worse and after a few years I can't read longer passages without my meds. I get distracted by my own mind and will forget what I just read, sometimes forgetting it as I'm reading it, and having to re-read every other line to understand whats going on. This isn't a chore, especially now that i'm out of school, but I can't do anything to fight it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partly. Predominantly, it's not energy that those of us with ADHD have an issue with, but dopamine. Dopamine plays an important role in decision making and initiating tasks. These decision include things like &quot;don't focus on that noise outside, you're doing your homework&quot; that neurotypical people can do automatically with little to no conscious thought. In a brain suffering from ADHD, there's depleted reserves of dopamine, so the train of thought becomes distracted easily and efforts to return focus chew through what dopamine remains.</p>
<p><em>Energy</em> is therefore often plentiful, but very hard to direct. ADHDers often talk about a state called &quot;hyperfocus&quot;, which seems contradictory when talking about a condition with the words &quot;attention deficit&quot; in its name. In this mode, once a thing has caught their attention, it becomes the sole thing they are capable of processing. As before, though, they still can't <em>direct</em> their focus. Suddenly, it's 5am, they know everything they could find online about the alpaca fleece industry in the 18th and 19th centuries, still haven't completed the report their boss wants later <del>tomorrow</del> <em>today</em>, and haven't slept because their brain still won't let them refocus on boring unimportant things like sleep, even though by this point they are thoroughly exhausted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with ADHD, this is exactly how it works. If I am uninterested in something keeping focus on it is almost impossible, as literally anything will override it and force me to concentrate to keep it up. A battle which frankly I never hold ground on for any period.</p>
<p>If I like it though, or find it compelling I can be there working it for hours on end. In my case, it either is video games due to the high action and attention grabbing things or fire, cause I am a fucking Pyromaniac, that can consistently grab my attention without me getting that bored. Thus, I got a job working as a metalsmith / Jeweler on the side (I have always liked small detailed work too). Usually the only thing that can pull me off any of these things is someone physically forcing me to shift focus or me working on it so long that my body starts feeling like it’s falling to pieces because <em>why have you been doing this for 16 hours straight with absolutely no breaks?</em> I don’t even bloody eat or drink when I get like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Neurons continually fire, and while cognitive tasks increase the firing rate, it's not a substantial enough energy expenditure to cause a big increase in calorie consumption. </p>
<p>Recent research seems to indicate that brain activity leaves a waste byproduct, that is cleaned up during sleep by glial cells. Increased rate of firing, leads to more waste, leads to impaired function and sleepiness. Brain drain without increased calorie consumption</p></div>		</li>
