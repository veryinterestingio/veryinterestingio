			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty good summary: <a href="https://www.oecd-nea.org/science/pubs/2013/6997-minor-actinide.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.oecd-nea.org/science/pubs/2013/6997-minor-actinide.pdf</a>.  And includes a lot of papers on the subject. This new process would be within the homegeneous options.  </p>
<p>The odd part of the this report is that it brings up the interim storage for &gt;30 years to deal with the heat load of Cm to lessen the storage requirements.  And it brings up the safety issues of high decay heat loads and high gamma on reprocessed fuel for a commercial reactor.  But it doesn't point out that the same interim storage can reduce the stated issues for reprocessed fuel. I am still hunting for that paper that put those two together.</p>
<p>And there is the APEX fuel cycles proposed in the 80's: <a href="https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1112330/" target="_blank">https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1112330/</a>. This requires a spallator (particle accelerator) to complete the task. This idea didn't take off because the costs of the spallator was greater than the cost of new uranium.  There are definite modifications of this proposal needed for the modern world, but the idea of using spallators to get through the minor actinides that are minimally useful to fissile Americium and Curium isotopes that provide a lot of energy may be part of the answer. </p>
<p>Both the report and the discussions during the 80's looked at commercial time frames for obvious reasons. But the US is actually now in a position to really consider half century interim storage fuel that reduces a lot of the downsides of minor actinides in reprocessed fuel.  (I would call it MOX fuel but MOX usually means just U and Pu)</p></div>		</li>
