<p>While the universe is opaque to light/photons prior to recombination and the release of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), observations of a gravitational wave background would indeed allow us to peer through the CMB and get direct information on times before  about 380.000 years after the big bang.<br />
Having said that, we can also use observations of the CMB, the large-scale structure of the universe and light element abundances, for instance, to indirectly infer information about the universe at earlier times. This includes particular imprints in the CMB, called B-modes, which would be evidence for primordial gravitational waves.</p></div>		</li>
