			<div class="markdown"><p>RF engineer here. This guy is correct. Let me add this as it pertains to the US: throughput is related to both bandwidth and signal quality regardless of whether or not it’s 3G or 4G channel coding. 3G coding (which refers to the way bits are broadcast wirelessly over air) happens to work better than 4G under less than ideal signal quality conditions. Your phone will always default to 4G if it can. If you’re seeing your phone in 3G mode, it’s very likely signal quality is poor and you’re only seeing 3G because your phone dropped 4G.</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that some major carriers are no longer monitoring or maintaining their 3G infrastructure, but I’m not supposed to talk about that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could actually explain why my service degraded over time.  I had good coverage for years but since the switch to 4G, I am guessing more rural areas are being neglected and older 3G is not being upgraded to 4G quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, in urban areas there is a lot more density of towers, and likely more rf channels available to &quot;re-farm&quot; spectrum from. Most urban areas are covered by multiple frequencies. Therefore... stealing from 3G to use on 4G has a lot less noticable downsides.</p>
<p>For rural though, higher band radios dont really reach far enough to cover anybody. So you often just have a single low-band 850 or 700 channel to use.</p>
<p>... if it was a 10mhz channel and then they refarm 5mhz of that to LTE, then the loss of 3G service is noticable... unless engineers do an exceptional job of balancing the traffic well.  But it's a LOT more difficult to effectively balance traffic across different technologies.</p>
<p>In order to expand rural capacity, telcos need to either win some very very very VERY expensive low-band spectrum licenses at spectrum auctions... or else install more towers and hope the high-band spectrum will cover the people they want it to.</p>
<p>Both options are major money losing propositions for telcos. Especially when very few customers will be covered to help pay back those losses.</p>
<p>In most cases, RMs will need to coordinate to help fund new towers if rural customers want better service.</p>
<p>The trouble is amplified by the way people tend to use their phones. </p>
<p>In short... you can upgrade sites to 4G (and it IS a major upgrade in spectral efficiency) but as soon as people see that they have faster speeds.... they just fuckin seem to use it more. So the capacity boost given by LTE doesnt tend to last for all that long.</p>
<p>On top of that.. many rural users have poor internet options available to them, so they tend to hammer the shit out of the streaming video services on mobile networks as much as they possibly can, compared to urban users.</p>
<p>Source: I work for a telco thats like 70% rural coverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RF Engineering is a subset of electrical engineering and pertains to working with RF, or radio frequency, components.  An RF engineer might work on the design of the RF section of a radio chipset, or in my case, design, commission and optimize cellular networks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RF engineer here, but I work on the handset side of things. Circuit design (Power amplifiers, acoustic filters, module integration, low noise amplifiers), labratory testing of prototypes, data collection, meetings. Usual electrical engineer office stuff. It's a good gig, pays well, flexible hours and lots of work in my area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda, it's... Complicated...</p>
<p>4G when it was first introduced was a standard with a theoretical speed that couldn't be implemented yet, so going from 3G to 4G they called it 4G LTE, which stands for &quot;long term evolution&quot;, which meant it was on the 4g standard, was faster than 3g, but wasn't yet at proper 4g speeds yet. Since LTE is the process of getting to next generation, the path to 5g may be called 5G LTE. But that depends on how companies decide to market it.</p></div>		</li>
