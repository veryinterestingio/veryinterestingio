			<div class="markdown"><p>It was invented for that specific purpose.  Hospitals still use cyanoacrylate to close up some types of wounds (e.g. skin flap on skull).  They tend to use the octylcyanoacrylate ester instead of &quot;superglue&quot; (which is butylcyanoacrylate ester), because the octyl stuff is more flexible once cured -- but the whole &quot;bonds skin instantly&quot; warning is not a side effect, it's the original intent of the stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off-the-shelf superglue also tends to have a lot of methyl- and ethyl-cyanoacrylate esters as well, which are skin irritants for many people.  The octyl- stuff doesn't usually cause those reactions.</p>
<p>And also doesn't vaporize off as much, which means inhaling less of it.</p></div>		</li>
