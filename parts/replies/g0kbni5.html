			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, they have different glands and different orifices that each produce a different kind a web: thin, strong, sticky, etc... They can even combine them together depending on what they need, and even reel the strand back to not waste it. It's pretty amazing.  </p>
<p>Edit : Seven ! They can produce 7 different types of silk. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zheng_Ke2/publication/325272086/figure/fig1/AS:648935018332160@1531729573243/The-seven-types-of-native-silk-glands-and-threads-from-spider-of-Araneus-diadematus.png" target="_blank">Awesome</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2010-05-scientists-goats-spider-silk.html" target="_blank">Scientists breed goats that produce spider silk</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Goats that produce spider silk protein in their milk could enable researchers to collect large quantities of the silk.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also referred to as BioSteel because of its strength.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioSteel" target="_blank">BioSteel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is reportedly 7-10 times as strong as steel if compared for the same weight, and can stretch up to 20 times its unaltered size without losing its strength properties. It also has very high resistance to extreme temperatures, not losing any of its properties within −20 to 330 degrees Celsius (−4 to 626 degrees Fahrenheit).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paging /u/lando55: I don't know if they've made any spiders with 8 silks, but have you heard of goat silk/BioSteel?</p></div>		</li>
