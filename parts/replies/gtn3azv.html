			<div class="markdown"><p>you are sort of skipping the fact that the way a lot of metals &quot;look&quot; is determined by the oxides on top. fine silver is pretty much always, well, silver, because it doesn't oxidize much. sterling can be any color from &quot;silver&quot; to black because of oxides. The same applies to many other metals.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The colours of these metals are due to surface oxides (or hydrated carbonate in the case of green copper). These are themselves coloured or cause colouration due to interference effects. Nearly all freshly prepared metal surfaces have the shiny silver colour OP refers to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes metals appear metallic, but I think the issue here is most people associate metallic with &quot;silvery&quot;.  </p>
<p>Metals absolutely have colors, as elements and compounds and alloys and oxides, and those colors can vary based on atomic details like the bonds they form, as linked to for the other answer. Metal colors range from near-colorless on one extreme to some of the most vibrant colors chemists can create.</p>
<p>While metals (by virtue of being metals) can present themselves in near-colorless grayscale, ranging from nearly white like platinum and tin to nearly black like lead, all of which people think of as &quot;silvery&quot;, but they also cover the full visible color spectrum and beyond.</p></div>		</li>
