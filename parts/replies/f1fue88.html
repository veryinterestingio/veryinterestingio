			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this helps me understand why we don’t like cold water (it’s so far below our body temp), but I’m still wondering why it feels pleasant to feel water that is around 100°F or a little hotter. I would think that an aversion to getting burned would cause us to avoid extremely hot water, but instead it feels fucking amazing sometimes. Thanks for your response!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body temp is just shy of 100°F (97-99°F typically), that's why 100°F feels nice, it is very close to body temp so your body doesn't have to work to heat itself up (since we are endotherms - create our own body heat). It will also help to increase your blood flow which increases the rate of transport of nutrients to your tissues and the clean up of waste products. As well as acting in a positive manner on other body systems.</p>
<p>If you are non-american and are thinking in terms of Celsius, nothing that you find enjoyable is anywhere close to 100°C. That temperature would more than scald your skin. In fact most bathrooms have a scald protector to keep the water under 65°C. At and above that temperature your skin can be scalded in as little as 0.5 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was amazing. Bath gets cold? Add steaming hot water for just a few seconds and its hot again.</p>
<p>The puddle in the basement from the hot water tank boiling out the pressure relief, and knowledge my hot water tank could have exploded, less amazing.</p></div>		</li>

A humble request to use °F if you're using Fahrenheit.

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you stay in constant 47 degrees Celsius water you will die within minutes. It will depend slightly on your size but inside water you want be able to shed heat you will reach 41c and protein will start to denature and you will die. </p>
<p>Back of the envelope calculation a 4000 watt water heater that kept a constant 47c would kill you in 9 minutes.  </p>
<p>27c water is indefinitely survivable. One would say it’s very comfy indeed.   </p>
<p>Hot is very dangerous. Cold much less so.</p></div>		</li>
