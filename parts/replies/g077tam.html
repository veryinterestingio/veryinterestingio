<p>Many people understand that something has to be done. But they are unaware of the scale.</p>
<p>You're completely right. We could all stop anthropogenic CO2 sources right now and would still overshoot the 2°C target.</p>
<p>Stopping emissions isn't enough anymore. The problem is the CO2 which is already in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>On top of that over 90% of CO2 and heat from global warming is currently being captured by the oceans (ocean acidification, &gt;50% of coral reefs are dead). I wonder if humans have the capability to fill the CO2 sink which oceans are. We're surely trying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on your knowledge, doyou think carbon capture technologies are a viable solution? It seems.  I read an article on this <a href="https://carbonengineering.com" target="_blank">https://carbonengineering.com</a> company and it seemed like with a little bit of political will we could undo enough damage.  I’m not sure on the numbers and costs.  Do you have any ideas about how much it would cost globally to reduce emissions enough to halt and reverse enough of the damage to stop any irreversible environmental damage?</p>
<p>Edit: I read a little more on that site.  They say they can remove carbon at the cost of 100 dollars a tonne.  Google tells me that we produce 36 billion tons of carbon emissions a year so it will cost 3.6 trillion dollars annually to completely negate our emissions.  I was gonna divide that by the global population but seem as how a good chunk of the population is very poor say we divided that cost over 2 billion people it would be 3.6 trillion/2billion = 1800 annually per person.  This would be hard but doable.  And it would incentivize decreasing our emissions.  Every dollar spent lowering emissions would be saved not having to remove them.  Or we could maybe aim for half that amount of carbon removal and invest in converting to electric transport of other things to lower carbon emissions.  We could do this if we could just agree we want to and get some decent politicians.  Man I hope we get this figured out I feel we need another 25-50 years to get it sorted.  I don’t know how things will look then.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What it would take to stop that trajectory is literally putting on the brakes and ending CO2 emissions everywhere simultaneously.</p>

<p>One of the bleakest things about this pandemic has been the sudden and dramatic drop in CO2 emissions during lockdowns, compared to how unbelievably quick they recovered long before there was any sort of resolution to the pandemic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: okay, since some of y'all are not reading, let me try this again. My point is that while <em>emissions</em> may have declined, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has NOT: people see that emissions are declining and think 'cool, we're saved' when we most decidedly are NOT, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/worst-and-best-case-scenarios-for-warming-less-likely-groundbreaking-study-finds/" target="_blank">scientists having just ruled out the best case scenario </a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And over even longer time scales you have CO2 combining with surface rocks via weathering, being subducted down into the mantle, and then gaseous CO2 being re-emitted from volcanoes.  This has its own balance and would fix our greenhouse gas problems in a mere 100,000 years or so if we could just stop our emissions.  Though some people have plans to <a href="https://projectvesta.org/" target="_blank">speed it up</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that will happen in the distant future is plate tectonics and most volcanism will stop.  The recycling of carbon will end as free carbon becomes locked into carbonate rocks.  This combined with increasing temperatures from a hotter sun will push photosynthesis towards the C4 process long before the sun enters the red giant phase.</p></div>		</li>
