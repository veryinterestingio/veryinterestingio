			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for those pop-science book recommendations. I went to university for neuroscience, yet have done nothing related to that since. It's still one of my most beloved pursuits of knowledge and inquiry.</p>
<p>Recommend more books and the reasons for them, if you are up for it. Please and thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>modularity stemmed from phrenology which is now pseudoscience. its much more likely the brain distributes processing among whatever it has available. Aren't there people born with half a brain that are more or less completely normal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm always wondering if visual attention is being used for math somehow. I can't do math in my head when I'm driving (or more accurately, I can't drive safely while doing math in my head), because I need to &quot;see&quot; the math in my mind's eye, and I can't do that while paying attention to what I'm actually seeing. I do have ADHD so it may be that math is a siren song that draws my attention away, but it also feels like I'm splitting my visual attention between my actual sight and my mind's eye.</p></div>		</li>
