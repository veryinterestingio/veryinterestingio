			<div class="markdown"><p>Rampant speculation here:</p>
<p>Doubling is easy for living things to do, but tripling is hard. When we grow, our cells divide into two, cloning themselves. The &quot;directive&quot; from our growing bodies of &quot;You, little cell, are going to become the eyeballs. Split yourself into two and have each half go over to those places and keep growing.&quot; is simpler to manage than any kind of tripling would. Simpler/easier leads to less mistakes, which leads to an increased likelihood of the organism surviving to adulthood to pass  on genes. Something like 4 would be more likely than 3 because it's two sets of two, which is repeated doubling. Note that there are some creatures that sort-of have 3 eyes, but generally it's two eyes and 1 &quot;eye&quot; that works slightly differently.</p>
<p>In addition, there's the issue of efficiency. If two (eyes/legs/arms/etc) are mostly enough, are the added energy and resources it takes to make a 3rd one worth it in the overall scheme? If a 3rd eye makes you 10% more efficient at looking, but costs you 10% more calories, is that a net positive or negative in your chances of survival? Basically there's diminishing returns.</p>
<p>EDIT: Note that some animals like certain species of frog and lizard do have a &quot;3rd eye&quot;. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye" target="_blank">Parietal Eye</a> in short just judges the amount of light that's out and helps the animal regulate it's rhythms based on the day/night and seasonal cycles. It doesn't see detail, just general amount of light. So in cases like this, the caloric tradeoff is &quot;worth it&quot; to the animal, so the eye gets passed on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this is the crux of the answer. Every attribute of our bodies has a biological cost and a reproductive benefit (however obliquely -- it is the benefit to <em>reproduction</em> that determines if a trait is likely to be passed on). If the cost outweighs the benefit, then even if a mutation occurs, it is likely not to thrive in the face of competition.</p>
<p>Stereoscopic vision and being able to judge distance is a great boon compared to a single eye. And while a 3rd eye might improve our vision, the reproductive benefit (ability to hunt / avoid predators) is probably much less than the 50% increased biological cost over 2 eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes.  That's why you have 4 fingers.  One + Thumb is good, but even though 4+T is more resources, it's enough more productive to be selected for.  There are 6 toed cats because that's a tradeoff that cat species are still experimenting with.</p>
<p>With eyes, it seems like 2 is enough.  The benefit from depth perception is awesome, but the incremental benefit from a third eye (and the brain to process it) isn't sufficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily.  Where would you put it that two eyes can't already cover?  And how would you grow/rewire the brain to handle that?  Seeing takes up an enormous amount of brain energy.  We often don't think it takes up more than conscious thinking but it does.  Hence why it's bigger.</p>

<p>Those aren't human things.  And if you hear a sound, your brain subconsciously tells you a lot of information, but really you just hear its direction then look that way.  Doesn't take <strong>tri</strong>angulation.</p></div>		</li>
