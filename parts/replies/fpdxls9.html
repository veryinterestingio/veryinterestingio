			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed but inside the dishwasher while it sits in there the temperature is somewhat consistent Iâ€™d imagine from the insulation.!When I take it out is when I notice the change. There was an interesting comment on this thread about how water spreads out on glass too. Maybe a combination of both.</p></div>		</li>
