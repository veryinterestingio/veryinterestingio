			<div class="markdown"><p>A great question. I think it is easier to state a safe distance policy. If a stated safe distance is 10 feet, then it means that at all times the risk of contagion is minimal when separated by more than 10 feet. Such a statement in time can be hard. For example, stating that don't go to a place occupied by another for 5 minutes is in general hard. But this is precisely what may be needed in elevators and small bathrooms.</p></div>		</li>
