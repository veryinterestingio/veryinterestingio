			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question. If the timings of each “Phase 3” on a given body part are staggered, then how come when you shave a a body part <em>en masse</em>, there’s not a period 100 days later (say) where there’s little to no hair? It’s not as if the new phase 1 strand is growing simultaneously and is fully visible when the Phase 3 one falls out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you shave you're just cutting hairs off at the surface, not completely removing them by the root and restarting the cycle. You're cutting off stage 1, 2, and 3 hairs all together, and then after shaving they continue on with whatever phase they were in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. So would waxing the hair, for example, pull all of them out at their root and thus begin the cycle anew for each follicle? So even after you pull out the strand entirely, is the follicle still at its prior phase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess that it's because you're cutting all of your hair at once and so some were in stage 1 when you cut them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I see. That makes sense. So essentially shaving the follicles doesn’t “reset the clock.” I thought the state of the follicles was directly dependent on the length of the strand. And only when it’s at a certain length does it finally enter Phase 3. Guess not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there other examples of mammals or animals that grow hair in really different ways after evolving?</p>
<p>Like looking at humans from apes the hair thing is crazy why does it grow so long on our heads?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Domestic dogs all evolved from wolves, and there's a huge variety of length and texture of coats among breeds--think of Komondors (&quot;mop dogs&quot;) or Xoloitzcuintles (hairless dogs), as well as the difference between poodles, labs, and terriers. Definitely evolution can make a huge difference in hair follicles! That being said, the head hair thing for humans is pretty unique. Some think we selected for it as pre-humans lived in savannas, allowing body heat to escape from our near-hairless skin while the tops of our heads were protected from direct sun, and then we may have sexually selected for sparse body hair and thick head hair later. Or it may just be one of those chaotic evolutionary things with no real advantage, where humans with no body hair and long head hair could survive, so they did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have multiple hairs of the same length in a lot of my hair follicles. Like multiple visible hairs per follicle. Is that normal? Your comment makes me feel like I should have a rotation of visible hair while more is going on underneath versus multiple “active” hair</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is common enough, from what I've read there are different opinions on whether or not a follicle &quot;should&quot; have one or more hairs in it, the consensus however tends towards it being not a big deal either way. Human hair is very variable in how long it stays in each growth phase, and each individual hair runs its own course, so trying to say one way or another how your hair &quot;should&quot; be growing is probably beyond the boundaries of what is feasible, but if your follicles are not getting infected and you're not  getting discomfort, that's a good sign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have 1 arm hair that doesn't seem to stop growing. I've pulled it out multiple times and when it grows back it will grow to 2 or 3 times the length of my other arm hairs. I've had it for years. Is this the result of a faulty follicle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed one or two on my own body as well. Sometimes follicles just hit the biological jackpot and for hormonal or genetic reasons end up hardwired into the first stage of growth, like a car stuck in gear, and just won't stop growing. Pluck them if they bug you but they're harmless.</p></div>		</li>
