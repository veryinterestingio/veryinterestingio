			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note about your source and something people should keep in mind is that that is one meta study. There have been dozens/hundreds of studies and other meta studies that have concluded the opposite.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sodium-studies-blur-picture-heart-healthy-201408157366" target="_blank">Here's</a> one article from Harvard about sodium which seems to still agree that high sodium intake leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, they do acknowledge more data is needed. They seem to touch on some similar things that were in your cited article.</p>
<p>Sodium intake can be balanced with potassium since sodium will bind with potassium and you will pee it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/12/181219075858.htm" target="_blank">Here's</a> another article from the American Heart Association discussing the same topic as OP. From the Journal article</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly a fifth of heart disease deaths in adults aged 25-69 in 2011 may be attributed to high sodium diets in a large province in China. Reducing salt intake in the region could potentially save thousands of lives, according to new research in Journal of the American Heart Association, the Open Access Journal of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, how does Sodium, a cation, bind to Potassium, another cation?
Water and sodium go hand in hand in terms of fluid dynamics, osmolarity, and renal excretion. Potassium is generally excreted in the urine, while the kidneys generally try to preserve sodium and water. This becomes difficult with natural diuretics (caffeine, alcohol), and with Rx medical diuretics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't bind together. They are both electrolytes and are removed by the same process. Your cells need a minimum amount of potassium to function. If you don't have enough potassium, your body will hold on to what it has which in turn holds onto the sodium,too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't actually bind together I don't think, but I did learn about the sodium-potassium pump in cell biology. If you have too much sodium and not enough potassium, you will end up with too much sodium inside your cells, and you won't be peeing enough out. If I remember correctly it removes three sodium for each two potassium, so you need to keep that balance.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You may be going for a simplification here but as I understand it, this is not accurate. Potassium and sodium have the same charge and can’t bond. However, you may be referring to the NaK pump which leverages potassium to exchange sodium through a membrane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the Na-K-ATPase pump matters here since it moves the ions against the concentration gradient.</p>
<p>Sodium causes water retention in an effort to equalize concentration in urine and blood. However, drink enough water and the concentration of Na+ in urine drops which leads to excretion via osmosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important for people to pay attention to the DATES of these studies and findings.  Guidelines in medicine actually do change over time, but often decades after large amounts of findings have already shown them to be ineffective.  </p>
<p>The problem is that the status quo is heavily favored and despite overwhelming amounts of evidence to the contrary, few institutes are willing to backtrack - the Harvard article you linked is a great example of people acknowledging 5 years ago that the data is not strong but out of caution, why not just keep following low sodium guidelines.</p>
<p>Just remember how long it took to change all our dietary guidelines despite all the data out there - look at how long it took to ban trans fats, or to reconfigure the food pyramid, and especially how long it takes to overturn guidelines from what we see as trusted authorities (e.g. Harvard research!!!) but that we now all know were heavily influenced by industry.  How many decades of &quot;butter is bad for you&quot; resulted in everyone eating the &quot;healthier&quot; alternative of margarine, which we now know is actually much worse?  Not to mention how much harm has been done because of dietary guidelines to avoid salt and fat, which caused food manufacturers to turn to adding sugar.  </p>
<p>Anyone interested in cardiovascular health and sodium should take a look at the Framingham Heart Study and the data that came out of it.</p>
<p>Edit: Everyone should just remember that science isn't set in stone once it's published.  This desperate need for &quot;the TRUTH&quot; when it comes to dietary guidelines is exactly what makes them so difficult to change...and why people still cite the &quot;science&quot; of vaccines being linked to autism, despite all the retractions and research that should make it thoroughly debunked.  Even the most prestigious scientific journals (like Wakefield &amp; The Lancet) have published major scientific findings that ended up being 100% junk...and yet those same retracted papers get cited hundreds and thousands of times, even forming the basis of other papers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when I was a kid like 6 or so looking at the sodium levels on everything because I was told it would make you thirsty. Also, I thought if you drank too much of anything then you'd become drunk and that scared me because I was raised to believe if you get drunk your a bad person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make some bold claims. There is certainly such a thing as too much salt. Some idiot drank a bottle of soy sauce, was hospitalized with extreme hypernatremia, had a blood sodium of like 180 or 190 where normal is around 140. He survived and was noteworthy because he didn't get severe brain damage unlike everone else with similar figures.</p>
<p>So, too much salt is certainly not impossible. Just like too much water is possible, for same salt-balance reasons.</p></div>		</li>
