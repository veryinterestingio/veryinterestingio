			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not said we see too many. However, from our old understandings they should not even exist in young systems. This is because giant planets were/are thought to form further out beyond what is known as the snow (or ice) line (a region where volatiles and condense into ices required to form a planetary core). Yet we see them occasionally.</p>
<p>Just so there is no confusion though it is more common for HJs to be found around older stars (from observations of the galactic velocity dispersion) and it is not common to find them around young stars. The fact we see any is still a problem that needs to be explained!</p>
<p>Also there is a misconception about the bias of observational methods (I am not an observer though so maybe one will turn up and clarify this a bit better). Just because our observations are biased towards a type of planet does not mean we cant say anything about populations statistics. Because we understand and can quantify these bias we can actually extrapolate in areas where our observations are &quot;weaker&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is usually possible to calculate how biased sampling methods are. Astronomers should be able to determine how many hot Jupiters we should see under any given theory of planet formation, and compare their actual observations to the expected, correcting for the bias.</p>
<p>To do that, you'd need to make a computer model of the distribution of planets predicted by a theory you want to test, then simulate the probability that our telescopes would find each planet, and determine which planets would be over or under-represented, and by how much. My gut feeling is that this should be &quot;easy&quot;, well within reach of a grad student, but I'm a biologist, not an astronomer.</p>
<p>Similar methods might also be used to estimate the true distribution of planets, eg by knowing that our methods probably spotted most of the gas giants that transited close to their stars, but very few of the Earth-sized planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you can take into account the probability of detecting a specific type of planet. Say probability decreases with distance to the star squared, then you ‘value’ a detection by distance squared. Say we know it’s 10 times more likely to detect planet A than planet B. If we detect 5 planet A and 1 planet B, we can say there’s probably more planet B. We’ve done this, and the results are interesting. 1 in 2 stars have super-Earths. 1 in 6 small rocky planets like ours. 1 in 20 have Saturns. So why are there no super-Earths in the solar system and instead we have 4 unlikely small rocky planets? If you want a Nobel prize, go figure it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Until we could see systems outside our own, we had to assume that our planetary system was normal, but now we have to find some way to explain why our solar system is so astronomically unusual, in numerous ways. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The orbital period thing is more an issue of optical resolution. The only way to observe objects with large AU is direct imaging. But this technique doesnt give us any information (such as mass or period) to be able to determine the orbital period accurately. We have observed quite a few that are larger orbital separation than Neptune for example. </p>
<p>I would comment on this though that all of these objects push the boundary between planet and brown dwarf (although really brown dwarves are actually just planets... ).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Direct imaging can directly give orbital properties such as a semi-major axis and period with astrometric monitoring over time. Determining the mass is more difficult but using models of planetary evolution along with their brightness and estimates of the star's age decent mass estimates are possible. System dynamical stability in multi-planet systems can constrain mass even more tightly, for example with HR 8799. And Brown Dwarfs are a distinct population of objects from large gas giants, they fuse deuterium for a short time, have different formation mechanisms and population statistics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And, He doesn't even list my favorite! None of the planet systems we have observed have planets with orbits within several orders of magnitude as long as planets in our system (and FYI this is equivalent to talking about the distance planets are from their star). Statistically, we have observed enough systems that, if it weren't for us, we couldn't have guessed that a planetary system could have planets this far out. </p>

<p>He talked about how small most planetary orbits are immediately before talking about brown dwarves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldnt think so based on observations of other systems. </p>
<p>One of the things I was trying to get across in my original post (but might not be overly obvious) is that there is not really a &quot;catch all&quot; mechanism for planetary formation and migration. There are a whole bunch of things at play and this results in the wild variety of systems we observe. We do not fully understand any of these processes let alone combinations of them and so what was important for the Solar system would be not only hard to figure out but also may not even be unique (that is there may be multiple ways of a system like ours forming the ordering it has).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not how orbital mechanics work. A 1kg lump of lead and a 1 kg sack of feathers will orbit their primary at the same distance given the same velocity.</p></div>		</li>
