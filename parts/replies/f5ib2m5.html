			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a networking expert, but there are 3 tiers of internet providers.</p>
<p>Tier 1s are the big guys - they are the ones that are building the undersea cables.</p>
<p>Tier 2s are in between - they hook in to the Tier 1 providers.</p>
<p>Tier 3s are your smaller providers, and the ones that hook up the end user and allow them to access the higher tiers.</p>
<p>So you would want to start at tier 3.  You'll have to register with the FCC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't want any changes because I'm content. But I mean since its regulated surely you can track any and everyone, tackle crime easily but instead that poses to be difficult. </p>
<p>On the other hand there's privacy surely companies should let all decisions be autonomous for the user, surely regulations should not allow logarithm and filtering as it creates a perception of society that isn't true.</p></div>		</li>
