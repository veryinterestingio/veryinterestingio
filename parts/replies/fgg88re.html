			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for the fact that since you are floating, part of you is above the water line, and gets pulled up more than the rest of you or the water since it is closer to the Moon or sun above or father from the sun/moon below.
So it does make you float better (by a tiny amount).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could also say that more of you is under the water and experiences less gravitational force. I'm not sure what you mean by float better, but you should still float at the same level regardless of the tides, due to the net buoyancy force balancing the net gravitational force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is right. I'll expand on this.</p>
<p>I'm going to dive into this with some simple equations to demonstrate. We begin with F=ma. Force is equal to mass times acceleration. Newton's second law. Now the net force on someone floating in water is the force of gravity pulling them down, plus the buoyant force pushing them up. So</p>
<p>ma = B - G</p>
<p>Where B is the buoyant force and G is the gravitational force. Now the gravitational force is just the mass of the object being pulled times the gravitational constant g, which is about 9.8 m/s^2 but varies slightly on location. The buoyant force is similar, except it's g multiplied by the mass of the displaced water. We will call this w. Just remember this w represents the mass of the water. So we get</p>
<p>ma = wg - mg</p>
<p>ma = g(w - m)</p>
<p>Now, if you're under the moon, the gravitational acceleration you experience is going to be slightly less. However, that gravitational acceleration is going to affect you and the water equally. So it's only going to change the value of that g term. Whether you sink, or float is determined by the other term w - m. If the water you displace has more mass than you, you float. If the water has less mass, then you sink. The moon don't change this. It will, however, change the speed that you will float up at, since g is reduced.</p></div>		</li>
