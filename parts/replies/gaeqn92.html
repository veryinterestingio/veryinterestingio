<p>My local newspaper had a majority of its strips credited to dead people </p>

<p>Zombie strips. <em>Blondie</em>, <em>B.C.</em>...Sometimes the originator wasn't dead. <em>Terry &amp; The Pirates</em> became a big hit, and Milton Caniff asked his publisher to cut him some profit participation. The publisher said no, this is <em>our</em> strip, you're an employee, here's a little raise, now STFU.</p>
<p>Caniff said OK, best of luck with your strip, put on his hat and was out the door. He changed some character names, published it as <em>Steve Canyon</em> under his own ownership, and <em>Terry</em> was dead in a year. Some papers dropped him during the Vietnam years because of his relentlessly conservative orientation, but Caniff died a wealthy man while various attempts to revive <em>Terry</em> flopped.</p></div>		</li>
