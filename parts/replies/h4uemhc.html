			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun story about just how dark it is. My brother worked for GoPro a few years ago, doing a few VR related shoots about cave diving in I believe Mexico. Anyways he told me a story about how on the last day there they were all in this giant open underground cave, my brother with his dive partner and a few guys just floating around because they had planned something together.</p>
<p>My brother said the next thing he knows is it's suddenly pitch black, no light, he said he felt like he was floating and became extremely disoriented but all the training he went through and since his hand was on a guide wire they had set he was able to mentally ground himself to quell the mass panic he felt. He said it was surreal as in the moment of pure pitch darkness his brain immediately could not register up from down.</p>
<p>The dive group made sure he was okay and they talked about it until the dive lights all came back on but he said it was out of everything he had done at that point with GoPro the scariest few seconds of his life; swimming with sharks paled in comparison to him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We humans rely so much on visual cues. This is why you need special training as a pilot to fly in bad weather (it is its own separate license) because even just a few seconds in a cloud can be enough to crash a plane once a pilot can't tell up from down. It happened to me today in a simulator and I could still partially see the ground, that's how crazy your brain can just shutdown</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bruh, considering it happened to you in a simulation, just imagine what would happen with the stress of a real situation, that's definitely another reason for wich i'll never try to fly an aircraft</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a night dive once. It's so disorienting. You really have to force yourself to follow your instruments and not the visual cues. </p>
<p>We stopped for the safety stop. That I was closely watching the depth gauge and timer. When it was time to surface, I put a few bursts of air into the BCD. I was 100% sure I wasn't surfacing so moron me fully inflated my BCD. I'm pretty sure I went from 15 ft to the surface like a rocket. I was shocked when I found myself right next to the boat with BCD that was puffed up like a cartoon life jacket.</p>
<p>It really takes strong training to force yourself to trust the instruments and not what your brain and eyes are telling you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seen those big face masks? Some have built in communications such as radios. It's not crystal clear audio nor the greatest but you'll be able to understand what is said. </p>
<p>OTS has been making two different systems wireless and wired. Wireless uses the water as a transfer medium for acoustic vibrations which are picked up by the dive mask.</p>
