			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain why you reuse them? I'm genuinely curious. I'm diabetic so I need them, but I can go down to Walmart and grab a hundred syringes for 20 bucks without a prescription. Is it money stopping people from getting new syringes? Like that money could go to more drugs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in states where you can buy them without a prescription it gets tricky. Texas is supposed to let you buy them at will but I've been refused several times. Which is super demeaning as someone who was only taking peptides.</p></div>		</li>
