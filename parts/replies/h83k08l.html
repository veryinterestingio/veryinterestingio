			<div class="markdown"><p>i guess my next question is, why are the outer planets at a relatively low temperature compared to the inner planets? is it distance, size, composition, chemical reaction or something else entirely? (this is super cool, i just took up astrophotography so i'm trying to learn all about how gas and light interact)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is fundamentally just because the outer planets are farther from the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, its blue because it is mostly methane at the top of the atmosphere, which strongly absorbs red light. Which means it reflects blue, thus appearing blue.</p>
<p>So, the answer is: because of the methane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes and no. Yes, the blue colour is caused by methane absorption, but Jupiter and Saturn also have a lot of atmospheric methane. The main difference is the presence of cloud/haze.</p></div>		</li>
