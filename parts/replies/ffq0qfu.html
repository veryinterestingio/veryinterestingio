			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about what data they generate in the game. It's about what data they get access to. Can they get location data? That means your non-virtual shopping habits can be scrapped. Can they get the list of contacts, or have you logged in via a social network and shared your results with friends? That network can be sold too. Did you give access to manage files? You've shared anything you saved.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much is actually still abused these days with better permission handling both in Android and in iOS, and with the vague threat of GDPR, but I wouldn't be surprised if it continues.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding number 3 - this is often misunderstood.  It depends on the company in question but generally speaking most companies who rely on data collection don't  sell the data to third parties.</p>
<p>Large companies like Google don't sell information because it undermines their own revenue.  It's more profitable for them to keep control of your data so that advertisers and thrid parties have to come to them to push other products.</p>
<p>For example; If I have a database of people who searched for 'Horses' it's much more profitable for me to keep that data private. That way if you want to advertise a new horse related product you have to pay me to push those adverts using my list.  It's more profitable for me to not sell you the data directly because it represents repeat business.</p>
<p>This may not be the case for all companies but tends to be true for those who have appropriate channels for leveraging the data they collect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Points 2 and 3 are usually the same. The only user data being sold here is &quot;this guy play games&quot; so you should advertise your game to him. Maybe a flag if you have made an in app purchase in the past to prove you are a high value custumer.</p>
<p>Advertisers generally don't give two fucks about your phone number or SS. They want digital signals that indicate customers that want to do business with them, and these can often be anonymous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, most of these mobile games are made by individuals and small companies that don't have a way to leverage the data in any significant way. If they want to make money from your data, selling it is really the only option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I was going to comment how selling data is such a legal catwalk that most individual/small companies probably don’t bother. Then I looked up the law in the US, which has me flabbergasted. I always assumed it would be similar to my country, where the selling of any data that is personally identifiable is illegal. Any digital fingerprint must be remove before the data can be passed on to a third party. I thought the difference would only be the definition of digital fingerprint, but no, the US is basically a desert for the law in this regard. That’s just horrifying.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So having done some research into this recently and using mostly numbers that come from 2016-2018 [couldn't find anything for 2019] it appears that in the United States about 5% of all mobile users ever make a mobile purchase ever, this number is higher outside of the United States by a few percentage points but nothing too crazy - However the interesting thing is that while 5-10 years ago 90% of revenue was made up of players considered to be &quot;whales&quot; [none of the research I found could define that has a specific spending threshold though] in the last 3-4 years there has been a significant increase in mobile revenue and a significant <strong>decrease</strong> in the percentage of revenue made up of by big spenders. </p>
<p>By 2018 we were looking at more like 65-70% of revenue being made up of big spenders and still on the decline suggesting more people are willing to spend small amounts overall, which is actually a good thing which will force mobile developers to create experiences that do not just cater to the wealthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother worked doing marketing art for a mobile game. He shared with me that they had a whale who spent at least $10-20k a month on their game who they had a guess was part of an oil dynasty family. He said the goal/hope/dream was then to have that person recruit their other whale friends. At one point the individual had done so and my brother shared that they were getting upwards of $100k a month alone on this handful of people.  </p>
<p>He also shared that the company he worked at then (and most since then) all target &quot;Asia&quot; as their main target. He said that the European and American markets are so minuscule both in size and spending that they're secondary concern with most decisions.</p>
<p>This is all based on his experiences/stories from working for mobile game companies so obviously, research and what not may be contrary to what he's experienced and I acknowledge that. Just thought it was interesting that it lines up with what you said based on research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the game too. Some games (especially gacha games) have special events like &quot;play X dollars for this guaranteed thing!&quot; and people will pay for that but don't normally pay to play otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Playing MMOs growing up I think 10-15 monthly is pretty reasonable.  So if there's like a VIP package for like $5 I'll usually do that (and there tends to be) and then as you said, they'll do specials/package deals.</p>
<p>So long as they don't go absolutely bonkers with it like $100/mo I don't find it to be too greedy, so long as the game <em>could</em> be played competitively without doling out cash.  When it reaches that point, and it usually seems to, I'm out.</p>
<p>No matter how good the game is what inevitably happens in the quest for MORE MONEY is free players get edged out, free updates become fewer and further between, prices go up, deals become more frequent, big advantages that are only available for cash spring up .. and it's a cycle where lower spenders get fed up and quit, prices go up.. and you're left with essentially <em>only</em> whales.  And as my boy syndrome said: when everyone's super, no one is.  Eventually even the whales, with nobody to flex on, start their migration.</p></div>		</li>
