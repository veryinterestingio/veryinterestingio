			<div class="markdown"><p>A needle biopsy determined stage three cancer. The pain was very stressful I played mind games to get through it. Like how I conquered those hills when walking. Then the needle was inserted again. Lying prone not breathing or moving. There was a RN on both sides holding my hands. Finally I just broke out in tears. Prior to that I had a problem with kidney stone and procedure to eliminate the stone. That damn biopsy and it was not my first painful medical experience. Yet I complied. The RNâ€™s were joking that the doctor looked like he was enjoying himself. BTW doctor looked like a mad professor. Then came around to check out how it went. I told him it was just fine no problem whatsoever.</p></div>		</li>
