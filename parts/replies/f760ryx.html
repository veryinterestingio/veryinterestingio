			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, the alopecia doesn't seem to do anything besides make my hair fall out. I do have some other weird health issues that give me trouble, but hair loss is something I've just lived with. Sometimes I'll randomly start to grow a lot of hair back and be okay for a year or two and then (like right now) lose everything that just grew. My head, brows, and arm hair are usually where it's most noticeable. I've never lost all of my hair before, fortunately, but I've always been afraid it might be happening.</p></div>		</li>
