<p>Recently, researchers have been understanding depression as the human body's natural response to chronic inflammation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds really interesting. Could you give more details / sources? Inflammation of what? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might interest you to know that serotonin production in the gut is being researched recently. A large amount is made in the gut by microorganisms, but it's unknown if/how much it reaches the brain. I'm not up to speed with that research but it's a fairly common theme right now, so I'm guessing there are at least some correlations between gut imbalances and depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all depression is associated with evidence of inflammation. Some definitely is, and those individuals are more likely to respond to supplements and medication that reduce inflammation (individuals with higher CRP levels are more likely to respond), but other people have no signs of inflammation and are still depressed.</p></div>		</li>
