			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I'm included in this study/article. This is pretty cool. I had a liver transplant at Pittsburgh in 1992 and have read a bunch of research surrounding liver transplants at Pitt, but it's sometimes hard to pinpoint dates and if I was definitely included or not. I also recognize a few of the authors names as being those on my transplant team.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the pediatric heart population, the highest mortality rates are seen within the first month post-transplant. If you can survive past the first 4 weeks, your chance of long term (&gt;10 year) survival is pretty decent; however, long and short term survival rates vary based upon the age of the child. Generally the younger you are, the higher the short term risk but the lower the long term risk.</p>
<p>Neonates have the highest mortality rates within the first month, but overall their grafts remain viable for the longest amount of time and average somewhere \~22 years before they fail. Conversely, teenagers have lower morality within the first month after transplant, but their grafts will typically fail earlier (usually \~13 years). Toddler and school age kids fall in the middle.</p>

<p>For liver the 18 year survival after transplant was 59% compared to the actuarially expected value of 49%. However these numbers are hugely influenced by a) reason for transplant (malignancies do much worse than cirrhosis); b) age of recipient (younger is better); c) when transplant was performed (recent is better).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally the actually expected value will account for at least age if not age/gender, so I'm not sure your b) point is justified, since that is the one thing that would be completely comparable between the both the expected value and the real value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up a good point  and I worded it badly. Even though this is the largest study ever of survival in liver transplants one could argue it is still underpowered when performing the sub-group analyses.  It was, however, a significant finding that when separated into recipient age cohorts, that the younger ages had longer survival (as one might expect).  The truth is that there were a couple of trends that confound analyses.  One trend is better use and better immune-suppression therapies over time, and the other was increasing age of donor livers over time.  In spite of the latter, long term survival rates are increasing with time.  </p></div>		</li>
