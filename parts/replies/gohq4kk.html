So what does &quot;killing virus&quot; mean in this context ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren’t exactly living, they are a protein envelope with DNA or RNA inside, depending on the type, they end up with various mechanisms get in the cell and the genetic material gets released, the cells then start replicating and translating the genetic material, creating many copies of the virus.</p>
<p>Killing the virus, usually by heat, denature the protein and damage its DNA so that is it doesn’t successfully attach and have its genetic material work.</p>
<p>When a protein is made, the strand of amino acids is folded in a way that is guided by the sequence of amino acids as well as the way it is made, this means the protein attains a specific 3D shape that is essential to functioning correctly. </p>
<p>Denaturing protein means that the protein loose its original shape, even though it may still have the same sequence of aminoacids, kinda like what you see when you cook an egg. When that happens the protein can no longer functions, but is still of the same structure. </p>
<p>So the word “inactivated” is really a more correct description than killed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viral RNA =/= mRNA</p>
<p>The covid vaccines are mRNA, not viral RNA. mRNA is a normal part of the body's functioning, they tell the cells what proteins to create. In the case of the covid vaccines they get the cells to make a part of the virus, and the body then learns from that how to fight the actual virus.</p>
<p>Also, A is incorrect. You're confusing symptoms with infection. Symptoms are you feeling your body's immune response. You can have symptoms from a vaccine without an actual infection, because the POINT to vaccines is triggering an immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, If anyone is confused regarding why the mRNA vaccine isn't a full infection, think of it as creating sterile viruses. The mRNA creates the virus protein, but the protein lacks the capacity to reproduce. This guarantees that the infection clears up quickly, your body learns to recognize the virus in the future, and the infection cannot run away to create the problems which makes a virus deadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This response was the speedbump I wasn't getting over, thanks.   I get it may not be the be-all-end-all answer, but in caseses where developing a vaccine that does not reproduce is necessary (which is what makes it safe), obviously that vaccine would not be contagious.  Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but you are wrong on both accounts</p>
<p>mRNA is the RNA version that gets translated to protein, if it is does that function it is a by definition a messenger RNA or mRNA. The cdc and moderna websites themselves describe it as such </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.modernatx.com" target="_blank">https://www.modernatx.com</a></p>
<p>Same goes for Pfizer </p>
<p>Other types of RNA include ribosomal RNA or rRNA, transfer RNA or tRNA</p>
<p>Now regarding the side effects point, symptoms like limited fever and such aren’t what I am talking about, what I am talking about is BAD side effects, like the swine flu vaccine triggering Gullian Barre syndrome in the 70s, and that vaccine was promptly withdrawn. This was relevant to the idea of a contagious vaccine which couldn’t have been withdrawn</p>
<p>To be very clear, none of the Covid vaccines caused any serious side effects so far, which is great given the number of people who have them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first half of your reply confirmed what I explained about mRNA.</p>
<p>Symptoms and side effects aren't the same thing. I mentioned symptoms, you switched to talking about side (unwanted) effects.</p>
<p>Again, symptoms (fever etc) are you feeling your body's immune response. It doesn't mean you're necessarily infected. It must means your body is reacting as if it were, which is the entire point to vaccines.</p></div>		</li>
