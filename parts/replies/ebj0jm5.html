			<div class="markdown"><p>No source, but just some speculation: While the night sky would probably dwarf full moon levels, you'd also see far fewer stars and would not be able to see outside of our galaxy. Simply due to light pollution from the closer stars. Just like standing next to a street light makes stars invisible.</p>
<p><a href="https://earthsky.org/space/what-does-the-center-of-the-galaxy-look-like" target="_blank">https://earthsky.org/space/what-does-the-center-of-the-galaxy-look-like</a> this says that without dust the center of the milky way would be as bright as the full moon on earth.</p>
<p>But from Pluto for example, the Sun is barely different from other stars, so even a 500 times more dense nightsky wouldn't give you daylight during the night.</p>
<p>Apparently the integrated apparent magnitude of the nightsky at ear is -6.5 . That means if you increase the density 500 fold, you'd get an apparent magnitude of -13, the brightness of the full moon.</p>
<p>And that's the number <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_density" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_density</a> gives for globular clusters.</p>
<p>The sun has an apparent magnitude of -26. To reach that brightness the nightsky would have to be 160,000 times brighter than the already 500 times increase before.</p>
<p>(every change of 1 in apparent magnitude means a 100^(0.2) fold change in brightness)</p>
<p>So we can safely assume that the nightsky in a hypothetical center galaxy planet would be brighter than a full moon on earth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Am I picturing it right if I'm picturing the entire night sky as a semi-spherical blanket that is ALL as bright as a full moon? Because that seems pretty damn bright to me. With just the little disc of the full moon in the sky, I can see shadows, details on people's faces, etc.</p></div>		</li>
