			<div class="markdown"><p>They still would, because nobody is going to accept routine massive delays in a workflow because of centrifugation steps, from an efficiency standpoint. There's also the fact that centrifuges have a volume limit. </p>
<p>I've had workflows where you centrifuge samples at 100,000g for 18 hours. Even if that was linear, scale that to a bench centrifuge at 2500g. That's what - a month straight of centrifuging?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The lab I work in has cents from 10k rpm up to 20k rpm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultracentrifuges go higher than 100k, but I’d guess high rpm is relative haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally people avoid talking about rpm altogether because it’s not a constant. If you make two different centrifuges with different rotors spin at 10k rpm, they’ll be under different forces. </p>
<p>What you consider high though is relative. With the setup and rotor I was used to, 100,000g was around 27,200rpm. By comparison the benchtop I used for pelleting cells might have been at 500rpm. </p>
<p>Then if you look at the max usage range of ultracentrifuges above a million g, the rpm values are into 150,000+ depending on the rotor. </p>
<p>It’s kinda like asking a nascar driver is he fast. Faster than the normal driver, but slow compared to formula one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've correctly answered the question, while also contradicting yourself.</p>
<p>The particulate seperation is proportional to the force acting on it, which is why a higher G value will cause more agressive separation with lower yields over a shorter time frame.</p>
<p>Think of 1g pushing garlic against a press for 1 day vs 100g pressing garlic against a press for a quarter of a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah. I was thinking within the limits of settlement actually happening. Obviously, a 20S particle won't really settle at all at 1g.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that you only get creep effects on the garlic after the initial deformation. Aren't most things to be centrifuged mainly liquids and very very small solids?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But at an atomic level the solvent molecules are working similar to a matrix that the solute needs to escape from.</p>
<p>You're essentially using extreme gravity to force the solute to behave as if the solution is super saturated and condenses out of the solution breaking free from any intermolecular bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are more factors than just the angular velocity though. The settlement speed is also proportional to the distance from the center and inversely proportional to the temperature. So if you can make a really small and hot centrifuge than you can counteract the lack of speed. That's why you can achieve similar separation with a bench top centrifuge and the cabinet -10C centrifuge, one just lets you do much larger volumes and doesn't potentially denature your product.</p></div>		</li>
