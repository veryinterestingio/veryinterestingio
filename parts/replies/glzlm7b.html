<li>The first vaccine available to me. I've had a lot of people ask if I'd take AstraZeneca or J&amp;J given slightly lower efficacy compared to Pfizer and Moderna. My answer? Yes, in a heartbeat. They all are efficacious about what matters--preventing disease.</li>
<li>We don't know enough about this yet, but some preliminary data suggests they might slow it. However, until we know more, we should continue to take precautions to reduce exposure risk regardless of vaccination status. </li>
<li>If people are able to double down on non-pharmaceutical interventions (masks, distancing, staying home when possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding gatherings, ventilating if possible, washing hands, and disinfecting high touch surfaces) and we can get transmission down while simultaneously getting more people vaccinated, we can relax our precautions sooner. I like to think we'll be able to start easing off on restrictions later this year, but right now it's just hard to say when that will be.</li>
<li>Yes, as are all groups intentionally spreading disinformation. But I'm also concerned with lumping people who have concerns or questions about the vaccines in with hard-core anti-vaccine groups. We shouldn't shame people for being reluctant to vaccinate. We should listen to their concerns and try to address them to the best of our abilities. We need to win hearts and minds rather than condemn bad actors.</li>

<p>Is touch surface transmission still consider a major vector? I was under the impression it was now consider a very minor concern due to low viral load?</p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>If you had to choose a vaccine, which one would it be? I would choose anyone made available to me. They all provide huge benefit of protection against COVID disease</li>
<li>Do vaccines slow/stop transmission? For now we know likely slow transmission but still unclear if fully could stop it</li>

<li>I am in the USA where the two vaccines available under an emergency use authorization are those by Pfizer and Modrna. Where I work those working with SARS-CoV-2 patient samples or animals have been given access to the vaccine (including myself). I was thankful for the opportunity and did not have a top choice. On some days people got one and on another others got the second.</li>
</ol>

<li>That is the hypothesis but we need actual data to support that. Until we know all of the measures that are in place (e.g. masks, distancing, hand washing) are needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Personally and only opinion I think normalcy will come gradually. It wonâ€™t be a specific date or declaration. I am hoping by 2022. The key is preventing people from getting very sick and preventing deaths.</li>
