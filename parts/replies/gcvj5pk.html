			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s pretty interesting actually. Similarly, I wonder if women are more susceptible to temperature changes throughout the day as well. </p>
<p>I’m at good median weight for my height and the same is true for my wife. My temperature is pretty constant throughout the day. However, my wife is freezing around the house and often has cold feet and hands despite wearing leggings and a hoodie. However at night under a blanket with just her pjs on, I swear she transitions to one of those old timey coal burning furnaces.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is about <em>where</em> the heat is. Not how much there is.</p>
<p>Your extremities lose heat the environment more readily than your core. </p>
<p>But your sensation of 'warm' or 'cold' actually isn't that, something feels warm if it deposits heat into you, and feels cold if you lose heat to it. Even if you are warmer. That's why a log doesn't feel cold but a steel bar does. Wood is bad at transferring heat. Steel is very good at it.</p>
<p>So your wife has a typical body temperature, but her hands and feet are losing heat to the environment, she feels cold.</p>
<p>You jump in bed, under the covers, in a contained space and the body heat she sheds quickly heats up the limited space under the covers. Now its warm in there, and getting warmer because a person's internal body temp is much warmer than what we consider comfortable air temperature. </p>
<p>Our bodies are engines, they generate heat, they operate on the basis that we're going to be shedding that heat into the environment, so when you stop being able to it feels too warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you go to sleep you can drop 1 or 2 degrees. And humans can sense relative temperature, not absolute temperature. It could be that at night, you are colder so she seems warmer. I am just loosely connecting facts here though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reason for this is really fun.</p>
<p>Being warm, and feeling warm aren't the same thing.</p>
<p>You tend to feel cold in your extremities. If you've actually been cold in your core you know its a unique sensation and very unpleasant. </p>
<p>Being actually cold in your core is dangerous, your body runs at a specific temperature for good reason. So we have automatic survival mechanisms to keep us the right temperature.</p>
<p>One of those is, when it gets cold out, you'll reduce circulation to your extremities. Your body decides its not worth the effort to keep your fingers warm anymore and stop trying as hard so more heat is reserved for your core. That's why some people end up with really cold hands for example.</p>
<p>It turns out, women's bodys do this at a higher temperature than men typically.  So while your body is still trying to keep your fingers warm, your girlfriends body has given up. Which is why her toes are ice cubes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but in offices, a cold person can always put on a sweater and dress in layers. A hot person can only undress so much. When I see someone in a blouse as thin as single ply toilet paper, and a pencil skirt without stockings - I don’t feel bad for them at all when they get cold. If they would just wear some slacks, and a shirt that isn’t lace tulle they’d warm right up.</p></div>		</li>
