			<div class="markdown"><p>To note though, as I understand it, if glucose and fructose are basically equivalent in normal conditions, since they are both integrated in glycolysis, they are <em>not</em> equivalent when in excess. The liver can stock glucose in glycogen form (basically stringing them together) but can't do the same with fructose. Which means excess of glucose can be somewhat absorbed, but excess of fructose will be more problematic.</p>
<p>You might think this isn't really important. After all, sucrose is a glucose and a fructose linked together, and so most times we eat the two in the same quantity anyway. But as it turns out, industrial food is rather found of fructose syrup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly, you can show symptoms of liver disease due to fatty liver. Once your body runs out of places to store fat easily it turns to other areas. </p>
<p>Fat in men and women are stored in different areas of the body. Men are more likely to store fat in their abdomen (very unhealthy) and women in their thighs.</p>
<p>In men, once it reaches a point where your body is finding it difficult to store, it turns to other areas, hence liver. This is where it gets real serious and dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not odd at all, fatty liver <em>is</em> liver disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Storing fat in the belly is not unhealthier than the thighs. Even interstitial belly fat is not in and of itself bad. <em>The conditions that produce it</em> are indicative of serious problems though.</p>
<p>Men die younger for a variety of reasons but none of them are related to where they store body fat. Some <em>may</em> be related to transitional fats but that does not seem to be supported by any longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>Being obese will stress the liver of course but a fatty liver is caused by related but separate factors than a being a fatty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>HFCs should be rightly maligned for introducing simple sugars where none are needed. In the end though, they are no better or worse than their equivalents (sucrose, dextrose, fructose).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia [fructolysis]: “29-54% of fructose is converted in liver to glucose, and about a quarter of fructose is converted to lactate. 15-18% is converted to glycogen. Glucose and lactate are then used normally as energy to fuel cells all over the body.”</p>
<p>More of it turns into glucose than glycogen. What do you think the liver does with the fructose when you’re not glycogen depleted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As that link points out, fat.  Particularly if you eat a lot of it.  The citation for the numbers you mention comes from <a href="https://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-7075-9-89" target="_blank">this study</a>, which points out</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A small percentage of ingested fructose (&lt;1%) appears to be directly converted to plasma TG. However, hyperlipidemic effects of larger amounts of fructose consumption are observed in studies using infused labeled acetate to quantify longer term de novo lipogenesis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a rate difference - I should have been more clear about this in my original post, but what I was focusing on conveying is that one really should avoid fructose if your goal is fitness.  There's a lot of work showing the various negative effects of fructose specifically.  See for example <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/96702" target="_blank">this review paper.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a marathon, you want to ensure your glycogen is at capacity so a little extra doesn't really matter. I forget the number but a human can store enough glycogen for about 90-120 mins of marathon-type activity. You're going to run out of it during the marathon anyway and that's why most athletes start consuming gels/food/whatever before that point during the race in the hopes of topping it up before it is depleted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You did not answer his question.</p>
<p>It's worthless and meaningless to say that energy is used in the marathon, and that it's a marathon not a sprint, if the energy has already been converted to fat and is unusable.</p>
<p>So he'll eat pasta before the marathon, then that pasta is converted to fat overnight through digestion. He's now left with no carbs, and no difference from having eaten just straight up fat (of same amount). So your pasta is worthless for the marathon and as good as a tub of lard.</p>
<p>Yet this clearly isn't the case. Why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware, you want to have as much glycogen in the body as possible. Saturation is better than early depletion. Any excess energy that cannot be stored as glycogen is then converted to fat. Fats are even better at storing energy then carbohydrates, but they're less accessible (i.e. not the body's first choice). I don't run marathons though, so let me know if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: not a nutritionist, just a guy who exercises and has done a lot of research. </p>
<p>This sounds right to me, but I’ll add a few things. When carb loading the goal is to fill the glycogen stores- but don’t eat too much because the extra will be stored as fat once the glycogen “tanks” are full. Essentially, you want a higher <em>percentage</em> of your food to be from carbs, while keeping roughly the same calories as usual. </p>
<p><del>While your body <em>can</em> get energy from fat, it very much prefers glycogen</del> (see response from u/nilloc34). I don’t run marathons but I often cycle long-ish distances, and once I’ve been going for a while, if I don’t consume simple carbs (sports drinks, gels, etc.) I’ll start getting sluggish and generally miserable. This is why I wouldn’t recommend long distance running or cycling for weight loss- your performance drops dramatically if you don’t refuel (but short distances are ok). </p>
<p>If any of this is incorrect, let me know- again I’m no expert</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah iirc fats are used as energy once the body runs out of the other stuff. So if you never run out of the other stuff for your body to burn, it’s not gonna be accessing fats as easily to burn. Or something like that.</p></div>		</li>
