			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The amount of people in this thread that have no clue what they’re talking about is astonishing. </p>
<p>Insurance ≠ extended warranty. And insurance companies aren’t making that much money off of your premiums alone. They, like many companies, use that money to hedge and invest. It’s almost like an interest free loan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Insurance is for unexpected, catastrophic losses. People tend to think of it in terms of fender benders and minor shit like that, but rarely think of the bigger picture. Saving your premiums sounds smart and simple until your business burns down or you cause a car accident that kills a family of three or your grain silo blows up or you crash into a schoolbus and you're liable for hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. </p>
<p>I may never need to file a claim. Or I may have one horribly unlucky event occur in my life that makes me damn glad I have that insurance policy. Immature Redditors who think insurance should cover literally anything will scream from the mountaintops that insurance is a scam and no claim in history has ever been paid. These folks should be ignored. If you're afraid you're not fully covered, talk to an insurance agent. Read your policy. Ask questions. Know what your policy covers, know what you're paying for, know what you're <em>not</em> paying for. Unless you're wealthy, simply saving your premiums and hoping that'll be enough for your unforeseen loss is the real gamble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mostly right, but you're needlessly dickish and seem to be dismissive of a genuine issue of insurance companies failing to pay for legitimate claims. It's not true of every circumstance, but it's still an issue, because profit.</p></div>		</li>
