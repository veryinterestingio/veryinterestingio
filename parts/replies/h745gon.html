			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.   Some banks are literally telling large depositors (big corporations) that they won’t accept any more of their cash balances because it costs more to take it than they can make on it.</p>
<p>And of course, there are plenty of people that WANT that money in the form of loans.   The problem is that there isn’t enough loan demand from those that are actually deemed safe enough to qualify for those loans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might sound crazy, but hear me out I think we could actually make that work.</p>
<p>What if we divide up these loans into like tranches and then package those tranches together with tranches of other loans. This would reduce the risk because the tranches could be from various different types of loans in different places or varying risk profiles. So if one loan goes bad, the impact on the investor is minimal. It's building diversification into a single investment product that then allows us to offer loans to people of varying risk profiles...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not their money, it's their customers' money which was deposited, so you can't tax it. </p>
<p>Typically they lend this money out to others (via mortgages or business loans), but no one wants a loan (housing market has already reached its peak). So they buy up mediocre treasuries instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I qualify for tons of loans, but banks don't want to give loans out either. I mean I can put down like 100k on credit cards and that is fine. But asking for a refinance on ~60k of a mortgage to a lower rate is a firm no. My credit rating is over 800 if you are curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying banks don’t want to give out loans is totally incorrect.   Loans are the lifeblood of banks.   No loans, no profits.   They just don’t want to lose money on them.  I know TONS of people that have refinanced their mortgages in the last year!</p></div>		</li>
