			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, Is there something like &quot;ethical&quot; eugenics, I guess that's a debatable topic and needs to be discussed and addressed properly before taking a positive stand on it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Eugenics is a set of beliefs and practices that aims at improving the genetic quality of a human population.</p>
<p>Is there something like &quot;ethical&quot; eugenics?</p>

<p>Why wouldn't there be? The most obvious answer is outright manipulating DNA to eliminate awful conditions, but even people voluntarily choosing not to have kids after being informed of the genetic risk would qualify.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts are this:  Genomics and genetic planning for offspring are already here.  It's doubtful that it will be walked back.  It is being used in some circles to monitor viability towards critical early terminal diseases.  Well see if that proves to be a slippery slope towards designer babies.  I actually think probably not and that the ethics of this will evolve simultaniously with the technology.</p>
<p>What I expect is the larger concern is that there is shortly about to be a major class driven difference where genetic therapies, genetic planning (counseling), etc. will be available to the wealthy while those who are poor cannot afford them.  </p>
<p>If that prove to be important and effective I suspect that there difference between the halves and halve nots may become even more imbalanced.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely agree.</p>

<p>The same could be said for any number of earthly luxuries. Is the world worse off for having discovered a malaria vaccine because not everyone can afford it?</p></div>		</li>
