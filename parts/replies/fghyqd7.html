			<div class="markdown"><p>Minnesota has been known for their ravenous mosquitos for decades at least.</p>
<p>It's the land of 10,000 mosquito breeding pools.</p>
<p>And Wisconsin is a pretty similar landscape and warmer climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but there are also various types of mosquitoes, some of which handle cold better than others.  As the climate gets warmer, these species are going to move further and further north:  <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/28/707604928/chart-where-disease-carrying-mosquitoes-will-go-in-the-future" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/28/707604928/chart-where-disease-carrying-mosquitoes-will-go-in-the-future</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming from Pennsylvania (where ticks have gotten pretty bad in the last 15 years) I was shocked at how bad Minnesota was, especially around the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Never seen so many ticks in my life. I thought because it would generally be more northern and colder (I think?) there would be less, but... clearly my assessment is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While climate change may have contributed a little, that seems a dubious claim, since many places like Idaho and other western states have rarely, if ever, seen temperatures that low since we began recording. </p>
<p>Monoculture replanted forests, unnatural fire suppression, and other factors are far more responsible for the current blight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My former lab did a lot of research on this. It isn't just in the US -- similar species of bark and ambrosia beetles are doing the same thing in Europe and Asia. Over the next five years, most of the region encompassing Southen Germany, Czech, Austria, Poland, etc. will be largely deforested due to beetle outbreaks. Then those forests full of standing dead timber will burn and everyone's going to act like this came out of nowhere and wasn't completely preventable.</p></div>		</li>
