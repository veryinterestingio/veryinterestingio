			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I hijack to ask a question then, because this response is quite pertinent to my own situation none of my specialists have answered.  For someone who has hyperadrenergic postural orthostatic tachycardia, where they are constantly dumping norepinephrine and epinephrine, adrenaline, etc.... when they stand or in somewhat stressful situations, long term, what does that do to the body? Pots is common, and has no real effect on the heart, but hyperadrenergic pots is a very chemical process, has my blood pressure allll over the place, and no one can tell me how it will effect the PFO or MVP long term.  Thx if you can answer this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably wonâ€™t - honestly.</p>
<p>Our bodies are constantly producing catecholamines in various quantities. Itâ€™s unlikely a slight hyperactivity will cause major issues.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t have much experience around that specific issue though. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.vumc.org/adc/38938" target="_blank">Here</a>  is a pretty good resource though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ty. That helped me understand the mechanisms behind what happens, so I think I know how to research the answer Iâ€™m looking for. It also helped me understand why I feel like shit when I donâ€™t get regular IV fluids, and why drinking more doesnâ€™t help, been trying to explain that to family and couldnâ€™t. </p>
<p>Anyways, OP ty for letting me highjack for a second and for an awesome question.</p>
<p>And ty for taking the time to link a helpful site</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One doctor I've been to said she thought I had pots syndrome, and I searched it as Potts syndrome and never found out what you just spelled out and now it all makes so much sense. I totally have that. So thank you for writing this because you just really helped me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am on four different medications that all elevate my heart rate as a side effect. I've been on three of them for over two decades. Before starting me on my 4th, my dr was very hesitant because of the other three I was on. I asked him almost the same question as the OP. Does medication induced elevated heartrate have the same negative effects on the heart as someone whose is elevated because of an unhealthy lifestyle. He said yes and to think of my heart as a car engine. Taking medication with that side effect is like always pushing on the gas- eventually the engine will suffer from overuse. My resting HR is always around 100-110. Is there any type of testing I could have done to see if I already have heart damage thus far? Does that explanation sound right to you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure - as far as increased oxygen demand there is little difference WHY the heart rate is elevated - only that it is.</p>
<p>Nicotine has a whole host of inflammatory issues that make it dangerous long term.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a bit more opaque - itâ€™s likely not detrimental to your health. </p>
<p>Remember, the heart is built to be able to sustain an increased demand for output for a LONG time. Itâ€™s only with chronic diseases and poor health that we run in to problems (usually coronary artery disease). But given enough oxygen and glucose the heart would, theoretically, be able to race away for a shockingly long time (years if not decades).</p></div>		</li>
