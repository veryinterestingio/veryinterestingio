			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. If diluted correctly, hydrogen peroxide is a mild oxidant that will just oxidise whatever the hell is staining your teeth so it doesn't have a visible colour anymore. Plus it's also a disinfectant, so you get rid of the bacteria, that destroy your teeth, just like the alcohol in commercial mouthwashes does. The only minus would be the lack of the nice minty taste, I guess. </p>
<p>Also, if too concentrated, it'll oxidise everything in your mouth... Also, if even more concentrated, it's kinda unstable and might be explosive. But yea, nothing you get in the pharmacy will be this pure, since you mostly buy like 3% aqueous solutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a dentist/doctor but probably not if you use it right. Dilute it with water, don't swallow it, don't over-gargle. I used it all the time when I got canker sores from my braces as a kid.</p></div>		</li>
