			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so about the cigarette thing... smoking can very easily cause a flash (ignite any vapors in the area). A puddle of fuel won’t catch fire but a flash is enough to cause first and second degree burns. The flash point of gasoline is -40 while diesel is ~120f (so unless you’re in the desert in the summer, not much to worry about there).</p>

<p>you can't.  It puts out the cigarette if you put it straight in.  People have tried this many times</p>
<p>Flash point is where it can burn <em>if provided with an ignition source</em>.   It does not self-ignite at this temp.</p>
<p>Gasoline will auto-ignite at 280 °C (536 °F).  A cigarette's cherry is hotter than that, but in practice you will never meet the criteria for ignition that way.  People have tried.</p>
<p>Oddly letting it smolder on paper or a couch has caused many house fires, sure.  But gasoline vapors can't ignite this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said, the vapor can flash. At no point did I say that the the fuel would auto-ignite. I said the opposite. In agreement with you. You’re not wrong, but we’re talking about a different thing. You’re talking about fuel burning, I’m talking about fuel vapor going boom (or poof, really).</p>
<p>However, under the right conditions (and the conditions are broad. Ambient temp, fuel temp, vapor pressure, vapor/oxygen ratio, etc.) a cigarette cherry is enough to cause gasoline vapor to flash. And a flash can be hot enough to cause burns. </p>
<p>I could take YouTube’s word for it, or refer to my time working in an Air Force fuels lab where I tested for this very effect daily. </p></div>		</li>
