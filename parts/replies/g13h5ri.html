			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a distinction between artistic music and popular music, even back then. Composers were largely sponsored by the church or by rich people (think nobility) to create music as a kind of status symbol. This was the music that was most likely to be retrained because of its association with powerful people. However, then general idea that we only listen to the best 1% or so out of a generation is entirely valid. I would hesitate to speculate about our own century's music since tastes vary, but I think it's safe to say that Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, and John Williams will be remembered 200 years from now. As for anyone from the current generation of artists, that is nearly impossible to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're right to say that there were different forms of music back then, the distinctions of &quot;popular&quot; and &quot;art&quot; music were not necessarily in play. At the time of Beethoven, there was an emerging middle class, and these people would have been able to pay to hear Beethoven's music in concert as well as buy sheet music for his pieces. It was very common at this time for people to gather together to sing songs (what we now call &quot;art songs&quot;), play piano music, and recite poetry--in this way, the music of composers like Beethoven and Schubert would have been heard by middle and upper class Viennese, and the piano became a symbol of middle class life. This is very different from the experience of someone like Mozart or Haydn, who, as you say, were primarily sponsored by royalty or nobility. Although Mozart's string quartets may have been for royal ears only, his operas were heard by the general public, and the songs became like popular songs. Opera, in general, began as a kind of popular music, and wasn't patronized by royalty until the French kings took it up; there is a long history in opera of subtle criticism of the ruling classes, which Mozart engaged in vigorously. Bach's music was indeed sponsored by churches and municipal governments (the city of Leipzig for most of his career), but it would have been heard by the church-going public, which presumably (Germany being a Lutheran country) would have included people from all classes. </p>
<p>All of this music, which I would say includes elements of both &quot;art&quot; and &quot;popular&quot;, is only the music that happened to be written down. The fact that it was written down is partly because of its connection to powerful people, but also the necessity of communicating music to entire orchestras. There was also music made by peasant classes--folk dances, ballads, and such. Most of this music wasn't written down, because it didn't need to be and the peasants were illiterate, so we don't know what it would have sounded like, although we can guess from written descriptions as well as instances where literate composers wrote music intended to sound like peasant music.</p></div>		</li>

<p>John Williams, who I'm pretty sure has taught his music to more people than Beethoven or Bach thanks to the popularity of Star Wars</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to chime in to say that John Williams's fame goes WAY beyond Star Wars.  The themes from Jaws, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, E.T., Harry Potter, Superman, and many more are instantly recognizable to most people.  It is astounding how many memorable pieces he has written; nearly every piece of movie music that has reached mass consciousness was written by John Williams.</p>
<p>I should add: apart from musicals.  That would be unfair to the great Alan Menken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you, it is likely the case of &quot;who did it first&quot;. A lot of classical music nowadays starts blending together save for the few really notable ones. Thanks for your answer :)</p></div>		</li>
