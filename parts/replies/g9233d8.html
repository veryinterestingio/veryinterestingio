<p>Crying in humans is the display of physical or emotional distress. Your body undergoes several reactions when you cry, not just having tears come from your eyes. Your voice tensing up is part of that.</p>

<p>This is the correct answer. The other answers explain the how, but not the why. Our voices aren't normal during crying because <em>things aren't normal</em>, and it's best when other people can easily recognize that fact (even if - in the moment - the crier would rather them not).</p></div>		</li>
