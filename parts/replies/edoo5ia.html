			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a cardiac cath tech in the US.
Cardiac catheterization (cardiac cath angiogram: a minimally invasive procedure used to diagnose coronary disease and treat blockage. Performed by a cardiologist under conscious sedation usually) costs a minimum of $10000 for the procedure alone, all equipment that is used is charged individually, ie catheters, wires, balloons, stents, etc. A typical emergent cardiac cath that includes all the drugs necessary during an acute MI ends up being something like $25000+~ ish, before insurance.</p>
<p>Some hospitals run specials on HeartView CT scans (aka Cardiac Calcium Score CT) where you can pay less than $100 out of pocket for the scan, but if you go through insurance it’s something like $5000-$8000. A CT Calcium Score (more accurate in diagnosing degree of plaque in coronary arteries) is different than a CT Chest Angiogram (typically to eval for pulmonary emboli, aortic aneurysms, way less accurate in diagnosing degree of plaque in coronaries, etc). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sorry for your loss. I lost my wife last year in a very similar situation. Still awaiting final autopsy report more than 3 months later but it sounded like they thought it was a heart attack and there was evidence of severe arteriosclerosis. I don’t think there’s really any great answers in a situation like this. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk. </p></div>		</li>
