			<div class="markdown"><p>In chemistry there is a rule: Like dissolves like.  This means we use hydrophobic molecules (like oil) to dissolve hydrophobic substances and we use hydrophilic substances (like water) to dissolve hydrophilic substances. A soap molecule has a hydrophobic end and a hydrophilic end so it can dissolve both kinds of substances. Most facial cleaners use an emulsions that contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic stuff to achieve the same result as soap w/o stripping all the natural oils off.  Here's a secret for dry skin: you can use olive oil to wash your  face and the oil will just seep in and moisturize your face.  (gently rub a tsp of warm olive oil into your dry areas. Wipe clean with a hot, wet wash cloth - it will be clean and free of dirt AND it will leave a monolayer of oil to protect your skin - no soap!) Somehow, oil has gotten a bad rap in the cosmetic world maybe because old makeup and facepaint was/is oil based but the truth is oil is needed to moisturize dry skin. People who live in desert conditions where it is very low humidity use olive oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, etc to take care of their skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oil in the cosmetics world is sometimes recycled used cooking oil; also the term oily is related to oily skin, so it is also a terminology stigma. </p>
<p>Buy quality brands who use quality oils and you are good. Buying discount makeup from places like China could actually be recycled cooking oil and harmful products. </p>
<p>My point is just that there is a reason for the avoidance of oil. </p>
<p>That said, I use a cbd infused olive oil rub and my face has never been happier, especially during dry months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cure for dry skin: lightly glide a small wet glob of Vaseline across your body before you get out of the shower. The key is to seal in some of the moisture on your wet skin. PAT dry (never rub) your skin, and then, rub the Vaseline residue left on your damp body into your skin. If you feel overly greasy, or stick to fabric, you are using too much. You can only use a towel once, but after a couple of weeks, your skin will be calm.</p></div>		</li>

In the 40's ( I think) they took the chemicals that made the suds, and sales tanked bc the public was taught, and got used to the idea, suds = clean. So when no suds were seen, people didn't feel clean</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same goes for &quot;thick&quot; formulations of couch/sore throat medicines. The medicine inside the syrup gets absorbed in the stomach/intenstines so it shouldn't matter whether the product is viscous or thin/runny - as long as the medicines arrive in the stomach and get absorbed, they'll all work similiarly. </p>
<p><strong>However, customers always prefer the version of the syrup that is very thick and when swallowed, coats their throats.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is largely inaccurate because it assumes all surfactants are basically the same. Some will be beneficial for harder water conditions, cleaning certain products etc. </p>
<p>Powder laundry detergent, bar soap, and liquid detergent are NOT the same and nowhere close.  Bar soap is saponified with diavalant ions and primarily fatty acids.  Powder detergent and liquid detergent have more similiaries but liquid has emerged as the dominant form in developed worlds because it doesn’t suffer from the dissolution challenges of powder and can therefore act faster and more reliably in the cold/quick conditions.  </p>
<p>Hair care products and laundry/dish products have about nothing in common other than they contain surfactant.  Preferred chain lengths, charge densities, cmc are all different.  </p>
<p>Might as well say that steel toes shoes are the same as a stiletto heal because they’re both shoes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain the difference between dish washing liquid and shampoo? If I check the main ingredient on any of my shampoo bottles it’s sodium/ammonium lauryl sulfate and/or sodium/ammonium laureth sulfate. My bottle of Palmolive dish soap also has ammonium lauryl sulfate and ammonium laureth sulfate as the main two ingredients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of things: you can’t go by the label as “main ingredient” when comparing surfactants. The other ingredients can have a major affect on the behavior and the “main” surfactant is there to stabilize the co-surfactants.  lauramidopropylanine and sodium xylene sulfonate are both found in Palmolive and used predominately for greasy foods which shouldn’t be you shower products. They are like the 5th ingredients down but far more important in cleaning. </p>
<p>Difference between laurel and laureth sulfate can be massive based on % split of those two and “size” of laureath which can vary a lot based on choices.  Or it could be almost no difference. Both get labeled the same. </p>
<p>Concentration will be very different.  Dish soap is more concentrated.  Shampoo can’t be because of eye safety.</p></div>		</li>
