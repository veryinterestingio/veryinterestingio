On a somewhat related note, the appropriate number of &quot;chuggas&quot; before a &quot;choo-choo&quot; is eight. üòÅ</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. You‚Äôll notice when choosing a laxative there are a couple of different levels and they basically all do the same thing you just pick the intensity. Level 1 is a ‚Äústool softener‚Äù which adds just a smidge of water to soften your poop and help it come out. The next level is 2 these are your laxatives they work in the same way just causing your body to add more water to the mix.  I‚Äôm going to call this level 3 but it‚Äôs really part of level 2 these are your hardcore laxatives. Once again adding a good amount of water to the system but these are more violent.  Then there‚Äôs level 4... some say created by satan himself, these aren‚Äôt pills that you take rather a solution provided by your doctor when they need to ‚Äúclean you out‚Äù. This type of laxative is mixed into a big jug of water. You have to drink that entire jug and then they suggest drinking even more. Now normally you would pee out this liquid, however the laxative in its sets off alarm bells. Something is real bad in your system and must be flushed out. The reason for the delivery method being in a giant jug of liquid, is simple! This liquid is what‚Äôs going to ‚Äúflush‚Äù you out. If you‚Äôve ever seen someone have to drink this you‚Äôll notice they spend a lot of time on the toilet.  Now depending on your fiber intake what comes out ranges between brown mucky water, and what looks like thick brown paint.  The kind so thick that when you flush it doesn‚Äôt all come out and you got to take a brush to it to get it off then you have to clean the brush in the toilet. </p>
<p>My dad had a colonoscopy done last year and he downed that drink like a champ! Basically just chugged it then washed the flavor down with a cup of water. Next thing he knew he was on the toilet for 2 hours.  Doctors said his insides were so cleaned out there was a mirrored reflection in there /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to have the same procedure and honestly, it stings so much. Within a few hours it's just a slightly yellow liquid coming out of you which feels like fire because your sore behind has been wiped so many times. Honestly, I cannot recommend baby wipes enough.</p>
<p>Fasting for a day and going through all that and turns out there's nothing wrong with my insides apparently. The funnt thing is if you rinse out all the foodstuffs which cause this pain and irritation then my body looks very healthy. The solution to all my problems is don't eat üòÖ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all laxatives are osmotic (adding water to the stool) or softening, though. There are also bulk-forming and stimulant laxatives. The former adds fibre to the stool and the latter triggers the muscles of the gut to contract.</p></div>		</li>
