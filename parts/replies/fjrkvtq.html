Therefore is the interest to recycle it high.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Just to expand a bit, mining bauxite is the cheap and easy part. The price of raw bauxite is generally below $40 per ton, and the price is relatively stable. This material is more than 50% various aluminum oxides (any lower-grade ones are not worth extracting yet).</p>
<p>The next step from bauxite is using the Bayer process, which is basically a complex heated chemical bath to separate and refine Alumina (Al2O3), which currently has a price of ~$300 per ton, although this price is more volatile and depends a lot on market conditions and where you are purchasing. As you need somewhat less than two tonnes of bauxite for one ton of alumina, the price of Alumina is ~25% raw material and ~75% processing.</p>
<p>The next step from Alumina is smelting, which involves using a lot of electricity to liberate all that oxygen from the material so that you end up just pure aluminum metal. Aluminum market price is currently around $1700 per ton, although it is very volatile and fluctuates a lot based on supply and current demand.
You need about 1.45 tons of alumina for every ton of aluminum you make, so of the final price of the metal, about 7% is the ore, 20% is the processing into alumina, and a whopping 73% is the smelting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The defining factor usually is &quot;how much energy did we use to source the raw, virgin stock in the first place&quot;. Aluminium is special in this sense, it takes so much to separate it from the ore in the first place. It is very abundant, much more than people usually realize but because of its reactivity, it is bonded to something. Breaking that bond will take a lot of energy and we also have to keep new bonds from forming.   </p>
<p>Iron is entirely different in this sense, it is relatively cheap to extract and refine. Aluminium is difficult, expensive and dangerous and why it is very effectively recycled also in the consumer level. Copper, zinc etc in consumer devices are almost all thrown to landfills, industry is the only actor who recycles..   </p>
<p>Only recently we have started to recycle some of them, like in consumer electronics but even there the metal collection is minor thing. They contain a lot of toxic stuff that it will cause environmental problems and we as humans will suffer from it.</p></div>		</li>
