<p>Edit: question deleted it's about F1 race car to team communication . It's only an educated guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not Doppler — F1 radios are probably AM radios, which means the radio signals rely on the amplitude of the signal to transmit audio. Amplitude is inherently susceptible to noise, which results in that low audio quality.</p>
<p>EDIT THEY ARE NOT AM RADIOS - they’re narrowband FM (specifically, I think they use the tetra transmission protocol). The reason they sound bad is the same reason phone audio sounds bad: only a specific narrow frequency band (I think centered around roughly 3kHz) is used</p></div>		</li>
