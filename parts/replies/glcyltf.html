			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to explain confirmation bias is that you seek out information to support your beliefs and ignore any contradictory information. Like if I told you all vaccines are harmful and I came to this conclusion by only googling and looking at articles where there was a bad outcome after a vaccination ignoring the billions of examples of positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Edit to add: you seek information that &quot;confirms&quot; your belief and ignore information that contradicts it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple of tweaks here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cognitive dissonance is where thinking and doing are two separate things. Imagine a serial killer believing killing is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's less about the 'doing' and more the conflict and how it alters your previous thinking.  Your example is more denial than CD.  Better to think of it as the stress and mental adjustment that occurs when the person who thought killing is wrong finds themselves staring at their first dead victim.  The CD causes them to readjust their belief system to correct for the incongruity so instead of them thinking 'killing is wrong' they'll likely start thinking 'some killing is justified' or similar.  This new belief being what supports their later serial killing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Confirmation bias is where a outcome is expected (or wanted) so badly it shifts results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't shift results.  CB makes you more likely to miss, ignore, or discredit results that conflict with your beliefs and would be better suited to explain your original serial killer example.  The killer, believing murder is wrong, might make excuses like 'I didn't kill my spouse.  They tripped and fell into the knife'.  Honestly missing that they thrust the knife forward.</p>
<p>CB could be used to explain the person dismissing that they killed someone and saying they are a good person because they donate to charity annually, have two upstanding children, pray every day, and are loved by everyone in their family, friends, and workplace although this is not the go to example normally given ðŸ¤£</p>
<p>CB is more often used for when you believe something like the Earth is flat, see photos from space and dismiss them as 'probably photoshopped' while ignoring that the Earth's shadow on the Moon is <strong>always</strong> round.  A picture from high up in the atmo that makes the planet look flat?  Def not photoshopped, is valid pic.</p>
<p>;tldr Confirmation Bias:  denies the truth* by favouring oftentimes weaker evidence that supports the lie they believe (you can substitute 'truth' with 'information that conflicts with their beliefs true or not')</p>
<p>Cognitive Dissonance:  the stress of being confronted with an undeniable fact that conflicts with their beliefs  which results in an adjustment to their thinking to become compatible with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What? No. Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort caused by attempting to mentally reconcile two incompatible ideas.</p>
<p>This term is often used incorrectly to reference the <em>complete absence</em> of cognitive dissonance. What these people actually mean is something more like &quot;doublethink.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So an example of &quot;complete absence&quot; of CD would be to think x is bad, do &quot;x&quot;, and not feel that it has to be justified mentally? Sorry if I am going in the weeds on the thought, genuinely curious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is understandable why the OP confused Congnitive Dissonance and Confirmation Bias.</p>
<p>Cognitive Dissonance often comes when Confirmation Bias is hit with hard facts that are irrefutable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>CD can indeed involve a conflict between one's thoughts and one's actions. For example, the Festinger and Carlsmith experiment (1959), in which participants were asked to perform a boring and repetitive task, and were then paid money to tell the next group of participants that it was interesting. They were then asked to rate how boring/interesting they found the task. The purpose of the experiment was to see whether they would change their beliefs to match their actions.</p></div>		</li>
