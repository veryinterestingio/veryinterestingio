			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, many places here in the US have to ship their samples from very rural areas to these testing facilities. Our courier comes at 10 am. Once. If the swab is collected in the evening it waits til the next day. Our courier doesn’t operate on the weekends, so our COVID tests wait all weekend to go out in the morning on Monday. If my hospital system had tons of new/extra funding I’m sure they would change their systems and speed up turn around times but it’s just not possible right now. We’re doing the best we can with what we are given.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your basic lab working 08:00-18:00 Mon-Fri</p>
<p>They have enough staff to cover this plus enough extra to cover the fact that some people are going to be on leave/sick/pregnant/etc</p>
<p>They almost certainly don't have a single person more, but they are happy and chugging along doing there thing.  Then COVID happens and some bright spark on the internet say we should be testing 24/7 the disease doesn't go away.</p>
<p>Okay says the lab and magically increases it's staff complement by 4X to make internet guy happy at exactly the same time every other lab also grabs enough extra staff to take them from HH/D to 24/7</p>
<p>Also without changing the budget they are working from or increasing the amount of equipment (sorry that should read specialised built to order equipment) they have on hand.</p>
<p>If you look at the problem and it's simple and obvious that everyone is doing it wrong it's more likely that you don't understand the problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of labs can't afford the extra overtime it would cost to pay people to work on the weekends.  Plus you have to have people willing to work on the weekends.  We're having a hard enough time to find people willing to do covid testing 8-5 M-F, let alone on the weekends</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much more. They're creating a monopoly in the lab world buying out labs, so again the issue of too many tests, insufficient staff, and a reagent supply problem. </p>
<p>But trying not to get into the politics of it all, last I heard they were backed up at least two weeks (we joke at work that it's pointless to even bother to get a test at that point, you've already passed it on and possibly recovered by then)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I'm traveling soon and the state I'm traveling to wants most nonresidents to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival ... unless we can show a negative COVID test from within three days of entering the state. Strictly speaking, I don't meet the screening requirements for most drive-through testing sites, so I was considering a Quest or Labcorp option (both say they give results in 24-48 hours). Your input, however, will make me rethink my plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I got tested locally (provided free by the county health service) and they didn't call me until 24 days later.</p>
<p>So it was super useless.</p>
<p>Test came back negative though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For large national reference labs, not all locations perform all tests. Reference labs have to account for extra shipping and processing delays. Samples are usually sent overnight/next day air but you have to account for specimen processing at two different facilities. </p>
<p>The way it generally works is like this. You get swabbed in the late morning, a courier shows up and brings your swab to your local Quest lab. Specimen processing is usually done on evening and overnight shifts. Your local lab doesn’t do covid testing, so processing accessions it and sends it to the airport for next day air. It makes it to the lab sometime in the early afternoon, but again specimen processing is staffed mostly on evening/overnight so you’ll probably get to the actual building where testing is being performed a full 48 hours after being swabbed. </p>
<p>By far the biggest hurdles have been shortages of equipment and reagents, but also personnel. Viral transfer media is a screw top and the swabs have to be removed or the sample aliquotted, and this is generally a manual process so it scales linearly with the number of tubes. </p>
<p>I know at least one lab that is combating this by requiring the deswabbing to be done <em>before</em> the sample is submitted to the lab in order to reduce the work load at the lab. There’s no way I could convince our decision makers to follow that path so we simply run significantly less samples than we could because we’re staff limited and there’s internal resistance to hiring new employees for something considered temporary.</p></div>		</li>
