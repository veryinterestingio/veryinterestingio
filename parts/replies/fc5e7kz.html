			<div class="markdown"><p>I love planet money. It’s the only podcast I listen to, any others I might find intriguing are always either too boring, only one person talking, or too jokey, or lots of other things. Planet money is the best mix of everything I love in a podcast, do you have any other recommendations of something similar? Doesn’t have to be the same subject matter but I love informative podcasts like that one.</p></div>		</li>
