			<div class="markdown"><p>And, even if one-way mirrors existed, you couldn’t trap light inside a mirrored box because mirrors are not 100% efficient. Even if the mirrors reflect 99.99% of incident light, the amount of light remaining will be less than 0.01% after 100,000 bounces. But light is so fast that if your box has side length 1 meter, 100,000 bounces would occur in less than a third of a millisecond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LIGO's mirrors lose one photon out of 3 million per bounce. A box with a side length of 1 meter would have an exponential decay time of 10 milliseconds. Make it 100 meters and you get a second. Use the LIGO tunnel (-&gt; 40s) and you can still see the light after a minute if other losses can be minimized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually amazing. Has such an experiment ever been done? Maybe not with the LIGO tunnel, but with the 100m setup for example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would actually eventually start to have it's own gravity! Even though light has no rest mass (mass in the traditional sense) it still has energy and <em>will</em> warp spacetime accordingly. Probably. (Maybe. Has anyone tested this for sure?)</p>
<p>Anyway if the magic box holds up it'll eventually collapse into a black hole! A black hole formed this way is called a Kugelblitz!</p>
<p>This would actually be super useful, so get to spell-crafting!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some back of the envelope calculations say the magic box would gain around ~16 grams of light pressure per second in the sun. So, depending on how strong your magic mirror cube is, it would eventually explode. My question is, would it be harder to move the cube as it gains more light pressure, due to the light pressure, inertial affects or something?</p></div>		</li>
