			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely one of the most exciting and promising prospects for future innovation are quantum computers. The reason is that they operate in a completely different way than any other technology, today. They use the physical phenomena of nature to manipulate information via quantum mechanics, one of the most wonderful and strange parts of science. Unlike a classical computer a quantum computer can have powers of superposition, interference and entanglement. These powers make it impossible for us to implement quantum circuits on classical computers.  Quantum computers are not a replacement for classical ones, they are an entirely new model of computation. I see them working together to complement the traditional systems by allowing us to solve some intractable problems.</p>
<p>I am particularly excited about combining this power with that of classical machines. I believe that the future of computing is &quot;bits + neurons + qubits&quot; coming together to allow us to access solutions to challenging problems in a fundamentally new way.  I recently gave a plenary talk at ISSCC on this topic.
