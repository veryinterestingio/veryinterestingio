			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically every mammal that's ever been tested for it dreams. Of course there's no way of knowing for sure since we can't ask them, but their brain patterns and eye movements are consistent with REM sleep which is the phase most associated with dreaming in humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some reptiles also dream. I've noticed REM and paw twitches (like a dreaming dog) in both my Varanus Melinus.</p>
<p>Funny thing, I've never seen them do it underwater (they can sleep totally submerged like crocodiles). Their sleep pattern is really different when sleeping in dry land vs in the water feature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much every animal with a brain should be able to dream. Dreaming is the process in which neurons in your brain fire at random during REM sleep. What you actually see is how your brain interprets those signals. As the neuron thing is a consequence of having a brain most animals should dreams or do something similar.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But cats have been known to have that condition as well where they act out their dreams while they sleep.</p>

<p>I believe there are videos out there of cats who have had their brains altered in such a way as to encourage this further. (Experiment studying somnambulism) They straight up act out their dreams 100% of the time. It's creepy to watch.</p></div>		</li>
