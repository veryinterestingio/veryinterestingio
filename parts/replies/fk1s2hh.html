			<div class="markdown"><p>They can lower them if the load is too heavy, so as to not exceed the load rating on the other tires and they can raise them when not needed to increase fuel efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. They also don't turn with the truck so we have to raise them as we go around corners, then put them back down once we straighten out.</p>
<p>Edit to add: so if you see one of these trailers with all their axles down, it means they have a heavy load on and cannot stop as quickly as other trucks,  which already stop more slowly than cars.  So please, please, please do not cut in front of us and slam on your brakes to make a corner in front of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh. I always thought they were there in case the main tires all got punctured, so when the trailer drops it can still roll on the backup tires.</p></div>		</li>
