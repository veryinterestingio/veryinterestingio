			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven’t played this particular game, but I do have a couple games with so many ads it’s almost impossible to play, but here’s what I do:
I go into my settings and turn off data for the app, and then whenever I want to play I just turn off my WiFi. Then no ads! This iPhone btw. It’s worked for every game app I play so far, as long as you don’t need internet connection to play it</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel guilty doing that but I only do it if the number of ads is absurd</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just use Blokada, on Android but I think it's on iOS too. </p>
<p>Turn it on, turn on some rule filters for ad blocking and specifically mobile game ad blocking and then you don't get ads, plus your Internet is still on. </p>
<p>If you have any issues with any other aps because of it, you can either whitelist what's getting blocked, or just set the app to bypass the filtering entirely. </p>
<p>I use it for all kinds of stupid mobile games that normally are more ads than game, but without ads you can play for a little bit, have whatever fun there is to be had and then move on lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this on Android too. You can stop any app from using your WiFi or data on the settings, you don't even have to turn the WiFi or data off. It's the only way to play some games.</p></div>		</li>
