			<div class="markdown"><p>It really isn't common - but in the 44 of 50 years I've lived here, it seems to have happened more often in recent years than in the past.  </p>
<p>The last couple of years here in southern Niagara County I've heard it rumbling during snow storms but really only during Lake Effect snow from the southwest.  Won't happen under normal snow events.</p></div>		</li>
