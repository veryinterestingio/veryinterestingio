			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Exclusive coffee drinking does not result in death by dehydration.</p>
<p>There's some disagreement as to whether coffee is a proper diuretic or simply causes you to urinate smaller volumes more frequently due to it being an irritant. But that's an entire can of worms.</p>
<p>It's technically possible to survive without any &quot;pure&quot; water at all if you eat sufficiently hydrating &quot;solids&quot;. You actually lose more water each day than you physically consume due to water being a metabolic byproduct. Just gotta have enough water <em>in your entire intake</em> to balance the register.</p></div>		</li>
