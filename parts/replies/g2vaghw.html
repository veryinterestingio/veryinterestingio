<p>Vaccines it is always best to have a humoral immunity</p>

<p>That's a great point. While a T-cell transfusion may be effective in the moment, it wouldn't be acting as a &quot;vaccine&quot; as OP described it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this would be considered an immuno-therapy, not a &quot;vaccine&quot;. </p>
<p>Humoral immunity will develop if and only if the patient is subsequently exposed to the virus itself, while having sufficient numbers of the (infection-specific) T cells in the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, by definition a vaccine requires an immune response. OP is asking I think, in lieu of a vaccine, could transplanted cells work? In other words transplanting immune cells that did have an immune response to an antigen (from the doner whether a vaccine initiated or the actual agent).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term vaccine has really broadened these days. There is  sipuleucel-T, an anti-prostate cancer T-cells vaccine that is FDA approved. And of course, there are dendritic cell vaccines, not ready for prime-time yet. It's somewhat arbitrary though. CAR-T cells and genetically engineered TCRs are not called vaccines.</p></div>		</li>
