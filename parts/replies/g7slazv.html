			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. First assumption in IT is to assume the users are both deliberately trying to sabotage everything, and are illiterate. </p>
<p>I can't tell you how many times I've gotten calls from someone panicking after they installed some software and there's a dialog that says &quot;software installed successfully&quot; with an OK button and they have no clue what to do. But 2 days later when they need to turn off virus scanning and disable their firewall to install some funny mouse cursors that hijack their browser and copy off all their files, suddenly they're Kevin Mitnick.</p>
<p>Updates are there to protect you, and they force you to install them because you're too dumb to let them do their job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've helped postgrad students to improve their digital literacy... I was really excited about all the useful quality of life stuff I was going to be able to help these people with and spent weeks leading up to the first classes researching what could be useful and practising how to introduce it. Turns out that may not have been necessary. </p>
<p>One session I took a full ten minutes one on one getting a student to understand the difference between &quot;left click&quot; and &quot;right click&quot;. Another student became very anxious while I helped her set up a Gmail account - turns out her anxiety was due to being unsure she would be able to remember which computer we were doing this on (library computer lab so maybe 50 computer stations), and what if someone else was using that computer when she came to check her emails? And how can she send them from this computer to her home computer? She was then very suspicious of the idea that she could access her emails from home simply by logging in from there. </p>
<p>Fun times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe this is me judging something which I have no knowledge of (i.e. the specific work environment these users are working in), but in the corporate environments I've worked in, users are prompted for admin credentials for this type of stuff, specifically for this reason.</p>
<p>If you get a proper on-prem domain configured and revoke local admin (assuming a Windows environment here), this won't be an issue anymore.</p>
<p>Even the CEO is not local admin where I work: &quot;It's a centralized policy. If I grant you local admin, it'll grant a bunch of people local admin. You don't want local admin, anyway. If Chrome, for example, runs something it's not supposed to as an admin, it'll break stuff that's hard and expensive to fix. Just let me know if you need to install something and I'll put in the password remotely, even at 3am.&quot;</p>
<p>(I'm fully aware that, as software vulnerabilities go, Chrome is pretty far down the list. CEO doesn't need to know this, though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh. I understand this response. This is the quick and snarky answer by developers, but really, I don't care for this attitude generally.</p>
<p>A person is operating a computer to do whatever they want. They don't need to understand what's going on behind the scenes, that's not why they have the product; it's the designer's responsibility to communicate why things are important (which is tricky, admittedly). So ideally, we wouldn't have posts like these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that - Windows used to decide it had a billion crucial critical NOW NOW NOW updates constantly, which turned out to be 90% unnecessary and often changed features or undid settings. So I turned off updates. Now I don't every 6 months. </p>
<p>If devs made critical updates just for critical shit, a lot of users would be more receptive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point, and to add on...   Once an exploit is found and patched, the exploit is then known.</p>
<p>Computer company:  &quot;We found out that you can do <em>xyz</em> nefarious thing, and fixed it.&quot;<br />
Nefarious individual:  &quot;So anyone not patched is specifically vulnerable to <em>xyz</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>By announcing the patch, the company announces the weakness.  If you take to long to patch yourself, you're extra vulnerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very important point. Many of the most impactful viruses was actually patched long before the virus actually started to spread. Blaster is a good example of this, where the patch came out one month before the virus, and even so that virus had an huge impact simply because people don't patch their systems. Many of the more known security breaches are also due to hackers simply using and testing for known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Never wait more than a week to install new security patches and you should be pretty safe in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty accurate lol. Even with a legitimate copy of Windows, I never do a major update without creating a restore point first. Last time I did, the update caused VMware, which my work depends on, to break. It was a pain in the ass to fix.</p></div>		</li>
