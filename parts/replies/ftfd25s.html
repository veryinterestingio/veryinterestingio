			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if humans couldn't break the sound barrier, one can observe it being broken routinely in astrophysical scenarios. Shockwaves are mundane in the universe. On the other hand, we have never ever observed any particle in the universe going faster than c. Sure, we have theories that might describe such particles but until we get hard evidence, they will remain theories.  </p>
<p>When physicists say they're confident the &quot;light barrier&quot; (i.e. moving faster than c), if I may use such a term, cannot be broken, they're expressing their faith in the Theory of Relativity as we know it because it has been buttressed by a metric ton of evidence. Yet, if they observe a single particle unequivocally traveling faster than c, they'll have to rethink our model of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because it's impossible to push an object with mass to reach or exceed light speed doesn't mean it's impossible that we'll figure out a way to get around that using space warping or something. I don't think it's likely, but the math says it's not impossible if you make a couple of concessions that we haven't been able to definitively say are impossible.</p>
<p>It's likely to be extremely difficult if not impossible though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this some kind of paradox. &quot;Observe&quot; something traveling faster than the speed of light. Light being the means for which we observe everything. Unless we produce that which surpasses light we won't &quot;observe&quot; this scenario.</p>
<p>We know forces exist that can trap light but we barely understand those forces at best. I do dislike the idea of affirming something with such certainty when it has such barriers around the explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an object were traveling faster than light, couldn't we tell just by keeping track of its position? If the time it took to move from point A to point B were faster than light, then we would be able to observe it. We might be seeing some delayed information of it's true position, but I think we could calculate the speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that particular argument in this specific context is that we actually have been able to implicitly observe something moving faster than c - space itself. The entire universe is larger than the observable universe, because the space beyond the observable universe is expanding faster than light can travel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the expansion of the universe does exceed the speed of light above the Hubble radius, it doesn't get treated the same way a localized object with mass (or charge or information) would. The General Theory of Relativity (GTR) allows this superluminal expansion because it's described as the rate of change of the scale factor that multiplies a comoving reference frame. i.e. it's just a stage where all the objects in the universe are set and it doesn't matter if this particular stage expands superluminally. What GTR and STR forbid however is the transmission of information faster than the speed of light. </p>
<p>You can achieve apparent superluminal speeds much more simply if you consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_paradox" target="_blank">the lighthouse paradox</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry, I might not be explaining this properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a bit different because there are plenty of things that move faster than the speed of sound. But for a long time humans weren't capable of reaching that speed. But there was never any sort of law of physics saying things <em>couldn't</em> move that fast.</p>
<p>You can think of &quot;the speed of light&quot; as literally meaning &quot;as fast as something can go.&quot; It <em>is</em> a law of physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of things broke the sound barrier before Yeager. Most bullets, rockets, whips, propeller tips (sometimes). The difficulty was an engineering one, not a laws of physics one. The speed of light is a hard maximum speed and going faster has all sorts of bad, physics-breaking implications.</p></div>		</li>
