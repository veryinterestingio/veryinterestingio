/* CHANGE LOG
    - Changed from "if do while" loop to simpler "while" loop.
    - New function "nearestHuman()" searches the environment for the closest human.
    - harvest function no longer takes an argument by reference, instead returns a boolean.

<p>edit: hopefully that makes everyone happy! I know this post was/is a joke, but I do actually appreciate the input from other knowledgeable people. I've still got plenty to learn and enjoy learning and improving whenever I can, so critiques are helpful and welcome! (that being said, this isn't supposed to be the &quot;entire code&quot; which is why some things aren't defined before use and what not)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's quite true.  I remember reading research on a species of wasp that was biologically programmed to put four crickets into its nest.  You could remove a cricket immediately after a wasp left it and the wasp would not replace it because it lacks awareness of the event and never actually counts the current number of crickets in the nest.</p></div>		</li>

Simulating the dynamics of a finite number of these things is basically impossible with our current computational architecture. Analytical understanding is obviously not forthcoming either.
