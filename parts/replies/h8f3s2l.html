			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a kid in my grade in school who had a red ring around his mouth from sucking on his own lips or something. That kid did lewd, inappropriate things you'd get arrested for immediately now, this was back in the 90's, but teachers would just tell him to stop it and not go any further on punishing him for it. I'm not sure if he was not all there or just a creep to be honest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't thought about that kid until now but now that I am I'm really curious what happened to him. Last I heard was a few years after we graduated, he had joined the military but I think was discharged shortly after. Now I need to do some research lol</p></div>		</li>
