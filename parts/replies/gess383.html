<p>Nitpick: An earlier calculation from Cassini and Richer in 1670 used observations of the parallax of Mars as seen from Paris &amp; Cayenne. They derived the distance to the Sun as 93% of its actual value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was about the mid 1700's that astronomers tried measuring the distance of stars that they realized just how far away stars must be when the parallax of the <em>entire orbit of the Earth</em> showed zero shift. Minds were blown all over the world!</p></div>		</li>

<p>The sun's distance was figured out in 1761 with another parallax observation. Around 50 years earlier Sir Edmund Halley (of Halley's Comet fame) devised a distance measuring method by observing how long it took Venus to transit the sun.</p>

<p>Chasing Venus by Andrea Wulf is a fantastic book about this transit and how Halley started to organize an initiative to send dozens of astronomers dispatched all over the world to measure the transits of 1761 and 1769. He didn't live to see the transit of 61. </p>
<p>It's a fascinating story including poor Le Gentile who didn't reach his destination and missed the 61 transit, decided to wait until the 69 transit, only to miss that one too because of cloudy weather.</p></div>		</li>
