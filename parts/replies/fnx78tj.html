			<div class="markdown"><p>No - it spread worldwide pretty much ignoring the local season </p>
<p>Plus being novel adds a different layer since there is no immunity to slow it down </p>
<p>Flu has many inputs including partial immune responses to potential variants vs the open field Covid-19 finds itself in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seasonality may not make a difference for a totally emergent virus that nobody has any immunity to. However, say years from now when(hopefully) the majority of the population has at least some immunity to it from vaccines and past exposure then it may need to be more opportunistic in order to spread, and generally URIs do better in winter time for a variety of reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make a stronger claim of course, but as (s)he says early evidence suggests likely that it doesnt mutate much. Of course with more time to observe we will learn more about it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they are talking about the seasonality of the virus. For the mutation, we do know the viruses proofreads itself and mutates decently less than something like the flu, so we have more data there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily a full year is required. Mutations occur much more frequently in smaller organisms as their lifespans are shorter than a human. You can observe bacteria in a petri dish that take on extra genes, etc. The coronavirus is mutating currently, but at a slow rate and in ways that the functions arent being altered. You can predict based on a viruses replication timescale and the number of observed mutations from the parent strain to see how quickly it will become &quot;different&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
