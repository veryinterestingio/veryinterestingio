			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Large wounds we have 2 main ways of medically repairing them. (there are some other options but theyre not commonly used, atleast where I am) </p>
<p>First you can pack a wound, this is done by filling the wound with a wet sterile dressing (normally saline soaked gauze, but there are foams and things that can be used aswell), this makes the wound heal from the bottom up, you need to change these dressing frequently but they tend to have a good outcome when looked after appropriately.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the wound is too serious and no amount of time and keeping it clean will allow it to heal, a skin graft is used. A form of plastic surgery in which a patch of healthy skin is taken (normally from a thigh or buttock) and placed over the damaged area. Your skin naturally heals in the place where the skin was taken from, and eventually the grafted skin heals and blends into the surrounding living skin. Unfortunately grafted skin is normally a lot paler then the surrounding skin even after the healing process is complete. So its always somewhat obvious that it's been done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After a bout of necrotising pancreatitis I had an emergency pancreatectomy which left a hole in my chest the size of a clothes iron. After stapling I was left with a large &quot;Mercedes&quot; scar but an open wound a bit bigger than a playing card that eventually healed itself without stiches.</p></div>		</li>
