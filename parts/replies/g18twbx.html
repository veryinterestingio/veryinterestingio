			<div class="markdown"><p>The world we live in today changes in ways that are hard to compare to historical data. The advent of the internet changes everything for language. I don’t know about other linguists making predictions based on historical change, but many predict that English will remain the global language as language diversity will reduce. Some linguists predict much more variation on English to come, as local variations of English have been surfacing more and more frequently. See Singlish for an example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other comments speaks mostly to distribution of languages (very broadly) but to answer your question the answer is no. Using historical things like phonological, semantic, lexical and syntatic (to name a few!) changes aren’t really good at predicting what changes will occur in the future because, at the end of the day, language is arbitrary and a lot of the time the changes that are made are arbitrary as well. That’s not to say that anything is possible - there are limits at every level to what can change - but to try an predict the next major linguistic shift in a given language is a bit like trying to predict what meme will making it to the front page this time next year. There are too many factors and too much randomness baked into the human experience to make any sort of meaningful prediction. </p>
<p>That said, we can use those data you reference to comment on the likelihood of a given linguistic change happening, but whether or not that change actually does happen is something else completely. </p>
<p>Another thing we can use this data for is predicting <em>how much</em> change will occur. Glottochronology is used in both directions (i.e. using the difference in two examples of the same language to predict how much time has passed in between their creation and vice versa) and is of particular import to archeologists looking at examples of ancient writing. </p>
<p>I hope that helps!  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnfhahhRupY&amp;feature=share" target="_blank">Here’s a fun video that explores similar ideas</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can still make broad predictions on language, like charsets will continue to be expanded and perhaps refined to allow identity. Also, maybe with a greater understanding of the structure of languages, syntax will be established to ensure their divergence.</p></div>		</li>
