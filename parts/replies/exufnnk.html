			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are on the right track here, and GP got it backwards.</p>
<p>Your body is pretty salty. When exposed to tap water, which is not salty, osmotic pressure drives water into skin cells. </p>
<p>By adding a salt to the water, the tonicity is increased, and osmotic pressure reduced. </p>
<p>Adding salts to water also modifies the hardness of water, which can have a noticeable effect on the tactile feeling of soap.</p>
<p>Oh an incidentally, that water sold in the store as having extra &quot;electrolytes&quot; like the &quot;smart&quot;whatever.... they mean compared to the purified water they started with....most of them have less minerals than tap water by half or more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, but GP didn't get it backwards, he got it half right.  He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The salt helps the water not draw moisture and nutrients from your skin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which doesn't actually make sense. Either there's a higher (hypertonic) solute concentration in the water than your body, which would indeed cause your body to (slowly) lose water, or the water has a lower (hypotonic) concentration and your body will (slowly) gain water, not lose nutrients. Or the concentrations are roughly the same (isotonic) and not much will happen.  The body has relatively good control over what can and can't pass through the skin, and it would be pretty disadvantageous if we sloughed off important resources every time we bathed in fresh water. As it stands, the biggest impact we're likely to see based on salinity of the water is how pruney our fingers get.</p>
<p>Edit: To my understanding, the main intent of the salt water bath is probably to get the salt concentration as close to isotonic with your body as possible so as to not possibly dilute your body's blood concentration over a long bath, but again, this effect is so negligible overall that I can't see it being noticeable over any reasonable length of time. I'm just spit balling now, but the effect over a three hour bath can't be much more than just drinking a tall glass of water, which, last time I checked, is not exactly the worst thing you can do to affect your body's healing process.</p></div>		</li>
