			<div class="markdown"><p>I lost heaps of blood once due to a GI issue to the point where I found it hard to breath and I couldn’t stand/sit up, was at around 40% of my normal haemoglobin concentration. Was stable though and in hospital. I had the worst panic attack of my life, never experienced anything like it before, utterly terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My memory of having a PPH is lying on the floor of my bathroom with my head on the cool tiles, trying to stay conscious and unable to move. The symptoms of low blood pressure getting worse, combined with the knowledge that “something’s wrong”, was absolutely terrifying.</p></div>		</li>
