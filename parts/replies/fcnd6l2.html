			<div class="markdown"><p>In the documentary I saw, a member of the Richard III Society watched the proceedings with great interest. Previously, the society members tended to disbelieve the idea that the King had a spinal deformity, because that might mean that other uncomplimentary stories about him could be true. </p>
<p>The skeleton was assembled on a table, and a severe case of scoliosis took shape as the vertebrae were put into place. The lady from the Richard III Society gasped and cried &quot;No! It can't be!&quot; Yet there he was: old &quot;Crookback&quot; himself. </p>
<p>The Society still believes that Richard was given bad press by the Tudor-loving Shakespeare, but they've accepted the physical evidence of Richard's bones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seems reasonable to me. I thought you were going to say they went the Flat Earther route.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No kidding, Richard III was a total bad-ass. During the battle of Bosworth field he broke he rammed his lance into Henry Tudor's standard bearer, killing him, but breaking his lance in the process. He then turned and smashed a knight in the head with the broken remnants so hard that he fell off his horse.

<p>I'm wondering, how do we know these stories aren't actually just legends?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was mainly what they were looking at. Accounts had said Richard had died fighting ferociously, which seemed at odds with his disability due to spinal deformity (exaggerated by Shakespeare et al). A man with a similarly curved spine could skip, jump and run all over, whilst wearing plate armour. The accounts were plausible.</p></div>		</li>
