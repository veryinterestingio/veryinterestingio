			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Spanish native with advanced knowledge in English. I always wondered - when you think of letters, do you realize how weird your speech to spell relation is?</p>
<p>Like, letter A is pronounced as &quot;hey&quot; without the h. Now, in spanish we say A. A, a. I dont know how to write that sound. The most difficult thing for spanish speakers is to memorize how different you make the sounds for even the most simple things.</p>
<p>Do you realize that as an English speaker or it's just... normal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought about that. Well, our language (spanish) has its hard parts as well. Conjugating verbs must be the hardest part for a newcomer.
She ran, we ran, they ran...
Ella corrió, nosotros corrimos, ellos corrieron...</p>
<p>It's easy and straightforward until you think about it.</p>
<p>Language is fascinating</p></div>		</li>

<p>90% of my answers to my kids when they say &quot;that makes no sense why is it like that?&quot; are &quot;B<em>ecause, Fuck You. --English</em>&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you mean. The sound you are talking about is /ah/ or the sound we make at the doctor when they put the wooden stick on your tongue.</p>
<p>We know it's difficult, but we get used to it. We all have a good understanding of spelling after high school, but it's difficult for people with learning difficulties. </p>
<p>I sometimes use Spanish to spell new words I learn in English phonetically so I know how to pronounce it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And is it easy for you to learn how to speak those letters or words with neutral phonetics (like we do in spanish)?</p>
<p>You learn by reading the word &quot;celular&quot;, do you really need to think how it's pronounced in spanish or you already know and the struggle only occurs while trying to &quot;forget&quot; you're not using english?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chiming in, since I grew up bilingual yes was aware but not all the time. Also I did not realize the level of difficulty people have with speech that learn english as a second language, until I took spanish as an academic subject. I hadn’t looked at spanish in a formal and grammatical way, i only spoke in informally at home and with a few friends-woahhhh this is tricky <em>and I’m bilingual</em></p>
<p>With that in mind i went on to study japanese and i was quite content that this crazy stuff is not common in Japanese. I would read a syllable and I didn’t have to worry about whether I used the right phonetics. Now there are different stresses in japanese but the extent of my knowledge of the language is not very far because i quit after a couple years.  Of course to the japanese ear i probably butchered stuff but not to the extent that one does with english in this sense. </p>
<p>Another cool thing, i meet japanese people who learned English and Spanish. They tended to have crisper pronunciation when speaking spanish. Now, I’ve met older americans that learned japanese and I’m not sure if its where they learned it, at what age, why or for what profession, the level of exposure to japanese culture in their time, but their accent is SO pronounced. Whereas my peers in their early tweeties or teens have much closer accents to sounding natural. Some were spanish speaker and had exposure to more languages and were young so that could have played a factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same experience, but for me it's so much easier to butcher Spanish than Japanese. Spelling words in Spanish still takes me a minute since it's not as phonetic, like how double l's somehow makes a &quot;y&quot; sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to be a problem to have more phonemes than letters. Dutch has more phones than letters (especially more vowels), but has a rather good correspondance of sounds to letters. The major difference here is that the Netherlands update their official spelling according to what changes in pronunciation and Spain/Latin America does the same. The countries of the English languages didnt and don't, and I kind of get it because how would you do such a reform nowadays?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there is too much variation. No &quot;official&quot; language academy and so many ideas of how to pronounce. </p>
<p>Ben Franklin wanted to make spelling uniform as well as many other people.</p>
<p>I personally would love an easier spelling system. I think it might eliminate some learning troubles if English was easier to read.</p></div>		</li>
