			<div class="markdown"><p>Bladder rupture can also occur.  This is seen occasionally in car accidents when someone has a very full bladder, say after drinking at a bar excessively.  Rupture can either be into the abdominal cavity and require surgery to fix, or can be into the extraperitoneal space and might heal with bladder decompression with a foley catheter for a time.</p></div>		</li>

It removes byproducts through diffusion through the permeable peritoneal lining.
