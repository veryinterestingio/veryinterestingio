<p>But it's not the faucets that really play a role. Idk where that came from. </p>
<p>The biggest thing is that using AC or heat dries out the air which does a lot to prevent mold from growing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This!  I did mold remediation for a bit.  The spore count that the indoor environmental engineers want remediators to hit is equal to the spore count outside the home.  Virtually no home owner calling for mold remediation wants to hear that, but it's impossible/improbable to get a 0 count.  Also homeowners dont like to hear that every mold that is black in color is not &quot;black mold&quot;(Stachybotrys).  The <em>only</em> way that can be determined is with testing.  Statistically black mold is rarely &quot;black mold.&quot;  On that subject there are a handful of species like Stachybotrys Chartarum that produce mycotoxins that will negatively affect many/most people with enough exposure.  By handful I mean 100+ species in the world out of well over 100 thousand species.  The <em>vast</em> majority of molds are essentially harmless to healthy people unless there's extreme exposure.  Those with respiratory issues are more susceptible to mold related health issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mold spores are everywhere. The question isn't whether or not there is mold but the concentration of spores in the air. </p>
<p>If there is stagnant moisture, mold will grow. If there is wet food that is left out long enough, the mold spores will germinate and then turn into mold.</p>
<p>Everywhere you breathe has some concentration of mold spores in the air so thank your immune system and mucus membranes for catching them.</p>
<p>When water washes away the spores, mold can't stick around but when the water is stagnant and there's humidity, mold will grow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I get no standing water, no high humidity. I get that molds spore are natively mostly everywhere looking for a nice place to take hold in. It's the part the 'running sink' plays in all this, is where I get lost.</p>
<p>I believe I can follow everything you said except for the last bit. Does running a sink act as a &quot;mold spore drain&quot; and pull/wash mold spores out of the house and down the drain? I am so confused. (non-troll, legit trying to understand)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, an actual problem with not running any faucets is that all of the sewer piping, including traps, will dry up and will quickly become insect nests, as well as allowing sewage gases to back up into the house.</p>
<p>An already-neglected (hoarder) house on the street I grew up on was abandoned for a few months and the whole damn neighborhood suddenly had a cockroach problem. They had to plug his connection to the sewer at the street and fumigate the house's drainage system because it was just full of roaches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how you define neglect. Put a hoarder in the house it'll be gone faster than any abandoned house. It's far better to abandon a house than put a hoarder in it, value and cleanliness wise. Source: parents are hoarders, there's mold in the faucets, visible mold all over the place, you name it it probably lives in the house.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In addition, people scare away critters.  Plenty of animals will make an abandoned house their home, but will steer clear of an occupied house.</p></div>		</li>
