			<div class="markdown"><p>This has a lot of great information, but to get to the heart of the question, our immune system and antibiotics are not a Staples Easy Button. Sometimes infections are so aggressive that they can outpace the usual preventative measures, in which case the best course of action is to excise the infected tissue so as not to risk runaway spread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And sometimes our immune system is compromised due to underlying issues (i.e. diseases, illnesses that compromise our immune system, stress, substance abuse, etc), so an otherwise 'fightable' organism gets a toehold and begins to wreak havoc where otherwise our immune systems would have been able to fight off the organism. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Vibrio vulnificus is another example of an organism that has been implicated, though I only saw one case in the whole time I worked in microbiology at a larger hospital.</p>

<p>This is very dependent on where you live. On the Mississippi gulf coast, there are many reported cases of people getting this after going in the ocean (technically the Mississippi Sound, between the mainland and the barrier islands), and I've heard from people at the hospital that there are a lot more cases of <em>vibrio</em> that go unreported by the media.</p>
