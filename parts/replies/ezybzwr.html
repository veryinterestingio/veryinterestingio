A lot of the carbon nanotube quantum computer papers you see are examples of one success from a giant pile of failures, and sometimes we don't know why all of those other things failed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, consistency is a huge one. If it takes a thousand dead chips to make one good one, then that one good chip will likely be too expensive for the average consumer. Flash memory is actually a good example. Why are bigger SD cards more expensive? Because they’re more rare. The cards are all made on the same machine, using the same process. Lets say they’re trying to make 128GB SD cards. Nine out of every ten cards have a bad sector. As in, part of the card is unusable. So for every 10 cards you produce, only one is actually a usable 128GB card. So how do you mitigate costs? Deactivate the bad half of the card. Now you have a 128 card, and nine cards that might be 64GB. Out of those nine, two are actually usable as 64GB. That leaves you with seven that might be 32GB once you’ve deactivated another bad sector. You discover that 3 are usable as 32GB. So now you have four remaining cards, which are usable as 16GB.</p>
<p>So in your quest to make ten 128GB cards, you actually made one 128, two 64, three 32, and four 16. So now the 16s will be pretty cheap; you’re basically just using them to recoup costs and avoid writing them off as total losses. The 32s may be a slight profit. The 64s are able to be fairly expensive. And the 128 is very expensive, because you’re only able to make 1 out of 10 reliably. These numbers are obviously made up, but they at least demonstrate my point. If every card was consistently a 128GB and didn’t have any bad sectors, then the 128GB cards would be much cheaper. And as time progresses, we get better and better at making them consistently, so costs go down for the consumer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why we couldn't make micro-SD cards above 400G until 2019. </p>
<p>At first, nobody wanted them.  They'd have been stupidly expensive in even 2010.  If you can swap out 10 x 32G cards, oh well, enjoy your professional photography job.  Nice work if you can get it, having people smile at you all day. </p>
<p>Then when phones started using them as semi-permanent storage, the demand skyrocketed but the manufacturers physically couldn't cram more storage into the physical form.  &quot;Yeah, we know you want 512G, 2TB uSD cards.  We're working on it but we'll have to retool everything to 11nm first.&quot; </p>
<p>(For demand, accelerometers were <em>obscenely</em> expensive in the 2004 era, until Nintendo ordered 200 million of them and the price dropped to a nickel.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>If you work in an industrial sector where the market is small you face this all the time.</p>
<p>I will give an example. We use monitor panels in some products but only a few hundred a year. For a long time we offered a 24&quot; 4:3  monitor. </p>
<p>As everything has been moving to widescreen and bigger (sitting room) or smaller (phone/tablet) the cost of the panels has skyrocketed so we had to change.</p>
<p>Many suppliers offer components on an upgrade schedual so they promise to keep  them for something like 5 years. So if you buy in at the start of the cycle you know when you need to start looking for replacments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, it would depend a lot on the specific circumstance.  If there was a ton of upfront R&amp;D cost to developing the product, well, that's already sunk and paid for, so the cost might not go back up a ton, even if demand drops.  Also, if a ton of other applications for the product became possible due to the cost going down (because of initial demand due to say cell phone parts), then the demand won't even necessarily drop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One that comes easily to mind is the price and availability of RAM. New motherboard architecture comes out, RAM that goes with this change isn't made in great quantities as the market penetration for the new tech is low. As more old PC's are replaced and new PC's are built, the demand for the RAM goes up, and production increases, dropping the cost. Then the new shiny architecture shows up, demand for the old RAM goes down, production slows and major producers stop making it, price goes back up again. Very oversimplified, but supply and demand changes at a very fast pace in the technology sector</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thinking of all those ladies working the switchboard manually, plugging calls by patching and re-patching 1/4” cables... then getting a weird request to send an opera to several lines at once.  Weird.</p>
<p>I remember hearing about Lincoln in the command bunker in the civil war, stepping over piles and piles of telegraph cables that were running out to several areas of the front, so the generals could know what was happening and send commands back.  That was in Gore Vidal’s book.</p></div>		</li>
