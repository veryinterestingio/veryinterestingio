			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really useful. My son was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and he's absolutely no-one's idea of a hyperactive kid, we went down a few routes, but it was only after we started reading up on ADHD that it really clicked and everything fell into place, so he got assessed on that basis.</p>
<p>And that ICNU fits exactly. We would introduce reward charts, earning pocket money - all the usual motivational things you would use to get your kids doing chores - and they would be fantastically effective. For a week or two. Then his attention just drifted away and never came back. The challenge was briefly there, and the novelty - then both dissipated.</p>
<p>What's been harder is the more I see his behaviour, I see the child I used to be, and the man I now am. All my life I've been 'lazy', 'careless', feeling like I'm no use to anyone, unable to meet any of the goals I set myself in life. Always felt like I was the thing getting in my own way.</p>
<p>And it's only now that I realise why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go get diagnosed yourself! It'll change your life!! Please don't be like my mother, who didn't ever get me help and just thought I was lazy and careless because that's what she was like when she was younger. My life TURNED AROUND 7 years ago after being diagnosed (I went from really feeling out of control and ineffective and self loathing, to now being someone who has accomplished what many people would consider an impossible dream!), and she STILL refuses to get diagnosed - my psych even sent the ADHD evaluation checklist home with me for her to take, he was so sure she has it. And of course, she scored SO high. I can only reason that she won't take it because subconsciously she'll have to reckon with a whole life built on the assumptions that she's ineffective or inept in certain areas (her sense of learned helplessness really impacted me, and how she continued to stay with our father who made a ton of money, regardless of the fact that he was really abusive to his children), and she's afraid to face the grief. But it makes me SO SAD.</p>
<p>The grief I had at 27 was a lot, I can only imagine it increases as you get older. But dear God. My first day on medication, it was like a veil lifted. All these things that had been deemed character flaws by others... gone. Of course I still struggle, but it's night and day. Please please please, you have so much time to live and being on medication is so worth it if it works for you! Also, pre-medication I was a nanny even though I found time with children GRUELINGLY boring. Once I was medicated, piece of cake - so I can only imagine how my mother felt while I was growing up, and I can only imagine what a better mother she could've been if she had had some help! (Sounds like you're an amazing parent though - this is more about getting to experience your own life to the fullest!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a perfect example.   My son, as a preteen, would play computer games until he was so desperate to pee that he would sprint to the bathroom in a dribbly panic.   About 10 minutes before that he usually would stand up from his chair and continue playing the computer game with his legs crossed and sway awkwardly and painfully trying to hold it in until he got to panic mode where he basically was on the verge of wetting himself.</p>
<p>And it wasn't online games where people were waiting for him - he'd be playing minecraft alone, but going to pee rated too low on the scale of things worthy of his attention.</p>
<p>He's grown out of the 'bladder dance' behavior - (fortunate, considering we just toured the university he's going to in the fall) - but his ADHD will be part of his adult life forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure to check up on him occasionally. Make sure he's going to class and doing his homework. Often times, without someone there to give a nudge in the right direction, a sufferer of ADHD just won't. It happened to me. Parents cut me loose after 18 years of reminders and i just couldn't function. Failed out after 2 semesters for just not going to class. When repeatedly asked &quot;Why didn't you just go to class?&quot; I couldn't give an answer. It really damaged my relationship with my parents.</p>
<p>That relationship has since recovered (I'm 35 now) but if they had just given me a few pushes while i was at college, i would have been so much more successful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well now I'm curious. I've been wondering lately if my daughter has ADHD but she does well in school so I perhaps wrongly assumed that she couldn't have but little things keep me wondering if it's just forgetful child things or a sign. </p>
<p>So re: the pee thing, despite being old enough to know better she will leave it to the last minute, unless I ask her to do something and then the need to pee is the first thing on her mind, every time. I just assumed it was a delaying tactic. Now I'm wondering if that's because the immediate need to do a chore (boring) raises up the previously ignored need to pee?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the big one for me is the “no internal motivation“ thing.  People think I can’t have ADHD if I had good grades and devour books, but I love to read, it interests me so I have no issues reading, while others with ADHD need a TL:DR for a paragraph.   I don’t love living in a messy house but shit doesn’t get clean until I have company coming over.  My external motivator is unfortunately needing the perceived approval of others… whether that was my teachers, parents, bosses, friends…    The best way to get me to do something is to tell me it’s too hard etc.  Is that a challenge? Hah.    Unfortunately the novelty of some challenges wears off.  Like: learning japanese.  The moment I realized I was doing well learning the kanji etc, I lost ALL interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a little funny to me haha, because to me coding is like the ultimate thing that keeps my interest. It has so much novelty, it's challenging, and interesting.</p>
<p>Coding, programming, developing, etc. has incredible depth, and reward for creating something! Yeah, the basics of programming aren't difficult, but then there's writing ever larger pieces of software, and all the techniques, structure, design, etc. that goes into the whole. Then there's working with others. Then there's creating stuff others want to use. Then there's doing something new. And so on.</p>
<p>Put simply though, it's impossible for 1 person to fully master software development. There's just too much depth.</p></div>		</li>
