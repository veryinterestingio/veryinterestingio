			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the way I understand the Crystal Hall Effect (after some more reading) is that in an antiferromagnet a Hall conductivity can arise even if the net magnetization of the antiferromagnet is zero (I. E. The two magnetic sublattices have the same strength and face in opposing directions). And somehow this has to do with the way the atoms are arranged in the lattice. But that last part is hard to understand for me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the introduction it mentions that rather than requiring a magnetic field to break T symmetry, an inversion symmetry is what gets broken.  I have no idea how much this could relate, though.</p>
<p>This next one might be more along the lines of what you are asking.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may be giving the terminology too much import. We basically call any system where the spins are aligned in opposite direction antiferromagnetic. The reason this is a distinct scenario is that you end up with a unique topological phase that is different than, say, the spin Hall phase. The spin Hall phase can have the atoms in the exact same positions as the antiferromagnetic system but the spins align differently due to energetic considerations (i.e which atom will have what type of spin). I specifically design photonic topological insulators so I have the freedom to deform the atoms to invert those energy levels as I see fit. For example to get a spin Hall insulator I’d break inversion symmetry and I can show that the Hamiltonian in that case has a Spin Hall term. If I break C_6 symmetry but maintain C3 and C’_2 out of plane symmetry then the Hamiltonian will have an antiferromagnetic term.</p></div>		</li>
