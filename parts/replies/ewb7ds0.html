			<div class="markdown"><p>So..why not just replicate organic stem-cells in a lab and artificially create the building blocks for new parts? You would also need to give them instructions for growth and specialization but i think it could be done after some research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of research already on this. Regulation is still pretty restrictive though, so development is slow. They're going ham in China though, where regulations are looser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that as long as the donatee is treated well, we shouldn't have dumb moral stigmas around how we handle organic matter. It's hypocritical, considering how people treat animals for example purely for the fact that they are expendable somehow and humans are above them.</p>
<p>I mean it's a medical holy grail. Some rules should be bent here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we don't know HOW to replicate them, for starters.  How can we replicate something that we don't even know how it really works?  That's like me asking you to rewrite the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy, from memory.</p>
<p>Further, the most versatile human stem-cells come from human embryos.  There's a ton of ethical issues there, let alone the political issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embryonic stem cells:  These stem cells come from embryos that are three to five days old. At this stage, an embryo is called a blastocyst and has about 150 cells.   <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117" target="_blank">source</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>150 cells is an unbelievably small number.  </li>
<li>Further, these things are insanely fragile.  They're not meant to be kept alive outside of a womb.</li>
<li>Seriously, how do you acquire human embryos?  There are so many ethical concerns here.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if you have the possibility to create something that is basically the holy grail of medicine in order to improve, fix and save the lives of literally millions, if not billions of people, killing a few masses of cells that aren't even conscious to get there seems like a worthy sacrifice. I would do it. And i would still donate to charity. An embryo does not have a consciousness yet and if it lived to survive testing, would not remember a thought. People die for nothing all the time. Cells that aren't even a person yet in any way other than sentiment are not outweighing the potential to literally create a miracle.</p>
<p>Now, the way you do this is by simulating the embryo and then studying the cells' behavioural processes in a linear fashion to chart the optimal pathway towards guided growth.</p>
<p>I don't work at a medical facility nor do i have a degree in biological sciences but this just seems logical.</p>
<p>And i wonder why can't we simulate organic material in order to build cells. Is automation not a thing then? Have machines follow the blueprints.</p></div>		</li>
