			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't meant to be so direct of a comparison. The cause would be the measurement. The idea was more that for some brief period of time before colliding with the lake it existed one way while interacting with air and as it was measured its environment changed and so did its properties. And once the interaction happens you &quot;can't&quot; go back. </p>
<p>The cause could be any observation. With observation having the meaning it does in quantum mechanics. I am not particularly comfortable trying to define observation, but it's worth noting it has a different meaning than what people would expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like, under what circumstances is the raindrop ever separated from the lake? If you can isolate the system, it acts coherently. When you let it interact with something big and complicated, it stops acting coherently.</p></div>		</li>
