<p>Scientists do not know exactly why this phenomenon occurs and are still trying to understand it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to add a bit more:</p>
<p>Our current understanding suggests this occurs because our brain doesn't just fall asleep all at once, instead parts of the brain enter sleep one by one. When some parts of the brain fall asleep too quickly, another part of the brain becomes alerted that something might be wrong and so you receive this sudden jolt that wakes you up.</p>
<p>Hypnic Jerks are more common in people who are sleep deprived, consume lots of stimulants or are stressed. They can take a bunch of different forms, not just the falling sensation like auditory or visual hallucinations or involuntary muscle movements in the limbs. They are completely benign, but can be annoying and can contribute to sleep deprivation if they happen often. If you have recurring hypnic jerks on the same night preventing you from sleeping, get up and do something simple for 30 minutes, then go back to bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During a period where I was experiencing really bad insomnia I was having tons of these.  It was extremely frustrating, because of course I'd think I'd finally fallen asleep, but nope.  It oddly did feel like something was out of sync, I would get sooooo close to falling asleep but it just would not happen, it was like my brain couldn't process a shut down correctly or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting as Iâ€™ve had bouts of insomnia and this parallels how I felt, occasionally it was me just not able to fall asleep then other times me being unconscious but not sleeping. And the most worrying was when I was fully awake but unaware, sleep walking and to a point even driving, doing math problems with no issue but being completely unconscious and waking up at random times being super confused as to where I was, what I was doing, and how I got to where I was</p>
<p>Ultimately it was found to be a stress/ anxiety disorder that has since been diagnosed and treated that caused me to essentially disassociate so much that I could sleep while preforming most tasks with an unknown amount of certainty</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I terrified my husband one night by screaming &quot;Spiders! Spiders!&quot; and slapping frantically at the bed. He was screaming &quot;where?!?&quot; By the time I got my cell phone flashlight on, I already realized it was one of those falling asleep hallucinations, but we still confirmed the bed was spider free just to be safe. </p>
<p>Having a job where you're on call 24 hours makes sleep weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That used to happen to me ALL THE TIME in late high school into my 1 year of college. I never realized. I'd wake up, throw up light on and frantically scan the bed because I thought it was covered in bugs. Most of the time I have one or two hard kicks as I fall asleep nowadays</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first wife woke me up in similar fashion when we were dating.  First time I spent the night at her place, she wakes me up yelling about a huge spider crawling toward my head.  Took me a while to realize she was actually still asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely true for me. I get high anxiety sometimes and struggle with multiple &quot;falling awake&quot; sensations one after the other and getting up and doing something for 20 mins or so usually helps me get right to sleep and stops the sensation.</p></div>		</li>
