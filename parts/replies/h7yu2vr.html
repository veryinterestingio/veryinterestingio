			<div class="markdown"><p>While most of it is BS, there are actual ways to do both. </p>
<p>&quot;Stayed colder long&quot; can actually be performed by the coating on the can. If it reflects IR, it won't absorb nearly as much energy from sunlight, staying colder longer. This doesn't affect emission, so it doesn't make it take longer to cool down. </p>
<p>If it is more hydrophobic, condensation will run down the side rather than build up more surface area for heat transfer. Since cooling it down doesn't cause condensate, once again it favors staying colder longer.</p>
<p>Additionally, the shittier-feeling cans that have a plastic coating on them are great at breaking the coefficient of heat transfer since they serve as a vapor barrier between air and metal - although only while dry inside. Beer that has sat in water in a cooler loses this entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the thickness of the wall (or void in case of insulated bottles) has a role. Is the 0.02 to 0.05 W/mK figure the result of the estimated bottle wall thickness?</p>
<p>I imagine a double-wall bottle will have a very low number there.</p>
<p>Edit: I discovered in another part of the comment section that mK is meter-kelvin, not millikelvin as I had been reading it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number in W/mK is a property of the material of the wall itself, not of the specific wall or its thickness.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As an analogy, imagine a car that can drive 15km with 1L of gas. Although the amount of fuel used by the car depends on the distance driven, the efficiency of the car will always be 15km/L.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'll give a small explanation that might be too difficult for ELI5. I still hope I can help.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Four factors play into the amount of heat (P) that is being transfered, measured in Watt, W:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>The material of the wall, which has a certain conduction coefficient (k), which is the 0.02 or 0.5 W/mK number</li>
<li>The area of the wall (A), measured in m\^2: If the wall is twice as wide or high (not thick) the amount of transfered heat doubles, so the power is proportional to the area</li>
<li>The thickness of the wall (d), measured in m: If the wall is twice as thick the amount of heat transfers halves.</li>
<li>The temperature difference (ΔT) between both sides of the wall, measured in K. If this temperature difference doubles, the amount of transfered heat doubles, so the power os proportional to the temperature difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Combining these gives that P=k*ΔT*A/d.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol very fair. W/m K is actually a pretty interesting unit though when you think about it. Watts measure power, or the flow of energy, right? So when we say a material has a thermal conductivity coefficient of 1 W/m K, what we're really saying is: if you set up a wall of this stuff 1 meter thick, and had a temperature difference of 1 Kelvin between each side of the wall, heat would flow through the wall at a rate of 1 watt to equalize the temperatures. </p>
<p>Idk, maybe it's just me, but I always like to reduce these weird units down to a physical example like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation isn't entirely correct. Notice that the m is in the denominator, so that would mean you would have to multiply by a distance to get the heat flow. This would mean the thicker the wall is, the more heat is transfered, which does not make sense.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In reality, what it means is:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you set up a wall that is 1m thick, has an area of 1m\^2, and a temperature difference of 1 Kelvin the heat flow would be 1W.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The area is very important here! If the wall is twice as wide, the heat flow will of course be twice as large. In reality, the heat flow is proportional to the area, and inversely proportional to the thickness, hence the m in the denominator.</p></div>		</li>
