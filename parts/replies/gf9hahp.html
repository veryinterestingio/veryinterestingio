			<div class="markdown"><p>No, pfizer just hasn't had time to prove that it prevents transmission yet because that's much harder to test. </p>
<p>I'm not aware of any vaccines that creates carriers instead of immunity and the likelihood that that is even possible borders on nill. That said, COVID-19 is capable of asymptomatic spread so it's not actually impossible, just very close to it.</p>
<p>If you would like me to expand on any of that let me know!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m not aware of an analogous situation in humans but it would be harder to test since some of what is known about Marek’s disease is from challenge tests which are not done in humans generally</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about the other manufacturers?</p></div>		</li>
