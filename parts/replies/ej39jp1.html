			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I think I have emetephobia. Ever since I was a child I would get nauseated when I got anxious and it's led to some traumatic experiences. Now I get anxious anytime I feel a bit nauseated and then I get more nauseated. It's the worst and it's affected my life in drastic ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely have that though not nearly as severely as I once did, taking care of another living thing can really condition you out of being &quot;grossed out&quot; pretty effectively. I remember hearing a line from the show Monk about how Monk (a detective with OCD and most likely other spectrum disorders) would rather die than throw up and feeling more relatable to that character than any other I had encountered in my life at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nausea is also a component of your Sympathetic Nervous System, often referred to &quot;fight or flight&quot; in layman terms. Basically when you are getting anxious your body is preparing you to fight or run for your life so it is shunting blood from non essential organs (like your stomach) to your muscles. Your fear and anxiety will make you more nauseated because it will keep triggering your sympathetic nerves. If you google Sympathetic Nervous System you can find a list of other effects it can trigger. The Parasympathetic system is its polar opposite. </p>

<p>You could try to find some calming techniques, basically if you can trigger your Parasympathetic system it will counteract the Sympathetic one. GL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too, I was really bad about 4 years ago, but after years of therapy it’s a lot more manageable but this thread, although I read it, made me thinking about the “what if” and I just don’t like that. I wish it didn’t exist but it saves people so. </p></div>		</li>
