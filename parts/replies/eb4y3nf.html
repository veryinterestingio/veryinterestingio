<p>It's being fixed actually. With the removal of CFC propellants from basically every can, the damage to the ozone layer was stopped. And now it is slowly repairing itself</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/18/1379/2018" target="_blank">It seems like that might not be the case</a>. It's <em>expected</em> that it would recover, but something seems to be preventing it from doing so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we report evidence from multiple satellite measurements that ozone in the lower stratosphere between 60°S and 60°N has indeed continued to decline since 1998. We find that, even though upper stratospheric ozone is recovering, the continuing downward trend in the lower stratosphere prevails, resulting in a downward trend in stratospheric column ozone between 60°S and 60°N. We find that total column ozone between 60°S and 60°N appears not to have decreased only because of increases in tropospheric column ozone that compensate for the stratospheric decreases. The reasons for the continued reduction of lower stratospheric ozone are not clear; models do not reproduce these trends, and thus the causes now urgently need to be established.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/climate/china-ozone-cfcs.html" target="_blank">China has been blamed for treaty-violating CFC emissions</a>, but the pattern of ozone recovery at high altitudes and depletion at low altitudes might indicate that a different mechanism is the real problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While dynamically driven explanations may be fully responsible for tropical lower stratospheric ozone changes, at mid-latitudes additional chemically driven contributions from increasing anthropogenic and natural very-short-lived substances (VSLSs) containing chlorine or bromine may play a role (Hossaini et al., 2015). Modelling studies imply that VSLSs preferentially destroy lower stratospheric ozone, though the effect outside of the polar latitudes is expected to be small (Hossaini et al., 2015, 2017).</p>
