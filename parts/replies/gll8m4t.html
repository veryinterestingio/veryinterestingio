			<div class="markdown"><p>To add one variable, would the earth’s rotation interfere?
I’m having trouble getting my head around this. It seems that the nut (I’m imagining a knuckle-sized hex bolt) would be continue in a “westerly” direction as does the earth’s surface.
So would it bonk onto the edge at some point since it isn’t pinned down to the earth’s surface?</p>
<p>I guess a similar question would be if an airplane follows the earth’s rotation so the same point is below, and someone drops a nut :-), if there were no wind resistance, would the nut hit that same point, or would it over or under shoot?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. It is essentially a manifestation of the Coriolis effect. In order for the object's path to be unimpeded the hole actually <a href="https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PlanetaryTunnelsWithCoriolisEffect/" target="_blank">has to curve</a> (except in the special case where the hole is directly on the Earth's rotational axis, of course).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the object being dropped wouldn't keep the momentum it had from being on the spinning surface of the earth in the first place? I would have thought that it would be like jumping; if you jump straight up, the Earth doesn't spin under you because you still maintain the momentum from being spinning at the same speed as the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The velocity at the equator is roughly 1000mph. If the nut could phase through rock it would want to make an orbit. Not a normal orbit though. Because of something called Shell Theorem, you can basically ignore all the rock farther from the core than the nut, meaning the sphere of Earth that actually matters to calculate your gravitational attraction is only the stuff closer to the core. This turns out to make the force change with r, not r^(2). The consequence is that the path will be an ellipse where the earth's core is in the center, not one of the semimajor axis as it would be in a normal orbit (like comet). So the natural tendency of something dropped through the Earth is <em>not</em> to go through the core. If the tube did go through the core, the object would have to be coerced into travelling that path by contact with the sides (unless the tube goes through the axial pole of course where there is no surface velocity).</p>
<p>The nut would land a little east of the aircraft if it were on the equator. In the north hemisphere it would appear veer south, and in the south hemisphere it would appear to veer north because of how the craft would actually be needing to turn to keep with a latitude line, but the nut would just be ballistic. Though the aircraft is matched the surface speed of the ground, it is actually travelling a little faster in orbital speed. You can know this because if the aircraft circled the world, an object on the surface would have travelled 2πr, but the aircraft travelled 2π(r+a) in the same time, with r as earth's radius and h as the craft's altitude. When the nut falls to a lower altitude, it keeps this extra sideways speed, but since it now has a shorter path around the Earth it becomes a higher surface speed and begins to overtake the aircraft. The opposite is also true; if you are on the surface and shoot something vertically up, it will land to your west. It loses relative surface speed as it gains altitude and the Earth rotates beneath it, and then it gains that relative speed back as it falls. This was one of the principles behind the first long range ballistic missile in WW2, the V-2 rocket - it was launched up out of the atmosphere at the right speed and let physics guide it to the target.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hadn't thought about this ever until this post, but does that mean the rockets had pretty significantly reduced range firing with the rotation of the earth as opposed to against it, because the rotation works against/with with rocket in each scenario?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just out of curiosity, where did you get this figure from, or how did you derive it? I'm just wondering... Looking it up quickly, I've found the time it would take to fall through the earth is about 42 minutes. I also am unsure if this excludes air resistance. I also realize that the acceleration due to g w decreases the closer to the middle of the earth, as a greater and greater percentage of the mass of the earth (and source of attraction and acceleration due to g) is no longer below you. So I'm hoping you could share/explain. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the object begin to slow down (or stop accelerating) as it gets closer to the center of the earth because more of the earth's mass would then be above/behind the object?</p>
<p>Editing in a rephrase: does the force of gravity change as an object gets close to the earth's center because there's less mass under the object and more mass above and around the object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you approximate the Earth by a perfect uniform sphere, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem" target="_blank">shell theorem</a> kicks in, and you can understand pretty easily how it goes. Imagine splitting the planet into two: a smaller sphere, with  radius equal to your current distance from the center, and a spherical shell. The theorem tells us the shell exerts no gravitational pull on you, so only the small sphere is pulling you towards the center. As you approach the center, the sphere gets smaller and smaller, and so does the gravitational pull. At the exact moment you go through the center, the radius of the sphere is zero, i.e. the whole planet is the shell, and you experience zero gravity.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's worth pointing out that the shell theorem doesn't require total uniformity, just uniformity with respect to radius. So it still works fine if the core is more dense than the rest of the planet, so long as the core isn't lopsided or asymmetrical.</p>
<p>(Not to imply that you didn't know this, but it's something that might be missed by a casual reader)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially true. As a point of trivia, it’s worth noting that the earth’s gravitational pull actually reaches a maximum over 2000 km below the surface at the boundary of the outer core and lower mantle. This is because earth becomes denser at greater depths. The gravity there is about 10.5 N/kg versus the surface 9.8. After that it decreases roughly linearly to the core. But before that depth it’s mostly increasing or steady.</p></div>		</li>
