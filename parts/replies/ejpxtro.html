They must be blocking out all of the frequencies the machines and motors going on around us, but not someone’s voice in front of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the difference between dog and human sense of smell is probably bigger than Owl and human hearing. But smell is basically just detecting particles in the air in the same way an air quality detector works. Each &quot;smellable&quot;  particle fits into certain kind of sensor sensor in the nose and the brain detects which scent sensors are triggered and the quantity of particles activating them.</p>
<p>So with each sniff a dog (or other scent based hunters) can tell which scents are present and how strong each is. They just need to follow the direction where the scent gets stronger. </p></div>		</li>
