			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. I'm a software engineer (salaried) and so little of what I work on can be tracked on a daily basis. You have to look to like weekly at least before you can start seeing if I'm hitting deadlines and such, and even then as long as I can explain why something took longer than expected I just shift my deadlines appropriately and management is totally cool with it.</p>
<p>That said, we also use git commit metrics and stuff to track how (generally) productive people are, though that only makes sense over months of time and varies a lot depending on what someone is working on.</p></div>		</li>
