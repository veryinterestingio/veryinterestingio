			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted a reply similar to this one in the main thread, citing the example of the Wisconsin Dells which were carved by the collapse of glacial Lake Wisconsin, approximately the size of current day Great Salt Lake. The topography of the west did allow glacial dams an lakes to form more readily, but they did form in the east too. A major difference though was the topography of the west allowed them to grow much larger before being bypassed and collapsing. Thus, we do have similarly eroded landscapes in the east, but they simply don't match the scale of the scab lands erosion because the lakes in the east collapsed before they could grow as large as the ones that formed in the west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I’m not saying glacial flood landforms don’t exist in the Midwest or east, they’re just less abundant because the landscape was less suitable for their formation.</p></div>		</li>
