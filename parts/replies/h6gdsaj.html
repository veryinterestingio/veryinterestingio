			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a bit closer to the working principle of GPS. The time difference fits to sources in a cone (technically a hyperbolic surface, but for practical purposes it's essentially a cone). If you turn the head and hear the same sound you get a different cone, so the sound needs to come from the intersection of the two cones.</p>
<p>The ear shape helps, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, that's precisely what triangulation is!  Triangulation is the process of using the angle towards a signal at two points to find the location of the transmitter.  You use a highly directional antenna (or a direction-sensing antenna like a phased array) to find the direction towards a transmitter using that exact intersection method.</p>
<p>Trilateration is the process that usually gets described as triangulation- using the distance (in space or equivalently in time) to a signal from multiple points to find its transmission location.  That's what GPS uses.  It gets quite complicated for things besides GPS, because it can be very hard to tell the time difference between signals that are repeating.  You need to correlate the signals, which is a very complicated problem and still a subject of research!</p>
<p>Another thing that gets called triangulation is the process of using signal <em>strength</em> to find the location of a transmitter.  This requires at minimum measurements from three locations, since signal strength can vary proportional to other things besides just distance, like humidity.  Say you have two signal strength measurements from different locations, with equal strength.  That means your signal could be coming from anywhere on a line that passes between the two points you measured from.  The only thing you know is that the signal is equally far from each point.  You use the third point to determine where on that line the signal must be.  This is basically how cellphones determine their location.</p>
<p>In reality it's a little more complicated since signal strength is not directly proportional to distance; a signal that is X strength at one point and .5X at another is not 2/3rds of the way between them.  It's closer to distance^2, although it varies a lot depending on the antenna.  Most antennas transmit mostly sideways, since that's where the people are.</p>
<p>GPS doesn't require correlation because GPS transmits the time at the satellite constantly.  You use receive a slightly delayed time from each satellite, and use the differences to work out how far they are from you.  Each satellite also transmits a very precise orbital position to help work out how far away it is, because it only transmits a time every 1.5 seconds.  That's part of why GPS takes some time to warm up.  It's also the reason that a tiny (compared to a radio tower) satellite can broadcast to a huge area of the planet from an incredible distance- 20,200 km (12,600 miles).</p>
<p>Fun fact: GPS satellites only transmit at about 200 watts total.  Another fun fact: the energy transmitted to earth creates a tiny thrust which very, very slowly (way slower than is of concern, but engineers still had to figure that out!) pushes the satellites farther out.</p></div>		</li>
