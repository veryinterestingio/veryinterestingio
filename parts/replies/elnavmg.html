			<div class="markdown"><p>this makes me think of a training exercise for a dog ( and I've seen it used on kids too).  where you have a toy that looks live enough, and makes it do something bad. then you smack the shit out of the toy for doing or not doing something..... are you sure you don't want a bite, or are you sure you want to dig in the trash... It's very effective, but idk how to feel about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting in the case of training little humans. Threat of violence is class one assault under Canadian law, would a tool such as this even be legal? </p>
<p>By the way you explain this training tool, 'smack the shit out of the toy' I wonder how someone would react if  knowing that the act of violence was all for show? Would they still take it seriously?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it starts young then they will believe/understand how angry the person is and can result in intimidation/fear of being in the dolls position next time. It is usually backed up with abuse as pain is the strongest inhibitor</p>
<p>As far as finding out about it, we rebel as teens for a reason; we see ourselves more equal (usually due to height/size) to adults and decide (horemonal-ly) whether our parents/whoever earns respectful treatment. Teens and adults dont always come to terms with it but intimidation and authority are methods often needed to keep us safe from things we don't understand as a society (eg we thought we could use the internet without any negative repercussions like data/information misuse).</p>
<p>Those who suffer neglect and abuse without any positive parental involvement like empathy and caregiving often suffer from PTSD and could continue the negative treatment cycle but hopefully with help can stop it openly or come to terms with it privately -this is usually after escaping the home and figuring things out in relative peace.</p>
<p>Legally everything is done on a case by case basis but social workers try to keep kids with a parent unless considerable evidence of abuse/neglect has occurred -initially most injuries arent caught so legally this could mean intimidation by threat of violence would count when miming it or using a prop (eg the doll) but it would depend how negative an impact it had on the child (eg not sleeping/eating, crying/panicking at seemingly innocuous items/people/places)</p></div>		</li>
