			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I had no idea about T cells but also I didn't realise that B cells all have unique receptors. Does that mean that I could have had a B-cell with the right receptor five months ago but now I no longer do because it died? Or does your body track those uniqunesses and create absent ones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won't already have the B-cell that makes a perfect antibody. Instead, you just have a ton of B-cells that bind to highly diverse receptors. As soon as your body finds any B cell that will bind a new antigen, it undergoes a period of iterative mutation and selection where higher affinity B cells will be made. Once the specificity is high enough, that B cell will proliferate and start creating large amounts of antibody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically your body just makes sort of randomly/procedurally generated b-cells with different receptors, and if they just so happen to bump into an antigen they're compatible with, they bring it back home and make new b-cells that are better at catching these antigens. Rinse, repeat. Then, once there's enough b-cells with captured samples of the microbe, they can start mass producing the antibodies.</p>
<p>Am I understanding this correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to that, there IS a treatment called IVIG: intravenous immunoglobulin. But this isn't a focused antibody; this is a ton of antibodies from a ton of people. One use is to treat people with immune deficiencies.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility of building recombinant antibodies targeting specific antigens. This is the whole idea behind monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A bunch of drugs for things like Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer use special antibodies designed to bind to various receptors and block them or make your body attack them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why HIV causes &quot;acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&quot; (AIDS). It attacks helper t-cells which are necessary to help trigger and strengthen your adaptive immune response to infections and to cancerous cells. As your body slowly loses its ability to replace the T-helper cells which are destroyed by HIV, it becomes harder for your body to mount as strong of a response as it usually would, which again is why people develop &quot;weird&quot; infections and cancers which people with normal immune systems basically never get like Kaposi's Sarcoma. It was the appearance of these rare diseases in otherwise healthy appearing people which first started alerting public health officials to this novel disease back in the 1980's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to u/diploid_impunity very good response, you also need a working endocrine system which basically builds and controls many of these processes in the lymph nodes (the junctions), which are then transported via the circulatory system.  That's why you need a living, breathing human-being.  </p>

<p>you would literally have to take ALL of a person’s blood to use in your in vitro assay, and then get really lucky</p>

<p>I can't tell if I'm ingorant or you're missing the obvious, but why would you need to do it in one big slurry from one donor, rather than take some blood from a large number of people and do them separately until one &quot;hits?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I regret even throwing that line in there - it was sort of a joke.  The fact is, this will just never work.  It's not just a numbers game.  Even if you could isolate that one in a billion B cell that recognizes your antigen, you're still not going to be able to make it develop into an antibody producing plasma cell in vitro.  You really need the structure of a germinal center, inside the body.</p>
<p>The lymph nodes and spleen are not just big empty bags, where lymphocytes wander around randomly, seeking their antigen, like some big singles mixer.  It's more like a structured, speed-dating layout, after which the agency plans out all your dates until you are engaged.  Since I'm just making up this analogy as I type, I'm going to leave it right there for now. </p>
<p>TL/DR: more like an arranged marriage than a swingin singles mixer</p></div>		</li>
