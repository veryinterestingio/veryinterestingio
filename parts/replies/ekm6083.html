Will more data from the existing telescope network add focus and detail?<br />
Is resolution limited by the size of the Earth?<br />
Is the limitation in data processing capabilities?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These were answered in the q&amp;a session actually. </p>
<p>More telescopes would add clarity. Squaring the resolution with each additional telescope. Also, yes if we had a bigger earth, or a more likely solution space based telescopes, it would increase the (sorry can’t remember the term) angular resolution. </p>
<p>As far as data processing limitations, that can be solved by adding additional hardware (relatively inexpensive) and just taking longer to process. </p>
<p>If you want the actual answers and not my layman’s interpretation, check out the q&amp;a at the end of the NSF press conference.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Additional telescopes do improve the quality of the image, but will not improve the overall limiting resolution unless they are off the planet. The resolution is limited by the longest baseline (distance between two dishes) available. </p>
<p>The number of baselines, pairs of dishes, goes as (n^2 - n)/2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current array of telescopes basically creates a lens the size of the Earth. My Prof says he doubts we'll get any clearer of an image without doing something different than what we've already done (more telescopes on Earth might not help clarity all that much). But! If we were to get one on the moon, then that would help for a couple reasons: 1. It's got less atmosphere to look through, and 2. It's farther away from all of the other ones so we, in a way, widen our lens. </p>
<p>There's also the option of satellite telescopes, but a satellite array like would be crazy. Both of these ideas would take years to implement and there's currently no clear path on what they're gonna do (if anything).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The super-massive black hole in M87 is about 3000 times bigger than the super-massive black hole in our own galaxy, and it's about 2000 times further away. So its apparent size is a little bit bigger than our own super-massive black hole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not quite true, ours has a larger apparent size.  The reasons are:</p>
<p>1)  It's not feeding as much, so it's not as bright.</p>
<p>2)  Its smaller radius means material orbits it in minutes instead of days, which means a blurrier image </p>
<p>3)  We have to observe it through the plane of the galaxy, so there's more gas and dust obscuring the view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding (3) above, M87 is also an 'early type' galaxy, which means for the most part it's not forming stars actively and does not have a lot of gas in it to begin with.  So it's both that we have to look through the plane of our galaxy which has a good amount of material in it, and that M87 doesn't really have much gas in it at all to begin with (regardless of it's orientation on the sky).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also said that the material orbiting our black hole is going immensly fast. Some go around our black hole at a speed of 20 years per orbit. As a result, taking a picture of our black hole is a bit asif “trying to take a picture of a running toddler.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the EU press conference they were asked this exact same question and said:</p>
<p>&quot;We had no idea it was going to be this big or facing this way. The reason we picked it over Sag A* is because it's moving at a much slower speed and is much easier to coordinate on&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if it's &quot;facing&quot; us does that mean a Gamma Ray Burst is heading in our general direction? Or maybe one already went by a long time ago? Sorry if I'm confused, I just always thought most super massive black holes spewed out radiation from their accretion disks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This black hole is shooting out a jet in our general direction, but it's not a gamma ray burst, it's a stream of ionized particles. </p>
<p>This black hole is enormous and almost certainly formed billions of years ago, so any gamma ray burst from that initial formation is long gone. Who knows if it was directed anywhere near us at that time, or if there was even an Earth yet at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A gamma ray &quot;burst&quot; is so called because it's a short (seconds to minutes I think) intense burst of gamma rays all emitted at once. They're so brief and intense because they come from a sudden, violent event, like two neutron stars colliding, or a star collapsing in a supernova.</p>
<p>This super-massive black hole is spewing out a lot of radiation, sure... for a constant source. But it's going to continue steadily emitting radiation for probably billions of years. There's no reason to believe it will soon undergo some violent event that will release a short burst of radiation.</p>
<p>It's kind of like the difference between going out in the sunshine over the years vs getting a UV radiation burn. If you take the same amount of UV radiation from 10 years of sunshine and deliver it to your skin in a second, it could very well kill you.</p></div>		</li>
