			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The industry for low waste/eco friendly products is booming, shampoo bars and powders are everywhere, as well as deoderants, cosmetics, and your usual soaps and body washes. Solid bars make it easier to lose the plastic packaging waste, they're generally made of more natural ingredients, often vegan, and ethically sourced, they'll last longer than shop bought products, and are better for your skin and hair, too. Try looking at farmers markets and artisan shops for more locally sourced products. There's also an upkick right now in companies offering refillable product subscription services, delivered right to your door. When you finish a product, you just mail back the container, and they refill it and send it back, soaps, shampoos and conditioners, as well as general household cleaning products, with almost zero waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a local store that makes solid soap, shampoo bars, and solid lotion bars. Breezy Quarters is the name of the shop and website. She even makes a NO MELT lip balm that really doesn't melt when left in the car in the middle of summer. Everyone loves it! (No affiliation, just love the store)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tetra Pak is a brand name and the main patents for it have long since expired so that's not why it is more expensive. Competitors exist but as often happens the most popular brand name becomes a generic term for a product.</p></div>		</li>
