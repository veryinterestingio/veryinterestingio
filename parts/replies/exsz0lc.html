<p>This is not true in general (when the principal moments of inertia are not all equal) as a result of the ω × Icm ω term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Euler_equations" target="_blank">Newton-Euler equations</a>.

<p>Angular momentum should be conserved, but the moment of inertia about the center of mass can still change (Sandra Bullock is not a rigid body). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eMH07Tghs0" target="_blank">this experiment</a> (unfortunately not in space).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is still another misleading element unaddressed here, which is I think the premise of the asker's question is a misunderstanding of Newtonian physics. </p>
<p>Many people have the correct intuition that being under constant motion is the same as being at rest-- that sitting on a very smoothly-riding train or airplane feels just like being stopped, even though you may be moving at hundreds of miles per hour. </p>
<p>What the asker may not know is that this is NOT true for constant <em>rotation</em>. There is a centrifugal force (which is a <a href="https://xkcd.com/123/" target="_blank">perfectly valid construction</a>) that pulls you &quot;out&quot;, away from the axis of rotation in your own frame of reference, and also Coriolis forces, which will &quot;twist&quot; or &quot;deflect&quot; things in your frame of reference. You can always unambiguously tell whether you are rotating or not by checking whether those forces are there, which is in essence how your inner ear works. </p>
<p>There is no analogue for centrifugal and Coriolis forces with linear motion, so (in short) that is why you &quot;can't tell&quot; if you are moving or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first effect (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket_theorem" target="_blank">Tennis Racket Theorem</a>) is also not true in general, so there's a chance she meets the criteria for either. In the movie, however, she rotates about what would be the intermediate axis without the flipping motion, which suggests her mass distribution is such that she doesn't have 3 strongly defined moments of inertia. If her arms and legs are spread out (her arms certainly are in the video), then her symmetry more closely resembles a square prism. I haven't done any math to prove that she wouldn't do the tennis racket thing <em>for certain</em>. If you'd like to, please do and let me know. I'm feeling particularly lazy.</p>
<p>The second part begs the question. The point of the thought experiment is to assume that she can only stop the erratic spinning if she stops moving erratically, and she does indeed stop flailing in the film, which results in a simple spin.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think we have different definitions of 'in general'. I'm talking about general instances of the class of rigid bodies within the context of Newtonian mechanics, to which the tennis racket theorem applies without exception (otherwise it wouldn't be a theorem). I think you're talking about the more general case of multiple rigid bodies and/or deformable bodies.  I was merely pointing out that the specific statement you made was not true, but the implication is that if it's not generally true for a single rigid body, then it isn't generally true for a collection of interconnected rigid bodies (of which a single rigid body is a special case) either.</p>
<p>About the second part, I was similarly only pointing out that the exact statement made in the parent post was not true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor correction: What you're describing is centri<em>fugal</em> force, which acts away from the center of rotation (from Latin &quot;centrus&quot; (center) and &quot;fugere&quot; (fleeing)). Centri<em>petal</em> force acts in opposition acts in opposition to centrifugal force, pulling things back towards the center of rotation and preventing them from traveling away in a straight line (from &quot;centrus&quot; and &quot;petere&quot; (seeking)). In this case the centripetal force is provided by the structural integrity of your limbs.</p></div>		</li>
