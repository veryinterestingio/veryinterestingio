<p>But H2O2 works as an antiseptic (Bactera &amp; Virus killer) by decaying into OH radicals, who bind to the cell wall/proteins thereby causing a chain reaction that disrupts the membrane. The point of using it in this capacity is that Catalase isn't supposed to be able to destroy it before it fatally deforms the bacteria/virus.</p>
<p>/u/Johnnybizkit Hydrogen Peroxide is highly caustic (Look at the Wikipedia page) and will cause significant scarring on its own. It should not be recommended to clean wounds with Hydrogen Peroxide unless a medical professional is present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure of the smell you're referring to, so this is kind of a shot in the dark. &quot;Sweet&quot; smells might be from esters. These can be formed be reacting hydrogen peroxide with ketones found in cells by way of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baeyer%E2%80%93Villiger_oxidation" target="_blank">Baeyer–Villiger oxidation</a>. Although I'd like to hear from a biochemist to see what their explanation might be (I'm more of a chemical engineer/material scientist).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather it's that you should only use it for initial cleansing and not for regular wound upkeep because it can bubble away the new skin cells, prolonging healing (and potentially causing scarring). This is the biggest reason you never use peroxide on any kind of piercing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it kills bacteria, but also damages some of the cells in charge of cicatrization (sorry if mispelled, english is not my main language).</p></div>		</li>
