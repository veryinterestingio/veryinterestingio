			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Tea is the evening meal to me and dinner is the midday meal. That being said judging by OPs post history and the fact that he's only heating something in the microwave for 1 minute I'd guess he means tea as in a cup of tea...
Which is totally sacrilege to heat in a microwave.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As opposed to using a microwave to heat water? It's faster than a kettle, and unless you have a fancy kettle that takes the water to lower-than-boiling-&quot;I don't want to scorch my tea&quot; temperatures, there's no reason not to if you're only making tea for one</p></div>		</li>

<p>That really depends on where you're from. In the US the mains power is usually 120V at 15 amps max, so even a 100% efficient electric kettle would heat up to 1800W max. 1500W seems to be the most common rating. That's why stove top kettles are more commonly used in the US.<br />
In most countries in Europe it's 230V/16A, so up to 3680W. Common electric kettles are around 2800W here, boiling water much faster than stove top kettles or microwaves.</p></div>		</li>
