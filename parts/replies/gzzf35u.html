			<div class="markdown"><p>Method of preparation is important as well. Garlic create a compound that is a precursor to tear-gas when cut into. If allowed to breath for long enough before cooking it will be very spicy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who are familiar with garlic in their dishes definitely don't find it spicy at all. </p>
<p>For garlic lovers that want to feel its spice, I recommend getting a lot of garlic and  making <strong>Toum</strong>. I grew up eating tons of garlic and it wasn't until I tried Toum that I realized how spicy garlic can be. </p>

<p>The chemicals in mint and wasabi activate the &quot;cold&quot; TRP channels</p>

<p>Then why doesn't wasabi feel cold like mint does?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wasabi activates fewer types of TRP channels than mint does. These detect &quot;colder&quot; channels so the sensation is closer to pain as a result. </p>
<p>Mint is milder and activates more types of TRP channels for a different sensation, one that we interpret as &quot;cool.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question, I'm not exactly sure but I'd say there's probably some autonomic nerve response to &quot;heat&quot; signals from whatever nerve fibers carry the signals of those TRP channels. </p>
<p>So even without temperature actually increasing, the activation of these heat sensing proteins through chemicals could activate the normal bodily response to heating up, including sweating.</p></div>		</li>
