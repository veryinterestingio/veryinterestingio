<p>I know we don't have the data yet, but is there a general expectation for how long the mRNA vaccines will work before a booster is needed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it depends what the societal goal is and how covid persists at a population level.  The mRNA vaccines will probably provide protection from severe covid and death for a long time, maybe several years, maybe forever.  They probably won't provide protection from re-infection and being slightly symptomatic/spreading covid for nearly as long.  So we might not *need* boosters if people are getting covid but not dying, but not everyone might accept that situation as the status quo.</p>
<p>The thing is, if large swathes of america never go above 50% vaccination, there will probably be regular re-challenge to vaccinated people with fresh covid strains. That'll actually serve as a booster to your vaccination, so your covid immunity will not wane as fast as if we completely eradicated it. I suspect that's the situation we'll eventually find ourselves in. Most people will be relatively protected, deaths will be low among vaccinated people, but you'll occasionally get a cold that's actually a new SARS2 strain. They are looking to add a covid vaccination to the annual flu shot in a combination vaccine to just give everyone a regular re-boost.</p>
<p>This dynamic of simmering infection with lots of vaccinated people occasionally getting sick is our basic dynamic for seasonal flu, and its the same reason that most flu variants aren't very lethal compared to the 1918 flu. We have a lot of pre-existing cross immunity to a variety of flu strains, so our immune system does a pretty good job fighting off new ones that infect us, even if we haven't seen that exact strain before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does repeated exposure to a virus after being vaccinated against it work as a &quot;booster&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression there was a fair level of convergence in the variants, so it may be that just a single booster is required. Is that old information? It's such a new virus, it's hard to keep up with all the developmenta.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine isn't an mRNA vaccine. It's a vector vaccine. So your answer, while interesting, isn't relevant to the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Variants that we are keeping an eye on aren’t ones with codon mutations at wobble positions.  The sequence of the ACE binding spike protein is not identical to the alpha strain.  It’s just not nearly different enough that even with only the antibodies specific for that protein (like every vaccine) have lost affinity for it.  (I’m finishing up my bio PhD spent in a venom lab… we look at, among other things, antivenom cross specificity, how strongly cobra antivenoms bind to something like a colubrid with three finger toxins that are almost completely different except for shape/scaffold and maybe 5 or 6 conserved sequence amino acids.  While weak, there’s still affinity).  Besides the ones you mentioned the reason we aren’t likely to see a total loss of of affinity is because the protein isn’t gonna change completely because of it did it wouldn’t even be an ACE binding protein any more and it wouldn’t have a furin binding site.  Even if the sequence changes from an asparagine to a glutamate it’s not going to lose affinity.  Because we chose the most critical protein of a virus that only has one antigen it has an affinity for, we are almost guaranteed not to completely lose the properties of that protein that both allow the adherence of the antibodies stimulated by the vaccine and the ACE2 receptor.   Over time in order to keep high levels of affinity (binding strength) we’ll probably need to modify and get boosters, but it will take a lot to get a variant that’s literally without affinity for the vaccine antibodies.</p>
<p>Mostly I just think it’s misleading to say that protein sequence has not changed… it has… just that any antibodies are binding to the same properties that allow it to bind to the ACE receptor, so it’s unlikely to lose one but not the other.  Even similar sequences are recognized unless an amino acid switches to one with very different R group properties… and that would likely decrease the affinity with ACE.  So the same thing that keeps the virus dangerous keeps it recognizable by vaccine antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya, you make a good point, I just think the bigger issue is that any gain of function mutation of this virus is going to be insanely rare. There's just not much to work with.</p>
<p>We'll see. There's always weird things that can happen, especially once things end up in a big genetic soup of multiple viruses mixing genetic data. That's the fear though always, some chimera event occurs. My problem here is I can't help but feel there is a lot of fearmongering over literally just genetic drift of a fairly &quot;stable&quot; viral genome. Now, stable might not be the best word, but Covid-19 has repair and verification that a virus like influenza doesn't, has a far lower mutation rate, and genetic drift  is 100% normal, inevitable, and are being reported as new novel strains. I find it kind of misleading of the media, even dishonest, but I also suspect that it is happening as a means to an end to push continued vaccination. I get it, with public health you weight the pros and cons of t he whole story, but the fearmongering over &quot;variants&quot; is starting to really get overboard, like we are back to square one again and some people are hiding in fear again as they have been told that their vaccine might not be good enough.</p>
<p>I mean, technically there can be antigenic drift here over time, I just don't see it that likely here to be a problem anytime soon, if not ever, and some variants to be reported aren't even showing any antigenic drift, at least according to one paper I read. That just seems crazy to fearmonger over. </p>
<p>All I am saying is that their vaccine will likely be fine for a very long time, if not their lifetime. Impossible to say now, but I just find the likelihood of a novel mutation that gains function to be more deadly to be a lot less likely than what I am hearing if I turn on the TV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would you say getting vaccinated after having had covid is essentially redundant and unnecesary? As you will likelly get a natural &quot;booster&quot; by being re exposed eventually.. most likely most of us wll be re exposed multiple times to the virus and its various strains</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For context <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.22.21257658v1" target="_blank">there is data out of the UK suggesting that both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are about 20% less effective against the Delta variant than the Alpha variant after one dose</a>, but after two doses efficacy is nearly the same against both variants. If that's true it seems plausible that J&amp;J will be somewhat less effective since it uses a one-dose regime. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994839/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_16.pdf" target="_blank">AstraZeneca is only 50% effective against symptomatic disease after the first dose and that's the vaccine which is most similar to J&amp;J. (But note efficacy against hospitalizations or deaths is much higher - more like 80% against hospitalization after one dose of AZ)</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding this correctly, this still means there is no vaccine like the JJ one so these comparisons don't mean much at all. It could just as well mean that the JJ vaccine is just that strong, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For more recent and translational context, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03720-y#citeas" target="_blank">this study</a> just accepted at Nature is the first to show that in vivo in a humanized mouse model of Sars-Cov-2 infection via mice expressing hACE2 that almost all vaccines (certainly teh mRNA ones) are sufficient in neutralizing old and new variants. These are much more informative than in vitro neutralizing assays that clearly dont translate given the findings of this paper.</p>
<p>You also probably shouldn't extrapolate dose-requirements across different vaccines. Number of doses isn't the issue, it's amount of antigen that your immune cells sees that it is important. Differences in efficacy are probably more due to delivery method, amount of viral vector or mRNA delivered (depending on vax type) and the sequences used to generate the antigens.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The bane of my life over the past few months.</p>
<p>The fact that an antibody has <em>x</em> higher/lower binding affinity in vitro does not meaningfully translate into real-world effectiveness of vaccines.</p>
<p>And it also completely ignores the extremely important roles of cellular immunity. Antibodies wane, but as long a our T cells keep recognising the virus, we'll be okay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really? Is there a reference for that? I was under the impression that the timing of when the antigen appears can also be important (because the second dose activates eg memory B cells that were not there yet for the first dose).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't follow. The J&amp;J vaccine uses a mechanism that only requires one dose, you can't compare that meaningfully to the first dose of an mRNA vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The J&amp;J vaccine was tested as a one-dose vaccine, but I don’t think that necessarily means that it uses a mechanism that only requires one dose.  J&amp;J is actually running a clinical trial testing a two-dose regimen, and from what I have read they are expecting to get better efficacy data.  Similarly, if Pfizer or Moderna had studied their vaccines as a one-dose vaccine they may have been able to get approval that way (and the efficacy data probably would’ve come out at least as good as JNJ’s).  I do think it’s not unreasonable to say that the JNJ vaccine might have worse efficacy than Pfizer/Moderna against the Delta variant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The J&amp;J mechanism is basically the same as the RNA ones.</p>
<p>Straight up injection of the mRNA which your cells then read, the instructions to make and spit out spike proteins which your body then begins to treat as a foreign invader.</p>
<p>VS</p>
<p>Wrapping some DNA in an adenovirus, the adenovirus makes its way into cells, where the DNA is then changed to mRNA, instructions for the cell to make and spit out spike proteins...</p>
<p>It's basically the same damn thing, only wrapped in a different package mate.</p></div>		</li>
