			<div class="markdown"><p>Because being able to see is still useful, some have super big eyes to make the most out of the little light they get, some just base their strategies on being under their pray and looking up so when something gets above they see a shadow. </p>
<p>It's not like they are completely blind down there, light will still shine and have some intensity and they exploit that intensity to the full potential with different strategies that we either don't have the need for or straight up would not work on our sunlight intensity.</p></div>		</li>
