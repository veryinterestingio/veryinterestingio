			<div class="markdown"><p>Her daughter asks for the technical word for not having a winner or loser. She can't remember the word, but a few minutes later in the &quot;present time&quot; the military guys are talking about trading their piece of the alien puzzle with the other countries, and I'm pretty sure that's when it was mentioned. Because the only way all the countries can &quot;win&quot; the full alien message is to &quot;lose&quot; all their individual slices of it. However, if one country takes all the other 11 slices without giving up their own, then the others have lost completely without any reward. Since she just heard &quot;zero sum game&quot; in that meeting, she is able to tell her &gt;!future daughter!&lt; those words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Potential spoiler warning</em> It is referenced in one of her more detailed and later-on flashes she starts to grasp the alien language better. Her daughter asks her what the scientific word describing a scenario in which there isn't a winner or loser but isn't &quot;win-win&quot; (I believe, that could be off. I am stoned so the semantics are a little fuzzy.)</p>
<p>Edit: Not <em>technically</em> a flash<em>back</em> I suppose, but you get the point. Removed flashbacks and just changed it to flashes.</p></div>		</li>
