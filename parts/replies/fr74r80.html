			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  I'm diabetic.  I get my insulin over the counter at WalMart for $25 a vial.  No prescription needed.  When I had insurance they were paying over $400 for one.  Newer ones which require a prescription are fancier but are really no more effective once you get used to using them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Effectiveness depends. Older insulins have little effect on me so they switched me to some very modern bio engineered stuff. I read up on it but I don't remember the specifics, they splice proteins or something to change it. So effectiveness can come down to a personal basis.</p>

<p>I find it odd you would need a prescription for any of it, in Canada her e I can get any kind of diabetic supplies over the counter. In fact I've only ever had one prescription about 25 years ago in another city for the stuff. The pharmacists tell me they can't/won't restrict any of it because it's essential and could end up killing people if they can't get it when needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually that is a problem. Side effects never go away, you simply get used to it. And that is not a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humalog is expensive. I knew someone who’s diabetic mom passed away. I asked for the extra humalog she had available to give to my friend who is type 1 diabetic. He literally cried when I gave it to him. The only thing he could get was novolin 70/30 bc he got his through a non-profit thing. It was ok but it wasn’t really quick enough for high sugar spikes. He told me that humalog would cost him over $200 if tried to get it without insurance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  When I was on Lantus my insurance company was paying over $400 for a vial.  The long-term acting insulin that Novo Nordisk makes for WalMart is $25 a vial.</p></div>		</li>
