			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read of the self domestication theory it's a combination of women selected more agreeable, less violent mates and tribes/societies of agreeable, less violent people out performing their vivals. It wouldn't be distinct to agriculture. Domestication of animals happened with hunter gatherers first. The same reason a less violent, hostile wolf buddy is a bigger asset to the tribe, so to is the same for fellow human tribe members.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this has less to do with genes and more to do with the environment we live in today, back then before they even had writing, they had to remember not to eat certain berries, go certain places due to danger, etc. There were more things that were required of a primitive human than of us today, especially us living in modern countries where we don't have to worry about how clean water is (unless you live in flint) or how to find enough food. We just do our jobs and that puts food on the table. </p>
<p>Genetics might have something to do with it, but I think there are more factors to how smart a person can become that are more important, as it's been seen before that an independent child may be more successful than the parent in adulthood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I understand you correct, you are talking about groups of people that to this day are still hunter gatherers? I couldnÂ´t find anything on that. I only read about the human average nowadays compared to ancient hunter gatherers. But since the beeing of a hunter gatherer isnÂ´t confirmed to be the only reason for a diffrence in brain size I donÂ´t see why modern hunter gatherers wouldnÂ´t be considered &quot;domesticated&quot; like other groups of humans today.</p>

<p>Yeah I think I know what you mean. It is true that thanks to modern medicine and technology people are living longer and maybe also with &quot;bad genes&quot;. But I would be careful with that term since the effectiveness or &quot;goodness&quot; of genes always relies on the environment we live in. The expression of a gene might be useless or usefull for the same individual in different environments. And since those can change it might be helpful to carry genes that are unhelpful right now around.</p>
<p>You said &quot;inbred&quot; isnÂ´t the right term. Maybe you can explain what you mean in another way? Because I would strongly disagree with humans as a species being more inbred, because of the high number of individuals and also globalization that definetely should help with genetic recombination and thus combat inbreeding and genetic diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, I can explain more, and it may be more in line with what you said about certain genes being expressed. Another theme would be as you said an adaptation to the environment (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>Humans evolved for hundreds of thousands of years to be specialized in hunting and gathering but after we focused on agriculture 12,000 years ago, those genes that would have been advantageous in hunting and gathering are no longer advantageous now. One example I can think of is the ability to store fat, and keep it. </p>
<p>Humans who were good at storing fat in their bodies and keeping it wouldve survived more than humans who did not, since there has never been a time like now where food is so abundant. Nowadays though, everybody is developing obesity and other metabolic diseases because we are just mismatched for our current environment. We no longer have to run around for hours to catch our prey in order to eat!</p>
<p>Many people also develop sleep apnea and other maxillofacial issues (fucked up teeth, fucked up jaws), because we no longer eat the food we evolved to eat for so long (tougher to chew stuff) and we eat way too much sugar and soft foods that we no longer develop proper jaw bones and muscles.</p>
<p>So I guess it's not really about being &quot;inbred&quot; just that we look &quot;inbred&quot; due to our maladaption to the environment we've created that we didn't evolve fast enough to adapt to.</p></div>		</li>
