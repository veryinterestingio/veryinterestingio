			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this, somehow, related to why I feel horrible if I eat in the morning (I don't usually)? As in, it doesn't have the proper amount of acid because it's not used to getting food at that time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to feel really sick if I ate in the morning. Then I started listening to the &quot;you need to eat breakfast. it's the most important meal of the day&quot; crap. It made me put on 28lb over a few years because I'd be hungry all day! I've stopped eating it again now and I've gone back down. Some people aren't supposed to eat breakfast, I'm sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm exactly the same - I've never liked eating breakfast and it makes me feel ill. When I tried to eat breakfast I started piling weight on</p>
<p>I'm sure breakfast is great for most people, but it makes me feel and look like shit and I have no more energy than I did without it. The only difference I found is that I'm less likely to feel cold in winter if I've had something to eat</p>
<p>I can even skip lunch if I want to and my body doesn't complain - it seems perfectly happy with one meal a day and an optional lunch</p>
<p>My fiancee, on the other hand, can't cope without 3 meals a day - she gets headaches and hunger pangs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m so glad I read this. I dieted really hard last year and lost about 30 lbs very quickly. If I ever had a cheat day I would get massive bloating and unbearable pain in my back after eating a large, unhealthy meal. Was diagnosed with gallstones. Luckily I think they have all passed and my ultrasound only showed small ones at the time. I always questioned if it was my hard diet but never really had a definite answer.</p></div>		</li>
