			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain functions off of the glucose in your blood, and unlike the rest of your body it does not have any alternative fuel source (under normal circumstances). Your brain relies on a constant supply of this glucose and once it runs out, there are no backup sources (under normal circumstances). Prolonged fasting is the only way to get your brain to “switch over” to using ketones - it won’t just do it because your blood glucose levels dip too low.</p>
<p>Edit: when blood glucose levels drop too low you begin to get fatigued, weak and tired. Don’t ask me why this happens on a cellular level because I’m just a medic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Altered mental status is something that comes with low blood sugar so that’s a pretty reasonable guess - some of the hypoglycemic patients I’ve had, you could have sworn they had dementia. </p>
<p>Again, that’s just a guess because I haven’t really studied that realm much. I just treat your symptoms and try to keep you alive until I can get you to a doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain will take glucose from other organs to feed itself, maybe this is the fatigue? Ill ask my father whos a sports scientist</p>
<p>Edit: yesh its to do with taking sugars from other cells in different parts of the body</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual metabolic rate of the brain changes very little during increased activity. Instead it's possibly waste neurotransmitter. One of the main reasons people sleep is to clear out wasted neurotransmitters in the brain, and extra activity could potentially increase this. That said, there isn't really any conclusive research on this exact subject, that's just my educated guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The “metabolic rate of the brain” studies I’ve seen are super inconsistent - some of them show significant blood glucose changes, some of them show no change, some of them show an increase in participant efficiency when supplemented with sugary drinks, and some show no change at all. </p>
<p>I honestly feel that they aren’t being hard enough on the participants. The studies all were very mildly intensive “brain activities” that won’t even come close to the level of concentration and thought you’ll put into a single class or while trying to understand a chapter in a textbook.</p>
<p>Edit:
There’s definitely more to it than simple “do activity, burn fuel”; I’d wager that stress hormones and mental waste products contribute as well, but no one knows for certain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The overall energy burn of the brain stays pretty darn close to the same. Individual metrics like you're talking about may change or may not.</p>
<p>As for the level of activity, they generally aren't testing the extent. They are comparing to a control, which means they really only need enough to cause a change, not enough to mentally exhaust someone for an entire day. The IRB to do that is way more of a pain to get in the first place, so people are unlikely to want to try.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sending and receiving electrical signals requires ATP to move the ions into/out of cells by opening/closing the appropriate pumps and channels. <del>If your brain is using more ATP, there is less for the rest of your cells.</del> *</p>
<p>Making ATP (efficiently) requires oxygen, so your heart and lungs are working to circulate blood to the brain to deliver this oxygen just as it would deliver it to your skeletal muscles during a workout.</p>
<p>Edit: * I realized this doesn’t make sense since each cell makes its own ATP. The limiting resource is going to be glucose or other nutrients (which is used to make ATP)</p></div>		</li>
