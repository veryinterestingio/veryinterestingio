			<div class="markdown"><p>First, there currently is no scientific consensus that spicy foods like hot peppers prevent bacterial and mold growth. Everyone has their own testing methods for it and currently no one is getting any results that agree with each other.</p>
<p>Second, spicy foods are relatively a modern thing in those areas you listed. Spicy peppers originated in Mexico and then moved down to South American continents. It wasn't until 1492 when the Columbian exchange started that hot peppers were brought to Europe, Africa, and Asia. We take spicy asian cuisine for granted but it's actually a relatively newish thing there.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest reason we think people started eating hot foods now is for cultural reasons. You need quite a high concentration of capsaicin to inhibit common food pathogen growth that would be pretty hot for even seasoned chili heads. There is a reason most hot sauces have to be pasturized before bottling. This makes it not very likely it was used for actual food preservation and that some people just liked the flavor of it instead If anything it was used to cover up the taste of food that was beginning to spoil.</p>
<p>Some people just like hot foods though and we're even starting to find out different species have just as much a varied taste for spiciness as humans do. Take a random sample of squirrels and your likely to find that atleast 2/10 of them would actually preferentially go for spicy food over others if offered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that spicy foods are prevalent in warmer climates because it acts as a cooling mechanism. Spicy food makes you sweat and sweating cools you down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this was more of a warm v cold water thing. Drink a glass of cold water, and you just get marginally cooler for all the extra energy you put into making that water cold. Drink a glass of hot tea, and for the same energy, you cool off more because you start sweating.</p>
<p>I don't have any sources tho...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in hot climate and that's bs it does NOT cool you down because unless you live in a desert, most hot countries are also humid and thus sweat does very little for cooling, we just feel very icky drowning in sweat that never evaporates, and our body feels hotter than before</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both of these things are true, as are a third fact that peppers grow better in warmer climates.</p>
<p>It's likely though that preservation is the most utilitarian reason.  The cooling mechanism hypothesis breaks down a little bit because people acclimate to spice and react less to it.  People who eat lots of spicy food gain very little sweat benefit from it.</p></div>		</li>
