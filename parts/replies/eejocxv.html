			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. So if you looking for solutions in the region where T^μν (Stress-Energy Tensor) is zero by only assuming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symmetry: T^μν = T^vμ</li>
<li>Lorentz Invariance </li>
<li>Conservation: d_μ T^μv = 0</li>
<li>Simplicity: T^μv only depends on h^μv and its 1st derivatives</li>
</ul>
<p>Then by working the harmonic gauge and the transverse-traceless gauge (gauge invariance), you come to the result that gravitational waves must exist. Now these waves exist in linearly independent definite helicity states due to our choice of gauge. The zero and +/-1 helicity states are unphysical leading to only the +/- 2 helicity states to be allowed. This is why all theoretical predictions of the Gravition have it as a spin-2 particle. And why saying gravity is mediated by a spin-2 particle isn't unreasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll admit you've gone over my head here. I covered some GR at uni but beyond &quot;the Einstein field equations permit wave-like solutions&quot; I don't fully understand the remainder of your explanation. </p>
<p>That said, &quot;if a graviton exists, it must be spin-2&quot; is not the same as &quot;a graviton must exist&quot;. It's very convenient for gravity to be mediated by a boson, but unless there is something I have missed, there is no experimental observation that demands this be the case?</p></div>		</li>
