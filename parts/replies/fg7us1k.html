			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, collagen is piezoelectric, it's the shape of you, it's the binding site for water, and if you dissolved all the cells in your body it would be mesh the shape of you.</p>
<p>When we use muscles, when gravity acts on us, if another object impacts us, all of these things, practically all motion makes for the same result. Physical forces move through us, and where pressure acts on collagen, there the collagen produces waste heat. When that heat is not too intense, it provides the necessary activation energy to bind nearby water molecules to itself before the pressure causes the fiber to break. If it can thoroughly coat itself before breaking, the water acts as a kind of radiator system to shed excess heat into the water network before critical failure anywhere, thereby helping other nearby fibers benefit from that same heat.</p>
<p>This matrix of fibers is dynamic and shifting between a traditional solid and something not unlike a liquid crystal as this transition happens, and is responsible for the increased range of motion, strength, and endurance one experiences between the cold state and &quot;warmed up&quot;. Stretching without adequate heat results in damaged fibers that must be cleaned up by the body, either by aligning the remnants or via the osteoclasts which eat them. The results are weak parts of the web, a drain on several kinds of resources for which the body has better things slated, and eventual loss of flexibility in certain directions as you encourage denser fiber packing in areas prone to breakage.</p>
<p>So what good is stretching? What kind of stretching yields any results? Well, being warm sure helps, but making sure to hit the whole range of motion means that the network isn't only opening at a single minute part of the arc rather than the whole arc. The fibers are laid in a variety of interesting geometries which ultimately help give rise to things like the layout for our sense of pain or nociception. Stress the mesh, signals arise and race down nerve pathways. When stretching hurts, it's often a signal that something, generally nerve cells, are being warped too far. Conversely, if we are warm, and if we are resisting against the direction of stretch to maximize our leverage at the fiber level, the fiber matrix is what expands, not unlike many colorful geometric toys many of us grew up with. When this kind of resistance is applied through the range of motion, the forces encourage fibers splayed across the normal grain to bend and snap into line, not unlike brushing hair.</p>
<p>Tl; dr: get warm, resist with the muscles you want to stretch, go through the range of motion to stretch the whole thing instead of a fraction. Do multiple reps. This is real stretching, at the fascial matrix level. Anything less is literally breaking and tearing you, then slowly, if ever, rebuilding you, and doing so more densely, less flexibly, and at large cost. Holler if you want more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Althought not ELI5 by any stretch (lol), this is a very thorough yet clear explanation. Thank you for taking the time to explain some of the minutiae of biomechanics. I'd go through my entire life thinking muscle tissue is just more flexible due to temperature as most things are.</p>
<p>Do you have an academic degree on this subject?</p></div>		</li>
