			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not made up of cells, which are considered by many to be the most basic unit when it comes to being a life form. They can reproduce, but only by hacking a cell into doing it for them. That means they can barely do anything on their own. They have no metabolism of any sorts. They do, however, undergo Darwinian evolution.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Viruses aren't necessarily &quot;not alive&quot;. They evolve, they reproduce, and they have a life cycle. They're obligate predators and parasites. They're part of an ecosystem. They compete with each other and with their prey. Ask me, that counts as alive. A cell biologist might disagree...but there's such a thing as a scientifically-sound opinion. Whether it's alive or not isn't science, it's philosophy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proud microbiologist here, and yes I agree it's more philosophy than science whether a virus is alive or not, so I accept the challenge! I agree with your points for why a virus <em>is</em> alive, but what about why it's not alive? Homeostasis is generally accepted as a criterion of life, which viruses lack. As is respiration/metabolism, although you could argue viruses pass those criteria since they do hijack the respiration/metabolism of their host. I'd disagree though, since at its most basic on a cellular level homeostasis mostly boils down to metabolism and needing to maintain energy gradients. Wait, did I just make a point for viruses being alive? ...Nah, I'd argue it still doesn't pass the test. Viruses are a stable, replicable, organization of stuff, that have no metabolism to call their own. Energy gradients and the homeostasis to maintain them are a hallmark of life, and I'd be happy to be convinced that they're not. </p>
<p>Since it's a friendly drunken (at least on my side..) philosophy debate, what about other edge cases like prions? As you said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>They evolve, they reproduce, and they have a life cycle. They're obligate predators and parasites. They're part of an ecosystem. They compete with each other and with their prey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and yet, they're just a protein. Their genetic material is their structure, far simpler than a virus, yet fit those criteria. </p>
<p>And now, I'll expect /u/PaulaNancyMillstoneJ to be a (wo)man of their word and gild me /s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's weird to think about where the boundaries of our definitions lie. We understand the world by categorisation; exploring the process and nature of those categorisations can be a way to gain valuable insight.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I believe that &quot;life&quot;, like most of our categories, has fuzzy borders. There are things which are certainly alive, things which are certainly not and, in the middle, things which have some properties of aliveness, but lack others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why it's general philosophy instead of science! In science, most questions are easy to answer in theory. See this, infer that. A little tricky at first but something you can pick up relatively fast. It's the application that gets you, since most of the time you can't see it, you need to see something that implies the thing you want to see and can draw conclusions based on that.</p>
<p>Philosophy is usually where the question <em>has</em> no definitive answer that we can prove. How do you even go about answering the question of whether something is alive or not, even if you had access to all the information that will ever exist?</p></div>		</li>
