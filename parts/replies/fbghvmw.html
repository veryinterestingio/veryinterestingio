			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you're talking about the water activated Kraft paper tape (starch based adhesive).  The discussion is about polypropylene tape (aka clear packaging tape - acrylic, hot melt adhesives). </p>
<p>I always like to call it &quot;flutes&quot; instead of the proper &quot;medium&quot; as well..some things just make more sense to ELI5.  Not everyone can pass the Mullen test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but edge crush doesn't really translate as well as burst to the protection in the distribution environment where things are less predictable. (But it is very good for warehouse type stuff).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an intro materials engineering course, my professor would joke that for the final, he would give us each a pure-metal rod &amp; give out grades based on who was able to make it the strongest by the end of the testing period (4-hours or so). </p>
<p>We didn't have access to the labs (since it was an intro class) and therefore the best option we had would be to &quot;cold-work&quot; the metal or cause imperfections. Basically, we would whack the rod against a tree or pillar for 4 hours....for better or worse, we had a written final.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol no just an example of starch and sticky.</p>
<p>I realize it may not mean it's cooked, but I am no chef. Boiling pasta in my bachelor days was just a 10min timer and then time to eat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, no you can't. All you can determine from that test is if the pasta is sticky or not. Pasta can stick to the wall and still be crunchy inside, you don't want that. It can also stick on the wall and be overcooked and mushy, you don't want that either. It really does not tell you anything about the doneness of pasta.</p></div>		</li>
