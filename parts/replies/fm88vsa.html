			<div class="markdown"><p>The physical explanation that is easiest to grok is that the nucleus they initially create is very unstable, and it sort of instantly breaks into pieces. The energy of those pieces, for the fusion reactions that <em>do</em> release net energy (not all of them do), is higher than the energy that got the nuclei close enough together to fuse.</p>
<p>The more complicated answer involves the curve of binding energy and E=mc^2 and is less intuitive (but explains why this doesn't violate conservation of energy).</p></div>		</li>
