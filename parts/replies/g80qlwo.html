			<div class="markdown"><p>The watermarks have gotten significantly better and are now only noticeable to &quot;golden ear&quot; listeners which they use to test from time to time. I heard it referred to as psycho-acoustic masking. It was explained once that if you heard a drummer using a drum kit without the actual drums you would hear his movements and feet hitting the pedals, but as soon as there's a drum we no longer register the other noises only the drums hence nobody really notices the watermarks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction, something in the USA is either trade secret <em>or</em> patented. The latter is published openly for all to know, that is the trade off.</p>
<p>For example the recipe for Coca-Cola is trade secret. Literally anyone could figure it out and make an identically tasting cola nut based carbonated beverage. They just make it very hard to figure that out through various methods.</p>
<p>A patent would spell out 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, a mL of mind control serum, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except they actually couldn't, only Coca Cola is allowed access to the decocained coca leaf extract used in their drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew about the encoded watermarks. But I never realized they were audible to normal hearing. Is this why applause sound effects all sound like they're running through a pulsing phaser?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could just be due to the limitations of radio fidelity.  A clap is pretty interesting because it is an impulse signal.  It makes a sharp, loud sound that lasts for a split second.  If you ever want to apply an arbitrary filter to an audio signal, you can run an impulse response through the filter and then use the resulting distorted impulse response on your audio stream and it will apply the same effect to the stream.  This works because, among other things, an ideal impulse response contains contributions from all frequencies.</p>
<p>In other words, an impulse will reflect the full behavior of a filter, echo, or other audio adjustment.  The limited bandwidth and compression techniques used in radio can make a noticeable difference in the sound of an impulse as a result.  That's why applause often shows noticeable artifacts in compressed sound files.</p></div>		</li>
