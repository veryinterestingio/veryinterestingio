			<div class="markdown"><p>If that was possible (it's not, even remotely) what would happen is that flu would disappear for perhaps a year or two and then a new strain would jump into humans from animals. There are many strains of flu in pigs, for example, that are nearly ideally human-adapted (most of them were originally human strains of flu that jumped into pigs form humans). Normally they're not well enough adapted to deal with the background of flu immunity in people, but if the virus in humans disappeared and immunity waned they'd jump back.</p>
<p>Because there are several mistaken posts in this thread, let's be clear: Human influenza viruses are human viruses. Animal influenza viruses do not routinely cycle back and forth into humans. The people who think that swine and bird influenza viruses act as reservoirs for human infections on an annual basis are confusing very rare events with the normal situation. Animal influenza viruses have jumped into humans <em>and caused sustained transmission</em> four times in the past 100 years -- 1918, 1956, 1968, and 2009.  Aside from that, there haven't been any episodes where animal viruses entered the human population on a sustained basis. There <em>have</em> been many thousands of cases where an animal influenza virus jumped into a single human but did not spread, or even when an animal influenza virus spread one or two steps, but none of those have been long-term and none of those contribute to the pool of human influenza viruses that washes over the globe every year.</p>
<p>There are also massive reservoirs of flu viruses in wild waterfowl. Really, influenza is a disease of wild birds that occasionally jumps into other species. Those viruses are less well adapted to humans, but they're the <em>original</em> source of all influenza viruses of all other species (except, maybe, bats).  Again, even if we managed to eliminate all human and all pig influenza viruses, within a decade or two a new bird flu strain would jump into humans and we'd be off again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately no, the flu is very effective at species hopping and is quite common in foul and swine.  You've heard if the swine flue and avian flu, those are potential human flu viruses before they make the species hop.</p>
<p>In fact, looking at the current avian and swine flu strains is one part of how they decide what strains to target in the flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Some viruses are just very effective evolvers, others aren't.  So while we could get rid of one strain, others will come through the protections.</p></div>		</li>
