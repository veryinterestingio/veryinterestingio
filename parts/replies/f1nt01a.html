			<div class="markdown"><p>They could evolve a stronger venom, and if that venom happened to do as you describe as that lead to more spiders born with that mutation then sure. That’s how it works.</p>
<p>Or the venom never gets more potent. It’s a crap shoot, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that there are many ways to survival of the species. Stronger venom might work, but a mutation might also cause the spider to have a more camouflaged color for example, which cause it to be eaten less, and thus reproduce more and thus giving this gene to the next generation.</p></div>		</li>
