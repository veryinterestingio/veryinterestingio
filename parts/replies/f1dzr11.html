			<div class="markdown"><p>The mucus is different depending on where the woman is in her cycle.  It’s at its most “sperm-friendly” around the time a woman is most fertile (ovulation, etc).  Fun TMI fact:  this cervical mucus is called egg-white mucus because of its similarity to egg whites.  At other times during the cycle it has a different texture and isn’t as conducive to fertilization.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more babies you have, the harder it is to care for each one and the less likely they each are to survive. This is a pretty solid rule across the animal kingdom, and is why you see such diversity in the number of children different species have at a time. </p>
<p>In general, the more care a newborn/newly hatched baby requires, the fewer children the parent will have at once and the more protective the parent will be of them.</p>
<p>Creatures like, say, many kinds of fish and spiders can have dozens or even hundreds of children at once because they don’t need to take any special care of them once they’ve hatched. Most of those babies will die, but because the energy investment is low, the parent doesn’t have to particularly care about that.</p>
<p>Human children, for a variety of reasons mostly to do with the combination of our big heads and bipedal gait making giving birth extremely difficult, are particularly helpless at birth and because of the way we learn and our brains develop, have an extraordinarily long development period before reaching adulthood and require quite a lot of time and attention to successfully raise.</p>
<p>Combined with how dangerous giving birth is, there comes a trade off point where getting pregnant too frequently results in too many children to adequately care for successfully and increases the risk of the mother dying which is likely to be bad for any children she has already had.</p>
<p>More children is better, evolutionarily speaking, but only up to the point where it doesn’t decrease the net likelihood of survival for all of the children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also an advantage in only having children rarely (because pregnancy uses a lot of energy and has a risk of death) and making sure those children are healthy. This is also why most fertilized eggs spontaneously abort within the first trimester - most of them have chromosomal abnormalities that mean they wouldn't be viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The majority of men’s sperm is actually defective. So ideally if only the best make it through then less chances of birth defects.</p>
<p>If you look up IUI. It’s a fertility treatment. But they basically “clean” the sperm (take out the defective ones) and spin it for hours in a machine. And then shoot it up past the cervix.</p></div>		</li>
