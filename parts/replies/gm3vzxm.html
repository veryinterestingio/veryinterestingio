<p>ELI5: staring at your lap all day (phone, laptop) over a long time causes changes in the structure of your neck and how they tell the brain what is painful.</p>

<p>So this is an ELI5 topic/summary; do you have an ELI5 conclusion by any chance? I find this quite interesting but even your elaboration lost me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, if you spend long periods of time in a maladaptive position without variable movements (say like sitting at an office desk for 8hrs a day), your body gradually adapt to maintain that position.</p>
<p>This adaption occurs gradually and because of this the pain signals that are normally present, say if you were suddenly forced into a slouched position, are not relayed to the brain to say &quot;whoa, hang on a sec, this is bad for us&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have chronic TMJ that creates intense jaw pain, headaches, neck pain, chest pain, shoulder pain, and weirdly enough, back and hip pain. I’ve been to as many healthcare professionals as I can find, and I’ve been learning that my scoliosis is probably worsening my TMJ. I do a lot of exercises that stretch my chest and neck and help my posture. Considering how related my chronic pain condition is to posture, the neck, and the spine, I’d love to hear more about any insights your research has given you into these areas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately specific to your own complaints I have very limited understanding of scoliosis but I did look at how Posture affects breathing mechanics. Mainly I found that a FHP puts additional strain on the scalenes and Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles which play a role in both breathing and head positioning. I would be inclined to believe that the  SCM is the main player here in issues with the TMJ.</p>
<p>Without a proper assessment or medical history I would be hesitant to give any advice or exercise prescriptions. I would suggest exercises focusing on the diaphragm which is often and overlooked muscle in posture setting and maintenance. This in combination with deep cervical flexor strengthening could reduce the over activity of the SCM ultimately reducing stress at the TMJ.</p>
<p>Again this is all speculation but if its something you haven't done already, it may be worth discussing this with your therapist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know if this is my issue, but I have quite bad bad headaches every day almost, and for a year.</p>
<p>Ive been trying everything for relief and lately experimenting with neck stretches/some strengthening</p></div>		</li>
