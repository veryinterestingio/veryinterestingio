			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same loophole that allowed (allows?) Tic Tacs to claim to be a sugar-free product, in spite of the fact they're virtually 100% sugar. If your suggested serving size (one tablet here) contains less than 0.5 g of sugar, it can claim to be &quot;sugar free.&quot; This makes sense if you're talking about something &quot;macroscopic&quot; - like a cookie or something (0.5 g out of 20 g or the like), but not here, if the single serving is itself less than 0.5 g.</p>
<p>Of course we're talking about the FDA restrictions - US rules. Other countries may have more sensible restrictions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never seen sugar free Tic Tacs, though I have heard this particular anecdote hundreds of times. Are sugar free Tic Tacs an American thing or is this an urban legend?</p>
<p>I can't even find pictures of sugar free Tic Tacs online (not counting gum, which is different)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just google tic tac nutrition and look at old pictures and you'll see the labels that show no sugar.</p>
<p>I'd wager that it has stopped as companies are now being pressured to give nutrition for the entire container and you can't just say zero sugar per serving and then have tons of sugar for the whole container lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>Apparently they added some fine print to cover their ass's. But before this post I was unaware they labeled things like this.</p>
<p>So thank you everyone! TIL</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a big difference (from the POV of the govt) between labeling something as “sugar free” and rounding to 0 g of sugar. I realize as a lay person that may not resonate with you but you should be aware of the confusion you cause when you say it used to be labeled as sugar free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your point. I did some Googling, and could not find any evidence that Tic Tacs were <strong>explicitly</strong> labeled as &quot;sugar free&quot; (which was my phrasing, admittedly). That being said, <a href="https://commonplacefacts.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/img_0706.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> is (or at least was) the nutrition facts for a Tic Tac (in the US). Labeling a product as having &quot;0g of sugar&quot; with a footnote indicating that there's somewhere between 0 and 5g of sugar in the product is not <em>technically</em> labeling it as sugar free. But...</p></div>		</li>
