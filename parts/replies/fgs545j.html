			<div class="markdown"><p>The f stop number corresponds with the size of the aperture, or opening in the front element of the lens. The wider this opening, the larger the angles of light there are coming into the lens. What this does is decrease the so called depth of field, which means that there will be a smaller actual area of the world which will appear in focus on the sensor.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that smaller f stop numbers mean a larger opening (weird old convention). Also, another cool thing is that this is not just with lenses, you can see the same thing with your own eyes! If you see something a bit blurry, try making a pinhole with your thumb and index finger wrapped in a circle, and look through it at the blurry object. It should become clearer (but the trade off is that it will be less bright).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, it's not exactly a weird old convention. F-stops are calculated by dividing the focal length of the lens by the diameter of the opening in the aperture (pupil).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number#Stops,_f-stop_conventions,_and_exposure" target="_blank">There's actually a ton of math that goes into f-stops</a> if you really read into it all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically, the aperture of the lens is f/f-stop: focal length divided by f-stop. e.g. f/2.8 is the actual setting, not 2.8. Since the stop number is in the denominator, obviously, a large stop makes a smaller aperture and a smaller stop makes a larger aperture.</p>
<p>Other bit of trivia: why the oddball f-stop numbers? 2.8? 4.0? 11? Well, the sequence of &quot;natural&quot; f-stops is 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22. You just might notice that those are all power of square root(2). sqroot(2) \^ 0 = 1, sqroot(2) \^ 1 = 1.4, sqroot(2) \^ 2 = 2, and so on. O.K. then why powers of square root (2)? And why focal length divided by these odd numbers? Well, the area of a circle is pi * r \^ 2. So, each step in the sequence will double the aperture, which is the size of the circle. The whole point of defining this based on f / f-stop, was that in the beginning, all exposure was manual. You wanted to be able to pick the amount of light regardless of the length of the lens. (A longer tube lets in less light, just like a smaller circular hole lets in less light.) So, the beauty of this system is that the photographer could get the same light at f/4 regardless of the length (zoom) of lens he was using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, I can actually answer this one. </p>
<p>Changing the aperture size doesn't result in the image looking different because the lenses in cameras are designed to produce a pupil image at that spot. Think of this as the opposite of a focus: instead of each point in the field of view being focussed at a point in the image, tje light from each point at a pupil fills the entire aperture</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good analogy but I wouldn't say that changing aperture doesn't result in a different looking image - a larger f-stop with all other settings constant will increase the depth of field &amp; reduce the brightness of the image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other answers I have seen discuss this using a framework I am unfamiliar with, so here's my understanding:</p>
<p>There's a kind of camera called a &quot;pinhole camera&quot;.  It has no lenses, it just has a tiny pinhole (&quot;small aperture&quot; or &quot;high f-number&quot;) in front of the sensor.  Due to the pinhole being extremely small in cross-section but somewhat thick/deep, incoming light that isn't &quot;lined up exactly right&quot; gets blocked by the material surrounding the pinhole.  In this way, rather than using a lens to corral and generally organize light, the pinhole simply blocks all light which isn't already &quot;corralled&quot; or &quot;organized&quot; well enough.</p>
<p>So when you raise the f-stop, you make your camera get closer to this theoretical pinhole setup.  This in general makes things &quot;less challenging&quot; for the rest of the system, partly because it doesn't have to try to correct as much &quot;disorganized&quot; light.  Think of the saying &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot;.</p>
<p>This pays off in a big way - you can have more things in focus at once (&quot;increased depth of field&quot;), and imperfections in the lens (e.g. fringing) are reduced.  But it has a cost:  you get a lot less light in, so you need to switch to a higher ISO or expose for longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, you can focus almost the whole scene where the sharpness is acceptable to you. If lens is set to its hyperfocal distance, all objects from half of the hyperfocal distance to infinity will be acceptably sharp.</p>
<p>Edit: Many cameras with manual focus lens in the film era have marks of focal distance on them, mostly for very high F number/ratios. See <a href="https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/07/kit-list-prime-lens.jpg" target="_blank">https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/07/kit-list-prime-lens.jpg</a>. Looking at this image, if you set the F number/ratio to 8 and set to focal distance to infinity, the image is acceptably sharp from 2 meters to infinity (see that scale expand to the right and left?).</p></div>		</li>
