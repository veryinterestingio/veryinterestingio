			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be really bad at keeping plants alive, until my mum gave me some plants she'd kept for me from my grandma... In summer (Australia).  I was so worried that I'd kill my heirloom plants too, I checked on them every day and years later I've got a whole potted garden, so here are some simple plant care tips for beginners.
Start small and easy, cacti/succulents are best.
Check it DAILY (putting it somewhere you'll easily see it helps with that), you don't often need to do anything to it every day but just look it over.
Take note of the plant's basic needs (usually on a label, some want more/less water).
Pay attention to the plant itself. If its looking worse in any way, troubleshoot and change your care methods.
Poke the soil/lift the pot (lighter when soil is drier) to determine if it needs more water, never just assume it does. </p>
<p>GOOD LUCK!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key really is finding plants YOU can keep alive. If youre a forgetful waterer or an overwaterer, if your house is dark or light, if you know anything about soil or bugs... just experiment until something doesn't die then get more with similar needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My partner and I tag team our plants to make sure that they go through periods of drought and  flooding to make sure that they're strong enough to survive extreme conditions.</p>
<p>They aren't. üôÅ Maybe we should coordinate our efforts so that they don't get double watering when they're looking droopy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great tips for beginners, I've got a bunch that are still alive 5 years later from don't these simple suggestions. Also recommend plants that are beautiful and very easy to care for, like devil's ivy and spider plants. Take photos of them when you first get them, so you can refer to the pics and see if leaves are growing, or browning or yellowing or dropping, so you can act accordingly - as well as to compare the growth years later and remember how small the plants were when you first started! That sense of achievement and love for the plants üíö</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clearly you have not seen my lack of green thumb abilities. One of my cacti drowned, the other one dried. Took my dad to resurrect then with some intense pruning(?) and all that other stuff I can't even talk about coz I simply know nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Many of the smaller herb-types aren't too hard to keep alive either, e.g. aloe vera, and it's often mentioned in lists of indoor plants. It's also got uses beyond simply being decorative, which is nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is the sight of plants, a part of our more primal brain feels more at ease when we have plants around.</p>
<p>humans evolved from an ape lineage that started in trees then moved to open land. Foliage around us is comforting because we don‚Äôt feel as exposed. </p>
<p>Plants themselves don‚Äôt really release anything other than smells that could help our mental state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then I wonder how dumb my primal brain is... Like, if I know the plants are fake, but they improve my mental state anyway, how real do they have to look? Could I get my 4-year-old nephew to cut out some leaves from green construction paper and glue them to some sticks?</p></div>		</li>
