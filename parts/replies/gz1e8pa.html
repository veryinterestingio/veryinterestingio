			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember rightly, this v shape and charge for H2O is also why water crystallises when it freezes, and that is why ice is less dense than water, which is not normally the case.</p>
<p>Does the higher mass of the molecule make it require more heat / energy to be gas as well, so even if it weren't for the v shape and charge, it would still have a lower boiling point than oxygen and hydrogen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but Not quite.</p>
<p>All the noble gasses for example, are all gasses at room temperature but the heavier ones freeze at higher temperatures. </p>
<p>Molecule size is one factor, but a bigger factor is how that molecule interacts with other molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually hydrogen does attract itself. Hydrogen gas is H2. Same with oxygen. O2.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When hydrogen is by itself, it isn't attracted to other hydrogen. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It <em>is</em>, as normal hydrogen gas is H2, but it's not a very strong attraction (especially when compared to the attraction between hydrogen and oxygen).</p></div>		</li>
