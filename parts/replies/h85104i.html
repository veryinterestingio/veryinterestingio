<p>Neptune's atmosphere is mainly composed of hydrogen and helium with a touch of methane. Most of the planet, ie 80% of it's mass, is made of a dense super heated mess of icy water, methane and ammonia. Jupiter (and Saturn) is a gas giant and Neptune (and Uranus) is an ice giant, same same but very very different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd be cautious even claiming that, as the historical evidence doesn't entirely support the claim. If you go back in the record, the GRS was first observed in 1685 by Cassini, then after the late 1600s it seemed to just disappear for a century or two as the entire latitude band clouded over - literally no observations of it were made for 175 years, in spite of plenty of telescopes that could easily have seen it. It was only first re-observed in 1869 by Joseph Gledhill, at the time referred to as &quot;Gledhill's Ellipse&quot;. Reference from 1898 <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1898MNRAS..58..488D" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>We currently only have a couple Juno overflights of the GRS with extremely large error bars. It could extend as deep as 3000 km, or it could only be 300 km deep. See <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab1086" target="_blank">Galanti, et al, 2019</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Although it's tempting to compare the GRS to a hurricane, the two are very different. Whether you're talking about a hurricane or just a little rain, storms on Earth are associated with low-pressure systems and they spin in a cyclonic fashion (same direction as the hemisphere is spinning). </p>
<p>The GRS, on the other hand, is a high-pressure system that spins in an anti-cyclonic fashion (opposite direction as the hemisphere is spinning). The most similar weather phenomenon on Earth is probably closer to an <a href="http://www.theweatherprediction.com/blocking/" target="_blank">Omega Block</a>, an example of which was responsible for the crazy high temperatures in western Canada a couple weeks ago. Like high-pressure systems on Earth, the winds inside the GRS are actually very calm within the interior, with essentially no precipitation - you only get breakneck windspeeds right at the very edge of the vortex, very dissimilar to hurricanes on Earth.</p></div>		</li>
