			<div class="markdown"><p>Apart from the anti-vaxxers having something stupid to talk about, I could see how testing positive for HIV could be a bad thing outside of that. It could certainly ruin some peoples' lives (having to tell others they need to get tested when they don't). It might also make people who would otherwise take a positive test serious less seriously under these circumstances.</p>
<p>But if it only occured right after the vaccine was administered, it really shouldn't be a big deal. Does anyone know how long the false positive happens for after the vaccine is given?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was listening to an ABC radio report and it's a tiny quantity of antibodies compared to what youd see in a person who had a HIV infection. But also they couldn't risk a reduced confidence in the HIV test results. They were working with a team (can't remember the name) who work on the treatment and prevention of HIV because of the technology they were using to develop the vaccine, and that team basically said they can't have a compromise in trust for a HIV test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main problem with it is that if a large portion of the population has this vaccine it means that the HIV test will be returning far more false positives and the HIV screening process is much more complex.</p>
<p>Imagine you have an incident that requires a hiv test and you had this vaccine years prior.</p>
<p>You test positive for HIV but those results are now not conclusive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What breaks my brain is that they tested for HIV at all. They knew it would produce some false positives. Any IND or NDA review board would read how the drug was constructed and know that false-positive HIV tests were likely inevitable, but physically harmless. </p>
<p>This doesn't even qualify for possible drug interactions. The only warning label should come on the HIV assay instructions.</p>
<p>This sounds more like corporate sabotage than anything else. Then again the media did say &quot;hamster derived antibodies&quot; when it was CHO cells in a bag of goo spitting out made-to-order proteins.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>With advice from experts, CSL and UQ have worked through the implications that this
issue presents to rolling out the vaccine into broad populations. It is generally agreed
that significant changes would need to be made to well-established HIV testing
procedures in the healthcare setting to accommodate rollout of this vaccine</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's correct. They knew there was technical possibility, but did not expect it to occur, and certainly not across such a large spectrum of the testees</p></div>		</li>
