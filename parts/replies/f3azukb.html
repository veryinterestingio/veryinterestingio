			<div class="markdown"><p>They're also weird in being clonal colonies. Most trees, each individual trunk is an individual tree. Aspen, every trunk is part of the same, massive organism. You get things like Pando, one of the oldest known living organisms at an estimated 80,000 years old, also being <em>huge</em>, occupying 106 acres and massing 6,600 short tons (making it one of the heaviest known living organisms). It's <em>a forest</em> composed on one single aspen.</p>
<p>Also the bark is photosynthetic as well as the leaves. That's also pretty weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, super fucking weird. They're really good at weathering forest fires because of this - their trunks burn down but the rhizomes are all fine and dandy underground so they just sprout another trunk. Wild stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure where you are in Alabama, but I’m here too and the last few years I haven’t really seen any nice fall foliage. Thanks to droughts and abnormally hot weather the leaves stay green for a while, then a lot goes straight to brown from bad climate conditions. Maybe a bit of yellow near thanksgiving and that’s it. </p>
<p>It makes me sad because when I was younger we always had a few weeks of really lovely reds and oranges and yellows too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Disagree. Even in the dog days of summer or the bleak parts of February (that's all of it), 89 has some beautiful sections in both NH and VT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a road has hills and mountains it will never approach the deadly boredom that is Midwest driving. Driving down Illinois is mind numbing in flatness. Driving through Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota, etc can hypnotize you since you just go straight. It will be a god send once self driving cars arrive to not have to keep a car going straight for 4 hours like I am playing a game of desert bus.</p></div>		</li>
