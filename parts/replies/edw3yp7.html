<p>It doesn't discount your point, but it's worth adding that you <em>can</em> create very long chains and sheets of silicon-based polymers if you alternate the silicon with other atoms like oxygen.  This is the basis for silicone oils and rubbers, silicate minerals, and a ton of other things.  Silicone chemistry might not be <em>quite</em> as rich as carbon chemistry, but it's definitely much more interesting than the average element.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is true. I mentioned that in a different comment.</p>
<p>But that's the real difference between Carbon and everything else: You can make Carbon-Carbon chain molecules of any length, but even the second most chaimable elements, Silicon, Sulfur and Boron are far behind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but a big distinction is that silicates generally are comprised of silicon-oxygen tetrahedra. Sheet or chain silicates occurring in nature aren't simply long Si-Si chains. I can see from your comment (and background) that you know this. I think your comment was missing the point of the distinction.</p>
<p>Carbon can form long chains bonded to hydrogens (consider fats for example). Meanwhile, silicates never form these kinds of structures. In nature silicon almost exclusively bonds to oxygen (some time hydroxides or similar substitutes) and typically bonds in four-fold coordination.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But it'll decompose on its own, making random shorter chain fragments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be he means that when you have all of those elements combined, their  Electro negativity is shared and so electro negative that it is unstable. Those negative bits hate being near one another and will do just about anything to break apart. Meanwhile in a carbon chain, any saturation of hydrogen will   Essentially mitigate the carbons charge making the entire molecule have a electro negativity of close to 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's many many years since I studied chemistry but if I remember correctly the reason for the lack of stability of Si-Si bonds was more to do with non-bonding interactions with the p orbitals. I seem to remember that in silicon because the oribals are further from the nucleus they spread out more so can interact with the orbitals of the next silicon in the chain. The net result is that the bond becomes stretched reducing the stability of the molecule. As more silicon atoms are added to the chain the molecule needs to stretch more and more to accommodate the additional interactions. A chain of silicon and oxygen works because the orbitals of the oxygen basically sneak underneath.</p>
<p>Hmmm I read that back through and I think p orbitals should read spÂ³ hybridised orbitals but you get the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. The 3p orbitals of Silicon are overlapping far worse than the 2p orbitals in carbon.</p>
<p>And hybridisation between 3s and 3p orbitals is also worse than hybridisation between 2s and 2p.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean they can't hybridise in silicon, just that they'll be quite unstable, as Disilene and Disilyne show.</p></div>		</li>
