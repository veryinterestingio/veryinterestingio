			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. The size difference between the male and female is quite surprising, and the way that the male injects semen into the female's <em>blood stream</em> after latching onto her with its mouth and <em>fusing their bodies together</em>, it just seems like an odd way to mate. Like some sort of kinky, vampiric, parasitic... <em>thing</em> (I've run out of adjectives). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to tell people about the Angler fish randomly. I don't know why but that's just so fascinating to me. It's just so... Knowing that there are species of animals that the male literally gives his life to breed is just... so messed up. Now I'm not sure if this is what OP meant or not but like... In the deep dark depths of the sea where these often weird and fascinatingly scary looking creatures lurk... They can't see and therefore hunt using other senses and tactics. So say I'm a female Angler fish and I want to find a mate... How would I go about finding him? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The female angler fish also gives her life to breed. It's not like swimming around for food and laying eggs is some sort of deep self-actualization. Breeding is for all intends and purposes the telos of all life forms, with the <em>possible</em> exception of humans, ostensibly capable of overriding this and creating other permanent meaninful things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only meaningful in that we have assigned meaning to them. Evolutionarily, even to us, the only thing that matters is perpetuating the lineage. I'd say that things like not wanting kids, homosexuality, sterility, etc all have a place in society on an evolutionary level as forms of natural population control, to help maintain a sustainable population size. We can say &quot;we're better than that&quot; until the cows come home, but even when/if we expand beyond earth and colonize other planets, in the end it's all just so we have more space for babymaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually the opposite, as the male seeks out the female. How they do so varies by species though, but mostly it’s by a really, really good sense of smell.</p></div>		</li>
