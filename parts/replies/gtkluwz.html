			<div class="markdown"><p>For energy storage, it has been identified as a key to climate change mitigation. Globally, only 3% of power capacity is being stored. The energy storage capacity needs to be doubled or tripled in 10-20 years. To realize this, we need low-cost and high-efficiency energy storage technologies. With the cost decreasing and energy density increasing, lithium-ion batteries should still dominate the energy storage sector in the future. </p>
<p>I think for biomass, it is necessary to broaden the response to carbon, where will you find your carbon in 10-20 years? Initially, you will see waste carbon play a key role as a source of carbon because it solves another problem—our landfills and too much carbon left in forests and fields. Later, you may see bioenergy purpose grown sustainable resources. At 20 years and beyond, you will see utilization of carbon dioxide . </p>
<p>It is very optimistic for lasting for a few days more by increasing energy density of batteries and  decreasing the energy consuming of the electronic devices.</p></div>		</li>
