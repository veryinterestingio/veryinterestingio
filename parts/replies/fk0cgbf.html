			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This works for almost every wavelength. X-Ray would be another application that uses high energy EMR that penetrates matter with respect to its density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Imagine if you had a red-colorblind friend who needed to tell red green and orange apart for their job. So you make a camera that shows all three as something your friend can actually tell apart. You know your friend has nothing to worry about if the red looks like a brownish yellow and the green like a greyish blue, so you choose those colors.</p>
<p>Sure it's not the real hue, but it gets the job done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The camera in most cases also uses a sensor called a charge-coupled device. Firstly, the photoelectric effect is when light with enough punch hits a metal surface and it causes the metal to eject an electron. A CCD is based on this principle. It’s essentially divided into “pixels” which work seperately and transfer their built up free electrons one by one into a “converter” to give a voltage. The voltage is then used to determine what the energy (thus colour) of the light rays were which ejected the specific bunch of electrons. Barcode scanners, cameras and satellites used by NASA are examples of devices which use CCDs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not true of IR cameras. CCDs don't work well for the required wavelengths (the bandgap of common semiconductors is too big for the lower-energy IR to overcome). I worked with a physicist who helped invent this stuff back in the day. IR cameras use an array of microscopic thermometers called bolometers. They are tiny resistors, and the resistance changes with temperature, so it can be measured.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Evolutionarily speaking, that's likely not a coincidence. Being able to see at frequencies emitted by the sun would be a useful adaptation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no microchip doing calculus. Light hits a semiconductor that produces an electron, the more light the more electrons. Then the electrons are moved, which represents an electrical current. The more current, the more light that part of the semiconductor saw. You can create an image in this way, be it for visible or infrared light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all thermographic devices work that way. Some are based on microbolometers, which are tiny little heat-sensitive resistors. Each pixel has it's own resistor, and as the resistor heats up it becomes more conductive. You measure the conductivity by putting applying a known voltage or current and measuring the response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has nothing to do with realtime calculus and it is not coming from the microchip either. This mapping from intensity values in an image to RGB values in the screen is the same as in a visible range image, the computer knows nothing about if the values are coming from an infrared or a visible light detector.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya kinda have to do that anyway. The computer has to process the image and make it work with pixels and approximate RGB values and all that anyway. All you have to do is map various wavelengths differently.</p></div>		</li>
