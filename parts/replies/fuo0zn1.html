<p>Illinois was formed out of a territory known as the Northwest Territory which spawned several states in what became the Midwest; the school is named after that because the school's founders wanted to serve the populations of those states. But, by the time the school was actually founded in 1851, the US already stretched to the Pacific and California was already a state.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Canada still has a Northwest Territories and it's etymology is the same the US's and has a similar history of provinces being formed from it.</p></div>		</li>
