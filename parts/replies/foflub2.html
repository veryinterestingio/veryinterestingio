			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is pumped hydro requires very specific landscaping that doesn't widely exist.  You need 2 reservoirs at 2 different elevations within close proximity to each other.  Not many geographical areas allow this, and creating them is an environmental impact itself,  its why building hydroelectric dams went out of fashion.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Hydroelectric dams went out of fashion because we've dammed up most of the water we could use for power generation that's worth using.  Because of water usage issues, you have places like Lake Mead/Powell/Havasu that are now getting lower each year and (in the case of Powell) consider being removed.</p></div>		</li>
