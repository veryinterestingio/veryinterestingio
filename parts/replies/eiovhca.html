<p>I do know that massaging the fascia near my Adam’s apple and hyoid bone causes an immediate “release” and resolves a bit of the globus feeling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this!!! It is exasperated by anxiety and became a severe issue as a music major with vocal performance anxiety. I have never understood why my throat would seize up in times of intense anxiety and prevent me from controlling my singing. I changed my major because of it.</p>
<p>Additionally, when I am anxious I gag on my food. Basically it’s very difficult for me to swallow certain textures or even large bites when I am extremely emotional.</p>
<p>I’m so happy to finally have a name for this and a direction to go for maintenance. Thank you so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it from anxiety too it sucks! I also have some acid reflex which can cause the sensation which then can set off my anxiety and lead me into a panic attack because surely my throat is closing in on me. I have trouble swallowing when my anxiety is up too. I end up taking really small bites.  </p></div>		</li>
