			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember having it happen a few times when I was a kid growing up in Muskegon, MI. Our house was only a couple miles from the lake. We had a huge window in our living room, and I remember my parents turning our couch around so we could all snuggle on it together while drinking hot chocolate and watching the snow come down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a thundersnow in Mississippi and it blew my lil southern mind. I just kept thinking, &quot;I didn't even know it could DO that!&quot; And then I trotted down to the major intersection in town and watched all the clueless drivers slowly, gracefully slam into one another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in southern Alabama a decade or two ago for what Boston would call a 2-3 inch &quot;dusting&quot;.    In Boston, that level of snow would barely be noted, and it would effect nothing.  </p>
<p>Being northeastern folks visiting relatives, we thought absolutely nothing of it and merrily jumped in a car to run an errand.  It looked like the apocalypse hit.  I've lived in cold weather my entire life, but the dusting I saw in Alabama had more cars off the road than I have ever seen.  Everywhere cars were off the road and crashing into each other.   I literally watched a dozen accidents in the short trip we took.  You just don't understand how many accidents I saw.  Every intersection was a pile of fender benders and spun out cars.  I'm not exaggerating.  Every place where two cars could find a way to hit each other or fly off the road, they did.  A state of emergency was declared, and everything shut down.  It was amazing.</p>
<p>If it didn't do so much damage and (presumably) hurt so many people, I'd say it was hilarious.  We had no trouble driving in it.  The biggest danger was other people, and even then, because you knew the mistakes they were going to make, you could help them out by slow down well before intersections.  The thing that fucks people up on snow is that they think they are fine, they hit the breaks, and nothing happens.  They panic and slam the breaks.  Nothing continues to happen.  They freak out because they are going to hit someone and so, while breaking, turn.  Turning while breaking on ice puts your car into a spin.  You could watch it happen over and over and over. Break lights come on and off a few times as they figure out they are screwed.  Then, as panic rises, the break lights then stay on for a few seconds... and then the car goes into a slow spin continuing to move in the same direction, turning a fender bender into a very impressive side impact into someone's rear (I feel like that should be an achievement).  It's the classic &quot;oh shit, I don't know how to drive on ice&quot; maneuver.</p>
<p>For what's worth, if that ever happens to you, DO NOT EVER TURN WHILE BREAKING.  Take your foot off the break while turning.  Just steer very, very, very gently around obstacles.  You can try breaking only while moving straight.  Break or steer; don't do both, you will spin and be fucked.  If you have fucked yourself and can't stop and can't drive out of the way, just hit whatever you are going to hit squarely.  STAY IN THE FUCKING CAR AFTER YOU HIT.  The guy behind you is going to do the same thing and hit you.  The guy behind him is going to hit both you.  You are going to get hit over and over again.  The safest place to be is in a steel box designed to take impacts.  If there isn't a truck behind you moving at 60 mph, you will be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve experienced it once, and it was actually this season. I live in north Texas, so our weather is bizarre anyway, but it really was an amazing phenomenon. Thunder and lightning while snowing really throws off your internal sense of weather patterns.</p></div>		</li>
