			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that while the Cavendish experiment can be used to determine G, (and it's entirely fair to credit him for doing so), strictly speaking he never actually did so and the gravitational constant wasn't even a really a concept at that time. </p>
<p>Cavendish's calculation was expressed in terms of the density of the earth, with the mass of the earth the only unknown. When he refers his goal for the experiment as 'weighing the world', he's being quite literal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>G is the fundamental constant with the most uncertainty currently, which is a reflection of just how difficult it is to measure. That the Cavendish experiment could get as close as it did at that time was pretty amazing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea it's mean density. The effect due to changes in density is tiny due to the sheer size of the planet and relative weakness of gravity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that experiment in college.  It was fun to see it all in action, but it was also quite tedious to take all of the measurements.  Me and my partner got really close to the accepted number for G.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool! It’s a very difficult experiment for undergrad students to do well because of how tedious the data collection is. So difficult in fact I’ve started using a computer sim.  Makes you respect these scientists even more considering what equipment they had available to them at the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We also have another bonus: we know it works! They were learning as they went.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rad, I did the experiment for the electrostatic force. The entire experiment is basically identical, except you just put a voltage across two conducting spheres. Since the electric force is much larger it's a far easier experiment. We ended up getting within 4% of the actual value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment" target="_blank">Schiehallion Experiment</a> as a fairly successful early experiment to determine the mass of the earth. It preceded Cavendish by 25 years.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Schiehallion is a mountain in central Scotland which has an unusually symmetrical shape, which meant it was possible to calculate the volume of the mountain fairly accurately. They then measured &quot;the tiny deflection of the vertical due to the gravitational attraction of [the] nearby mountain&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That experiment was out by 20% because it was based on faulty assumptions of the structure of the Earth. It was an important experiment in Geology because any theory of the Earths structure needs to explain why the results were so awful.</p></div>		</li>
