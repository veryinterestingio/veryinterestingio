<p>Short answer: the tax code was written by rich people to benefit rich people.</p>

<p>And for some reason we keep electing super rich people to lead our governments and for some reason we expect this to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We keep electing super rich people because you need to be super rich to run for office. It costs hundreds of thousands to add you name to a ballot in each state, let alone actual campaign costs. Even if you get good sponsors and a party it still costs candidates significant amounts to run. Of course those amounts are also tax deductible lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like it's time for a revolution.</p>
<p>Didn't we have a war about &quot;taxation without representation?&quot;</p>
<p>Seems like the poor people aren't being represented here in a system where in order to become the representation, you must already be rich. Sure sounds like &quot;in order to become the representation, you must be in Britian/be British.&quot;</p>
<p>The only thing poor people can hope for is to make enough money to become the rich. Then they become the type of people who want less taxes for the rich because they want to protect their money.</p>
<p>Of course, the counter argument is &quot;Well all the poor people vote for these rich people.&quot; But who picked the people to vote for in the first place? Other... rich people? In order to be voted for you must already be rich, so the pool of people to vote for will always consist of rich people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have read it more closely... there is a deduction. It only applies to the rental income for the rental property for which there is a mortgage, though, not your overall income. I break even on mine, so in my mind it became no deduction. Sorry about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re thinking of a primary residence vs a second residence.  Property taxes on a business property (including rentals) are certainly deductible.</p>
<p>Edit:  oops. Interest. Not taxes.</p></div>		</li>
