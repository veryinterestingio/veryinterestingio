			<div class="markdown"><p>While not quite the same as what you're describing, the term for that in economics is Pareto efficiency if anyone's interested.</p>

<p>Or for macroeconomic growth, steady state (which there isn't a good wiki for but you can just search Solow/rbc/dsge steady state).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought Pareto efficiency and inefficiency referred to when a game has 2 pure strategy equilibria, but one is less beneficial than the other (the Pareto inefficient equilibrium) and the other is more beneficial (the Pareto efficient equilibrium), as in the case of Rousseau's Stag Hunt. </p>
<p>The ESS the parent comment mentions sounds more like Nash equilibrium, unless I'm misunderstanding what they're saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I didn't really understand what ESS was, so that's why I said it's different from what they're describing.</p>
<p>Pareto efficiency in microeconomics just means that no agent can do better without hurting others. Strong Nash equilibrium implies Pareto efficiency (not sure if we can say iff), and IIRC as the market tends large (N -&gt; infinity) the core converges to the unique Pareto efficient Nash equilibrium. Anyways, I don't know what ESS is so I didn't really get their example but this is what I think relates to their example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard a term for it, but the same theory is discussed in biology. You can have multiple ESS's, and the population will tend to follow the first stable system of strategies that it arrives at, even if there is a more beneficial stable system elsewhere. This is because the points between the first system and the second system are unstable so the population will be pressured back the the first system before reaching the second system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you hate reading, here's a neat little video that shows this concept visually using simulations:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/YNMkADpvO4w" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/YNMkADpvO4w</a></p>
<p>It's more from an evolutionary perspective than an economics standpoint, but still applicable Imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that's for market economies... there's nothing stopping countries from shutting down the market and running a planned economy for half a year or so using emergency powers. Rationing and civilian service are things that exist. If the crisis persists the damage caused by this may be preferable to the alternative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yeah. Well put and it really shows the interconnectedness of all things that you can reference biology to explain economics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is possible because economics is a set of abstract representations of biological processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think it’s a very clear link! </p>
<p>I’m not sure what the word for this school of thought is, but I’m very convinced that “realities” of the world explain a great portion of why our systems developed like that did.</p>
<p>I guess “materialist” is the school of thought. Biology/logic. If we assume organisms have a will to survive/reproduce, that explains scarcity. Only so many resources to go around for so many animals to survive. Economics is finding a way to distribute scarce resources. To me, it is nearly a direct link.</p>
<p>Game theory/logic is the part that explains how if we all try to be nice, any one person will have a crazy incentive to deviate.</p></div>		</li>
