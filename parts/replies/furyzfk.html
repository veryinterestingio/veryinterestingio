			<div class="markdown"><p>See my comment to the OP. The reason why the boarders of your nails hurt sometimes is because that’s where most of your pain receptors are. It doesn’t hurt having nails initially because your nails are to protect the tops of your finger tips and helps with opening things. Armor isn’t supposed to hurt you. It’s supposed to protect you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh. Sounds awesome. There’s some people who say that nails aren’t for protection, but I learned them to be like armor for the finger tips, but it’s really just monkey claws. They’re useful, but I don’t remember a lot of my biology.</p></div>		</li>
