			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually leave my coat on the rack at the front door, but this 1 night I took it off in my bedroom. I was dreaming and something felt off in it, in the dream I was in my bedroom looking at the door, it opened slightly and a person came running through, I woke up instantly and in a split second I jumped at my coat hanging on the door. </p>
<p>The door must of opened a bit more while I was sleeping casting a shadow or something and my brain was like &quot;There's someone in here FIGHT!&quot; My wrist hurt for days as I slammed it into the door handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Experts disagree but I believe that at least in part, dreams are a crucial survival mechanism for adapting to new circumstances and using recent memories and information to adapt to new threats and opportunities.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason that we see such vast variety of the worst of things in our dreams is a nightly review of the worst possible scenarios in the future.</p>
<p>The transition from a dream back to waking consciousness is sometimes the scariest, most unsettling thing of all.</p>
<p>People talk about the idea we only exist inside a simulation, but when you wake from a dream, you get confronted with how unclear and confusing our reality is.</p>
<p>Accepting that confusion and embracing my fears has helped me a lot.  </p>
<p>Still gotta remember to hang up my coat though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brainchild’s Sleep episode covered this (kids show on Netflix but great for all ages). They suggested some dreams are basically practise runs for RL scenarios that could cause us problems. Clearly doesn’t have to be literal scenarios but similar themes. Fascinating theory, ties in with what you suggested too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminded me of something that happened the other day.</p>
<p>I was watching a YouTube video, and all of a sudden I heard a loud knocking on my wall.
I ran out to see who the fuck was knocking.</p>
<p>No one.</p>
<p>Turned out, the YouTube video had a skit with the guy banging on a door and saying something.
The sound was just soo good, and perfectly placed on the one ear, that I didn't realize it came from the PC.</p></div>		</li>
