			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, but could be even better if it connects bangs per time to RPMs and the time required to achieve high RPM to the time required to deliver high torque.</p>
<p>If you agree, feel free to steal or adapt the suggestion below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get torque up on a petrol engine, you need more bangs per time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... which requires the engine to spin faster. If you've seen an RPM gauge on a car before, it shows how fast the engine spins. It takes time for the engine to spin up to get lots of bangs per time and deliver lots of torque.</p></div>		</li>
