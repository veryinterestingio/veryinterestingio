			<div class="markdown"><p>I will always, ALWAYS upvote ranked choice voting awareness. There's a lot of voter reform crap that can be done, but ranked choice voting is IMO the single greatest thing that could happen to democracy in the USA. </p>
<p>Currently, if you're voting for a candidate that isn't from the 2 major parties you have to play mental gymnastics with yourself of whether you want to vote for who you want or if you want your vote to matter. It's a pretty lame game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing that video and now seeing it was 9 years ago it was posted. The main problem obviously with this video is that there's no one impartial in charge that wants the best for the voters (lion). Instead, the gorilla/leopard are in charge and have no motivation to make it easier for other parties to have more power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like u/ta1e9 said, it would be extremely useful in the primaries.</p>
<p>In the short to medium term, I disagree that it would make much difference in the actual election cycle. It would take many elections before it will have a real impact on reducing the typical two party outcome.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The US isn't a 2 party system because of a specific law or agreement.</p>
<p>The 2 party system is a natural consequence to our voting system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We didn’t choose this stupid system. The mathematics behind voting systems literally had not been worked out when we set ours up because it was the First Nation-wide attempt at representative democracy. Every other western democracy spent the next 100-200 years ironing out their system based not only on ours but also on all the many failed systems that happened during that period. We’ve just been insulated from change, by our incredible size, our oceans protecting us from land wars, and our system being intentionally difficult to radically change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't want to vote you can either show up and pop in an empty ballot or cop a $50 fine. I didn't like it when I was younger but forcing me to go did help me learn the parties and issues they stand for.</p></div>		</li>
