			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually 94% fewer “events” but it depends on how events were defined. I believe in at least one of the trials it was symptomatic cases so it would be 94% fewer symptomatic cases in the vaccine group versus the placebo group. It all depends how they were defining an “event” as well as even how they were defining “efficacy” but that would be the standard definition of efficacy in this scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sounds fishy, but is biologically fair though. If you catch a virus that your body is familiar with, it doesn't mean your cells won't reproduce any of them, it just means your body will respond to the infection faster - typically fast enough you won't even notice you're infected, and before you've made enough virus to test positive. </p>
<p>In those cases an infected vaccinated person <em>might</em> test positive, even though  they would fight off the infection before it develops to the point where they feel symptoms or shedding enough to transmit it.  In that case counting symptoms instead of positive test results makes more sense - if you got infected, but fought it off before feeling sick or passing it on, does that really count?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the question still remains if you don’t develop symptoms can you still pass it along? Currently evidence is strongly yes, although asymptomatic because of vaccination and asymptomatic because immune system/luck/etc are somewhat different</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I don't believe that is true.   In the Pfizer test at least a reduction of symptoms was considered a positive outcome. </p>
<p>It's a weakness in the testing that many have pointed out.  The sample group was not regularly tested for virus, only tested if symptoms appear.  So if asymptomatic infection is actually a thing, as we are told it is, we aren't measuring the fall in &quot;cases&quot; as they are usually measured, but symptomatic cases which by estimates are 20-50%. </p>
<p>This is where the &quot;you have to wear a mask after you are vaccinated&quot; line is coming from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I beleive this is also why the Oxford vaccine efficacy number is lower because they tested people every 2 weeks, or something like that, whether or not they showed symptoms. So the figures are hard to compare across these vaccines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pfizer/Moderna vaccines only were checking &quot;Ill enough to get a test&quot;, so it's possible some of the high immunity rates is cases that would have symptoms becoming asymptomatic.</p>
<p>However, The Oxford vaccine also tested you weekly for asymptomatic cases (at least the UK branch did) and they found that their vaccine also reduced asymptomatic cases in the group, by a lower amount  (IIRC it was 50% reduction in number of asymptomatic cases in the vaccinated group, vs 62% reduction in symptomatic.) So hopefully asymptomatic cases for the Pzifer vaccine will also be reduced, but we can't confirm it.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Ill enough to get a test. That's what the studies watched as primary outcome.</p>
<p>At least one of the studies also released results about severe cases where the number went down a lot, too, but there the statistics is much lower so we don't know if they went down 80%, 90%, 98% or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for replying, but I'm not sure that answers my question. What I meant was, even in those who still get covid, do they have some level of protection at least, or does it simply not work for them at all? Are they protected more from getting severely sick and ending up in hospital, compared to a non vaccinated person, or does it make no difference? Apologies if I've misunderstood anything.</p></div>		</li>
