			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d also add that the reason they didn’t care about high resolution that much at the time is that old <del>480P</del> 480i CRT TVs were limited to a low resolution and 4:3 aspect ratio regardless of what the video was shot at.</p>
<p>In fact if you watch a 90s movie or play a 90s video game on a TV from that era, it’ll look a lot better than on a modern set, as it doesn’t have to stretch out the pixels to make them fit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is especially true of low-res sprite-based games, because the lower resolution of the older TVs actually caused the pixels that make up the sprites to sort of blur and blend a little bit, which made them look better. </p>

<p>EDIT: Oh wow. Didnt expect this to get this much attention. Thanks for the awards and all that, nice people. :)</p>
<p>Also, according to what multiple people have said in this thread, many emulators DO have a filter or function that can replicate this effect to make older games look the way they originally did, but I dont know any specifics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the thinking was why spend the money capturing high quality images for a crap playback device?</p></div>		</li>

<p>576i if it was made in the UK</p>
<p>We actually had really old TVs where they had a button where you could switch between the two, dunno if you had that over there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interlacing is also an important factor in why old footage looks bad on LCDs. CRT TVs display the interlaced footage directly: they show the odd rows, then the even rows. LCDs on the other hand need to display whole frames at once. If you only have interlaced video, you have to deinterlace it. This is a hard problem. Odd and even rows cannot be easily paired as they are slightly delayed in time compared to each other. Unless you use a fancy complex algorithm for deinterlacing, the output will be fuzzy.</p>
<p>Edit: Since this got popular, let me share a great video by Dr. Steve Bagley at Computerphile: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCUjvK-zbHw" target="_blank">The Interlaced Video Problem</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I was a kid, consumer VHS and Beta was just taking off and very expensive, but a lot of people still had their 8 and 16mm projectors. </p>
<p>Let's just say, my friends and I learned how to use a projector at a rather young age because of 8 and 16mm porno reels. And we could set up and tear down a projector and screen in about the time it took for our parents to turn the corner of our street, park the car and unlock the door...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tape itself was not dirt cheap, and neither were the cameras for it in the early days of that technology. But it is way more convenient to review footage on tape instead of having to get film developed to see what you captured. The cost of developing film makes it more expensive than it appeared at first (so the physical materials and process for tape might indeed be cheaper), but the convenience of tape is likely where the biggest savings were, it made the overall filming and production of a movie more cost effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Video was orders of magnitude less expensive to produce, since you could look at the material recorded <em>immediately</em>, whereas film needed to be shipped to a lab to develop and would take hours to days to process.</p>
<p>The material cost of the film itself wasn't important, but the time between recording and reviewing/editing was hugely expensive, as it pushes out the recording schedule, and making a movie takes an army of actors, unionized film industry professionals, assistants, caterers, equipment rental, catering costs, accommodation if you're filming on location, logistics, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Another reason film looks better is because film is a better archival format. Video tape is magnetic, and is therefore much less stable than chemically altered film. Film also degrades if kept in incorrect conditions, but you could bury a betamax (most video-taping operations used betamax before digital cameras took over) tape in a lead-lined climate controlled bunker under a mountain, and it would still de-magnetize over time.</p></div>		</li>
