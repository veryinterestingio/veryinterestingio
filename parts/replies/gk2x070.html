			<div class="markdown"><p>About 10 C (50 F) is when I go from shorts and tshirt to jeans and a non-insulated jacket. Winter jacket comes on at below freezing. Longjohns are only needed if I'm being outside for longer than an hour in below -20 C (-4 F) or something. I haven't used snow pants since I was 12 years old or so.</p>
<p>However if the temperature is above 25 C (77 F) I'm suffering even in shorts and no shirt, and above 30 C (86 F) I can't function as a human being...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is one of the interesting arguments in favor of the imperial system. Namely, that it's calibrated for &quot;human scale&quot; - 0 is damn cold, 100 is damn hot. It gets a bit more contrived with some of the other units of measure though...</p></div>		</li>
