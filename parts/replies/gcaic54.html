			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Noticed my pet was drinking more water and peeing more this last week so I took him to the vet. Diabetes!  We caught it so soon though that  it's had no effect on the rest of his health yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m glad you caught it soon enough to help your pet.  I hope theyâ€™re able to make a full recovery.</p>
<p>Sadly, we didnâ€™t catch it soon enough for my cat.  I noticed in late October that he was peeing more and drinking more, but I didnâ€™t bring him to the vet because he just had a lot of bloodwork done in late September which all seemed normal.  By the time I brought him in on November 2 because he was acting lethargic, they said there was nothing that could be done for him.</p>
<p>So I guess my advice is to be more trusting of your intuition when you get the feeling that something might be wrong or is abnormal, even if they just had a check up a month earlier with everything looking good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have my cats on a Wellness Plan through Banfield. It was a blessing for caring for my cat as she aged. We were able to document her weight loss and a mass in her abdomen along with making sure that she was active enough. Her fluid and food intake/output were okay. And when it was time, we knew and the vet didn't try to talk us into any kind of treatment because they were on the same page. I never had to pay for the office visits and it was such a weight off my mind knowing I could just take her to the vet. I know not everyone has the opportunity to do that but I was very thankful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the Dr. Said something similar to me, she was surprised I'd brought him in so quickly. She said most of the time that the pets have diabetes, they come in because the owners have noticed a lot of weight lost and some they.. can't do much for. I'm sorry to hear about your cat, that's just heartbreaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get a second opinion. </p>
<p>Some vets work in mixed practices, they donâ€™t see so many cats (20-40%) so have less experience at diagnostics and, importantly, treatment. </p>
<p>This happens for cats quite a lot, but because most vets see dogs more often they donâ€™t know as much as a cat focused, or cat only clinic. </p>
<p>Obviously, sometimes it doesnâ€™t help. </p>
<p>Heard about a case recently where a cat had a horrible problem with one of its toes. Vet checked toe out. Then recommend chest x-rays. Suspicion confirmed, cat has cancer.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You had good luck catching it like that. My in-laws found out because he looked dizzy, and minutes later had a seizure. He had a large backyard to himself, so they didn't saw him peeing. After that he lived 10 more years with daily shots of insulin, and died of unrelated causes at the tender age of 18. Blind and with almost no teeth but with blood sugar in check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good Vets are extremely sensitive to little changes in behavior, like how animals shift their weight or how they hold their tail. It isn't an exact science, but it's pretty dang close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog recently herniated a disc in her back and just by how she was holding her leg and tail, the vet knew exactly which disc was affected. I wasn't even guessing it was a back problem until they said so (I thought she ate something she shouldn't and was struggling to pass it). But sure enough, the injury progressed and she ended up paralyzed and needing surgery. She came through great and has almost all her mobility back just two weeks later. I was thoroughly impressed with the vets' ability to diagnose the problem correctly very early on, which certainly led to her positive outcome. </p>
<p>Anecdotal, but the most recent example of many. Vets really have an impressive ability to read the body language and posture of animals. Very grateful for their training and dedication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not good at many things in life, but animal behaviour is one thing I am good at. Reading the subtle signs in animal body posture is one of the most important things. If we miss a subtle sign that a dog is nervous and don't muzzle it, we can end up getting bit. Or being able to tell that a dog is a &quot;less is more&quot; regarding restraint; basically my normal restraint would make them panic where as a light hand and minimal head restraint would be a lot better and make them far less stressed. </p>
<p>Cats are my favorite because they tend to be more subtle and show less warning signs. I give cats their sedation (high volume spay/neuter clinic) and I need to be able to tell is this cat fine? Is this cat a freeze in place and not react cat? Or is this a cat that is going to try and attack me when I poke them? This vastly changes how I poke them and what method i use.</p>
<p>Its a fun job, and I love being the go to person for weird dogs and fractious cats. Makes me feel like I'm useful in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side, a couple years ago our toddler like leaned or laid on our dog wrong and hurt her back and she was completely paralyzed in her back legs. </p>
<p>The vet strongly recommended an $8,000 surgery as her only hope and then backtracked and said it was still only a roughly 1 in 4 chance she would ever walk again. Or we could try crating her and seeing if she would heal but they didn't think it would work and recommended we schedule euthanasia if we weren't going to do the surgery. </p>
<p>We got a second opinion from another vet and they told us pretty much the same thing, but was willing to prescribe her some steroids to help the healing if we wanted to try crating her, but we'd most likely end up having to put her down. </p>
<p>We tried crating her and put her on the steroids. We had to rig a little harness around her back end to hold her up when we took her out and she was miserable the whole time, but she pulled through after around 4 months and has been perfectly fine ever since.</p>
<p>Edit: if anyone wants to see the girl, here she is all cuddled up in her bed with her blanket. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Cdr6Vgv" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/Cdr6Vgv</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a veterinary critical care nurse, hearing such kind words like these means more than you know. Our industry is hurting and people who work in vet med, more often than not, are absolutely miserable. Veterinarians carry the highest suicide rate of any profession. Our doctors are brilliant and no less capable than human doctors. The divide is ugly and itâ€™s time for that to change. </p>
<p>Please lead with respect when dealing with your vet docs. Theyâ€™re paid 1/3 of the amount for nearly double the work. Pet insurance is still in its primary stages, use it people. I assure you none of the vet nurses or doctors are banking on your dogs diseases. Weâ€™re grossly underpaid. </p>
<p>But we love your animals like our own. We hold them, heal them, grieve for them &amp; celebrate when they make it through. We serve the ones who canâ€™t speak for themselves. Much love ðŸ’•</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough, thatâ€™s a great way to evaluate if you have a decent therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist. Do they notice little changes in your behavior and do they ask you about them? You changed the shade of your hair color? A good mental health professional should notice and ask about it in a nice conversational way. They may be able to spot a behavior trending in a way that isnâ€™t good and they should at least discuss it with the patient. (Itâ€™d be negligent not to.) A psychiatrist and patient may even agree to tweak the medication regiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tried that, but it's like my dog can tell when I'm trying to film her. However, she's very food-motivated, so, when I brought her in once because she was limping, and she refused to walk at all so the vet could see exactly what was going on, I pulled out a few of her treats I had brought with me and handed them to the vet. The vet then walked across the room, squatted, and held out the treats. My dog instantly stood up and hobbled over to the vet.</p></div>		</li>
