			<div class="markdown"><p>Important qualifier...*sour* pickling doesn't add anything with any calorie value. Salt, vinegar, spices, etc. have no calories to speak of so they don't alter the calories of the pickle.</p>
<p>Not so for sweet pickles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guess it would depend on what is considered a spice? black pepper, chili powder, cinnamon, garlic powder, onion powder and the like <a href="https://www.calories.info/food/herbs-spices" target="_blank">all have calories</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but just like with cucumbers, it's all about the serving size.</p>
<p>If you eat a teaspoon of black pepper, sure, that's 5 Calories. But in very few situations are you going to get a full teaspoon of black pepper, so the Calorie contribution of black pepper is often negligible.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that cucumbers have 1/25 the number of Calories for the same mass (i.e., 100g of cucumber has about 10 Calories while 100g of black pepper has 250 Calories)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They contain vitamins and are low in caloric density. Those two things together make them a healthy snack, for sure. There are better veggies to eat, but if you're hungry between meals, eating some sliced cucumber is definitely a healthy choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is healthy too. People say you need to drink a certain amount of pure water every day but that just isn't true. Water is water. If your &quot;water&quot; also happens to be full of vitamins and dietary fiber and other good stuff, even better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cucumbers have a generally low nutritional content to go along with their low content of basically everything else. If you're looking for a low calorie option for something to munch on they aren't a bad choice, but you'll need to be getting you nutrients somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>
