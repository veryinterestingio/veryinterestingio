			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I never would have guessed that better hygiene can actually cause more diseases. It shows how counterintuitive some complex things are.</p>
<p>Has something been done to prevent something like this happening in the future (such as making sure we're not over-cleaning our homes)?</p>
<p>I've also heard that allergies may also be caused by better hygiene, though for some reason no one is really doing anything about it (more and more people are getting allergies and there is no prevention effort going on).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably worth remembering that polio is actually a relatively mild virus given the cultural boogeyman it has become. <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/poliomyelitis" target="_blank">Only about 0.5% of people who are infected with polio develop any kind of paralysis at all, and a very substantial fraction of the people who have any degree of paralysis fully recover. About 75% of infections are asymptomatic, and about 25% have generic symptoms similar to those of a cold (fever, sore throat, headache, etc.).</a> Polio is an enterovirus, closely related to a bunch of other viruses that cause disease in humans, mostly limited to colds (for example, rhinoviruses are in the same genus) but occasionally more serious. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016817020500122X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">The fact that it gets into and damages the nervous system is sort of an accident, and different strains of polio vary widely in their ability to damage neurons.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, the infamous
propensity of poliovirus to invade the central nervous system
and specifically target motor neurons is rare and accidental
and it is neither a prerequisite nor does it present a benefit for
its normal life cycle in humans. Poliovirus is a neurotropic
virus by mistake; its CNS invasion is mostly a chance event
and largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic
position of the infected person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hygiene has undoubtedly saved far, far more lives than it has negatively impacted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so 1/200 suffer from paralysis, that's not a small number. But what about growth defects. Another problem with polio in kids is inhibition of growth in localized areas. What are the rates on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't looked for a sources, but you'll frequently hear in medical school that kids who play in sandboxes (where cats, raccoons, etc may defecate) are less likely to have things like asthma or other allergies.</p>
<p>More likely to get infected with Baylisascaris, but less likely to have asthma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s something called the Hygiene Hypothesis that seeks to explain the prevalence of autoimmune disorders (such as T1D) in wealthy nations. I’m not a medical expert at all but the way I understand the theory is basically that because people aren’t typically exposed to serious infections and diseases in wealthy countries, their immune systems are prone to overreacting to things within the body.</p></div>		</li>
