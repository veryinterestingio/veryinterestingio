			<div class="markdown"><p>The rover is a good way to illustrate your point but a bad example here. It was only designed to last a few months because they thought that the solar panels would be covered in dust and render it without enough power to function beyond that point, not because it was only rated that long for mechanical reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, they didn’t “think” that then get wildly surprised. They knew they could use the solar panels for definitely a few months then could not promise past that. I’m sure they had a long table of the odds of them lasting 1/5/12/24/100 months and designed around a certain percentage lasting a certain amount of time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with one of the rovers whose wheel tracks are shredded... They didn't make them heavy-duty because they had no idea it would be travelling so far for so long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The solar panels got cleaned by wind events that they had no idea were possible. It wasn't some calculated odds, it was a freak accident.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They didn't think to add the wipers? Like on cars? Something that just goes left and right a few times over the panel every day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the added moving parts are possible points of failure and incur additional expenses. Space-wipers might cost half a million dollars for whatever reason, who knows. They probably ruled it out as being unnecessary (maybe its primary job was to be completed within 3 months) or not cost-effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever used wipers without wiper fluid on frozen road grit? What about dry pollen? Do they work well?</p>
<p>Do they work well after three months?</p>
<p>Do they work well below zero?</p>
<p>Do they hold up to direct sun for months without getting brittle?</p>
<p>Do they fold in half nicely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an example of acceptable tolerances in terms of part failure and durability. How long a part is &quot;rated&quot; depends on how critical and durable it is. In terms of this new structure, they can only gurantee safety for 100 years, but, like said previously, it can probably last after that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never can guarantee anything, it’s always odds. If 99.99% make it one year that might be the standard they aim for, even if that mean 99% of them make it five years. But even st 99.99% that is still one out of a thousand that fail before a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They basically cocooned the reactor at Chernobyl.  </p>
<p>The deactivated reactors I have worked on in the U.S. have a similar cocoon with a 75 year rating.  We are just basically waiting for the radiation to decay so they can be safely demolished after the radiation decays to safe levels within that 75 year time period.</p></div>		</li>
