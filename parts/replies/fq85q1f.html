			<div class="markdown"><p>The multivitamin has calcium in it that may inhibit complete absorption of the iron. My doctor told me to take the iron as a separate supplement an hour or two after taking the multivitamin with vitamin c or orange juice. Apparently the vitamin c helps the iron and be absorbed. But I don't know if that's necessary for people who are not anemic or whatever I guess the best thing to do is see your doctor.</p></div>		</li>

The strength of the cherry syrup is strong enough to make you cough on the first sip and the size of the ice pellets is just right.</p></div>		</li>
