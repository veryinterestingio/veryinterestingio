<p>Basically for the child actors it's people they know really well out of character acting things you've both gone through 50 times.</p>
<p>It's not particularly traumatising because it's not you, and because it's an agreed dance you've worked on loads. In the moment if the actors are worthwhile it is full of fear but its different.</p>
<p>For me the impact of difficult scenes is at the first few read throughs when you're trying to find the process of the character, and sometimes the first time you do a full run-through of a scene. It can linger.</p>
<p>I was in a play pre-covid where I had to violently sexually assault someone and I couldn't sleep the night after the first full run of the scene.</p>
<p>During the plays run though it was just a really strong scene.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's definitely a good thing that that scene bothered you. I'd say it's an indication of character.</p></div>		</li>

And the movie adds in the scary sound effects and music in post so the actors don’t usually hear them.</p></div>		</li>
