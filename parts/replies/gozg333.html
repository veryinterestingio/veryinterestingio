			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a pipe in the last two foundations I've lived in in the basement.  The pipe goes to a spacing of material (like a few inches) under the concrete.  If radon levels are ever high, you can just vent the pipe outdoors and poof.  Away goes your radon</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not, generally, a crawl space. Usually theyâ€™ll put down a layer of loose material, gravel or similar, before you pour the slab. This creates a porous area where liquid can pool away from the slab and air can circulate. The mitigation system creates a low-pressure zone there that encourages the radon gas to stay out of your house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing about point 4. Lung cancer deaths due to radon are about 20% in the U.S., and about 3% for those who have never smoked. Just because it's the second leading cause of lung cancer doesn't mean it's so significant it can't be masked by the first leading cause.</p></div>		</li>
