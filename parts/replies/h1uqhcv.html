			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you simplified Earth's orbit to 2 dimensions, would that acceleration due to the eccentricity show up as an extremely small variation in the net downward force towards the planet since a person's downward acceleration would be affected by g + a. Where a depends on which side of the planet you're on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eccentricity of Earth's orbit is irrelevant if you measure your local gravitational acceleration, unless you have extremely precise devices. The local gravitational acceleration is dominated by Earth's gravity and your place on Earth which don't change. Tidal forces from the Moon are the next contribution orders of magnitude smaller, which also don't change. Tidal forces from the Sun come next, and they change by a few percent relative to its overall very small value.</p></div>		</li>
