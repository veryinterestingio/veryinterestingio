			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such an important point. Modern biology has long since moved to genealogical-based rather than typological-based classification. Most people are still very used to compartmentalizing organisms into discrete, siloed &quot;types&quot;. But an organism doesn't just stop being part of the larger group it's in by &quot;becoming&quot; something else. In some cases, people seem to find it intuitive (e.g., dogs are mammals), but not when it runs up against commonly held understanding (dogs are also lobe-finned fish). If you can get past that, it can really enrich your view of the natural world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of that enrichment (and this involves dinosaurs!) is an anecdote from when I was in...6th grade maybe?</p>
<p>My teacher explained that pterodactyls were not dinosaurs, because...<em>dinosaurs did not fly.</em></p>
<p>The younger me took a big goddamn issue with that. I didn't yet know the term &quot;no true Scotsman&quot;, but I recognized the fallacy for what it was. If you define dinosaurs as non-flying, then you disallow the very existence of a flying dinosaur. You could define anything that way! You could say &quot;Delaware is not a state, because no state begins with 'D'&quot;. That statement would be true...only if it were already true. If Delaware isn't a state then it is true that no states begin with D, but if Delaware is a state then states can begin with D. Obviously, this way of defining things is dumb. And it was obviously dumb, and that explanation was not satisfying at all.</p>
<p>It wasn't until much later when I had learned about phylogeny that I actually understood why pterodactyls were not dinosaurs, and of course it has nothing to do what they could do or how they looked or anything. It's simply that dinosaurs are a group sharing a particular common ancestor, and pterodactyls did not share that ancestor. A dinosaur could have <em>any</em> properties so long as it shared that common ancestor with other dinosaurs.</p>
<p>In fact, they could even fly. Like most of the dinosaurs currently alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great story. I remember hearing similar things when I was going up. As a kid, I was also so fascinated by things that &quot;are, but aren't,&quot; for lack of a better description. Tuataras look like lizards but <em>aren't</em>. I think I was doing a similar thing without having the context or understanding to put my finger on it. Fast forward to college when I'd taken some biology classes, I had a lungfish as a pet; this &quot;fish&quot; that's more related to me than other &quot;fish&quot;. Most people look at it as just a weird skinny eel thing, but being able to contextualize it is so cool. It breathes air because it has <em>lungs</em>, not a modified swimbladder, but honest-to-god lungs. And &quot;walks&quot; like it's got legs, because it does (or more correctly, we have modified lobe fins!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like what you say, but you lost me on the above comment; therefore, I hope you will help me to understand what you just said: &quot;Dogs are also lobe-finned fish.&quot; What in the holey name did you mean? My mind is elastic, but it's not silly putty. Show, don't tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank for you for bringing this up. You are illustrating exactly what I meant; some of these conclusions seem bizarre and stupid because they appear to go against common-sense notions (wtf you mean a dog is a fish?).</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, modern biology classifies organisms based on genealogy. That means that a group is defined as an ancestor and all of its descendants. This is why birds are literally dinosaurs. Modern birds are nested within the dinosaur family tree. T. rex is more closely related to a chicken than it is to Triceratops! Dinosaurs (including birds) are unified by sharing a common ancestor.</p>
<p>So how does this relate to dogs and fish? Let's take a look at a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CacxZy7.jpg" target="_blank">simplified family tree of bony fishes</a> (we're excluding things like sharks, lampreys, and hagfish). The branch point is the last common ancestor of &quot;ray-finned&quot; and &quot;lobe-finned&quot; bony fishes. Basically, this ancestor and all of its descendants constitute the group &quot;bony fishes&quot;. But let's look more closely at the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/T2SzwtT.jpg" target="_blank">family tree of lobe-finned fishes</a>. This group contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungfish" target="_blank">lungfishes</a>, as well as other animals not shown, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth" target="_blank">coelacanths</a> and many extinct species, all of which generally conform to our everyday notion of what a &quot;fish&quot; is supposed to look like. But you will also find &quot;tetrapods&quot; in this part of the family tree; this means mammals, reptiles (including birds), and amphibians. </p>
<p>So why would we call these animals fish? <a href="https://i.imgur.com/EAatnkS.jpg" target="_blank">Circled in red</a> is what people call &quot;fish&quot; in everyday language (again, we're excluded sharks, etc.); that is, scaly, slimy things that live in water and breathe with gills. However, you'll notice that this group arbitrarily excludes one of the descendants of the ancestor of all bony fishes: tetrapods. In fact, some of the animals we're calling &quot;fish&quot; are more closely related to the tetrapods than they are to the other &quot;fish&quot;. Arbitrary exclusion of one or more descendant groups is a big no-no in modern biological classifcation; such groups are said to be &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly" target="_blank">paraphyletic</a>&quot;. What we want is &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyly" target="_blank">monophyletic</a>&quot; groups; that is, groups defined by an ancestor and all of its descendants. This is useful because it helps us better understand biodiversity, how organisms are related and how they evolved, etc. Paraphyletic groups are essentially holdovers. The notion that fish are all scaly, slimy things that live in the water and have gills might be useful in an every day sense, but it's not correct in terms of biology. Lungfish are more closely related to us than to goldfish; goldfish are more related to us than they are to sharks!</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my first comment, organisms don't stop being part of one group when they become something new. As the person I replied to said, saying dogs are lobe-finned fish isn't an attempt to be cute or clever; it's simply accurate. When humans arose, they didn't stop being primates or mammals, just like they didn't stop being bony fish. I know one sounds reasonable and the other sounds strange, but that's only because of the preconceived notions we carry. People tend to have misconceptions about organisms being lumped into &quot;types&quot; of equal standing; fish vs. mammal vs. reptile, etc. But this is often quite wrong. In the diagrams I shared, I included &quot;ray-finned&quot; bony fishes. This group contains &gt; 95% of the things we call fish, and in fact has at least as much species diversity as mammals, reptiles (including birds), and amphibians combined. Ray-finned fishes are incredibly diverse, and thinking of them as a &quot;type&quot; on equal footing to &quot;mammal&quot; is very misleading.</p>
<p>Basically, if we want to apply the term &quot;fish&quot; to all the animals we usually do, and have it also be meaningful in the context of modern biology, we have to include tetrapods. Otherwise, we've created an arbitrary grouping that does not reflect how animals are actually related to one another. Think of &quot;fish&quot; as a higher level of classification than you are used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;lobe-finned fish&quot; is an evolutionary category, whereas &quot;fish&quot; is more of a colloquial term. A dog is not a fish, obviously. You couldn't fry a dog in batter and sell it with mash as &quot;fish and chips&quot; because a dog is not a fish and mash is not chips. However, dogs did <em>evolve</em> from the evolutionary category &quot;lobe-finned fish&quot;. At some point in history, some lobe-finned fish ended up evolving to live on land, and kept evolving to produce the wide array of land-based vertebrates we see today. Other lobe-finned fish didn't do that. They stayed fish for hundreds of millions of years, the kind of fish that we would be able to sell as fish and chips.</p>
<p>So, a dog is not a fish colloquially, but it <em>is</em> a fish evolutionarily. It's just a fish that evolved quite a lot of differences. If a dog and a lungfish both went on Ancestry.com, they'd both be able to trace their lineages back to a great, great, great, great grandfather, Jim the long-dead lobe-finned fish.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since all eukaryotes are derived from prokaryotes (google says its from a fusion of archaea with bacteria), are humans technically still that archaea?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prokaryotic may be more useful as a descriptive term than a cladistic one. As you mentioned, it is a polyphyletic (as opposed to paraphyletic or monophyletic) group comprising bacteria and archaea. The unifying group of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes is probably better described simply as &quot;life&quot; rather than prokaryotes (unified by the &quot;last universal common ancestor&quot; or LUCA). Archaea as a domain does contain eukaryotes, so from a cladistic point of view, we are archaeans. Just to mention, microbial diversity is an active area of research and not at all my specialty, so others may be able to provide more or better detail.</p></div>		</li>
