			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband can get into bed and fall asleep just like that but for me it takes ages. Similarly in the morning, he just gets out of bed like it's no big deal but it takes me around an hour to feel human. It's very unfair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, i go to sleep fast but take forever to wake up. Idk if its really been scientifically answered to an exact point, but i would think it has to do with how well/fast your brain can both “start up” and “shut down” for waking up and going to sleep. </p>
<p>Some people also have trouble clearing their mind/have anxiety related issues so im sure that makes it hard to go to bed. And for waking up, im sure some people are just naturally more motivated/have the impulse control to just force themselves to get up. Definitely a lot of factors at play, sounds like your husband lucked out though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i've come to peace with the fact that i just can't wake up properly, a lot of people who know me IRL say that it's probably because of your work and being stressed bla bla but honestly i have the same issues when i'm on vacation, or on the weekends ... i just can't get up ... i have to force myself out of the bed and zombie walk into the bathroom. Hell most of the days even when i arrive at work 1+ hours since i woke up, i'm still in zombie mode. </p>
<p>Falling asleep in the other hand, it takes me 10 seconds once i've decided the day is over and i'm going to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm useless both at falling asleep and waking up, <strong>but</strong> at least I don't get mosquito bites. While everyone else is scratching their skin off I'm just chilling. I mean I still get bitten, but I just don't get the itching reaction and red lump anymore. Just stopped happening around 25 years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We women are practically trained to have anxiety over whether a zillion things were taken care of, or had their feelings properly considered, or whether we’ve adequately planned out the next day/week/year. So it’s no surprise it can be so hard to let that go enough to fall asleep!</p></div>		</li>
