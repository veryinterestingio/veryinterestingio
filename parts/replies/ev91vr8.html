<p>Along this line any mechanical failure is terminal, as well. You can't fly a quadcopter with only three rotors; you can't balance lift and you can't balance torque. There are <em>so many</em> points of failure and so many of those are fail unsafe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youre correct that you couldnt fly humans in a quad copter with 1 rotor out. However, you actually can control a quad copter using 3 rotors, and to some extent even 2. It requires specially programmed software. Also, it requires violent changes in attitude, so you could never out humans on something doing this, but it is being done with quad copters. I was at a seminar that talked about this. I'll see if I can find a link to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true for almost all quadcopters, but it isn't necessary. You could make a quadcopter which uses collective for control. It would still be too inefficient for flying people around but it would work better with a gas engine.</p>

<p>What about the Chinook?  It's my understanding that it pretty easily outpaces all other helicopters in the US military because it has two rotors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chinook has two counter rotating rotors, and this is the important part. A helicopter rotor is a wing, just like an airplane, except the wing spins in a circle. At any given time, with the front of the helicopter being the reference point, half of the wing is moving backwards and half is moving forwards. As the forward speed of the helicopter increases, the airspeed over the forward half of the wing increases, and the airspeed over the backward half decreases. This decreased airspeed over the backward half of the wing <em>reduces</em> the lift it generates. This reduced lift can be compensated for by adjusting the angle of the blade as the rotor moves backward and increasing rotor speed, but at a certain point the rotor can't safely spin faster, and increasing the rotor angle will cause a stall over that half of the rotor. At this point you can't go any faster because you will lose lift over half of your wing and your helicopter will roll over sideways, falling out of the sky.</p>
<p>With the Chinook, they use two overlapping counter rotating rotors. With counter rotating rotors, each rotor loses lift on a different side of the helicopter. This let's you go faster in your helicopter, because you aren't rolling over and falling out of the sky. </p>
<p>It should be noted that most heavy lift helicopters have one, very large rotor. They are slower than the Chinook, of course, because of the loss of lift all single rotor helicopters experience at high speeds, but the single more powerful rotor is able to lift more than the dual rotors of the Chinook.</p>
<p>The Chinook was developed because the military wanted a fast troop transport helicopter, which the Chinook does well. Being able to quickly deliver a platoon of soldiers to an area with no runway for fixed wing aircraft is pretty valuable from a tactical standpoint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make up for rotor efficiency with raw engine power and that often reduces weight along the way.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook#Specifications_\(CH-47F\)" target="_blank">CH-47 Chinook</a> can lift a bit under 11,000 kg which is more than most helicopters but is significantly less than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_CH-53E_Super_Stallion#Specifications_(CH-53E\)" target="_blank">CH-53 Super Stallion</a> which can lift 14,500 kg.  The CH-53 is significantly newer with a single massive rotor(24 meters vs 2x 18.3 meters) and can send about 50% more power to that rotor (3x 3270 kW engines vs 2x 3529 kW engines)</p>
<p>Its a lot more straightforward to make one big rotor on a helicopter and there is increased complexity with additional rotors.  You can make a heavy lift helicopter either way, it just comes down to what the engineering requirements are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>scale.</p>
<p>electric power systems don't scale up well for a few reasons, but the battery most obviously, which means helicopters need to be gas powered. the way gas engines work, they actually get <em>better</em> the bigger they are, and distributing mechanical power is fairly complicated. </p>
<p>this is why tandem rotor helicopters are fairly niche' and <em>very</em> large. the classic example being the US CH-47 &quot;chinook&quot;, which is designed to move armored vehicles around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably dont fix what ain't broke, mostly.  More rotors will require heavy complicated gearboxes to transfer power from engines to blades.  The extra weight will reduce payload and reduce fuel capacity. Each rotor blade will require additional clear space from its neighbors so they dont hit and destroy themselves making the fuselage larger and heavier.</p>
<p>If you add additional rotors, the helicopters will also require larger landing pads and possibly make more noise and rotor blast.  Not good in a congested city or jungle area with small areas of clear space.</p>
<p>There were twin main rotor heavy lift helicopters in the Vietnam war era.  They required the rotors to be mounted above each other so they wouldn't hit.  The osprey is technically a twin main rotor helicopter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An additional note is that with smaller quadrocopters, it is substantially easier to accelerate or slow down specific rotors to achieve the desired movement or to maintain stability. If it were scaled up, the amount of torque necessary to do the same thing with a helicopter sized quadrocopter is quite large and likely nowhere near as precise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The osprey is very iconic for me growing up with GI Joe toys. Is 2 basically the max for anything big enough to carry people in, then? I was thinking a little quadcopter with enough space for the driver and maybe 1 passenger, not so much transport vehicles. I don't know what it would be useful for but I feel like it would be zippy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Engines are big, heavy, and the most likely thing to go wrong. So in general you want to have as few as you can get away with. Using two engines gives you redundancy and balance, so it's a pretty good number. </p>
<p>If you're going after speed, more rotors isn't the way to go. Helicopters can't go all that quickly because the rotor tips start breaking the sound barrier. The osprey can go a little faster because it works more like a plane in horizontal flight. The vast majority of 'zippy' aircraft use one big jet engine in the middle.</p>
<p>There are plenty of aircraft with four engines, but they're all huge, long range, transport craft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Give it ten years. The old days that don't believe in fly-by-wire will all retire and stop consulting. We'll have f22, b2, etc pilots that have all flown computer assisted.</p>
<p>Then it's just a matter of finding an efficient way to transfer power from 2+ engines to 4 rotors in a space and fuel efficient way.... </p>
<p>Granted... The rotor design math is kinda scary and the break points between the length of a two rotor (think Chinook) and 4 get intense when you start calculating drag... Not to mention driving four rotors from x engines in a fault tolerant way..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main point being: What problem would a four rotor copter solve that a 1/2 rotor copter or plane doesn't already solve?</p>
<p>If you're wanting a larger payload than what a 2-rotor provides, it'd be better to use a plane.</p>
<p>If you're wanting a more stable craft for delicate operations, it'd be better to redesign those operations since even a 4-rotor drone would struggle to remain in a fixed position in space. If it's not that delicate, a 1-rotor can handle it already.</p></div>		</li>
