			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to this, our daughters pediatrician mentioned that young children enjoy the repition because it gives them the feeling of control and structure in a world where they basically have no control. They like knowing what the next page will be in a book, next lyric in a song, next scene in a movie because it is comforting to know what will come next. It provides structure and grounding to them in a world that seems otherwise chaotic.</p>
<p>This seemed odd to me because as an adult I like surprises and unexpected things, but I can see why it makes our daughter happy. I guess I enjoy knowing my day to day at work will usually be pretty stable and complain when it gets chaotic, so maybe I don't like surprises and unexpected things as much as I thought I did.</p>
<p>TIL I like structure, not chaos, at work. I'm apparently just an adult toddler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would watch The Titanic as a child every day I could that I wasn't in school! But I would have my mom skip through the part where Rose almost jumps off the ship and Jack saves her. My mom probably loved the fact that movie could keep me pr occupied for three hours a day though. ALSO Leonardo was my first crush?</p>
<p>I think the enjoyment of repetition is a lot like knowing the words to a song and having the enjoyment of singing it with your friends vs (usually me) not knowing the words and smiling like an idiot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been thinking lately about this because I'm a nanny. The kid I care for most often is 3 and will repeat a word or phrase over an over until I repeat it, which shows him that I understood what he said. It also helps him when I repeat after him, because he gets to hear the &quot;proper&quot; pronunciation after his attempt. I think this is definitely connected to what you're saying here about watching the same movie or episode or video over and over again.</p>
<p>It could also be the same reason we listen to the same song over and over. We still get enjoyment out of it. Since children's attention spans and memories are still growing, it may very well be that they get something new out of it each time, too. Rarely does a 3 year old get through an entire episode of Paw Patrol without getting up and running out of the room, or playing with a toy, so while the episode may have played on the TV 10 times, it's possible that they've o Ly seen certain parts like 3 or 4 times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Repetitive learning behaviors are age appropriate for the age range you mentioned. Jean Piaget theorized that learning involves assimilation (taking in info) and accommodation (taking old schemas and adapting them). kids in the pre operational phase of cognitive development involve egocentricism and centration - they struggle to see things from other perspectives and tend to focus on one topic or situation at a time, respectively. Which might explain why a kid is satisfied with watching the same cool stuff rather than explore new stuff. They aren't logical yet so they way they think is pretty concrete. They also can't imagine reversing or undoing a sequence of events (irreversibility). Plus, if a child enjoys something, they want to experience it again. Mastery (and celebrating it) is a fundamental aspect of social learning. </p></div>		</li>
