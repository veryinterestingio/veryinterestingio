			<div class="markdown"><p>That's usually my stand. Yes, I understand the change is practically negligible, but whenever the conversation comes up and someone asks &quot;what's the solution?&quot;, absolutely no one has an actual workable solution, so we all latch on to any small alternative to try and make a difference.</p>
<p>We laugh about each small change, but in the long run we've started banning/limiting plastic bags, styrofoam, straws, bleached napkins; as well as vegetarian food demand (&quot;meat alternatives&quot;) increasing has led to an increase in plant-based protein.</p>
<p>If you told me 15 years ago that single use grocery bags were going to be gone I would have laughed, only weird old ladies took their &quot;shopping bags&quot; to the grocery store.</p></div>		</li>

<p>She was Jon Stewart's go-to expert on the economy. She was amazing at both cutting through the bullshit and explaining what was going on, and what caused the crisis, in very clear terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but isn't the issue also that the narrowness of straws in particular made them more of a concern to wildlife than other garbage? I get that the impact is small anyway, and other pollution is still an issue, but iirc there is a reason that straws and not forks were targeted.</p></div>		</li>
