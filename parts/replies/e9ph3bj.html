			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta. It more explains why the heaviest element fused in the core of large stars is iron. Stars could run out of fusion fuel before they get to iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also sorta.  Iron isn’t the heaviest element fused in stars.  It’s the heaviest element you can fuse and get energy out of the deal.  Fusing iron into heavier atoms costs energy, but there’s lots of that floating around in even very old stars.  Any of the heavy elements we find on Earth were produced in ancient stars, scattered across the universe when they went nova, and caught in the Sun’s accretion disc a few billion years back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong, but the iron just means the star is running out of energy. It doesn’t kill the star, it’s just a symptom of its upcoming death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, the iron is not killing it, the lack of fusable fuel is what kills it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The closer you get to iron, the faster the star uses up the fuel as well. Hydrogen fusion can last billions of years.  Once silicon -&gt; iron fusion starts the star has less than a day to live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer.</p>
<p>I was reading up on how supernovas happen. When a star is fusing hydrogen to helium, it produces a huge amount of excess energy, which make the star bright and also keeps it from collapsing on itself due to gravity.</p>
<p>When the hydrogen is all gone, it collapses a little bit until the pressure is high enough for the helium to start fusing into carbon. That keeps the star stable for a while longer.</p>
<p>This keeps happening, with lighter elements getting fused into heavier elements.</p>
<p>When the process reaches iron, the fusion actually <em>consumes</em> energy and so there's nothing to prevent the star from collapsing. Apparently, the collapse happens at a significant fraction of the speed of light and the whole thing happens in a quarter of a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those collapses are also where the heavier elements come from as everything is crushed together there is a huge amount of energy available to fuse nuclei</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, because the fusion consumes energy, the entire system is cooled, which leads to the entire star becoming smaller, which leads to more nuclear burning, which leads to more cooling, leading to a cataclysmic cycle. Gravitational force causes the star to try to crush itself towards the center, and because the system is being cooled, the outward heat/pressure can't hold the collapsing mass back. It condenses until it hits electron degeneracy pressure, essentially when you pack electrons so close you can't pack anymore in the same space. If you have a big enough star, the electron degeneracy pressure isn't strong enough to support the collapsing star, and this is when electrons fuse with protons to become neutrons. Eventually, you get a crazy dense core of neutrons, supported by, you guessed it, the neutron degeneracy force. The star is still collapsing at this point, but when neutrons are so densely packed that no more can be crammed together, the entire star's mass that was collapsing bounces back from hitting the neutron core, creating a supernova explosion</p></div>		</li>
