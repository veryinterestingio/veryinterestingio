			<div class="markdown"><p>Aye. Though emphasis on this being far more a utilitarian symbiotic relationship (more akin to, say, a clownfish and a sea anenome) than the &quot;owner and pet&quot; relationship we're familiar with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I got to witness these interactions on my pepper plants last year, and this year! It was so cool! Eventually aphidius wasps moved in! Nature took care of everything, and my plants all survived. It's so fascinating to watch!</p></div>		</li>
