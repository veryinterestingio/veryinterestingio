			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for mentioning evolution, the ultimate reason was missing from all other answers I saw. The simple answer is that we are doing just fine without accurate memories, so they would not be worth it.</p>
<p>More specifically: our brains are made by evolution, and evolution does not care about accurateness of the memories or truth. The only thing our body - including our brains - is for is increased probability to proliferate our genes. The current system works just fine, judging by the fact that we are the most successful species on planet by many metrics. And the costs for actually accurate memories would be huge. Accurate memories would need to have enormous advantages (for the purpose of gene proliferation) in order to offset those problems for it to be even a theoretical possibility of being created, and it is difficult to imagine that the advantages would be great enough. So there is no reason for evolution to develop accurate memories.</p></div>		</li>
