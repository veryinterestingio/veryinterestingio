<p>Trees are carbon sinks. It is the CO2 they take from the atmosphere we need to plant them for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An individual tree is a temporary carbon sink. A forest is a permanent carbon sink.  </p>
<p>Also, remember that not all trees that die simply fall and decompose- anything that gets harvested and processed into wood remains a carbon sink for as long as that wood's in use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is precisely why deforestation is so threatening. Failing to replace those carbon sinks adds a lasting offset to the global CO2 concentration. This, combined with pulling oil out of the ground and burning it, throws the entire ecosystem off balance, since weâ€™re strictly adding CO2 to a closed system while simultaneously removing the sinks where atmospheric CO2 is naturally sequestered.</p></div>		</li>
