			<div class="markdown"><p>The mRNA vaccines are produced by synthesising the mRNA base-by-base chemically. It's just as easy to make a batch of the modified version as the original version. Actually, since it involves a deletion it's quicker to make the new version, since it's shorter. You would want to do some structural analysis to check it folds correctly afterwards though.</p>
<p>the AZD1222 vaccine will require printing off the new genome, then using that to make up a new master cell bank. Then using that to make new batches. It's not much more work, but it's a little more work.</p>
<p>[Edit] Apparantly they produce the DNA chemically and then convert to RNA later, which makes more sense!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the mRNA vaccine is produced by cloning DNA and then using that DNA to make mRNA via T7 RNA polymerase. Synthesize DNA &gt; subclone &gt; transform &gt; plasmid prep &gt; in vitro transcription &gt; purify RNA &gt; formulate LNP-mRNA.</p>
<p>Similarly, the adenoviral vaccine involves synthesis of the DNA, cloning, then transfection. Synthesize DNA -&gt; subclone into antigen spot &gt; purify and linearize dna &gt; transfect &gt; harvest viral particles.</p>
<p>The speed difference between both is really only truly going to be between after transfection for the adenovirus and after in vitro transcription for the LNP-mRNAs. Is the purification difficult/validation of purity? Or is the growth rate of the mammalian cells going to be slower. All the molbio work beforehand is practically the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I appreciate the explanation! But it seems to me that this advantage is not that great, and that there could be modified conventional vaccines almost as fast, as is done with the annual flu vaccine. The mRNA vaccines did not begin their clinical trail any quicker than the AstraZeneca vaccine. Obviously, the AZ vaccine had a head start in that the ChAdOx1 vector had already been developed whereas the mRNA vaccine essentially was made from stretch, but given both vaccines now exist I donâ€™t see that the mRNA method has much of an advantage in this area (although it has clear advantages in others, while obviously still having the logistical issue of requiring cryogenic storage).</p></div>		</li>
