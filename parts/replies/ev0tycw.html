			<div class="markdown"><p>I can throw a little real world observation into the mix here. The vacuum sensor for our turbine condensers had a semi bad design that would sometimes get water trapped in the dead leg and throw off the sensor, so we would crack open the drain to that portion to try and clear it out. The vacuum was about 28&quot; Hg gauge, which is a little less than 1 psi absolute. Through a half inch pipe, with the valve cracked maybe a half turn open (so maybe a few millimeters), it was almost but not quite painful to put your hand on, and it made a definite flowing air noise. Even with machinery running around it. You definitely wouldn't get sucked through, and any light breeze would disappear more than a foot away. The only real indication would be noise, and I assume on the station an increase in oxygen production. Normal practice to find small leaks in the condenser is to produce smoke somehow and try and find it getting sucked in. In the old days this was with a cigarette, now there are tubes that you break and will produce a smoke like... essence?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a small leak you can use a helium leak tester. You hook up what is essentially a mas spectrometer to your vacuum pump and then squirt little shots of helium around your expansion joints, seals, and pipe penetrations till you find the leak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The helium leak tests really struggle with larger leaks. For cryogenic leaks it's great, but when we had a bad leak or a leak out of a large volume we would turn to the Snoop test. Which is basically soapy water, that bubbles on top of a leak, and requires some positive pressure coming through the leak. For a big leak, I love that stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is that human skin, all by itself, is already a pretty good spacesuit.  It's airtight and can regulate its own temperature.  The thing it can't handle is pressure differential (which is why mechanical counterpressure suits would actually be porous).  So if you actually covered anything larger than a pinhole with your finger, the pressure might be enough to cause bruising.</p></div>		</li>
