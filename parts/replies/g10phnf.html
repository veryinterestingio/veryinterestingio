<p>Tattoo pigments are able to stay in the cell layer (the dermis) because once the epidermis heals, there’s no way out and don’t degrade easily.
Hence, why tattoo artists tell you after care is so important - other than preventing infection.</p>
<p>If the needles went any closer in the epidermis it wouldn’t be permanent and if it went in the fat layer (hypodermic layer) it wouldn’t be visible &amp; also not as permanent below your skin.</p>
<p>The reason they fade, to my knowledge, is sometimes the pigments are ‘attacked’ by your own cells or ‘leak’ out of place.
Edit: also sun damage is pretty gnarly on tattoo’d skin as well, making it fade too.</p></div>		</li>
