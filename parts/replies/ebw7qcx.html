			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have ingrowns in both my large toes to the point of having to get surgery and slice the ends off, down to the root, and reform that “path” you speak of. I cut my toes terribly as a kid and fucked up the growing path. </p>
<p>I gotta say, the first time I stubbed my toe after the surgery healed, I almost broke down crying from NOT being in pain. It was incredible and well worthwhile surgery. </p>
<p>Edit: added smidge more info. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had 2 majorly ingrown big toenails maybe 3 or 4 years ago. They cut them out once, but they came right back. The doctor's solution was to slice the nail down the sides to remove the ingrown shard, and then &quot;chemically burn&quot; (as it was described to me) the root so that the sides of the nail wouldn't grow back. Now my nails are thinner than they used to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that is what happened with me as well. Mind you it’s been almost ten years.  My toes are thinner, but. I’ve not had any major issues. Even messed the nail up stubbing it once and it healed just fine. Hopefully your surgery helped you. Straight quality of life changer for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, I also had this done and immensely regret it. My toes are as healed as they are going to get and are still in pain. No more ingrown toenails, but instead I just get plain pain from pressure on the nails. I can't wear certain shoes because they press on my toes too much and my clumsy boyfriend regularly stepping on my toes is a rather big issue, much more than it should be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well explained mate. I also had ingrown toenails, that shit was SO SO painful....the literally burned away the nail beds on both big toes....now I am left with 2 little weirdly formed ugly toenails, but BOY oh BOY what a relieve it is not to have ingrown toenails.....the first time I stubbed my toe when the surgery was done and it healed was a blissful experience. </p></div>		</li>
