			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Lots of people have suggested a tax on pollution, and using up precious resources. However the quickest way to end a political career, particularly in the US is suggest more taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well China and Indonesia are the biggest issue. I am not sure how you can propose a tax on them. If you reduced the US contribution to 0 that would only be about 1% of the plastic in the Pacific ocean, 95% of the plastic comes from East Asia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given how much these nations depend on the sea and how much their culinary heritage depends on sea food, they might be persuaded to adopt ocean-waste reducing systems like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mr+trash+wheel" target="_blank">Mr. and Mrs. Trash Wheel</a>, which stop floating plastic waste from making it out to the ocean, and these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faw8jntZy9I" target="_blank">Australian storm drain nets</a> or storm drain socks, which trap a stunning amount of waste and keep them from flowing out to sea.</p>
<p>Both of these solutions do not require any additional energy input to operate. The nets are completely passive, and Mr. Trash Wheel is powered by a water wheel that turns as pushed by the water current in the river and some solar panels. If China alone were to adopt these two solutions, the ocean trash problem may actually become solvable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whereas that should be how things work, in international free trade, if everyone is not playing by the same rules and enforcing them the same, companies will simply move to where either laws or enforcement of laws is lax, and pollute there while exporting their goods. To a significant extent, that is exactly what has happened in world trade as the US and Europe tightened pollution standards. In a globalized economy, serious penalties need to be erected to exclude unfair players, so that everyone involved plays by the same rules, or it won't work. These are global problems we're dealing with.</p>
<p>The whole point of good governance and regulation is to internalize externalities. Externalities like pollution privatize the profit while weighting everyone else down with the consequences. Government should regulate big business and protect the people. That is the fundamental prerogative of governance. Instead, too many governments, including our own, protect big business and regulate the people. I think if it were phrased this way, both liberals and conservatives (except those who are totally sold out to corrupt big business interests) would agree on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, it's super important to remember that they contribute disproportionately because western nations literally ship their garbage over there for them to dispose of - knowing damn well they don't have the infrastructure to deal with so much waste in an environmentally friendly manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whereas that is true of certain kinds of garbage, I'm talking about food wrappers and bottles that are tossed into the rivers. The recycling and e-waste we shiped to China that China no longer accepts was never dumped into the rivers in mass quantities, as far as I understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not very knowledgeable about US-China waste relations (lol) but I do know that China used to be the biggest importer of scrap plastics and other raw waste materials and all. This has now obviously shifted to the other nations in SE Asia (like Malaysia and Indonesia) but I believe plastic bottles etc. still make up a huge proportion of the imported waste. However, good news being that these nations are starting to worry more about their environmental image and are intending to accept less waste. Bad news being that this opens a huge illegal market for waste imports (which also is a huge opportunity for illegal dumping).</p></div>		</li>
