It's not too hard to see how magic and superstition was believable when you have a rock that always wants to point in one direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s very (very) unlikely they had crystals that were waiting in just the right spot for lightning to strike. The odds are <em>realllllllly</em> small for this to happen. It’s a cool story though and I do get you were just trying to remember the details. You are spot on I think with the rest of it.  They did a neat experiment with calcite and were able to get within 1% of the sun’s location:  <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/11/viking-sunstone-revealed" target="_blank">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/11/viking-sunstone-revealed</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can beat magnetism into a piece of steel/iron with a hammer. Lay the steel north south with the magnetic field and strike the south facing end. When you hit it the atoms align themselves with the magnetic field. The more you hit it the more magnetized it becomes.</p></div>		</li>
