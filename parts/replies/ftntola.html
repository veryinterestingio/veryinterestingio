			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're counting large numbers over a decent timespan, it's very easy to lose track. That's why they make those clicker thingies that bouncers use! There's always distractions, and the longer you're there the more bored you get. Try counting cars for an hour!</p>
<p>If you're using your fingers, you won't lose track. You can just look down at which segment your thumb is on, and which finger is up on your other hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for numbers small enough to fit on my fingers, or that my fingers would be helpful for. </p>
<p>89,357,890 -  983,780? </p>
<p>No I'm not doing that in my head, but I'm also not working it out on my fingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>90 - 80 = 10 +
800 - 700 = 110 +
7000 - 3000 = 4110 +
(3)5... - 8... = (2)74'110 +
92... - 9... = 8'374'110 +
8... = 88'374'110</p>
<p>Doing it that way, you can reasonably do any size addition + subtraction in your head, though I find speaking the final value of each &quot;chunk&quot; out loud helps keep it in memory. Once you get to a certain size carry, though, it does get very difficult to remember each piece (i.e. current partial sum, position along the numbers, and a carry if you have one).</p>
<p>There are people out there, though, who can multiply and divide number far larger than this just in their heads, and addition / subtraction is basically child's play for them.</p></div>		</li>
