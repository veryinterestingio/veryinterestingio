			<div class="markdown"><p>You're kinda right. My dad was a stockbroker. It's a wild, vulgar environment on that floor.</p>
<p>Edit: my dad has been removed from it for quite a while, but he told me that it wasn't uncommon for rampant drug and alcohol use to be a thing before the morning bell. He said that pretty everyone was cursing like a sailor and trying to beat out the other guy. They knew at the end of the day that if one person was making it big it meant that some poor soul was probably bankrupt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nonsense. Those are called ex-trades or OTC trades and they do not require physical presence. You just negotiate the details with the counterparty and register them in your OMS and send a confirmation message to the stock exchange.</p>
<p>I know because I work for a company that sells OMS to tier 1 banks who regularly do trades in the millions.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just realised auto correct screwed it up. Those are called ex-pit trades*, since the trading floor is called the &quot;pit&quot; and these trades are off-pit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been there and I work in finance</p>
<p>Even though it isnt as “useful” as it once was with online trading, it’s still pretty handy to have a centralized place of business for a stock exchange.</p>
<p>Tons of people still work at the NYSE and manage hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks. They set the opening prices each morning and have extremely important jobs, and while they do indeed still do most of their work online, they still need a physical place to come work.</p>
<p>Also anyone managing a group of stock listings (and pretty much all other employees) at any exchange are subject to SERIOUS information restrictions. I spoke to a guy who had to drop a massive company and hand it off to someone else because the CEO once let something slip by accident.</p>
<p>For these security reasons, it’s helpful to have everyone in one place.</p></div>		</li>
