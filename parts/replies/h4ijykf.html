			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you get changes in frequency if you move the sound source or microphone (Doppler effect), but reflections in a room (in this case the environment acts like a REALLY big room) filter a signal by boosting and cutting frequencies (affecting their phase), but not shifting nor creating frequencies</p>
<p>Edit : ie if you play a 1kHz sine wave in a room, you’re going to record a 1kHz sine wave of potentially different amplitude and phase, but not frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if I'm sitting in a room, different from the one you're in now and then I recorded the sound of my speaking voice and played it back again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves. Would any semblance of my speech except maybe the rhythm be destroyed? Like what'd you hear would be the resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fAxHlLK3Oyk" target="_blank">Here’s </a> a link to the piece, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room" target="_blank">here’s</a> a link to the Wikipedia article. </p>
<p>It’s by Alvin Lucier, made in 1969. Looks like a lot of academic composers were exploring a lot of highly abstract musical ideas around those years.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note that by the end you hear these pure tones. A room dampens most frequencies except for some, and you if run that enough times, eventually you should pretty much only hear the few frequencies it doesn’t attenuate, and everything else will have been attenuated so many times it won’t be present in the recording anymore, which is essentially what you’re hearing. </p>
<p>The tone is ringing because different reflections at different points in time will tend to “smear” a signal over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yo! You’re actually describing exactly what some modern classical composer did. It’s an art piece where the guy sat in a room and read a paragraph of text and recorded it. He then played back the recording and recorded that, and so on. </p>
<p>Each time the recording gets more and more diffused, until the end where it just sounds like these ethereal washes of noise, rather than anything intelligible. A good comparison I’ve found is hearing the distant music from a music festival. It’s a really cool piece. I’ll try to find the link, give me a few minutes.</p></div>		</li>
