			<div class="markdown"><p>The cycle happens regardless of the length of the hair, it's about the length of time the hair has been growing. A hair that grows for a couple months will be shorter than a hair that grows for a couple years. Cutting your hair has no impact on the cycle. But each hair is at a different point in it's cycle so that's why you shed a few hairs a day and it doesn't fall out all at once like a summer molt.</p></div>		</li>
