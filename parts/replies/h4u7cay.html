			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell me about it when ever I go to visit my family in Turkey they always ask me about American cities and this is generally the order they ask in.</p>
<ol>
<li>New York</li>
<li>Miami</li>
<li>Texas</li>
</ol>
<p>They think Texas is a city because most Turks who meet Texans always say they are from Texas and not a city from Texas so by word of mouth a lot of people think Texas is a city and so my family always asks about Texas. Also in movies Texans always say they are from Texas which solidifies their thinking that Texas is a city.They don't believe me when I say Texas is a state a little smaller than Turkey.</p>
<p>Edit; I just asked me dad about this, turns out westerns were very very popular in Turkey during the 70-90's. That probably has a Texas effect also.</p></div>		</li>
