			<div class="markdown"><p>Long story short, is that you are measuring the speed of light in <strong>miles</strong> per <strong>hour</strong>. These are two variables that we have to agree on first. But what happens if we don’t agree on how far a mile is, or how long an hour takes? We can both agree that a mile is 5280 feet, but what if our rulers are different lengths to begin with? We can both agree that an hour is 1 rotation of the short hand on the clock, but what if my clock spins twice when yours spins once?</p>
<p>The faster you move, the slower your time feels compared to everyone else’s. This is a very hard concept to understand, so here is an example. </p>
<p>So if you are moving at 0 miles per hour (0 x the speed of light), and someone else is going 536 million miles per hour (.8 x the speed of light) then you would experience 10 minutes passing, while they would only experience 6 minutes passing, during the same period. This is because their time is slowed down by the speed they are traveling. </p>
<p>Notice that the time dilation was not linear (I.e. 0.8 times the speed of light does <strong>not</strong> equal 0.8 time dilation). The closer you get to the speed of light, the faster and faster that the time dilation increases.</p>
<p>This sounds <em>ridiculous</em>, and like magic. So naturally, an experiment was performed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In October 1971, Joseph C. Hafele, a physicist, and Richard E. Keating, an astronomer, took four cesium-beam atomic clocks aboard commercial airliners. They flew twice around the world, first eastward, then westward, and compared the clocks against others that remained at the United States Naval Observatory. When reunited, the three sets of clocks were found to disagree with one another, and their differences were consistent with the predictions of special and general relativity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the time dilation is not linear. For someone traveling at <strong>80%</strong> the speed of light, they still experience 60% of the time passing as someone traveling 0% the speed of light.
—At <strong>90%</strong> the speed of light, they would still experience 43% of the time passing.
—And at <strong>99%</strong> the speed of light, still about 14% of the time passing.
—By the time they are going <strong>99.9999%</strong> the speed of light, they are still experiencing 0.14% the of the time passing. </p>
<p><strong>Here is the catch</strong>. You are always traveling 0 x the speed of light from your perspective, because whatever speed you are traveling is offset enough by the time dilation to counter the difference you would try to observe in the light’s miles per hour —For however quickly your <em>miles</em> are changing, your <em>hours</em> dilate proportionally. </p>
<p>So if you were traveling at 536million miles for every hour that passes on your clock, and wanted to subtract that from the speed of light to see what proportion of the speed of light you are traveling, you would intuitively want to say your speed is 536million/670million=0.8. But that is only half of the equation. You aren’t measuring distance, alone. You are measuring distance per time.  And even though you’ve increased the distance you are traveling, you still have to adjust for the time dilation you are experiencing. Which brings you right back down to 0C, no matter how many miles you traveled in the time that your clock went in a circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dammit, you're confusing me even more.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm moving with the earth around the sun, milky way, local group, cluster, super cluster etc. Ultimately I don't know how fast in which direction.
So what is my time dilation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the universe is finite( no matter how big) I should be able to have a static point?</p>
</li>
<li>Does time exist independent of humans?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it's really just a law of physics.  The idea is that the laws of physics are the same between inertial frames (consider two objects moving and not accelerating with respect to each other) and the speed of light is a law of physics, at least that's what Einstein took away from Maxwell's Equations, which at that time was our theory of electromagnetism.  This idea that the laws of physics remain the same between inertial frames is really the foundational principle to relativity, and then applying that to Maxwell's Equations gave us all of this stuff with Minkowski spacetime and metric and all the weird velocity stuff and &quot;length contraction&quot; and &quot;time dilation&quot; and Lorentz transformations and all the stuff you would learn about in a special relativity class.  But at the heart, it's about inertial frames and the constancy of the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the point. The faster you go, the more things get funny... relative to things going at other speeds. </p>
<p>How do we measure the speed of light on earth? Very precise timers and carefully measured distances. You could do the same experiments on earth (which is moving at various speeds relative to the sun, other planets, the center of the galaxy, other galaxies, etc) and in a space ship going any speed relative to us, and come up with the same number. </p>
<p>You could also shoot a laser at a distant object and see how long it takes for the light to reflect back. Again, that will work out the same way, as long as you take into account relative motion (as in, if you're traveling towards it, you have to include that distance traveled in the calculation).</p></div>		</li>
