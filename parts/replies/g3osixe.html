But if you focus on small steps, and only on what you are currently doing you will get that dopamine every time you finish a step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the completion of a subsection is what I should associate to feelings of accomplished. Rather than to the aggregate of those small steps </p>
<p>Makes sense - seems to allow for good feeling regardless of outcome and more often</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is work generally limits your &quot;best possible&quot;, and then you go from &quot;yeah I accomplished something&quot; positive feeling to &quot;ugh this should be better but various constraints force it to be subpar&quot; negative feeling.</p>
<p>It's better to have no feelings about the work, or only occasional positive, than lots of little negative ones</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was involved in a project for one of the big consulting firms where they had a problem with people siloing information that would be better shared. An internal university type thing was created and points, badges and rewards were assigned to those who were contributing a lot and for high quality contributions. It became very successful as the ultra competitive streak in these people was turned from benefitting them for holding onto knowledge, and instead increasing their “worth” when they shared it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like it would be effective because in sharing the info these employees now get credit/higher value/can be l Levied for Pay raise etc. </p>
<p>Otherwise sharing would have left them still undervalued</p></div>		</li>
