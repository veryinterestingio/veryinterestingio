			<div class="markdown"><p>Prior to clicking on the link I was really concerned by the idea that someone would intentionally mix chlorine and acetylene.  Using it as a demo to impress and scare University students makes much more sense.  (My prof went with making thermite as his demo, another substance that most people would say &quot;burns&quot; even without external oxygen).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Knallgas&quot; is also a popular demonstration.</p>
<p>I.e mixing Oxygen and Hydrogen in a balloon, then lifting a candle next to it for the shape &quot;bang&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh and the near retirment age chemistry teacher in highschool would do the same thing, just with chlorine and hydrogen in a dark room, and when someone entered and turned on the lights, it'd explode, since hydrogen and chlorine only react spontaneously under UV light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermite is just a mixture containing its own oxidizer though, and that's frankly pretty common with propellants, incendiary devices, etc - rocket fuel, gunpowder, explosives, and so on. Still a good demo, just doesn't demonstrate burning without oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say it was to demonstrate burning without Oxygen, just that you could use it to demonstrate burning without an outside supply of Oxygen.  The fact that it contains it's own oxidizer is precisely why it's used in a lot of the applications you listed.  The fact that it makes a lot of sparks and &quot;burns through&quot; steel plates is why it's used in chemistry classes to demonstrate how cool chemistry is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, ClF3 can often be stored in regular steel containers. When the tank is first filled, the ClF3 quickly reacts with steel, forming a layer of fluoride compounds that insulate the rest of the container and protect it from being reacted</p></div>		</li>
