			<div class="markdown"><p>Drums are strange. The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=drumhead+harmonics" target="_blank">harmonics of a drumhead</a> are two-dimensional, and take on whole-number divisions, but along both its diameter and its circumference. They also interact with the shell and the second head if present.</p>
<p>Timpani have a curved shell that causes the head to resonate much more strongly, depending on where you strike. You still get a dull sound at center, but now strongly resonant tones off center, and more high harmonics towards the rim.</p></div>		</li>
