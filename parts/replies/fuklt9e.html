			<div class="markdown"><p>Another often overlooked reason that the U.S. won't necessarily pay off debt is because it actually props up the value of the dollar.  The debt has to be paid off (even if it's the government doing it), and it has to be paid off in dollars.  </p>
<p>I'm not entirely certain, but I think this is one of the reasons that high government debt can actually lead to *deflation*.  The government is competing with everyone else for dollars.  If they don't just print more, that might cause the value of the dollar to climb.  </p>
<p>Maybe someone who knows more can chime in here, but isn't this what is happening in Japan?  No matter how much money they throw out of their helicopters, that always increased the overall debt-load which counteracts against the obvious inflationary pressure that printing money brings.</p>
<p>Also, wouldn't a policy based on velocity be better at counteracting deflation?  Increasing money velocity would increase the overall money supply without new debt.  The trouble I see is that it's hard to increase velocity without increasing debt *somewhere* in the system, and that puts deflationary pressures back in the economy.  Maybe someone can say something here too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wording has to be a bit more precise, I think. The US government has ALWAYS paid up their debt. It has never defaulted. It will probably always maintain some level of debt because that is pretty much the mechanism to control the economy. (US treasury interest rate is the de facto &quot;risk free&quot; rate - sort of sets a bar for all other interest rates used in the economy) It can be pictured as a revolving line of (expanding) credit. Although the analogy isn't the best, this is not unusual a growing corporation will quite naturally need a larger revolving credit line in order to conduct business. </p>
<p>Government debt (and the resulting spending) is usually seen as stimulating and increasing inflationary pressure not the reverse ie deflation/recession. This is not the same as corporate or individual debt which can be modeled as contractionary if it reduces spending/consumption (because high debt loads decrease funds available for business growth) I am not sure but it seems more likely that the US govt prefers a fairly stable but possibly slightly declining value of the dollar - but that really goes against the interests of other economies (broadly speaking) who wish to export to the US. </p>
<p>Japan has their own situation, a large asset bubble in the late 80s-early 90's, aging population (ie more welfare) and increased competition (S Korea and China). The government has used debt to fund infrastructure etc essentially to prop up the economy and keep their banks viable. As it happens, this is nearly 25 years old and is still going on - fighting demographics is hard work. Older populations consume less, are less productive, the culture tends to save more which are all downward pressures on the economy. BOJ is trying very hard to get some inflation into the economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About Japan:<br />
-If you were a politician and you can pay back your debt at say 0.3% interest or buy US debt which pays back 2%, which one would you do?<br />
-If the Japanese yen crashes, Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Suzuki cars will become so cheap they'll flood the market. </p>
<p>Japan is caught in a spiral where they can print money as much as they can, but the money doesn't inflate the economy as long as it is used domestically. So the government is adding layer upon layer of bureaucracy.</p></div>		</li>
