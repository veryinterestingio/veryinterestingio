			<div class="markdown"><p>We were never taught counting in the Marine Corps. Hell, most Marines can't count past 10 anyways (joking). But there is so much more going on in firefights, that counting rounds you're firing and estimating when you'll be done with a magazine is unnecessary. You'll be communicating with others around you, calling out targets, fire and maneuvering, and dealing with weapon jams sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Couting bullets was always considered a no go. You don't have time for counting bullets when s**t hits the fan. We always put 5 tracers in a 30 5.56mm rounds magazine when tracers are available (yay for budget cuts).</p>
<p>But in general it's a question of click and no bang equals shouting reload (getting cover form a buddy) and then going through a reload drill .. or a faulty gun drill.</p>
<p>All this is mostly rifle related off course.</p>
<p>Another option was to switch to pistol. Counting bullets with a pistol is a little more doable because of fire rates and less bullets to count (and no tracers for pistol)But same rules apply ... fire until out and the pistol sled stays back ... fast reload, pull sled to load first bullet (actually .. tbh ... dont pull sled, but hold sled and push the pistol forward, then release sled) and keep firing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counting your rounds is an important exercise just to get second-nature, you're just sort of aware that you might be half-way through your 30, using the tracers on top of this is a failsafe for when you're caught up in other things. They're all good drills and they all just add up.</p>
<p>There are situations where you'll often need to foxtrot-oscar your current mag and load a fresh, you'll have time later to bom' up your magazines to full.</p></div>		</li>
