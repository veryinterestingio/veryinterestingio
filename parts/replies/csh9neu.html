			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer, and I want to copy and paste an answer that I wrote earlier in addition to this. My recent work has been about the pros and cons for Free Trade agreements between developed countries like the United States and less developed countries such as Malaysia, Mexico, and Vietnam.  However I want to address one of the most basic issues that economists have with this bill:</p>
<p>One of many reasons economists are against this bill is because of the lack of competition this will bring about. Sure it will initially open up new markets (mainly the less developed countries) to US multinational firms and initially there will be competition. However due to the implied structure of the bill, there will be no regulation of the competition and we will see many of the multinational firms wipe out the domestic industries in many of those countries (look up what happened to Mexican corn farmers after the North American Free Trade agreement). So why is this bad for the US consumer? Well lets use Malaysia. The Malaysian firm (supposedly) has the ability to peddle their product in the US; but after it has been run out of business in Malaysia, the multinational firm no longer has extra competition in the US OR in Malaysia and prices can rise as a result. </p>
<p>This is a gross oversimplification and I can go into more detail, but that is the ELI5 version. Then there is the issue with the possibility of healthcare prices shooting through the roof as a result of intellectual property rights being enforced, but that's another argument that I'll talk about if you guys ask.</p>
<p>Here is the biggest red flag about the TPP, (I heard this from a famed economist years back) a real free trade agreement would actually be one page long, maybe two. These trade agreements people are working on are over 11,000 pages. It is literally impossible for someone to read and comprehend. Even if you were the most intelligent lawyer/economist in the world and you started reading it now you would not be able to give congress a summary of the bill by the time the agreement comes to a vote.</p>
<p>Granted, I have been educated by a new wave of economists from the The New School for Social Research, so my views differ from the traditionalist view Monetarism. Also, my &quot;expertise&quot; regarding Free Trade agreements (I have only ONE paper on the subject, there are plenty more people more qualified than me) generally regards the relationship between developed and developing countries. I haven't looked into the relationship between two developed countries so I can't really comment on the possible agreement with Europe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of what's in trade agreements in these days is regulation harmonization. The reason you can't have a proverbial 'one page long' free trade agreement is because governments have different regulatory regimes, and bringing them all into line takes a lot of negotiating. A 'one page long' free trade agreement could only exist in a world with minimal government regulation of the market in the first place. </p>
<p>Also, how is monetarism the 'traditionalist' view on free trade?</p>
<p>I'd love to see the paper you've published. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps I misspoke about traditionalist, but monetarism is the most &quot;followed&quot; theory (including the theories developed from it).  I understand you point against the &quot;one page long&quot; FTA, it was meant more as a euphemism for a rather short FTA. 11,000 is redicously long for this kind of agreement even with so many countries being involved. You could be the best lawyer and economist and start reading the FTA now, and you wouldn't be able to give congress a summary on it when it comes time to present the bill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume that a one-page agreement would have to allow most existing laws for each country stand. It wouldn't have to be an all or nothing proposition. For instance, it could say no tariffs could be imposed by anyone, which would only affect any existing tariffs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now personally I am against FTAs between developing and developed countries, and the primary reason is lack of regulation that is forced upon developing countries.  This leaves their domestic industries completely vulnerable to better equipped multinational coperations. Ideally those domestic firms do have to compete, but at a handicap until they have developed to the point where can play ball on the same playing field. </p>
<p>In regards to the one page euphemism I used, it meant that the length of this FTA bill is concerning because a real FTA (which may be beneficial for some nations) does not need to be that long. Not that a one page FTA is good for the countries involved. </p></div>		</li>

I'd imagine in places like Canada the Supreme Court would have no issue at all throwing out anything that goes against the Charter of Rights and Freedoms if a company tries to go against anything in there even if the TPP passes and makes that action legal. </p></div>		</li>

Usually these countries chose to settle or to eventually pass unjust laws in fear of what those companies can do to them if they won the lawsuits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smaller GDP means smaller investments means smaller compensation if they lose in court. </p>
<p>The &quot;poor African/Asian&quot; nations tend to be the ones that lose the most cases (and most of them pay up anyways) in ISDS arbitration, because they also tend to be the most corrupt... And expropriation without proper compensation and discrimination against some investors to favor local political or business buddies is pretty much part of the culture at this moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A law only exists to the extent it can be enforced. The United States routinely gets &quot;overruled&quot; by the United Nations on various matters. Our response is essentially to laugh in their face, give them the finger and say &quot;come at me bro&quot;.
Canada can have it's sovereignty &quot;eroded&quot; on paper by outside forces all day long. At the end of the day Canada is a sovereign nation with a military, and borders an ally with an even bigger military. Imposing something on them would require force, and that would be an ill-advised move on the part of said outside forces.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your &quot;super-national secret courts&quot; exist because of ISDS clauses that have existed since the 60s... And Australia sued unsuccessfully under such courts by virtue of another free trade agreement. TPP won't change a thing... Wtf, m8?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, some of this info may be correct, but this is ideologically motivated scaremongering. Most of the world has not had &quot;practically free trade since the 50s.&quot; Just take the Bush-era steel tariffs, EU agricultural protectionism or any of a thousand other trade disputes handled by the WTO. </p>
<p>Australia will most likely win the case at the ICSID because the people who write and sign these treaties are not stupid. There was a specific clause in that treaty that says that governments are allowed to &quot;hurt&quot; corporate profits when there is good reason to do it, public health being the example in this case. Phillip Morris will most likely be forced to comply with Australian law, and also pay a considerable sum in legal costs. The whole thing will end up costing australian taxpayers nothing, and will cost PM a lot of time and money because they filed a stupid, frivolous lawsit. This is because in general, the people who negotiate and sign these treaties aren't the assortment of crooks and morons alternatard media would like you to believe.</p>
<p>I came here looking for someone with actual inside knowledge on international trade treaties because I want to learn new things, not read politically motivated half-truths feeding off the hive mind's confirmation bias. The whole &quot;international trade treaties are bad cause corporate conspiracies&quot; shtick is frankly getting a bit old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual way to explain it to a five year old.</p>
<p>Your going to school and the school gives kids the option of which teacher they want to have class with. There is Mrs. A, Mrs. B, and Mrs. C and every kid has to be in class with one of those teachers. The way the teachers get kids to choose there classes is by making deals with the students to attract them, and those deals often involve a student performing a job for some kind of reward. Every class needs a line leader and you happen to be very good at that so A, B and C all want you in their classes. A, B and C all make offers to you for performing that job but A makes the best offer when she says she'll give you three candy bars a day for doing that for the year.</p>
<p>You now have an agreement with A that you will perform this task for a whole school year and she will give you three candy bars a day for that. After the first month of school A changes the rules. All teachers are allowed to change the rules because it is their class room. A decides that she is going to bring in a teaching assistant who she does not have to pay three candy bars a day and no longer pay you. Its A's class room and her rules so there is nothing you can do about it, you are stuck in A's class and can no longer benefit from B's or C's offer.</p>
<p>A new agreement allows students to challenge teachers when they change rules or do not live up to the agreements that they make by going to the principal. The principal then decides if the rule change was fair or if there was a good reason for the teacher not living up to the bargain. If they weren't or there wasn't the teacher has to pay you what they promised when you originally made the agreement. </p>
<p>The policy is there because of situations like Egypt advertising an expected return to a sanitation company and then raising wages after guaranteeing a specific profit level to the company they outsourced the work to. Can it be abused by people, potentially. Is there a good reason for it, probably.</p></div>		</li>
