			<div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago my local mall had a food court surrounded by caged animals.  </p>
<p>Neighborhood kids expanded the vocabulary of the talking birds to the point the mall had to shut down the animal exhibits.</p>
<p>I was sorry to see them go, but it was fun being a teacher rather than a student.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>A friend had a parrot that lived inside, learned to swear and was generally hilarious. He was allowed outside, would hang in the trees with the wild birds chatting away, then fly back for the evening.</p>
<p>There is nothing quite like a tree full of parrots all screaming F**K in unison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was nearly 20 years ago, the parrot's probably still around but they sold the house and moved interstate. I do chuckle thinking about new people moving into the house only to discover trees filled with parrots screaming profanities. &quot;This wasn't in the listing!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
