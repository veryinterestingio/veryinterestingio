			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The back of the fridge will always be colder than the front. This is usually caused by opening the fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some fridges, they are cooled by a vent connecting to the freezer. How cool the fridge gets depends on how much the vent is open. I learned about this after I left some stuff too close to the vent and it ended up freezing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone I once knew would meal-prep Smoothies for breakfast. Putting assorted fruits in daily sandwich baggies to dump in his blender with other smoothie stuff.</p>
<p>Would you say blending frozen fruits in general works around the freezing texture issue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have frozen the following fruits myself and had good results with it: blueberries, bananas, mango, pineapple, and strawberries. Usually I buy frozen fruit so I can't guarantee that it works as well when you freeze it yourself, but I suspect it will be fine.</p>
<p>I have freezer-burnt fruit before and there's no saving that with blending.</p></div>		</li>
