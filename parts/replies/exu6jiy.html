<p>There is no point in having the capability to live for a very long time (maintaining your body at a cellular level) if you are just gonna die early from some external force. It would be more efficient to spend your energy on early reproduction or something else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As mentioned in the mission statement, ELI5 is not meant for literal 5-year-olds. Your explanation should be appropriate for laypeople. That is, people who are not professionals in that area. For example, a question about rocket science should be understandable by people who are not rocket scientists</p>

<p>Regardless, it’s pretty simple actually. </p>
<p>“Normally, this snack lasts a year, but I’m throwing away any that are left at bedtime, and you’ll never get any more.”</p>
<p>Tell any 5 year old that and there won’t be a single one left at bedtime.</p></div>		</li>

Therefore, From an evolutionary stand point, it is better to physically mature and produce offspring quicker (meaning aging/shorter lifespan) in order to pass along your genes.</p></div>		</li>
