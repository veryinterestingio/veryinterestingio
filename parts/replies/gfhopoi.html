<p>I first read it in one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. Someone explains that the world (a flat disc) is riding through space on four giant elephants riding on the back of a giant turtle, A'Tuin. The question is asked what's under A'Tuin?</p>
<p>Another turtle. And under that? It's turtles all the way down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think so? I haven't read them all, but in the first it's clearly stated that there's nothing under A'Tuin -- it just swims along, alone, through space.
And the Diskworld's sun manages to pass under the turtle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great A'Tuin has been mentioned to frequently roll on its belly to avoid asteroid and comet collisions, or even to snatch these projectiles out of the sky which might otherwise destroy the Disc. These stunts do not affect the Disc's population, other than to induce severe seasickness on anyone who happens to be looking at the night sky at that time. A'Tuin has been known to do more complex rolls and corkscrews, but these are rarer. This is similar to real-world sea turtles' habit of rolling over with their shell down to protect themselves from sharks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the established canon in Discworld and is clear to the readers from even The Colour of Magic, but different characters in the universe argue about the topic. I have definitely read a similar line in the Discworld books, and I believe that was either in Small Gods or Fifth Elephant. If you haven't read Small Gods, it's set long before the other books and it's approximately a parody of our scientific renaissance challenging the doctrine of Catholicism, only in the Discworld the church doctrine is heliocentrism. Many characters exchange speculations about what shape the world is, and at one point they find themselves in Ephebe with a bunch of drunk philosophers. I think it was an exchange between two of them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Speaking of turtles. &quot;There's good eating on one of those.&quot;</p>
<p>But &quot;When their <em>full attention</em> is in your grip, their hearts and minds will follow.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all true. Surprisingly perhaps, the Discworld theologies are not 100% consistent. And some characters do not have knowledge that we, the readers, are aware of. They debate all sorts of things.</p></div>		</li>
