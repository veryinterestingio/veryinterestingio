			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;essence&quot;.. &quot;composition&quot;.. dear lord, that committee REALLY wanted to reinvent the wheel and make their mark: &quot;lets call content essence and wrapper as a composition. That way everyone will remember how important we were. Sure it makes no sense, it is not intuitive and will cause confusion but each time that happens.. Guys, we will be immortalized.&quot;  </p>
<p>I HATE standard committees making up new words and terminology, usually there is absolutely no reason other than &quot;we need to be unique&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget, in 1999 when the SMPTE committee came up with all these names, digital media as we know it didn't exist.  They invented the wheel, not reinvented it.  Yeah, the names seem pretty stupid, but there were no names to use before, so they had to come up with something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i mean.....thats the technical jargon of it.  that is the content of the package because one thing isnt complete without the other.  the essence is the codec to unscrammble the composition....which is an accurate technical term for any artistic work.   these phrases have existed as long as the art has really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were actually very good reasons for all of this. It may not be immediately obvious to an outsider but the standards body works to accommodate the needs of its members. </p>
<p>DCP lets you re use components across different compositions. This is a big deal when it comes to versioning which is a huge deal for big studios that have their films in many countries. </p>
<p>The same general structure and concepts were adapted to being usable upstream in the workflow and this has been standardized as IMF.</p></div>		</li>
