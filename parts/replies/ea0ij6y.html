			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. From the Wikipedia above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The weight of the kilogram is then used to compute the mass of the kilogram by accurately determining the local Earth's gravity (the net acceleration combining gravitational and centrifugal effects); it can be measured using an instrument called gravimeter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the acceleration due to gravity acts equally on all objects in the local area, you can find the local gravity without needing an object with a precisely known mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So calculate local gravity, which can be done anywhere, then calculate the energy required to lift the object. Then via math you can find its mass. Cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that mean a kilogram changes from region to region? Or does the local gravity value get cancelled out in a calculation somewhere? I'm missing something here </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly this needs to be its own comment. It explained it (and links to 2 other videos for more detail) much better than we have here so far</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your explanation, but I think it would be more accurate to say that the standard ford focus used to be defined according to a specific car, and now it's defined according to the schematics.</p></div>		</li>
