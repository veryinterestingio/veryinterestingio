			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op but if I start working out regularly for a long time then my muscle gets stronger because of the tearing and healing of muscle, so if I suddenly stop working out will my muscle be stronger like it was when I was working out or will it become weaker?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally here, when I'm in the gym on a regular 3-5 day routine (different body part groupings change the days/week) and then go on a vacation for a week, where I'll tell myself I'll work out but end up drinking and eating garbage all week, I've come back to the gym with new PRs probably from the added healing time.</p>
<p>Id do it more often in my workout regimen but it's very easy to lose the 'now we go to the gym' habit in taking one week off ðŸ™„</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Fatigue masks fitness&quot; is a nice way of explaining this. You're getting stronger but also accumulating fatigue at the same time, so you don't notice exactly how much stronger you're getting.</p>
<p>That week off and surplus calories help deal with any residual fatigue and get you operating at 100% of your new capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you mantain a healthy diet your muscles will never go back to pure nothingness. But you'll lose some mass. I did a couple years of gym about 4/5 years ago and i still got some gains. Obv I'm not as big as before. But doing your normal day to day life will keep some of the muscles. I mean if you suddenly become tetraplegic you'll lose all your muscles. But that's just because you ain't even using them.</p>
<p>Edit: don't know the science behind atrophy. Just speaking from experience</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also anecdotally, I've felt that gains I've had are much easier to build up than when I built them up the first time around. My guess is that the cell nuclei you gain during building up aren't lost, but the sarcomers are. When you go to the gym again, you still have the heightened capacity for synthesizing new sarcomers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will be weaker than your peak state but stronger than the very beginning. And it will also be easier for you to 'regain' your muscles once you restart working out.</p>
<p>Like other said, working out involves tearing your muscles, letting them heal and they would grow larger. The growing part actually involves both quantity and measurement, meaning you would have more muscle fibres and each fibre will be thicker. </p>
<p>Think your muscle like a rope, the more fibre/string a rope has and thicker each fibre/string is, the more weight a rope can keep. Stop working out will generally only let your muscle fibres shrink, but you wouldn't lose the amount of extra fibres you grew (that's actually the harder part, to gain more muscle fibres).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly right, except for the growing more muscle fibers part. Only in extremely rare circumstances can adults actually increase the number of muscle fibers in their muscles. Under normal conditions of working out, 100% of strength and size gains are from the existing muscle cells/fibers getting larger.</p></div>		</li>
