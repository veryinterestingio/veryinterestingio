			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It's not really teaching animals to communicate beyond a cause/effect type situation. The main takeaway is that animals can <em>communicate</em>, but humans have <em>language.</em> </p>
<p>There are many aspects of human language that make it unique. One is called displacement, which is the ability to talk about things that are not in the here and now. Humans can talk about what happened yesterday, a year ago, or even what they plan to do in ten years. Animals don't have that ability. Many animals have communication systems like the monkeys that use different calls to signal the type of predator that is coming (i.e., how best to hide/protect themselves), and even honey bees that use a &quot;dance&quot; to tell others in the hive where a nearby food source is. But animals don't talk about what they had for dinner last night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Language part is so important. In sign language, a sign can only have so many meanings. In language we can have sarcasm which only can require specific context. Language is very complex indeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Koko isn't really doing sign language though, at least not ASL. She has a couple motions that her handler knows what she means by them, but it is basic things like &quot;I'm hungry&quot;. Koko is not stringing together sign language to create complex sentences to communicate abstract concepts. </p>
<p>Basically Kokos version of sign language is way over emphasized for the small amount of information she can communicate with it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering her handler was the only person to ever claim to &quot;communicate&quot; with KoKo it's pretty much been debunked that she was actually able to talk with anyone or do anything even remotely similar to holding a conversation of any type. Just about all of the experts in the world that met KoKo or researched KoKo agree that her handler was greatly exaggerating/straight up lying. No one ever communicated with KoKo or saw her communicate other than extremely basic signs for basic things. All the claims that she could talk or do anything out of the ordinary were never proven and was just hearsay from her handler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that Koko's communicator was lying when she said that Koko could talk through sign language. She just didn't use ASL or any other official language that researchers could keep track of. She most likely used Homesign-- a type of sign language most often used between a deaf individual and their family. Homesign is always specialized, and may not follow the same vocabulary or even grammar rules that a vocal language would. </p>
<p>However, I will not argue that Koko's communication was probably limited to basic things. We've tested other chimps before and not a single one of them could express novel ideas. They were almost always limited to basic words and could only express 1-2 ideas within an utterance.</p></div>		</li>
