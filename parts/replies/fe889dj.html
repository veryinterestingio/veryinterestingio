			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason I don't like images like the one that you linked is because they don't explain the more important part -- as the photographer zoomed in, he backed up.</p>
<p>The reason the dartboard looks so much bigger <em>as compared to the Blue Dude</em> at 135mm than, say, 24mm is because it is relatively closer. Let's say the dartboard is 10 feet behind the dude. At 135 mm, the photographer might be standing 20 feet away from the dude. The dartboard is only 1.5x farther away (20ft vs. 30ft). At 24mm, the photographer is standing 2 feet from the dude, and the dartboard is 6 times farther away (2 ft vs. 12 feet). The zoom doesn't <em>make</em> the perspective compression, it <em>enables</em> it by letting you get farther away from your foreground object. </p>
<p>If the photographer in your image stayed in the exact same location the whole time, just swapped lenses, and cropped so that blue dude filled the same amount of frame, the perspective would never change (you'd just get crappy pictures due to extreme cropping). </p>
<p>In my moon example (linked elsewhere), the reason it works is because the moon was &quot;only&quot; about 200,000 times further away than the Washington Monument.  If I'd been standing a quarter of a mile from the monument, the moon would have been a million times further away, and would have looked smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but he is asking why his camera can't take a good picture of the moon and the answer to that very question has to do with focal length, not so much with the ''moon illusion''. If he asked why sometimes the moon appeared as big as a building, then the ''moon illusion'' phenomenon would've been an appropriate answer.</p>
<p>Why does the moon sometimes looks as big as a building -&gt; Because of the moon illusion.</p>
<p>Why can't I take a good photo of that giant moon atop the building -&gt; Because a wide angle lens will make everything far away way too small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree completely that &quot;focal length&quot; is the answer to the question &quot;why can't I take a <em>good</em> picture of the moon looking as big as a building.&quot;</p>
<p>But the reason that focal length is the answer has to do with distance from the building. Imagine that OP is standing in a spot where (to the naked eye), the moon looked to be the same size as the building in front of it. If he pulls out his phone camera, and snaps a shot of it, the moon will <em>still</em> look to be exactly the same size as the building. They'll just both be tiny specs becuase phone cameras have wide angle lenses. If he crops it down so that the building fills the frame, the moon would also fill the frame -- they'd just both be horribly pixellated.</p>
<p>With a phone camera, the only way to get a better shot of the building is to move closer to it. But now the moon is (relatively) farther away, and looks smaller. With a good zoom lens, you can stay in the same place and zoom in. Focal length makes this possible, but it doesn't create the effect -- and example photos like the one you posted tend to obfuscate this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was replying to your statement that a wide angle lens makes the foreground and background look disproportionate, which is false. It's the ratio of the distance of the things far away and the things close by the lens that cause this effect. Using a wider angle lens just enables you to have more disproportion, but it's NOT a property of the lens itself. Lenses just show a wider or a narrower angle of view, but how things look is completely up to the photographer.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not true, it makes <em>everything</em> smaller, not just things far away.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol this makes my head hurt. Basically you're saying we're changing the distance between us and the subject but zooming to keep the subject relatively the same size creating the illusion that the background is drastically changing size right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.</p>
<p>By changing the ratio of the distances (you-to-subject vs. you-to-background), you actually <em>do</em> change the relative sizes, because perceived size is actually angular size. Let's use <a href="http://www.1728.org/angsize.htm" target="_blank">this</a> calculator for an example. Imagine that I have 2 items, each 1 foot tall, located 10 feet apart. I stand 1 foot away from the closer one. The closer item (1 foot from me) has an angular size of 53.13 Degrees. The farther item (11 feet from me) has an angular size of   5.2051 Degree -- less than 10% of the size. Now, I walk to 20 feet away. The closer item (20 feet away) has an angular size of 2.8642 Degrees, and the father item (30 feet away) is 1.9097 Degrees -- more than half the size. If I go to 100 feet away,  the angular sizes are now 0.57295 Degrees vs. 0.52087 Degrees -- almost identical.</p>
<p>This change in relative size is what your eye will see, and is what <em>any</em> camera will capture, at any focal length.</p>
<p>Zooming in just makes the photo not suck. I've actually been able to dig through my &quot;moon&quot; examples and demonstrate this. This is my &quot;good&quot; picture:   <a href="https://imgur.com/J9uyy6Q" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/J9uyy6Q" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/J9uyy6Q</a></a> , taken with a zoom of about 350 mm. This is a wide-angle photo (38 mm) taken from the same spot:  <a href="https://imgur.com/1GqZnyP" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/1GqZnyP" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/1GqZnyP</a></a>. Finally, this is a crop of that second picture:  <a href="https://imgur.com/wQAebSh" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/wQAebSh" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/wQAebSh</a></a>. As you can see, the relative size of the moon vs. the monument looks basically the same as the first picture, it's just of terrible quality because of how much I had to crop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most cameras these days have at least exposure compensation control, and some even have full manual modes.</p>
<p>So, if you don't have a suitable ND filter, crank the exposure compensation way down, or in manual mode, increase the shutter speed setting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it makes the foreground and background completely disproportionate. The longer and narrower the focal length, the more the foreground and background gets compressed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, but that's false. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/dwciox/why_does_the_moon_look_smaller_on_photos_than_it/f7ifv4c/" target="_blank">Here's a longer explanation from an older, similar question.</a></p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tod2qZnKZEQ" target="_blank">this video</a> I linked there debunks that misleading photo series of yours, which shows the effect of distance, not focal length.</p>
<p>Focal length, together with film/sensor size, determines the angle/field of view. You can take great moon shots both with wide and narrow fields of view, you just need to get the focus and exposure right. If you want to see more details in the moon, you simply need a higher magnification = narrower field of view, which can be achieved by increasing the focal length <em>or</em> decreasing the sensor size (while keeping sensor resolution constant, or better increasing). You're right that most phone cameras are unsuitable for that, because they have a wide field of view, which is more useful to people in &quot;normal&quot; situations. But with the advent of multicamera phones, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/eo2nmv/eli5_why_can_phone_cameras_not_take_good_photos/feaqngs/" target="_blank">that is starting to change</a>. Though if you want to take a really detailed shot of the moon, then your best option <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/eo2nmv/eli5_why_can_phone_cameras_not_take_good_photos/febia8c/" target="_blank">is a telescope.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to add to your comment, you could take a great shot of the moon with a wide angle lens if you had the correct exposure and enough resolution, what makes the moon look large in pictures is its size relative to the frame. You can get this with a wide angle lens by cropping the picture to the desired size.</p></div>		</li>
