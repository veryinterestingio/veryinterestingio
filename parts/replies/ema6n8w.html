The biggest animal of all time is still thought to be the blue whale. Oxygen levels more affected the giant insects hundreds of millions of years ago</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they don’t, it won’t be due to the reasons listed above. It’ll be due to the fact that their environment is very niche and specific, and is reliant upon specific wind and rain patterns coming out of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Large animals require a lot of biomass. Large trees require CO2, light, water, and various other micronutrients. The limiting factor for populations of sequoias, afaik, is water. If weather patterns change and their valley stops getting enough water, they’ll die off without intervention.</p>
<p>As for CO2, well that’s rising. Sunlight isn’t changing anytime soon. I’m not sure about the micronutrients in their environment but I suspect they’re relatively consistent.</p></div>		</li>
