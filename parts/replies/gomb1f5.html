<p>There are a tiny number of reinfections documented, most are related to immunocompromised people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There have only been a handful of infections after vaccination yet and most of those were less than two weeks after the first vaccination.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And even these are questionable, because COVID tests do not have 100% specificity. Having a positive test result, then months of negatives, then a positive 6 months later and feeling sick is not a 100% confirmation of reinfection. Given a large enough sample size, and a specificity of 98-99%, you would expect to start to see false positives that line up with other infections like a coincidental flu or cold.</p>
<p>For that reason, the evidence of a tiny number of reinfections, gathered from PCR testing, really isn’t that convincing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely correct. For example, prior tetanus infections offer no immunity to tetanus, while the vaccine is quite effective. In the case of covid, It may also depend on which vaccine you got. Almost everyone has been targeting the spikes as an antigen target. There are exceptions that use inactivated viruses instead. </p>
<p>It's most likely that a natural infection will offer better protection than the main vaccines you're likely to get. There are antibodies we can test for that you will not find in a vaccinated person. They are using these actually to test to see if vaccinated people got exposed to the real virus in Israel. Because the vaccine would not give you these antibodies, but a real exposure of the virus, even if the vaccine prevented it from forming an infection, should. </p>
<p>Because we are stimulating millions of people to create one form of antibodies, the virus is somewhat likely to mutate around this consolidated protection. If this happens, people who are previously infected might still be protected, while vaccinated people would be susceptible again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So far the opposite seems to be true. People have been reinfected with mutated variants after natural infection but the mRNA vaccine has protected against all variants so far because the spike protein is a major component. Mutating away from the spike is going to severely impact the virus' ability to infect as far as I'm aware. </p>
<p>For instance this nature article mentions the indispensable nature of the spike protein. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-020-0485-4" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-020-0485-4</a></p>
<p>If cov2 mutates the spike it is extremely like that it becomes significantly less dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your information isn't really correct. </p>
<p>The MRNA vaccines are shown to 95% effective in preventing symptomatic infections of the original strain. They are shown to be less effective with the South Africa strain as the spike has a different shape, but they do still offer quite a bit of protection. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, symptomatic reinfections are very rare. The current estimates range from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 10000, but this isn't based on a comparison of a control group so it's hard to tell who just isn't being re-exposed. That being said, most epidemiologists are pretty sure the risk of being infected after you recover is far less than 1%. </p>
<p>I know the first thing you'll do is point out that people have been reinfected, and you are absolutely correct. If the rate of reinfection was 1 in 10,000, with nearly 30 million known cases in the USA, you would expect to find 3,000 cases of symptomatic reinfection. We don't actually know the real numbers, but it's safe to say they are quite low. While you CAN be reinfected, it's very unlikely you will be. This also counts for the mutated strains. </p>
<p>Now, these numbers don't exist in a bubble. It's very situational. If you get exposed to a mutated strain, you are more likely to be reinfected than if you get an exposure to a more familiar strain. If you get a large exposure vs a small one, the odds change as well. </p>
<p>But the TLDR of this is that a natural infection is &gt; 99% protection while a vaccine is 70%, 90% or 95% depending which one you get. This is protection from symptomatic infection. Protection from severe infections is higher than that, and protection from death is quite high. I've never even heard of a reinfected or a vaccinated person dying from covid.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Some very tiny fraction of people have been <em>suspected</em> to be reinfected but these studies or case reports often fail to account for or consider specificity.</p>
<p>If you monitor enough people with a test that is only 98% specific, for a long enough period of time, you’re guaranteed to get false positives. And if the cohort is big enough, you’ll get false positives that coincidentally line up with symptoms from another infection like a cold or flu. </p>
<p>For this reason, studies that take confirmed COVID infections via PCR, and then monitor them for some number of months, again using PCR, are not that convincing to me. You can do the math and see that some false positive “reinfections” would be expected.</p></div>		</li>
