			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware, freezers work by being cold enough to inhibit the bacteria that cause food decomposition. An antibiotic wouldn't have that problem, so the freezer wouldn't help. Drugs go off due to chemical reactions, rather than actual rot, which can actually (rarely) make them toxic.</p>
<p>In addition, I wouldn't hang onto them for &quot;later use.&quot; Unless you're a doctor, you probably won't know when you have an infection as opposed to a virus, etc, and so you shouldn't just go taking antibiotics whenever you're sick - you'll be killing off bacteria your body actually needs. You're way better off sucking it up and making the trip to see your physician and accept a new prescription when you need it instead.</p>
<p>I did fact check this info as much as I could, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/antibiotics/the-danger-of-leftover-antibiotics/" target="_blank">here</a> is an article with both points in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reaction speed usually increases drastically with temperature. So if decomposition is an issue (depending on where the equilibrium for the reaction lies at that temperature) cooling will still help preserve it for longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Freezing also slows down chemical reactions. Freezing dry medication (e.g. pills) in waterproof containers in should in theory reduce chemical degradation from oxidation. However, some pills or other products may become less stable with freezing where it damages the physical structure in a way that compromises the medication within. I'm definitely not recommending anyone freeze medications to use at a later time, although in most cases it probably would extend the life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’d want a medical professional’s decision making for antibiotic choice. Self-diagnosis is not a great idea especially with infectious diseases. Give the wrong antibiotic and it won’t remove the bacteria causing the disease which could cause the disease to get worse.</p>
<p>Also a good argument against homeopathic medications which don’t do anything bad but also don’t do anything good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't even aware that different antibiotics served different purposes. Thanks for the explanation.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I seem ill-informed, I don't have many opportunities to go to a doctor, except in the most important circumstances - which have only come up once in my life, when I was 3 or 4. I know very little about personal health as a result.</p></div>		</li>
