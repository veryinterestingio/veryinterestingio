<p>It was previously thought that most of our immune cells circulate around the blood and either post guard at lymphoid organs (like lymph nodes and spleen) or go in and out of tissue patrolling for threats...We and others are finding that immune cells actually live (without leaving or recirculating) in the same tissue for years, where they protect us from infections and tumors. We still do not know how that works in terms of how they manage their food supply, which is key for their function and survival. To complicate things a bit more, it turns out their strategy to adapt to this long-term residence changes for every tissue, ie: the liver offers a very different environment than the skin or the gut.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have learned that we can leverage our own immune cells to combat tumors (aka cell therapy, ie: CAR-T, thanks Carl June!) but these therapies do not work very well yet for solid tumors. Understanding what needs to be added (or removed) to make these cells happier in solid tissue environments is key to improve their function... and achieve long-lasting cures.</p></div>		</li>
