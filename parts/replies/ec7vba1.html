			<div class="markdown"><p>Shelf stable. This is why grocery store ranch sucks. It is shelf stable. The Ken's you use in your restaurant has to stay in the walk in. It must be refrigerated and has a not too distant expiry date. The Ken's you buy at the grocery is stored at room temp and will last months.</p>
<p>The chemicals that allow them to sell Ranch at room temp that lasts months changes ranch into a weird, sour, bland, slightly slimy mess. Any dressing really. All sorts of preservatives and stabilizers and replacements change a product. </p>
<p>If you are lazy you can buy the refrigerated ranch, but it still isn't as good. The best way to go about it is to buy the packets and make it yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The refrigerated ranch is typically shipped and stored non-refrigerated, and displayed in the refrigerated case to add appeal. If you check, they will usually say “refrigerate after opening” </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's telling you that the ranch used to be refrigerated, but it still is, too.</p>
<p>Seriously though, why wouldn't it say &quot;refrigerate after opening&quot; either way? Would they really waste refrigerated display space on something that doesn't need it?</p></div>		</li>
