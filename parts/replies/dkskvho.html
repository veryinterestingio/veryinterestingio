			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask what your first language is? And do you speak more than two?
I'm a language geek and I love learning and speaking foreign language so much. I find it absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>Also your English really isn't bad. Easily understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly, my first language is Croatian as iam croat. I the terms of english language i have no trouble in reading and understanding what ive read since my vocabulary is very good IMHO but but when it comes to speaking i tend to &quot;block&quot;. Writing isnt much of a problem as I have enough time to &quot;make my mind&quot;. Much of my english is selflearned through movies and cartoons (subtitles helped a lot) so Ive never had any troubles with my english in school, except for grammar. Ive never learned proper grammar because iam lazy as hell. I know something Italian too, but only so much... I understand more then i can &quot;talk it&quot; but that is really just a few words.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support and for all the answers in a thread!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It needs to be reiterated.... the only people that might be confused aren't very intelligent English speakers, and it is a DRAG to talk to them. Just watch the news.</p></div>		</li>
