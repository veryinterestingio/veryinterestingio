			<div class="markdown"><p>Permanent viruses are permanent because they establish a latency, whether by integration(retrovirus) or episome formation(herpesvirus, papillomavirus, polyomavirus). Some are permanent because they multiply in low numbers, and don’t disturb the immune system(adenovirus). Others are “permanent” because they leave lasting damage in the tissues they infect, despite being cleared by the immune system. Things like the flu and rabies are RNA viruses so they have no way of establishing a latency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>rabies can only be in your system for a maximum of 6 months depending on the location of the bite and the severity before death. is this taken in consideration when calling it a permanent virus? as far as I know, herpes isn't as fatal.</p></div>		</li>
