			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but for CPR, we need more oxygen. It's better than nothing (and definitely helps a lot), but when the EMTs come, they will resuscitate with &gt;90% oxygen from bottles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newer advice is generally that there's enough oxygen in the blood to keep tissue alive until paramedics arrive. The chest compressions to keep blood circulation is the important part of CPR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that healthy people don't need more than 21% oxygen at sea level for CPR. A normal bag type mask which is often used only pushes through ambient air and is not attached to an O2 tank.</p>
<p>The O2 tank comes in when people have other respiratory issues or where O2 saturation isn't good enough through the normal methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you were doing CPR at an altitude of 2750, but you were on a plane with a pressurized cabin, but the cabin was breached in a snakes on a plane type scenario, but you were in the luggage compartment where it‚Äôs not pressurized anyways (Edit: due to snakes also)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normal O2 functions for humans is 19-22%. Below that you start having effects. An unconscious person wouldn't have effects at 15%, but a conscious person would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>K√ºpper et al. say that oxygen concentration between 17.0‚Äì14.8% does not cause any risk for healthy people by hypoxia. It also does not cause risks for people with chronic diseases of moderate severity. The ability for strenuous work is reduced as the concentration decreases with the time that exertion can be sustained becoming very low below these levels, below around 17% it may be necessary to take breaks outside the environment if more than 6 hours is to be spent inside, especially if any physical exertion is performed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, from what I heard, the important part of CPR is keeping the hearth pumping so oxygen flow in the body. Also pumping the hearth makes the lungs push and pull air into it.</p>
<p>I may be wrong though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you heard correctly. Chest compressions with minimal interruptions is key, because every time to stop, it takes several compressions to ‚Äúfill the pump‚Äù again. Layperson CPR doesn‚Äôt even teach mouth to mouth anymore. It‚Äôs just compressions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this. If you witness the person go down, they've still got plenty of oxygen left in their lungs, unless it's a drowning victim. Also laypeople are crap at swapping from compressions to breaths if it's only one person doing cpr; you're supposed to not stop compressions for more than 10 seconds to give the breath and, well, they can't do that. Better to keep pumping until someone trained arrives with the O2 canister.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an experiment you can perform with your significant other: lock lips and only breath the air the other person breaths out, back and forth. After 10-20 seconds, 90% the shared oxygen is depleted and you will feel like your suffocating.</p></div>		</li>
