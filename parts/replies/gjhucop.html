			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately both of those links are news stories and not scientific papers. There's no way they're using the correct wording. </p>
<p>&quot;But this new strain of COVID is up to 70 percent more contagious&quot; is meaningless coming from a local news story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Straight from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e2.htm?s_cid=mm7003e2_w" target="_blank">CDC PDF, pg. 4: &quot;  B.1.1.7 is assumed to be 50% more transmissible than current variants</a>&quot;</p>
<p>The NYTimes is pretty trustworthy. Its not like they did their own epidemiological studies. Their reporting and analysis is beyond reproach here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; If the variant were about 50 percent more contagious, as suggested by data from Britain, it would become the predominant source of all infections in the United States by March, the model showed. A slow rollout of vaccinations would hasten that fate. &quot;</p>

Your skepticism is misplaced. Unless you have other data to contradict this. Go ahead, I'm all ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember this from June / July, and one thing I wondered was whether the fact that people were moving mattered.  Even if they weren't maintaining consistent distance, if they were either milling about or walking as a group, that might greatly reduce the odds of one infected person's virus infecting another.  Either you're not near the <em>same</em> person for a sustained time, or you're all walking along dispersing the air around you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A majority of people there didn't wear masks, and many (maybe a larger majority?) were covid skeptics who went into bars and restaurants and other retail businesses.  Without masks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which event? If you're referring to a political rally or something, then the use of masks will matter a lot, and if it's a large enclosed space (e.g., an indoor stadium) then it's not really helping that it &quot;feels&quot; outdoors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Believe they are referring to Sturgis Motorcycle rally. Where the vast majority were not wearing masks, were anti-maskers, or participated in events that would normally be obvious spreader events just to spite the people that say not to.</p></div>		</li>
