			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing is fairly common. As the med student was talking about, pain and sensations inside the body are poorly localized. Since that structure (the urachus) that went from the bladder to the belly button contained nerve branches from nerves that also go to the bladder, the brain sometimes gets confused where the sensation is actually happening. So the brain thinks &quot;that pressure I'm feeling is not actually the belly button, it's the bladder being full. Time to pee&quot;. It's similar to why heart attacks cause arm pain or getting kicked in the balls hurts in your lower abdomen.</p></div>		</li>
