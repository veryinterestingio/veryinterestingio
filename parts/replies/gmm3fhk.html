<p>What's really useful to know: Loperamide will eliminate withdrawal, and it's OTC. Eliminate it very nearly completely. No, not just the diarhhea. It binds all peripheral opioid receptors, so stops all peripheral symptoms, which is basically all of them. You'll need way more than indicated, 20-40 pills, but it works.</p>
<p>Don't take more. Yes you can technically take an order of magnitude more, overload the mechanism that ordinarily keeps it out of the brain, and actually get high, but that's associated with sometimes fatal heart arrhythmia. Which already got bottles banned (blister packs only now, max 24 per box), soon it will be behind the counter and limited if idiots keep dying.</p>
<p>And also note, this works because it's an opioid. So you're still addicted. But it's far easier to taper when neither withdrawal nor being high are present.</p></div>		</li>
