			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that there's so many different causes for birthmarks, it's not a wild stretch to say at least some of them might be born out of developmental genetics. Your rough blueprint is complete at birth and outside of abnormal development certain parts <strong>will</strong> happen. If it's a birthmark caused by any part of your development you have a decent chance (it's not really 50/50 given it's developmental and there's no way to know if it's recessive) of you having it in your rough blueprint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well as I said, my specialty is not dermatology, but from a basic genetics point of view we surgeons use to explain stuff like this: Something your parent or grandparent has you could also have or are more likely to have. In the case of the white patch of hair I'd say there was a roughly 1 in 8 chance he'd inherit it (don't hang me for this, the chances in genetics are not my specialty either, but since this is ELI5 this should be good enough), therefore if he has other siblings they shouldn't have the same mark (atleast not statistically).</p></div>		</li>

My middle daughter (who has a lot of my DNA (my height, I'm taller than the average woman, my coloring, and my body type)) has the exact same birth mark but smaller and on the opposite arm. So that's weird. Lol</p></div>		</li>

My mum doesn't have any others and we aren't sure about grandmum since she passed a long time ago. I also have a birthmark on the bottom of my foot of a crescent moon that no one else in my family seems to share, but the third nipple thing seems to be pretty prominent for the women on my mum's side.</p></div>		</li>

He's nearly 3 now and it's still there. Think the doc said it's something to do with the amount of capillaries in that area.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 6 year old had 3 red spots (vascular birth marks that run in my wifes family) that became more apparent in the first few months. They are all gone now, if you know where to look the skin is still a little raised in those areas but the redness is gone and the skin tans and looks the same as anywhere else. Dr. said about 50% of them go away per year on their own and by 5 years very few kids still have them but you can get them treated if they are an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the stork bite too. My dad has a small one, mine is huge red stripe down the center of my neck. I have been asked occasionally if I injured my neck because it looks like a straight line. My daughter also has a stork bite, but hers is smaller and mostly covered by her hair. She also has a big birthmark on her forehead, which has mostly faded but shows a little when she gets mad. That one is interesting because she has freckles all over one side of her forehead, up to the birthmark, and then no freckles on the other side. Not sure why that is but I think it’s neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is accurate, you have a piece of skin with little to no melanin. We call that depigmentation. It could be caused by trauma (skin lesions and grafts for example), scaring or just plain simple inverse formation of the same proces that creates normal birthmarks. In extremely rare cases it could be a case of chimerism but I won't go in to that unless necesary.
On another note: I see many of them on my patients but not as many as regular birthmarks. But this is anecdotal evidence and is therefore shit. Also I'm an orthopaedic surgeon so I usually don't really check for birthmarks if they are not in the way of my scalpel.</p></div>		</li>
