			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very unlikely that &quot;tornado alley&quot; would cross the Appalachian mountains (because this kind of geography is not conducive to tornadoes), but it is possible that climate could change in a way that drastically reduces the prevalence of tornadoes across the US. However, the current trends suggest that the prevalence of tornadoes is increasing in the US overall. So probably you're not going to see tornadoes disappear entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tornadoes are undeniably awful beasts. But they are also amazing to witness. Kind of like a train wreck. Don’t want them to happen but can’t look away when they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think regardless of what happens to 'tornado alley', you will continue to see Tornados. When gulf air pushes northward and runs into cold fronts pushing east, you will have the moist gulf air interacting and getting lifted by the higher density cold dry air behind the cold front. Combine that with speed and directional shear as a result of this interaction and you will still have favorable formation parameters being met in many places.</p></div>		</li>
