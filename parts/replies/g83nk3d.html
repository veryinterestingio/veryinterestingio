			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really that much efficient over using qwerty and the abbreviations you’re comfortable with? I wonder how many words per minute can change ( especially since computers can be programmed as well) . Could qwerty ever catch up</p>
<p>edit: pls stop answering that qwerty was made to be slow. i already knew that and after 50 comments saying the exact same thing, I figure that this is common knowledge. the thing is we don’t use typewriters anymore. I’m talking about programmed computers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only type a single letter at a time on a QWERTY keyboard, whereas you more or less type single syllables at a time using multiple key presses at a time as a stenographer.</p>
<p>Most of the words in this comment could be typed as one or two chords on a stenographer keyboard, but would be hard to read if they were shortened to one or two letters on a normal keyboard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can add to this, my wife is a court reporter.</p>
<p>I type <del>quick</del> quite fast, upwards of 130-150 WPM, and in order to be certified you have to pass your last Steno test at 225 WPM with an extremely high degree of accuracy (I believe it was 96%+?).</p>
<p>Additionally you might be writing (steno calls it writing, not typing) for 3 - 4 hours continuously with no break. During that time you might be called on to do a 'read back', which means reading back something a lawyer or witness previously stated. Obviously those read backs are expected to be perfect, so accuracy is paramount.</p>
<p>Macros and shortcuts they can <del>customized</del> customize in their stenotype dictionary, allow them to do entire series of phrases or sentences with a single key stroke (let the record show), which further boost their overall writing speed.</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> Fixed spelling. I would be a proofers nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QWERTY or AZERTY or Dvorak or whatever is still fundamentally a one-keypress-per-letter, one-keypress-at-a-time system, so it'll never be able to keep up with stenography, which can punch in entire words or phrases for certain key combinations, and defaults back to a keypress per sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stenotype machines don't type a single letter per key stroke, you're basically typing an entire syllable, word or even sometimes sentence, at once, in a short hand that can be read. It's difficult to explain, but for example think about how long it takes to type out &quot;Will you state your full name.&quot; A stenographer literally types that out with only 2 motions. First typing 3 keys at once, then typing 8 keys at once. If you look at a printout of an old style stenotype, you'll see something like</p>
<p>HR    U</p>
<p>ST      A    UFRP L</p>
<p>each line being a single motion, all that is typed out in about a second. A stenographer (and nowadays a computer) would read that as &quot;Will you state your name&quot;</p>
<p>In all, &quot;Will you state your name for the record&quot; is typed out with only 6 strokes.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what's being typed. again, each line is a single motion, all the letters in each horizontal line are being pressed at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://2e9620bc94566eb78d03-9c5b5f41f05a023c2430aa3232a7d8c5.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/Steno.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://2e9620bc94566eb78d03-9c5b5f41f05a023c2430aa3232a7d8c5.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/Steno.jpg" target="_blank">https://2e9620bc94566eb78d03-9c5b5f41f05a023c2430aa3232a7d8c5.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/Steno.jpg</a></a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was looking for someone to drop the knowledge like this. One term for this that differentiates stenotype from QWERTY is that it’s a “chording” keyboard. Just like a piano keyboard, it accepts combinations of keys instead of processing keys one by one.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is that the stenographer isn’t usually thinking about how to spell each word out letter-by-letter; instead they are hearing the sounds and syllables being spoken, and translating those directly to combinations of keys to press.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pulling numbers out of no where?</p>
<p>Use the average or some other quantile. The average wpm rounded to nearest 50 is:</p>
<p>50 QWERTY</p>
<p>200 Stenographer (no specific keyboard)</p>
<p>However the average person don't train to be fast typers unlike Sternographers. So this statistics has flaws. It's best to compare Sternographers to professional QWERTY typers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually worked for almost 20 years in the speech recognition industry, that's why I asked. People actually overestimate the accuracy of human transcribers. Granted, stenographers are specifically trained for the purpose and thus clearly still better than an automated system, but at my previous company we already ran into the problem that our hired human transcribers made about the same amount of mistakes as our best system. Fatigue and distraction is something people underestimate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this! I’m not a steno, but I do transcription, which is basically the same thing without the faster keyboard. Main difference is we do post-production instead of live content. </p>
<p>Yes, auto programs exist, but the industry evolved with it. The software can only handle extremely clear audio. Even then, it’s not really legible. </p>
<p>So some companies hire editors to go through the auto text and make it easier to read, ie fix grammar and misheard words. Other companies that deal with scratchy audio, like phone calls, don’t bother at all because it comes out a jumbled mess. </p>
<p>I hope this answers your question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. There are '<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mask+steno+reporter&amp;t=brave&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Fbloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com%2Fjournaltimes.com%2Fcontent%2Ftncms%2Fassets%2Fv3%2Feditorial%2F0%2F7d%2F07d43db9-5249-59fe-8496-7acb58a6e176%2F56a81a1e8a2ce.image.jpg%3Fresize%3D1200%2C1024" target="_blank">mask</a>' reporters, and have been for a decade or two. They just talk into a small speaker and then type it out after the fact. Many reporters also record the hearing just for luck. But the audio quality is usually piss-poor (professional audio capture is hard!).</p>
<p>I think there will be trouble automating the process. Namely for liability. Its an official court record, it must be accurate. And if its not, someone meeds to be responsible. Also theres basic problems with machines; Synonyms, funny names, slang, ebonics, and idioms will be problematic.</p></div>		</li>

I don’t spend much time in court, but when I’m there for hearings which are being recorded and/or transcribed, these mask reporters are used more often than not. The hearings are also recorded by non-amplifying microphones. Just wanted to back up what you said in your comment.</p></div>		</li>
