			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren’t that tiny. You can see them with your eyes . And the nerves on the end on the severed end are dead. They are like the insulation around a wire minus the wires. The new nerves need this to grow into as it’s a microscopic guide to all the little places the individual nerves need to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re confusing nerves with neurons. Nerves are made up of nervous tissue which itself is composed of different types of cells, the neuron being the one most everyone is familiar with. But there are other cells besides neurons that make up nervous tissue. Nerves are just bundles of neurons and these other cells. Even though the neuron is microscopic, it’s axon can be extremely long (like the full length of a limb) and when a bunch of them are bundled together as a nerve tract they can be huge and easily visible to the unaided eye. These bundles are wrapped in multiple layers of connective tissue. This connective tissue isn’t like the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath only covers the axon of individual neurons. And again, a nerve is just a bundle of these. That connective tissue that covers the bundles is what the surgeons are reattaching. The hope is that the native nervous tissue can use the donor nerve as scaffolding. I don’t think they can reconnect the axon terminals to other neurons. Those are just too small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very detailed stuff and still not fully explained like everything else in human brain but, in central nervous system which is basically spinal cord and above, a protein called Nogo factor is produced that inhibits nerves to regrow after trauma or damage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nerves in your limb are actually the projections of nerves higher up towards or in the spinal cord. So when you cut them, they die past the cut and I think sometimes they shrivel up all the way up to the spine, but the cells are still alive higher up. These cells can sprout new nerve extensions which can grow into the old nerve “tunnel”. The white nerves fibers in the spine come from the brain ...and for some reason those nerve fibers (axons) won’t do this trick of jumping across a cut. Partly because the spinal cord has a rich blood supply as it’s composed of living cells (the gray butterfly shaped part) not just axons. This leads to inflammation , swelling , scar tissue. For nerves to jump across a break they need to be within like a millimeter or less.</p></div>		</li>
