It’s best to not rely on some random website protections and use strong password that cannot be breached even with very fast computers.</p>
<p>You can use an uncommon sentence or at best password manager (like Bitwarden) to generate long and strong password.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The worst is that a lot of websites, even some that deal with sensitive info like credit cards etc, have for some reason a LIMIT on how long you password can be. I use an offline password manager, so I can really have a password as long as I want, but I've seen limits as short as 12 characters. 12! What kind of fucking moron thought to limit my security to 12 characters? It was on some fairly important site too IIRC. If you MUST set a limit, at least let it be like 128 characters...</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is dumb, but the point is they don't do it because they think it's a good idea, they do it because they have to.</p></div>		</li>
