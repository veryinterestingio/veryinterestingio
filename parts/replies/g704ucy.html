			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>-Eat carbs. </p>
<p>-Body creates insulin to process the carby sugar. </p>
<p>-If body produces too much insulin, blood sugar goes low.</p>
<p>-Low blood sugar is known as hypoglycemia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m hypoglycemic and this happens to me a lot. I sometimes wake up hungry at 3am or so and have to have a middle of the night snack or I can’t go back to sleep. Normally if I eat enough protein and fat before bed (8pm for a 10pm bedtime) then I make it through the night. I’ll still wake up hungry but not starving like some days.</p></div>		</li>
