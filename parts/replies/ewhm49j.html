<p>He said people really valued: alcohol, medicine (specifically diarrhea meds), cigarettes, lighters, and small stoves.  He also mentioned stuff like antiseptics and tampons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the food is not they're to easy to acquire. The problem is there perishable (don't hold value for long), and are not very dense (imagine amount of carrots to pay for a car vs. few ounces of gold). Also hard to achieve uniformity. 1kg of pure gold is equal to any other 1kg of pure gold, 1kg of carrots can be with mold, or half chewed etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how many carrots is 1kg of gold worth? That is one issue I always have with this. I'll be sitting here with my bag of rice and someone will offer me a bar of silver for it. Is that a lot? I have no idea what rice should cost in silver. I do know, however, how many days of calories are in a bag of rice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is as much as the local rice market demands. If there are a lot of rice sellers in the market place, and one dude with a silver dime, rice cost one silver dime per kilo. (a US silver dime a.k.a Mercury dime is worth about $1 today).</p>
<p>If there is one rice seller, and 100 rice buyers, you can bet that kilo of rice is more like a 1 oz. silver dollar coin (worth about $17 today).</p>
<p>money is an abstraction layer. Gold doesn't have any intrinsic value, it is only worth what people think it is worth. I had a metal ores class, the instructor said 78% of gold is jewelry, 18% is coins, and 3% is in industrial use (phones etc).</p>
<p>Yet people seem to think that gold is worth $1500 per troy ounce \~1/32 of a kilo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curiously, if you compare the price of gold to the price of bread, the price of a loaf of bread in grams of gold has not changed much over the last few hundred years.  Just because <em>you</em> don't currently know the value of the Eastern Caribbean Dollar (for example) doesn't make it useless as a currency.</p></div>		</li>
