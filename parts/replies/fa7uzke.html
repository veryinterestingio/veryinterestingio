			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s plenty of CO2 wastefulness going on but paper is a weird thing to make your focus. The acreage is replanted after being cut (pulling more CO2 out of the air), not all paper ends up in landfills, and many landfills capture/use the gases they release.  </p>
<p>I’m not here to defend clear cutting or the environmental damage mono-cropping does. There’s plenty of reasons to dislike wasting paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people are getting sidetracked here.  The question was about the effectiveness of burying trees as a method of carbon sequestration.  Paper makes up a very large chunk of landfill content and so I thought of it first in regards to this question.  Besides, landfills don't actually decompose things quickly and so the CO2 they release, at least from paper, would be pretty small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The March, 1976 issue of the <em>Journal of Irreproducible Results</em> had the paper &quot;National Geographic: Doomsday Machine&quot;, describing how the magazine, being sent to subscribers all over the country, is <em>never thrown away</em> because it is so beautiful. Thus the continent will sink into the Earth from the added weight.</p>
<p>My own thought was that these magazines, stored in attics and basements around the world, represent a huge tonnage of carbon dioxide sequestered from the natural carbon cycle.</p></div>		</li>
