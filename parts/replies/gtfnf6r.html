<p>If you make the cut deep enough, you may puke some blood, but you are also knelt there with your intestine on your lap. So coughing a little blood probably isn't noteworthy.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be a slow way to die, as a form of ritual punishment/atonement. You could be offered mercy and be decapitated, but only after you had atoned by making the fatal cut.</p></div>		</li>
