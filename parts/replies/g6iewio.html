<p>The city I grew up in (Aachen, ger), as far as I know, is the pinnacle of these shenanigans:
Aix-la-chapelle (fr), Aken (NL), Aquisgran (it, so (methinks)), Cachy (cz)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean no, but it served as the imperial residence and crowning location for many Holy Roman Emperors and was the capital of the Carolingian and even Frankish (for a time) Empires. Important, but if there's ever been a &quot;capital of Europe&quot; it was Rome, Ravenna or Constantinople.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edited to add: I nearly missed an international flight once because I thought Tournai and Turnhout were the same place. The train to Turnhout stopped at Brussels airport but I hopped on one to Tournai which is in the opposite corner of Belgium...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exonyms are often conservative. Florence retains the flo- from Florentia, Firenze  went through a sound change Floren- -&gt; Fioren- -&gt; Firen-, with the -tia ending becoming -ze.</p>
<p>Tried to figure out the sound changes in general, but I guess some of this is particular Tuscanian. Maybe if Florence was in a slightly different place on the Italian peninsula the name would have been <em>Florenza</em>...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be careful travelling by train around Switzerland.  Many cities have different names in different official languages.  While the written destination signs at stations generally show the name of the city in the language spoken in that city, the audio announcements will use the name of the city in the language of the announcement.  If you are Z√ºrich, the sign will say the train is going to Gen√®ve, the announcement will tell you the train is going to Genf, and as an English speaker you want to go to Geneva.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ginebra is the cities name Spanish. Switzerland has German, French, Italian and Romansh as official languages. You would not see or hear &quot;Ginebra&quot; in official announcements and no one will pronounce it that way. It's Genf/Gen√®ve/Ginevra/Genevra. If anything Ginebra is closest to the Italian pronunciation.</p></div>		</li>
