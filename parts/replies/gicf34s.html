			<div class="markdown"><p>Reddit is actually disgusting on Android.</p>
<p>I analyzed it a few weeks ago, launches using 100mb of ram right away, scroll down 10 posts + 100mb, keep scrolling and scrolling, soon enough you'll hit 1gb, it only frees up memory if the phone doesn't have enough. Literally doing the bare minimum to avoid getting killed.</p>
<p>I have no idea who develops this app but I want to slap them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheaper than the flagship yes, but it was $700-800, hardly a cheap phone. I also didn’t have these problems the first year or so I had it, so maybe something is wrong with my iOS install, or maybe app devs have gotten really sloppy lately lmao</p></div>		</li>
