			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like whenever this happens to me, I'm at rest (sitting at my desk, for instance). The sound is overwhelming but quickly and smoothly fades to nothing. I can't really picture the physiology behind any of those three reasons being the culprit. I'm quite confident this is the same phenomenon that OP is describing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I’ll be on my couch or in my car and all of a sudden a high pitch noise will stream into my ear almost making me flinch to kind of get it away, but never lasts more than 10 seconds. Never been a worry just always wondered wtf is actually happening</p></div>		</li>
