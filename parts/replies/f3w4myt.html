			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation touches on water's latent heat of boiling, but it doesn't address the difference in heat capacity between solid and liquid water. The reason why liquid water has a higher heat capacity is because there are more degrees of freedom for molecular movement. In solid water, the lattice can only vibrate with heating. In liquid water, the molecules can vibrate but also translate and rotate freely. More degrees of rotational/translational freedom means more capacity to gain additional kinetic energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close enough. Although maybe stress that liquid water doesn’t have ‘permanent’ hydrogen bonds like ice. H-bonds are continually forming and breaking between molecules, giving a net effect which is responsible for the higher heat capacity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great points from u/LongestNeck and u/therift289</p>
<p>I neglected to touch on the solid phase of water entirely even though OP did ask about it. Bringing in the behavior of hydrogen bonding in ice really helps to understand hydrogen bonding as a whole, and especially as it pertains to water.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div>		</li>
