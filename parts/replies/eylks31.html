			<div class="markdown"><p>The person above them referred to laptops and smartphones in general, saying the price difference was about 2.5x.</p>
<p>The responder then mentioned Apple--one specific company that makes such products, and one of the most popular at that--and mentioned the price difference among their products is even bigger, at about 4x.</p>
<p>While Apple's laptops aren't top of the line spec-wise, as others have pointed out, I think the comment was valid in pointing out the price difference can be much larger than 2.5x among popular manufacturers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sell so many apple computers and laptops at my job and always try and convince people to buy an different kind. Yea that's always an losing battle. Ppl care about name brand over the actually specs. I work in an casino also which means we mark them up even more then out in town. Seen someone spend 6k on an macbook before and just laughed to myself about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>32GB RAM, 4TB SSD, Vega 20 w/ 4GB, 8core i9 w/ turbo to 5GHz, finger print ID, 15&quot; 2880x1800 ISP display w/ P3 gamut</p>
<p>For the same price you could go to a PC with 64GB RAM, 512GB SSD (and 1TB spinning disk), 17&quot; sRGB 4k display RTX 2080 for the same price. But it weighs more than twice as much, has less storage (and most of it is slower), no finger print reader, worse color on the screen... for many people that's better, but for some people having a compromise between power and is their sweet spot.</p></div>		</li>
