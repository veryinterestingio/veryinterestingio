<p>Not sure which universities out there allow their undergrads to inject highly controlled substances into each other... my university biology labs barely trusted us with using a centrifuge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They still teach the course to this day. It passed all the ethical approval required and just needed informed consent.</p>
<p>You have a good day.</p>
<p>Edit: I was the volunteer for all of the practicals since one of the ethical requirements was that your doctors was within the city of Manchester and I was born there. It was fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does pharmacy school work in the UK? Do you need a 4 year undergrad before applying or do you go directly there? </p>
<p>Here in North America, I feel like there's very little chance the experiment would receive approval in an undergrad setting. I'm not even sure they'd even get approval to store morphine, let alone allow students to inject it into each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And it passes through the skin quite rapidly. Takes only about an hour until the patient feels the first pain relieve from a transdermal patch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes of course patches are great but in relation to the OP thatâ€™s very different to getting a drop on your hand. Those things are designed for that and are literally pressed against your skin. I am not very well clued up on how these patches deliver the drug but I suspect that the adhesive contains some form of carrier Within the bulking agents to regulate absorption rather than being just dry Fentanyl .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In duragesic or related patches there's no penetration enhancer, it's literally a matrix of drug in polymer behind a membrane designed for somewhat linear release over 72 hours.</p>
<p>You can touch fentanyl and just wash it off no worries, but if you get more than a few mg on your skin and it sticks cause you are sweating, you will readily absorb enough fentanyl to become dangerous.</p>
<p>Fentanyl is lipophilic enough to pass through the skin without any help.</p>
<p>Plus there's always a huge inhalation risk when encountering bulk fentanyl. Someone dropping a package of it will put more than enough of it airborne, and bioavailability through the lung is basically 100%.  So inhale 1 mg of Fentanyl, without Naloxone, and it's looking bad.</p></div>		</li>
