			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, hominids without fire presumably ate meat in similar ways as most other apes. Which is to say raw and opportunistically. </p>
<p>Still, one might think of some activities as precursors to cooking, in the vein of ‘preparing food’. Like opening shellfish, removing unpleasant tasting organs, cleaning, gutting, using tools to scrape off meat or crack bones for marrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to point out there are many recent humans that ate more raw meat than cooked meat. For instance, traditionally the Inuit ate a lot of raw meat such as seal and caribou meat. Fish was often dried or eaten raw. Bird eggs usually eaten raw. Some things were boiled, but I think most meat was eaten raw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting aspect to this is how cooking encouraged development in humans.</p>
<p>If you take a food item - let’s call it a potato - you have to consider how much energy you spend gathering, eating and digesting it to calculate its overall calorie budget.</p>
<p>Say the potato has 100 calories of energy in it, but you spend 10 calories gathering it and 40 digesting it raw. You only wind up netting 50 calories of energy.</p>
<p>The big advantage of cooking is it softens foods so they’re easier to digest. Now you’re only spending 20 calories to digest it and you’ve gotten an extra 20 calories for your body to use, such as supporting a bigger brain, which is a real energy hog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of fascinating connections between our early diet and development. </p>
<p>If I remember correctly, we are uniquely efficient at processing fish proteins compared to other apes. There’s a whole bunch of interesting features about humans that point to a fair deal of activity around water. Like downturned noses that enable diving, or the way our fingers and toes wrinkle up for better grip when they get wet. Having access to those fish proteins were probably a great boost in terms of enabling bigger brains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been a lot of debate about water and humans. They have some valid points. What other mammals have so little hair? Ones that spend a lot of time in the water primarily. Then again, muskrats and other mammals live in the water and have lots of hair, so it's not conclusive. I quite like the idea that we spent enough time adjacent to the sea to fit in there.</p></div>		</li>
