			<div class="markdown"><p>Housing costs have gone up, but so has medical insurance, childcare, and car expenses. I don’t have exact figures but back in the day about a half of your income would go towards these expenses, but today it’s about 3/4s. These are fixed expenses that are very difficult to trim back on. </p>
<p>The housing market has also shifted away from constructing entry level homes, so even if you wanted to find smaller, more modest homes in an affordable price range, you can’t. Housing is being built for people who’ve already bought and sold several houses and are already in the upper levels of income. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The technological progress we’ve seen over the last 20-some-odd years has been amazing, but has definitely hit us all in the pocket book. </p>
<p>Also, if you look at a common house built in the 50’s vs one built today, they’re completely different in terms of size and amenities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, you were probably paying subscriptions for a newspaper, multiple magazines, paying per minute rather than flat costs for land line telephone conversations (which were also far more common since texting didn't exist).</p>
<p>The overall cost has gone up, but it's been somewhat ameliorated by other factors becoming less relevant.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe in some areas. There are HUGE new housing developments made exclusively for first home buyers.</p>
<p>I would be interested to see numbers for how many houses are built to sell to first home buyers vs not. It doesn't sound accurate to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“The “over $500k” market is showing some momentum but the “under $200k” market has essentially collapsed since the mid-aughts “</p>
<p>Some other stuff I was seeing was saying entry level housing construction  is getting back on the rise. Where I am most new housing is luxury condos, for lease, with some lower-income units but not a lot for the middle class. </p>
<p>From the same article “The bottom line is that it’s going to be incredibly difficult to build new starter homes going forward in this sort of environment.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is iffy. Because housing varies like crazy. There are tons of nice houses where I live that can be had with an acre or so of land for $200k or less. But just get near the lake and little tiny houses are nuts. But then go to California, and my colleague who makes much more than me, can hardly afford an apartment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 2016, the Census reported that the median household income was $57,617 whereas the median household price was around $300(EDIT: $300<strong>k</strong>). So maybe 10x was a bit of an exaggeration and it's closer to 5.</p>
<p>But this is still disproportionate from several decades ago. The median household income in 1965 was $6,900 whereas the median household price was around $20,000, so under 3x.</p>
<p>While we can quibble over specific numbers the conclusion doesn't change: the increase in housing prices has outpaced the increase in income over time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be interesting to correlate this with the amount of wealth owned by the top 1% wealthiest people(1965 vs. today).</p>
<p>My guess is that you will find out that the top 1% wealthiest own more now than in 1965. This could be one reason why people earn less compared to 1965.</p></div>		</li>

75 years ago, for that same job, possibly less hours and better benefits (as those have also dwindled or been cut out over time), they owned a house. </p></div>		</li>
