			<div class="markdown"><p>good answer, but he asked if they were an area. Do you know how big of an area it is then that they point down to the extent that you can no longer rely on a compass/magnetism to determine magnetic north/south?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The following link is to NASA's World Magnetic Model (WMM). Included in this is a section and map that covers the magnetic blackout zones (BoZ), i.e. the places where a compass becomes unreliable:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/limit.shtml" target="_blank">https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/limit.shtml</a></p>
<p>As an interesting point, 2020 is the first year where their WMM includes BoZ. Prior to that, it was just vague guesswork.</p>
<p>Also interesting, the magnetic pole moves by about 50km a year, so the size and shape of these blackout zones is constantly changing. It is also variable depending on local geological and atmospheric conditions which the model does not include in its calculations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't, I'd imagine it changes constantly, though probably stays within some margin most of the time and that whole chaotically bounded area drifts over longer periods of time.</p>
<p>I picture it in my mind like thousands of lighting strikes every second over some area covered by a storm. The edges of the storm, defined by the lightning strikes, moves around fluidly, but are generally confined to an area.</p>
<p>Edit: I wanted to add that I'm defining this area in my head as where the field lines intersect the ground, similar to how the circle of the aurora is where the field lines intersect the atmosphere. I assume you meant the same, it's kind of arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That totally depends on the threshold you define. If you use super sensitive compasses you can get closer, if you use a nail you rubbed with a magnet floating on water, not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you were standing at the general center of that circle and were looking down at a compass, would the needle be going haywire, unable to lock onto a stable magnetic North? </p>
<p>Also, at the center of said circle, would you be exposed to increased amounts of solar radiation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it might spin haywire or might drift slowly or might not move at all.</p>
<p>Kind of like a weather vane, the wind doesn't blow all the time, doesn't always blow the same direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The compass needle wouldn't do anything particularly predictable... it would be like blowing a fan straight down onto it, it might get stuck in an eddy current for a while or it might be pushed around seemingly randomly otherwise.</p>
<p>Try to picture the &quot;current&quot; that drags the compass needle flowing down onto it vertically instead of across it horizontally like it would closer to the equator. Like putting it under a waterfall rather than in a flowing stream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't move for a normal compass because the force on it is too weak. If you can suspend it in vacuum or stuff like that you might see it move erratically, but still slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume so...only because of the general shape of the field and the distance between the surface and the core, but they would not converge to a point, only to a smaller area, since the inner and outer core (whose relative movement creates the field in the first place) is actually pretty damn wide.</p></div>		</li>
