			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancers can be <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761313002963" target="_blank">stopped by T-cells</a> as well when they are still relatively young. IIRC, this cancer-immunity cycle must be &quot;won&quot; by a cancer cell line before it can progress to larger scale tumor formation. So in that sense, many cancers killed by the immune system are never diagnosed, and never cause issue for the body. So in answer to the original question, no, cancers are not universally lethal, in fact most are disrupted by the body before they are even noticeable. But you're right in that if you have <em>clinical</em> cancer, you're likely going to need treatment to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to throw in too that even in the case of cancers that have become malevolent and grow uncontrollably, some have just gone away without intervention. It's rare and we have no idea why, but it does happen.</p>
<p>The whole boat of cancer is a wild card in many ways. Some people respond to chemo, others don't. Some people have it come back over and over, others get into remission and it stays that way. I don't know the medicine side of it, but it seems to be highly specific to the individual patient. Like the opposite of a broken bone or tooth cavity. Imagine if a dentist was like, &quot;Welp, we're gonna start drilling, it works for some people but who knows what will happen to you. You might just end up with a lot of holes in your teeth and the pain's still there.&quot;</p>
<p>I wish we could just eradicate it, but it sounds like cancer's so complex we're nowhere near a universal treatment or approach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because Cancer is an umbrella term. There are so many types and sub types of cancers, along with &quot;drivers&quot; such as hormones and certain types of proteins, they all behave differently and react to treatments differently. This is why there will never be a cure all for cancer. At the end of the day it will all boil down to each individuals cancer and it's characteristics and drivers. A cure will need to be completely individualized.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically this is it. Cancer is not one single disease. The term cancer essentially just means unchecked cell growth and this can happen just about anywhere in the body for a whole host of different reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s an even more effective response if you can engineer T-cells to express a CAR protein. I just got a job doing exactly that. Receive the patient cells, process them, and send them back. In the meantime, the patient undergoes lymphodepletion to make room for new cells.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily. We don't always have to treat low risk prostate cancers. The decision is a clinical one and we make it based on the patient's life expectancy. You wouldn't treat a cancer if something else is much more likely to get the patient first. Even malignant tumors can be slow growing to the point where you can safely observe it because it likely won't kill the patient in their life expectancy or cause significant symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seconding this. Sometimes attempting to resect/treat the cancer can kill faster than the cancer would, or slash the patient's quality of life (mobility especially), or trigger another serious medical episode like a stroke, or (primarily US) simply be so damn expensive that grandma says &quot;nah would rather leave that money to my kids.&quot; Always ask your doctor, &quot;what's prognosis for doing nothing?&quot; because sometimes that is the option of least harm - especially when the patient is elderly and several conditions are already competing for the patient's life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a term called watchful waiting where they basically wait to see if you need treatment. I have a form of cancer (mycosis fungoides) that people can live the rest of their lives with using low impact treatments like topical steroids and UV therapy. Somebody over in the lymphoma sub told me they had it for 20 years before they were diagnosed. Unfortunately for me, after about 4 1/2 years it spread to my lymph nodes so I had to get chemo and now I’m getting a bone marrow transplant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. By definition, benign tumors do not have the potential to metastasize (spread), which is one of the requirements for classification of cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but that doesn't meant that benign tumors can't be a significant problem. I have a family member with a benign tumor in a very inconvenient place, and they have gone through two complete years' worth of chemo so far, separated by five years or so, to keep it from growing. It's always kind of hard to explain to people that it isn't technically cancer.</p></div>		</li>
