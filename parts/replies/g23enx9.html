			<div class="markdown"><p>At our company we put baffles into some of our plastic tanks. </p>
<p>The reason that baffles were added in the first places was not to reduce error in fuel readings (although it helps) but to reduce the momentum of the fuel to prevent the tank from dislodged itself, to prevent the vehicle from rocking due to the fuel, and to reduce the noise of the sloshing. </p>
<p>Plastic as a material is a better dampener than steel, and plastic can be molded into complex shapes. You can actually design plastic tanks into shapes that reduce slosh without baffles. </p>
<p>Plastic tanks are blow molded in the same way plastic bottles are, so you can only added components in the inside through the hole where the fuel pump attaches. Which makes it very difficult to insert something large like a baffle reliably. However our company has a developed a method in which we add baffles.</p>
<p>But in general, mostly steel tanks require them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly most modern car gas tanks are molded into crazy shapes, which inherently reduce sloshing.</p>
<p>My tank sloshes quite a bit, occasionally you can feel it.</p>
<p>What size tanks do you make? I've seen baffles in plastic tanks, but only in large 500+ gallon tanks. I haven't seen them in normal car sized capacities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, I don't understand how this is the second highest answer. I have never seen any baffles in modern gas tanks. It's just smooth plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is because of the manufacturing methods. Plastic gas tanks are blow molded, but that only gives you control over the outer surface. The inner surface is created by air pressure, not a die, and so you can't have any features on the inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you This is probably what OP is looking for. A a simple vertical measurement in a relatively &quot;flat&quot; tank would fluctuate wildly while a more vertical chamber would not (as much.) By creating a maze you're basically turning one flat chamber to a relatively complicated vertical chamber.</p></div>		</li>
