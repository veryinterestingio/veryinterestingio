			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this informed answer. Fascinating.</p>
<p>You spend most of your answer on binding on the surface of a cell and also many other answers do. May I ask why binding is so hard for a cell surface? We have glue that works for nearly any surface. Did cells make it extra hard to attach to them as a defence mechanism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My perspective is focused on protein-protein interactions- antibody binding viral surface proteins or the viral proteins binding to a cellular receptor. A few atoms out of optimum positioning has enormous implications for the strength of the interaction- subtle change in charge or shape complementarity on a virus surface spike at the interface can enhance or prevent virus entry, or it could make an otherwise virus-neutralizing antibody ineffective.</p>
<p>Also, cell surfaces are extremely crowded with many, many proteins. The virus spikeâ€™s affinity for a receptor needs to be really high (have precise complementarity) or there needs to be a large amount of the cellular protein receptor (to sum many weak interactions).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, viruses don't &quot;want&quot; to bind just any protein. Most viruses want to enter specific cell types so they can best evade immune detection. If they enter every cell type it becomes easier for the immune system to detect them and eliminate them, thereby adding pressure for selectivity on the virus' part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Binding in this case does not mean that cells are sticking together. The cell surface is essentially covered in many keyholes. Binding happens when a molecule on the outside of the cell has a key to fit in one of the keyholes. Depending on the purpose of the binding site in that cell, the external molecule could be brought into the cell.</p>
<p>Making binding difficult is somewhat of a security feature. This way, only specific molecules can get in. Essentially, viruses have developed keys to fit our locks. A species jump can happen when a random mutation during duplication creates a key that can fit into a different lock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More simply- is not really &quot;glue&quot;- it is a lock and key receptor and protein interaction.  If the key doesn't fit the lock...no binding.  Doesn't have to be a perfect match- but has to be close, or no binding will occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it that rabies can infect so many different animals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One theory for its wide host range is that rabies is more promiscuous with its receptor choice, utilizing multiple receptors to bind to cells and induce endocytosis, or internalization, of the virus. The trigger for the rabies surface glycoprotein (G) is the low pH of the endocytic pathway, which is a ubiquitous process. </p>
<p>Another contribution is that rabies will exist as a collection of quasispecies in its host. Many RNA viruses (of which rabies is an example) mutate very rapidly - many different variants will exist in one individual (and turn some of these may be adapted for the next host). This is probably what allows the virus to hop between hosts in the wild; some of the existing viruses are pre-adapted for its next target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic answer is rabies mutated fast enough to become virulent across species.  Viruses evolve rapidly- when we live in close quarters with critters that get a disease eventually the virus will figure out a way (evolve) to use us as a host too.  The wikipedia entry on cross-species transmission might help orient to the models we have to explain, theoretically.  Hope that helps- my understanding is very basic!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer but there's all sorts of words you used in your explanation that you didn't explain. You need to simplify the explanation more to make it readable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>co- and/or post-translational modifications</p>
<p>amino acid residues</p>
<p>binding event</p>
<p>binding interface</p>
<p>charge</p>
<p>steric clashes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's just in the first 3 paragraphs, where I stopped reading.</p></div>		</li>
