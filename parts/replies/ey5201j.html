			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a few ideas on this front. We'd start with &quot;natural&quot; gas produced in the GI system and then ignite it with something like gastroliths that are flinty, special teeth, or sparks produced by cool cells called electrocytes that are found in bioelectric animals like electric eels. We dig into this quite a lot in the book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Paul, I'm excited to read your book (just ordered it!).</p>
<p>I've given talks on building dragons and have written a middle grades book where a group of kids builds a dragon using amped up electrocytes. As part of my lecture, I explain that natural gas is already produced in ruminants and bombadier beetles have an anatomical model we can model (Those beetles shoot a very noxious liquid from their butts, which makes for some great shenanignans).</p>
<p>One major consideration for dragon building is size. I argue against building Game of Throne-sized dragons and believe we can have more success on a much smaller scale - like a lizard or a chicken. I also believe it'll be easier. What do you think? Does size matter when engineering mythical creatures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Karl,
We had some similar ideas! It's cool that you too thought about electrocytes for example. Dragon body mass is a major issue. We were hoping we could get something that is pterosaur sized for our dragon, but smaller would be more practical. Birds could be a good starting point. At one point we had fun speculating about a flock of dragon-like, fire-breathing humming birds in the book!</p></div>		</li>
