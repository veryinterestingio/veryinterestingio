<p>Imagine if Moderna trial concludes and and there's 3x as many C19 positives in control versus test (vaccinated). We might say its reducing cases by 2/3 or 66%.  </p>
<p>Imagine if Pfizer came a month later with one where 7x as many C19 positives in control versus test. Then that vaccine might be 85% effective.  </p>
<p>Now imagine you were going to get 1 of those 2 vaccines. You, your insurer, everyone will take 85% over 66%.</p>
<p>As you are trialing you expect some noise. The stronger the effect the sooner you can overcome that noise and show the minimum threshold. You can then start manufacturing and finish the trial out for the complete number later.  So you want to know the bottom threshold to hit to cross that barrier.</p></div>		</li>
