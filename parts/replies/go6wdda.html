			<div class="markdown"><p>I wait unit things like stock are cool enough to portion then throw em in containers and in the freezer. If it's too hot for the container (212 is a bit hot for the plastic and warps it a bit) then it's hot enough to be out of the danger zone anyway. I generally portion in 2 cup servings or less of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Fridges are efficient. The food inside is not going to spoil because of warm food you put into it. Don't wait for the food to cool, as soon as you're done eating it, put it in the fridge or freezer asap!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When im done eating, the food is cool.</p>
<p>Is half the arguments in this thread just bad communication? </p>
<p>Cause im crowd letting it rest on the counter until its cool, but that doesnt mean letting it sit for hours, half an hour while i eat is more then enough to cool it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I cook something, serve myself, put the rest in a storage container, clean up a bit and then eat.  That way I can enjoy my meal slowly and not have to worry about cleaning up after or how soon I deal with it.  So this is helpful re: whether to put the excess food in the fridge right away or wait a little bit or wait a long time. </p>
<p>I don’t trust this fridge enough to put super hot things in there so I generally let them cool for about 10 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

This is mainly about food that is still piping hot.</p></div>		</li>
