			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much that's it.  Rapid growth of bones exceeding the rate of which muscles and tendons grow causes the pain.  Its also linked to the fatigue that can occur as growing takes a fair bit of energy.  Things like  Osgood-Schlatter disease is a great example where the growth (also activity level of the child) places strain on the patella tendon so much so that the body reinforces it with calcification  leaving a lump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A physical therapist would be the person to see about this. Find a local PT clinic, and ask them about it. There are some great techniques for this condition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It settles once the growth eases and the soft tissue can catch up.  PT for a good stretching regime and ice post sport has been found to be most successful.  Some people can have issues kneeling on hard ground later in life but that is in extreme cases.  Mines just barely visible these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s probably due to the nerve ending near the ends of the bones, and as the bones grow, you feel a pinching type effect. Skin is supposed to be somewhat elastic and flexible, whereas bones are rigid, so bones will pinch the nerves while the skin kinda goes around it.</p></div>		</li>
