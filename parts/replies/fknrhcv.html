<p>you just don't build memories for these events. This is why sometimes you barely remember a dream, and you know there was more to it </p>

<p>Isn't that building some memory though?</p>
<p>For instance, I sleep with the TV on. I sometimes am aware/get an impression of news stories because of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah exactly. You do build some memories but not all. These gaps are the evidence that we are conscious without memory; because you wouldn't get a sense if you hadn't been conscious enough for it to sink in. Therefore you were conscious but don't have direct memories, you just gained the benefit of <em>knowing.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a bit of a debate actually as to weather or not consciousness persists during anesthesia. So you would experience everything, in the moment, but never have recollection of it.</p>

<p>This is the most horrifying thing I could read here, thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shoutout to that time I was super sleep deprived and apparently had an entire meal with my family and family friends but zero recollection of the event. I remember waking up the next day and asking mum why she didnt call me down from my nap to have dinner, only to be told that she did.</p></div>		</li>
