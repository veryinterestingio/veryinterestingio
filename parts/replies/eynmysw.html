			<div class="markdown"><p>Also with increasing media use, I wonder how well we distinguish years down the line from real experiences vs some story we lived in through a film or a TV series.
They’re all visual and, to some extent experiential memories</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just remember band class being interrupted and everyone being very serious. This was middle school for me, and I had never heard of the World Trade Center so I couldn’t really understand why the buildings name was even important. </p>
<p>I remember seeing the footage at some point, but my memory only recalls them being on fire, though I know I saw the footage of them crashing too. I was more thinking “I hope they don’t fall at least.”</p>
<p>All those memories are pretty surreal though, like I’m a replicant, or dreaming, and they aren’t mine.</p>
<p>Edit: truth be told, I probably wouldn’t even know of the World Trade Center to this day if it wasn’t for 9/11.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched the second plane hit during the live broadcast with a group of maybe 20ish.  None of them saw it, called me a liar even!  Then like 20 minutes later, the media figured it out and started replaying it.  People looked at me like it was my fault...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How come witnesses are still reliable in legal systems then ? When we know over time (and it takes ages for court cases to come to pass) that a witness memory when testifying might be vastly different to initial statement (and even that might not be accurate) ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren’t. Minor or even major details can be misremembered and altered over time. And multiple witnesses (even a whole group of police officers!) can see an entirely different progression of events. However, I’m in no way an expert, I just had a college seminar on the topic. So if you’re truly curious and want to read a great book ok the subject, try The Invisible Gorilla by Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simmons.</p></div>		</li>
