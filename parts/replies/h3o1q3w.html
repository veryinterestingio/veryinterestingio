			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, we have been able to freeze and thaw somewhat larger things (like hamsters) and thaw them out again without killing them, because we did have technology that worked for thawing the whole creature more or less at once, fast enough to prevent that harm. That was one of the early uses of microwave ovens! There was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tdiKTSdE9Y" target="_blank">Tom Scott video</a> about it recently.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for things that are much bigger than that the process takes too long, so it doesn't work for something the size of a person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the most bonkers science stories I've ever heard.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yeah, we were studying hypothermia back in the day and I had a great idea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I built/invented a homemade microwave oven and we put frozen hamsters in it to see if we could revive them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell? That's totally insane, there's no way that could work!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, it totally worked. We zapped em right up and they were basically fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...well I'll be damned&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, at this point in time, microwaves weren‚Äôt really being used for heating food yet, so imagine your first experience with such a thing was communicating with others hundreds of miles away and bringing back frozen animals to life. Really gives you some context to the kind of science fiction people were coming up with back then.</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps in 50 years, an ‚Äúembryo defroster‚Äù might be on every trying families nightstand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the things that may advance cryogenics is manipulating the thermal conduction of heat through the body, such as with biological antifreeze, that would help the body get warm at the same rate everywhere. </p>
<p>There are some frogs which can be frozen and revived, and their solution to the problem of limbs thawing faster than the heart and lungs is they have a kind of antifreeze that not only helps with the formation of ice crystals, but it also conducts heat through their body efficiently so that the limbs stay cold longer, and the trunk gets warm faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also kind of missed a step, which is replacing the water in the embryo as much as possible to reduce ice formation and damage, and reverse that when you unfreeze. Which is easier for a handful of cells and not a whole human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the issue of failure rate - you can freeze 20 embryos, and if 19 don't make it, it's not a huge deal. </p>
<p>Even if we could get a 50% success rate, it's hard to imagine anyone preferring that to just about anything else. </p>
<p>And we're a LONG way off even a 0.01% chance of success, for the reasons you stated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're trusting that someone will unfreeze you and cute you in the future. What's more likely is that the company goes bankrupt and someone buries your body in the desert to avoid having to deal with it during liquidation, </p>
<p>Not to mention you're relying on the storage site to never lose power or anything over potentially hundreds of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in future if they have technology to cure said terminal cancer, especially in late stages, they can probably heal cells that get damaged by cryogenics, increasing success rate. There is a theory that same future technologies used to unfreeze people in cryogenics will be able to cure most ailments and extend human life to the point that cryogenics become useless</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Embryo survival rate under 90% is considered very poor nowadays.  Generally survival rates are closer to 98%. The temperature change rate is a very important factor in determining success, you can easily control this factor when talking about an embryo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's &quot;no big deal&quot; by comparison. </p>
<p>The fact that you are successful with a 1 out of 60 rate shows this. Yeah, it sucks and is expensive (congratulations btw).</p>
<p>If you're freezing a human, if it dies, that was your one chance. There's no trying again. A living adult is worth way more than 100k.</p></div>		</li>
