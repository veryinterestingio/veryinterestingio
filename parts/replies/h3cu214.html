			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting - for some reason I always assumed that ATP was protonated by water in the body thus carrying no ionic charge, but obviously that's absurd since the body has a pH of approximately 7.4. a quick search tells me that hydrated ATP dissociates into its conjugate base at a pKa of 6.5. it seems you are right on the money with regards to magnesium balancing the charge. <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1977/p2/p29770001824#!divAbstract" target="_blank">this article</a> suggests that Mg2+ counter-ions do balance the charges to varying extents at particular pH levels.</p></div>		</li>
