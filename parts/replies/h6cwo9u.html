<p>If we ever learn how to move though space at great speed, or use worm holes to skip around space. What will it be like to see our sun's light from millions of years in the past.</p>
<p>Edit: not millions of light years. 10s of thousands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What they're talking about with the light shifting due to the universe expanding, it doesn't care how strong the light source is. It would happen to the dimmest light and the brightest light at the same time.</p>
<p>The strength of the light source is important when it comes to the inverse cube law. Which is going to determine detection based on how bright something appears not on it's wave length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a laser light turned on in space, with no atmospheric interference will travel as far as sunlight?</p>
<p>Harder to detect I know. But all position is known by 2nd observers it would travel same distance?</p></div>		</li>
