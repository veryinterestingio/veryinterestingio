			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of health, abolishing DST rather than making it permanent is more beneficial. Standard time is the time that most closely matches solar time (the sun clock). Research has shown that our body clocks still follow more or less the time of the sun clock. For example, several studies found that the further west people live within a time zone, the more health problems they may experience and the shorter they live on average. Using permanent DST would increase the mismatch between our body clock - which is set by the sun clock - and the social clock. You can read more about this in the position paper we published: <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0748730419854197" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0748730419854197" target="_blank">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0748730419854197</a></a></p>
<p>In terms of energy consumption, although DST was originally implemented as an energy reducing strategy, research has shown that this is not necessarily the case in our current society, see for example: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-daylight-saving-times-save-energy/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-daylight-saving-times-save-energy/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-daylight-saving-times-save-energy/</a></a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like that would make summers terrible around here. Sunrise would be around 4:30-5:00 AM (meaning a LOT of people would get woken up by the sun way too early if they don't have blackout curtains) and sunset would be around 7:00 or 7:30 in the evening. Hope you weren't planning on doing anything in the evening that isn't under artificial lights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be terrible if we define our current lifestyle as good, but is it? If the sun rises at 5am, then people could go to work at 6. They can be home by 5 and start doing things earlier in the afternoon.</p>
<p>For some reason, we're attached to getting up later and staying up later. It's as though there's something more comfortable or interesting about living later in the day. But is it really better to be awake from 8am to 10pm than to be awake 5am to 8pm?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What? </p>
<p>I don't think I understand your point? Evenings are night time. Night time is dark, that's a thing. Everyone plans to do stuff under artificial light at night time. </p>
<p>Are you saying you want it to go dark even later? </p>
<p>I can't imagine my kids going to bed at 8:30pm with the sun still up, they'd think I was a nutter. </p>
<p>Or earlier? Earlier sunset would be ok, in the winter the sun sets around 5:30pm here which is just normal. Drive home from work at dusk. </p>
<p>Also those days you quoted seem extra long to me (east coast Australia) but maybe I haven't been paying that much attention to the sunrise times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering how do we follow the &quot;sun clock&quot; at all in a Nordic climate when the sun is almost never up when there's a chance to be outside in the fall and winter season.. that is before and after work. </p>
<p>For example, today sunrise and sunset is 08:05 to 16:40. And most of the time during this period it's cloudy. And in summer there can be just a couple hours of dark from maybe 01:00 to 04:00, and never completely dark. </p>
<p>Between summer and winter the sun clock shifts noticeably every day, hurrying from one extreme to the other.</p>
<p>Still got to be at work at 08:00 and go home 16:30 or so for a regular workday regardless of season, so human schedule never syncs with solar schedule.</p>
<p>Changing from DST to standard time makes the day go from noon to night in an instant instead of gradually making the afternoon darker, which can be hard to adjust to. The other way is not so bad since the day is already so bright when the switch happen in the spring that it doesn't affect peoples daytime schedule much.</p>
<p>I guess the sun and earth won't adapt to human schedule, so maybe we humans have to adapt and adopt more dynamic schedules that change a little over time? We have the technology now to make that possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate a bit more on the concept of the sun clock and how it relates to our body clock?</p>
<p>Honestly I don't see why calling the solar noon 1pm instead of 12pm would make such a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because solar noon is the moment when sun is at the highest point in the sky. You can't call 1pm a solar noon.</p></div>		</li>
