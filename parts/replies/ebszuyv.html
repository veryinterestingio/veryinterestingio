			<div class="markdown"><p>absolutely</p>
<p>next time you see a trail of ants, wipe away one small part with some windex or chlorox before you clean the whole thing up </p>
<p>Once ants get to the cleaned part they'll get confused and wander around looking for the rest of the trail they were following </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more fun: wipe away the pheromone trail with ant killer. Watch their confused little ant faces as they slowly die and think that they’ve been betrayed by one of their own.</p>
<p>That’s what they get for laying down pheromones in <em>my</em> kitchen. Bitches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can wash the pheromones off whatever surface they're on. When the ants find the end of the trail and no food, they'll get confused and maybe think one of their sisters is playing a joke on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had ants really bad once. I found an ant killer (CANNOT remember the name, dammit!) that was sweet and slow acting. It took long enough to kill that an individual ant could make it back to the nest so the other ants could backtrack to the poison. I had a single file line of ants, nose to ass, from the second story window they were using to get in all the way to the poison where there was a solid mass of them on the drop of poison. I had to replenish the poison quite a few times before the line finally slowed to nothing. It was insane. I took pics but am not on imgur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how the other ants follow.  I think the question is how do they travel so fucking far. We don't see them scouring the place during the day which kinda makes it seem like they B-line for the sweetness. Obviously, a chemical trail for others could make it deceptive, but it's still bloody impressive that you don't see them wandering around, one finds food, releases a little pheromone and BAM, every ant in the neighborhood knows what's going on. </p>
