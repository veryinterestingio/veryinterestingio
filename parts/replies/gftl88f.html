<p>The cost of producing lab kids is cheap provided you live in socialist hell-hole like most of Europe and Canada where socialized healthcare covers the cost. Damn socialist /s  </p>
<p>What comes after they are alive is a different story altogether</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I have a moissanite engagement ring and wedding band that I love. The engagement ring is from moissaniteco.com and the wedding band is from an Etsy maker that got her stones I believe from Charles &amp; Colvard. There are lots of companies that do moissanite jewelry but seems these are the two prominent places (in the US at least) and many people Iâ€™ve seen get them from Chinese companies with great results. Check out r/moissanite for more random people talking about their pretty rings lol</p></div>		</li>

By problem I mean people try to make her feel bad about not having a diamond? My girlfriend also said she is open to not having a diamond ring but I worry her girl friends might say rude things about it to her</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anytime anyone asked me if the rock on my ring was a real diamond I just told them &quot;I don't know, but I don't care. Look how pretty it is!!!&quot; Honestly I don't know if it was or not, but I believe he bought it when he was 19 or 20 so I'm leaning towards either he threw all of the money he had at the ring or it wasn't real. I don't care either way; because it was beautiful.  Sadly I lost my engagement ring several years ago and the wedding band followed a few years after. Someone probably got a real pleasant surprise in their pocket at good will...</p></div>		</li>

<p>This phase seem to have a connotation the lab grown diamonds are somehow not diamonds. They ARE diamond in the most literal sense of the word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not OP, but I also have non-diamond wedding jewelry. My original engagement ring was an opal, which caught a lot of attention because it is unusual. Never had anyone say anything negative. When that one got damaged, we replaced it with a blue/green moissanite. That one has had nothing but positive attention - super sparkly, changes color in the light, and unlike anything most people have seen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think Iâ€™ll be trying to buy an engagement ring in the next year or so. I donâ€™t want diamonds, but Iâ€™m not really sure what I want. And I donâ€™t think she really knows or cares, as long as it looks nice.</p></div>		</li>
