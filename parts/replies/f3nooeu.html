<p>It's basically the opposite counterpart of slick tires.  Completely smooth with no tread for maximum contact area and thus maximum grip.</p>
<p>But the corollary to that is if <em>anything</em> gets between the slick and the road, like a tiny bit of water, the grip instantly goes from maximum to nothing and your vehicle goes from under control to an example of Newton's first law.  Which is why slicks aren't street legal and legal tires have tread voids, siping, etc. to get water and debris out from under the tire.</p></div>		</li>
