<p>A lot of hand sanitizer has traditionally been isopropyl alcohol (aka rubbing alcohol), which is poisonous to humans. But any alcohol will sanitize a surface so during the pandemic a lot of distilleries made pure ethanol to sell as sanitizer as well, which is essentially very strong drinkable booze with some unpalatable or poisonous ingredients added to it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the unpalatable ingredient just to stop people from drinking it? or does it help with the sanitization</p></div>		</li>

And all alcohol is poisonous to humans, our liver is just able to detoxify our blood quick enough to enjoy the benefits without the negatives. Unless you party hard of course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>yeah it always irks me when people think ethanol is not toxic or think isopropanol is up there with methanol when really, it's closer to ethanol in toxicity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure part of it is so minors can purchase it. A local distillery made sanitizer that's 70% ethanol, part water, part glycerin, and part hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide will make a person vomit, is enough to warrant a warning label, and thus can be sold to anyone.</p>
<p>Not only were they helping the public when sanitizer was scarce, but they were also cutting a lot of losses by distilling a bunch of expired beer to then turn into sanitizer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it's to stop people from drinking it, either to deter abuse, or to prevent accidental poisoning say a child or elderly or someone with a mental disability or some other vulnerable group.</p>
<p>It doesn't help with sanitation.</p>
<p>They also put in things so that people don't just distil ethanol and avoid the taxes for alcohol</p></div>		</li>
