<p>Just to add something, vitamin K plays a role in blood clotting and is named after the German word Koagulation as in coagulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this and most other questions about naming of  things in Biology is &quot;because we didn't know wtf was happening when we discovered things and just named shit&quot;.</p>
<p>Retinol (Vitamin A) was named because it was first thought to do something with eyes. Which it does (deficiency in it leads to night blindness). As well as being absolutely essential in embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, glycoprotein synthesis, the immune system, production of human growth hormone, etc. Spend a lot of time in development talking about retinol, named after retinas, in the growth of legs, and going &quot;wtf was wrong with them?&quot;</p>
<p>The complement system (a part of the immune system) has 8 proteins (well plus Factors B, D, I, and more!). They were numbered C1-8 based on the order they were discovered and isolated. The classical pathway (the order they act) is C1 attaches to the antibody, then recruits C4. C4 then splits into C4a and C4b. C4a fucks off to act as a signal, C4b stays behind to recruit C2b (after C2 split into C2a and C2b, and C2a also fucked off), those two then recruit C3 and split it into C3a and b, and a also fucks off.  And then they get 5, do the same, and then get 6, 7, and 8. Of course there's also the alternative pathway that starts with C3, which recruits factor B, which splits into Ba and Bb and... </p>
<p>God I hated that section of immunology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, lets add the Coagulation Cascade naming clusterfuck.</p>
<p>It STARTS with Factor VII (yes, ROMAN NUMERALS). Where were factors I-VI? Well they come into play, but they are also named (fibrinogen, prothrombin, etc.). Oh, but Factor VI doesn't exist, it's just what they used to call a part of Factor V before they realized that Factor V has 2 parts. Of course, we have names for Factor VII-Factor XIII too, we just don't use them for some reason. Probably because one is called &quot;Christmas Factor&quot; and another is called &quot;Stuart-Prower Factor&quot;. </p>
<p>Then there's Protein C, S, and Z. Those are named because protein C was the third protein some guy discovered initially, but don't get confused that it's an ANTIcoagulant, while the cofactor for protein C, protein S, is named because it was discovered in Seattle. Why Protein Z? Because fuck you, that's why.</p></div>		</li>
