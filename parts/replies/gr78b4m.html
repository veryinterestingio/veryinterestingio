			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the opposite will happen, over time the deadliest mutations will be negatively selected. Evolution pushes towards viruses being harmless, because a healthy person has more chances to go around and spread it.</p>
<p>Viruses like Herpes Simplex that infect humans from millennia cause symptoms in a minority of people and there are more people carrying it in their bodies than not. Deadly viruses usually come from animals, cause they are adapted to be less harmful to that species but not others (smallpox came from cows, ebola from bats, plague from rats...)</p>
<p>1918 H1N1 was once a very deadly flu, almost a death sentence for the elderly and very dangerous to young people too. It's actually still around but now it's just your everyday flu cause the deadliest mutations died witg their hosts.</p>
<p>&quot;New&quot; flus are a whole different deal and they are created because of peculiar perks or influenza viruses: there are three cathegories of flus, one infect only men, one only animals, one infects both. Influenza viruses don't have a single, continuous genetic molecule, they have 8 separate strands.</p>
<p>When two different flu viruses infect the same cell at once, within the cell there are all these strands, when a virus particle forms it just picks 8 streands, it's unable to figure out what belongs to what virus. This can lead to genetic exchange between different virus species.</p>
<p>This is also why we can't really eradicate flu, it doesn't matter if no human carries it, because there are animal reservoirs around that can easily reinfect humans.</p>
<p>If COVID-19 has no animal reservoirs around (despite coming originally from animals) we can theoretically eradicate it, just like we did with smallpox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plague is neither a virus nor spread by rats. And smallpox isn't from cows - cows have a similar virus that we figured out was a close enough match to serve as an early vaccine for smallpox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way to early to say we will need boosters every year.</p>
<p>Looking positively we are now in a much better position to handle any future pandemic. This has advanced vaccine development massively.</p></div>		</li>
