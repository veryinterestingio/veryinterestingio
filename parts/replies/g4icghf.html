			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no exact science answer but I imagine that it is essentially the same thing as recall. Being able to &quot;see&quot; in your head is just remembering. You know what red is, you know what a house looks like as you have seen it. If I say imagine a red house, the brain just thinks of the things you have experienced in reality. Essentially just perception and recall working in tandem. That's my idea anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find these answers satisfactory. Thank you both. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm unsure exactly what recall is, but here‚Äôs my take-away: the brain contains a series of assets it has acquired over time from which it pulls for us to ‚Äúsee‚Äù when we are imagining something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that doesn't the answer the question. You're explaining the why, not the how. HOW is the brain showing us something visible, when your answer explains why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on MRI readings looking exactly like when we experience something, just at lower intensities, it seems to imply that the brain is actually replaying the experience. I have no idea how accurate my poor layman's view of that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think how will be similar to how you can see any images at all with Ur eyes open. There is the raw visual data and the perception we impose on that data. When I'm jacking off from memory I am concentrated on images I have already seen. Our perceptual system creates rough models of the things we see to act as shortcuts otherwise we would be perceiving things as new and be perpetually stunned by even mundane experiences. When I focus on a memory or imagine my brain calls a compressed reasonably useful recreation of the experience from component parts. I wish they where more realistic but then I would never leave home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. With fMRI machines we can see what parts of the brain light up and we can draw reasonable conclusions about the systems what systems are responsible for what functions and how they interact. </p>
<p>How these systems come together and create consciousness and imagination are much broader questions, and in order to answer them, you need to get at the root of what consciousness and imagination really are. </p>
<p>Those are the sort of things that are better defined by philosophy, and we just aren't really at the point where we can provide a good answer with science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are also people (myself) that can ‚Äúimagine‚Äù but the outcome isn‚Äôt quite vivid visual imagery. It isn‚Äôt some kind of linguistic description either. Instead, I can construct the feel of how things are, piece by piece. Like I don‚Äôt see a shape but know what it would look like, then thinking about the color, etc. </p>
<p>Perhaps this is actually what people mean by ‚Äúimagination‚Äù but I have no way to tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no one has any way to tell how much of this is semantics, perception, the standard each person is keeping on their mind on to what really is to 'imagine' or 'visualize' something, etc. but I'd be willing to bet the difference is smaller than some people make it out to be. I might be wrong, but I don't think most people have the ability to just close their eyes and play a full color, vivid, simulated world per se. the implications of it would be much bigger than a few incongruent experiences. similarly with sound; I'd bet people who can 'hear' stuff in their head pretty well still feel an itch finally scratched when they have a song stuck in their head and finally get to listen to it. it's the difference between imagining it how it goes in your mind, and actually hearing it.</p></div>		</li>
