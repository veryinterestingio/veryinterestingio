			<div class="markdown"><p>This can also happen to men, which can be a problem as the abs keep the internal organs protected.  I know someone who was complaining that his abs looked funny after gaining weight and I blurted out &quot;Oh that's what happens to pregnant women!&quot; and he's never quite forgiven me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. You just reminded me of a baby shower I went to this weekend. During one of the games, we were using ribbon to guess the circumference of the pregnant mother. My brother decided he would wrap the ribbon around my waist and that would be his guess. It was an <strong>exact match</strong>. 😑Good thing I can take a joke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the strength of her abs before the pregnancy affect the diastasis recti? For example if a lady works out a lot and has killer abs, is she going to have issues working out her abs again after pregnancy? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either way after pregnancy she's going to have a more difficult time than prior to pregnancy. If she goes in to the pregnancy stronger with better tissue integrity, she'll be less likely to have serious problems, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. The younger or more elastic her tissues are will help tremendously as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How about all those very fit women who successfully return to their pre-pregnancy fitness level after several months and continue to get even more fit afterwards? Clearly it wouldn't be possible if pregnancy was guaranteed to permanently destroy women's abs no matter their health and fitness state.</p></div>		</li>
