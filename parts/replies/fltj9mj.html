			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/Onithyr said the lenses are fixed for cost, size and weight reasons. it's kindof like asking why you can't adjust a pair of glasses to your perscription.  </p>
<p>However, just like glasses, You can get perscription lenses to go into your headset, replacing the stock ones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oculus is already on it - Half Dome 3 prototype.  Features a <strong>electronic varifocal lenses</strong> with eye tracking. I'm not sure if this will allow near sighted folks to play without glasses, but this should help with close up image focus </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's unlikely that the built in focal lenses of the VR headset would account for the specifics in a prescription. They could adjust for basic sphere power, but wouldn't be able to adjust for axis and cylinder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think non phone based headsets can only achieve their wide fields of view with aspheric fresnels, which are basically only made via injection molding. So, it would be too expensive to make a mold for every possible astigmatism combination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to but I’m so comfortable with my contacts at this point. I’ve been wearing them for over 20 years. Putting in my contacts in the morning is almost like a “wake up” moment I might actually miss.</p>
<p>That and my career is so heavily dependent on my eyesight (I’m a 3D artist) that I’m worried about the downtime, and prolonged screen exposure (eyes getting tired, night vision etc). Everyone I see online says it’s great but I’ve not seen the same reaction in the people I know closely who have had it done. My mother now has terrible night vision and can hardly drive at night, and one of my close friends who just recently had the procedure,  has had to go back twice for adjustment surgeries now, and says the recovery period is not very pleasant. </p>
<p>I dunno. I still think about it. But I don’t really have much issue with the way things are currently either. I guess that means it’s not worth the risk, for now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're content with contacts then just forget about the surgery. It doesn't matter how many people rave about laser eyer surgery, it's still surgery and still comes with risks. Unless wearing contacts becomes some huge pain in the ass ,or you suddenly become allergic to them or something, it's not even worth thinking about surgery IMO.</p>
<p>Don't let yourself get talked into wanting something you may not actually want. There's nothing wrong with using aids to see :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;She initially wanted to get LASIK surgery, but Rose said she was convinced by her doctor to instead get the small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) procedure.&quot;</p>
<p>My sympathies go out to her and her family. It's always as if we always get in this mindset that we ourselves could never be the one to experience complications and everything will be fine.</p>
<p>But please do try to keep the facts straight. Yes, both procedures come with their inherent risks and side effects, but attributing one's to another will only spread misinformation and discourage others from making the choice themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It says right in the article she didnt have Lasik, but a newer recently approved procedure called SMILE. But yes, ANY type of surgery has risks. Ppl shouldn't take surgery lightly</p></div>		</li>
