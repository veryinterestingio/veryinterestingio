			<div class="markdown"><p>The human brain is pretty good at compensating for speech, which is one reason talk radio survives on AM.  The main reason, of course, is that it's cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Umm no  -  Am reaches much further than FM on the same power.  It is not how bright it is, it is how bright it is relative to the low brightness</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is why the radio operators on the Titanic and Carpathian had an argument - Carpathian started broadcasting about 10 miles away from Titanic with enough power to be heard on land. The Titanic's Marconi operator was listening to the station on land (i.e. &quot;volume&quot; turned up to hear a faint signal) and then the Carpathian suddenly cut in so loudly that the operator threw his headset off to escape the noise (then radioed the Carpathian and told him to &quot;Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So weird how sounds transmitted through AM radio signals worked similarly to just yelling really fucking loud. I had no idea old transmissions used to drop off in <em>volume</em> as you got further away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The signal information gets overwhelmed by random noise at some distance from the source.  The are many sources of AM noise in the universe.  Very few FM &quot;noise&quot; sources.</p></div>		</li>
