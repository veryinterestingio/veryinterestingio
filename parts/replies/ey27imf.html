			<div class="markdown"><p>Since Clevertraders can see all the sale data from Shellsell, they just &quot; do the math&quot; so Shellsell makes just enough to cover operating expenses (employee wages, rent, operating costs). But Shellsell could pull an Amazon, and say &quot;We actually lost money cause we had expenses&quot; which they then get to write off as a tax credit after their fancy accounting.</p>
<p>The whole system is fucked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the mimum wage is just that. a minimum wage, in logistics it can account for around 40 percent of costs, the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The value is in the customer surplus, the price consumers are willing to pay for a good. the good itself has value related to the manufacturing costs and all processes involved, but it camnot be looked at in islolation as the supply chain can include other value added services alongside that product.</p>
<p>meaning more can ve extrcated off the customer surplus, its a small expense</p>
<p>start looking into other wages, such as CEO's.</p>
<p>e.g the highest paid boss in UK rakes in hunderds of millions in one year. gambling company
tied to Fixed odd betting, online poker etc.</p>
<p>track the relationship between minimum wage workes and their bosses. then the gap becomes really clear. </p>
<p>just remeber, companies doent work in the traditional way youre taught to think. there are levels of complexity involved. optimsation techniques and a range of skills above the common pay scale.</p>
<p>then we can talk about the Ginni coeficient.</p>
<p>or other ideas such as setting a maximum wage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but this is getting a little more difficult. The IRS and others push back on this and therefore companies obtain a “transfer pricing study” (usually from an independent accounting firm) to be able to argue that there is no overcharge on the first sale, and the IRS sometimes won’t even care what the study says. This method of creating a first sale/transfer pricing is usually part of a bigger, overall structure to reduce taxes but lately isn’t the only way (unless margins are thin anyway, in which case this works).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. The transfer pricing was the main bit that jumped out at me as being not entirely accurate — and accounting firms have profited enormously in the last years by providing services to show that the Arm's Length Principle is being adequately followed (which is to say, that assets are being sold at the same price internally for which they would be sold to faceless third parties).</p>
<p>Still an excellent summation of how much of this works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For american companies they left out thr investment incentives built into the tax code. </p>
<p>One of the main reasons amazon hasn't &quot;paid&quot; taxes is their investment. </p>
<p>So for the last 6 to 8 years amazon has exploded without &quot;paying&quot; taxes. It's because they lost money by building up the company. </p>
<p>These massive losses they took to build the infrastructure (they are still building more)
Get to count against their future profit.</p>
<p>So unless amazon makes more then it invested for 6 to 8 years in a single year they won't pay taxes until the investments have paid for themselves.</p>
<p>Obviously they still pay payroll taxes for all the 230,000 employees including Bezos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entirely reasonable point. The specifics of such are well beyond my ability to explain, let alone condense down  into an ELI5 but I hope the beverages analogy works to explain the general idea of profit shifting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn’t trying to indicate your explanation was bad. It was quite good. I just wanted people to know that this particular method of profit shifting isn’t the only way companies reduce tax liability, and when used it frequently is one of a few methods simultaneously put in place. There are many other methods that go beyond my ELI5 abilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then the large low tax paying corporations and wealthy individuals invest in the political system to elect &quot;representatives&quot; who hobble the IRS to prevent push back and any other &quot;unfriendly&quot; tax, regulation or government actions against them. Per the rules of this forum it is up to individual citizen to form opinions &quot;whether or not companies (and wealthy individuals) should avoid taxes, whether or not it is good or bad that they are able to do it, and whether or not governments are responsible for allowing it&quot; although studies of the legislative process have shown that it doesn't really matter what people think about it as so far it has no effect on the process. I guess in summary the simplified answer as to how the big corporation avoid paying taxes is by gaming and capturing the system.</p></div>		</li>

Edit: I understand why they are,I said I cant believe but morally it's a tough one,take money owed and put it into the country and people but lose the company vs fight it and keep the company and people in employment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it makes sense. Apple, Amazon etc are going to pay almost no tax anyway, so they may as well pay it in Ireland. In return Ireland get a lot of high pay jobs and get the appropriate income tax. They get infrastructure investment to support those companies. They become attractive to other large tech companies who want to be near their suppliers etc. It's win win for Ireland, and why it's against the rules and why the EU took them to court.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone likes to cite Ireland as the bogeyman, but no-one takes a couple of minutes to update their information.</p>
<p>Ireland closed the double Irish loophole in 2015, with existing use expiring in January. Apple has paid back billions in taxes, and while that money is still sitting in escrow while appeals run their course, that money will almost certainly end up with Ireland, with some ultimately finding it's way back into Europe. The replacement loophole some companies used, single malt, has also been closed. </p>
<p>When defending corporations using these schemes, the usual response is that companies are acting within the law and it's up to countries to close the loopholes (since morals don't count for anything apparently). We've closed the loopholes. We were pushed into it, but we did it. It's time to find a new bogeyman.</p></div>		</li>
