			<div class="markdown"><p>The water doesn't just disappear. And plants do not become more and more bloated with water indefinitely.</p>
<p>So if a plant has the same amount of water (roughly) day to day - and it does, especially if it doesn't grow rapidly day to day, which most houseplants don't - that water has to go somewhere. Specifically, it evaporates, mostly from the surface of the leaves.</p>
<p>So basically, the amount of water put into a plant will leave the plant, sooner or later, as extra humidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's used for transportation, transpiration and cooling.  I mean, a lot of water that humans drink just comes out as urine, sweat, spit or feces.  Just cause it's not utilized for growth doesn't mean it isn't utilized for other purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity!! Ding ding, this is correct. I have a piano and it goes out of tune if you don't keep the air between 35-50% humidity, so I have around 5 plants near it that I water and mist. I have a hygrometer (humidity reader) and I watch the humidity go up from high 20's to mid 30's in winter after I water the plants.</p></div>		</li>
