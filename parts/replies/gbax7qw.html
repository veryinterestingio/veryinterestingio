			<div class="markdown"><p>Substances like soap actually are able to make nonpolar things water soluble by forming structures called micelles.  They're basically microscopic bubbles that orient all of the soap's nonpolar tails inwards, which creates a little nonpolar space that can isolate oils from the surrounding water molecules.  The whole micelle is water soluble because the polar heads are pointed outwards where they can be solvated by water, and by encapsulating nonpolar molecules they are able to dissolve them in water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t the micelles dissolve the fatty materials inside the fatty part of the bulb though so it’s not making something water soluble, just giving it a polar coat for transport and easy rinsing? I thought that’s at least how it works with micelles in our body anyways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibacterial soap is not important or a useful option. If you need antibiotics, use antibiotics.</p>
<p>Soap also can disrupt bacterial cell walls, which will then rupture with the mechanical action of washing.  Apparently something similar goes on for viruses too, based on the fact that they’re recommending 20-second scrubbing with soap for corona virus.</p></div>		</li>
