			<div class="markdown"><p>bigger is an understatement...
As a human the visible universe is defined by how far light has traveled since the beginning of time. basically one giant sphere 93 billion light years across...</p>
<p>If the plank length being was standing on your toe and we slowed down light speed by a proportional amount to the plank length size... the equivalent portion of the human size person that would be visible at galaxy age time lengths would be approximately only a .2 nanometer sphere. </p>
<p>And to put that into perspective a human hair is about about 60,000 nanometers thick.</p></div>		</li>

So clever, yet that cleverness comes from simply taking a step back and viewing the situation in an almost &quot;common&quot; sense.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love the end bit, where you do all the rough calculations, then throw them away and go with your gut.</p>
<p>That last bit often helps to even out the estimation's building errors, and feels like it shouldn't work as well as it does. Especially to someone still in the formalization-of-everything stage of mathematics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A form of estimation set out by Enrico Fermi. Basically you do everything according to order of magnitude to get an approximate answer. The advantage of this is that the math is extraordinarily simple (usually just adding or removing zeroes) and is more accurate than you’d expect. </p>
<p>If you are involved in fields like engineering, any of the sciences etc. it’s closely related to a “sanity estimate” used to make sure that your computed answer is in the right ballpark. </p>
<p>So let’s say the question is about limbs - a human has one (closest order of magnitude). An insect has 10. Or, there are 10 rooms in a house. There are 100 people on a commercial aeroplane (or maybe 1000). </p>
<p>It may seem like this is too broad but it means an average person can do the math, very quickly, and with surprising accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna throw out a bad example but with the good explanation at the end.</p>
<p>How many trading card decks are currently assembled right now in New York City?</p>
<p>Well lets assume 1 in every 50 people have at least one deck. 1 out of 3 have 2 or more decks, so let's estimate that at 3 per person.  There are roughly 8 million people in the NYC. </p>
<p>8 million people/50 = 160,000*3 decks = 480,000 decks.</p>
<p>The more guesses you make the more accurate it will probably be because you are likely to underestimate a bunch and overestimate a bunch and they are likely to average out to something closer to the actual expected.</p>
<p>Now to look at the data, which definitely isn't there. We have ~430 million MTG cards in just 5 early sets. Yu-Gi-Oh has reported at 22 billion total ten years ago. Pokemon I can't find an estimate for. But even just assuming what we have we see 22.4 Billion cards. With just this we see there is at least 357 million decks. As a percentage of world population NYC has 0.14%. 0.14% of our world decks is ~500,000. Honestly surprised that came so close. Of course this is with the very much smaller total card count, but we also assumed every card is part of a deck and not a collection. But remember this is moreso a fun though experiment with a mathematical justification.</p></div>		</li>

We could be off by a factor of 10 if we hold onto the prefactors though. That's using relative sizes, meaning we get this answer from division.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want an answer on an absolute scale then half the observable universe is halfway between the size of a Planck length and the size of the observable universe. That's from subtraction.</p></div>		</li>
