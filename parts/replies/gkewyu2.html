			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about other states but in CA when you make an offer it’s common practice to be backed by a earnest money deposit that the buyer looses to the seller if they back out anytime after 21 days into the process (as with everything, there are exceptions to this).  I don’t think the deposit is required but it’s a good faith deposit so most sellers won’t accept an offer without one.  Just sold my house also located in CA 6 months ago, I 100% wouldn’t have accepted an offer without one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There is an earnest money deposit in most states.</p>
<p>If the buyer breaches, the seller gets the buyer's earnest money. </p>
<p>If the buyer fails to get financing by the finance deadline,  it is not a breach, the contract is vacated, and the buyer gets his earnest money back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but I think that only applies if there is a loan contingency.  At 21 days, standard purchase contacts call for contingencies to be removed in which case, the buyer failing to get funding would then not be eligible to receive their earnest money deposit back, unless the loan contingency was not removed.</p>
<p>ETA: this is why as either a buyer or seller, it’s very important to do your research AND have a good agent who knows the laws and can fight on your behalf to make sure the contract is fair for you without making it unappealing to the other party.  My agent had to fight for us a bit because the buyers came in with a very lowball offer that I honestly was torn on even countering.  We did counter and they signed our counter immediately but I made it clear that the counter included concessions for what they wanted (replace the carpet/flooring) and that it included any other little things they may want to do, and that we would not be giving them anything else they asked for after the inspection unless it was reasonable and/or required by law.  When they tried to pull extra bullshit because the dryer vent needed to be cleaned (we hadn’t even moved out yet and it had been cleaned out the year prior), and a ceiling fan wasn’t working (which stopped working because they dicked around with the taped down switch during their initial viewing and I fixed as soon as we found out), I had our agent push back.  I gave them a few things that were a little costly but absolutely reasonable and I would hope for as a buyer, but the rest of the stuff they wanted was just trying to nickel and dime the price down which I had already anticipated they’d do based on the borderline insulting low initial offer.  </p>
<p>TL/DR: protect yourself with a good agent that is experienced and will fight for you if needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well lemme introduce you to “due diligence” in NC. That money goes to the seller regardless. The buyer never gets that money back unless the seller backs out. </p>
<p>In NC, when I bought, I didn’t put any earnest money down. It was all due diligence because no one cares about that earnest money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having bought and sold several houses in CA, what you say is technically accurate.  However, there are usually several contingencies on any typical deal, with financing and inspection being the two most common.  </p>
<p>The inspection contingency allows you to walk away for almost any reason.  Inspections <em>always</em> find things.  No house is perfect.   Most are small things - “the walkway leading up to the house has a hairline crack in it” yet you can use any of those reasons to simply walk away and get 100% of your money back.  </p>
<p>It is not hard to cancel a deal and still get your earnest money back.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that the buyer can only walk if the seller is unwilling to do whatever repairs are recommended.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Absolutely true. And given that in a hot market if your house has been &quot;on the msrket&quot; for more than like 2 weeks people will assume there's something drastically wrong with it / the price having someone walk can cost tens of thousands.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bank pre-approval is extraordinarily common where I am, and still cash buyers seem to be preferred. This is in a sellers market too.</p>
<p>Any insight on why it's still so preferable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ability to skip the appraisal with a cash offer is attractive, especially in a sellers market when people are willing to pay over asking price or over the appraised value.</p>
<p>The bank will not lend over the appraised value, so the buyer then would have to have the cash to bridge the gap and if they don’t, the deal could be off. Accepting a cash offer skirts this possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pre-approval just means that the buyer more or less qualified to take out a loan based on credit score and income. It doesn't guarantee a seamless transaction because there's a lot of stuff that could still go wrong.</p></div>		</li>
