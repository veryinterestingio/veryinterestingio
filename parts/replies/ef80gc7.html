			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, so White House briefing, one mic to many: IE sharing feed.</p>
<p>But news gathered out in the field: BYOM.</p>
<p>The big thing is this: do you as a news agency trust the person who setup the mic feed to have done it right? White House: sure. Local police captain: not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an audio professional the problem is camera operators who don't know how to adjust their audio.  I'll get a room full of journalists and set up an audio distribution amplifier for them; 1/3 say it's fine, 1/3 say it's too loud, 1/3 say it's too quiet.  I'm giving all of them the same feed off Aux 1 and they don't know the difference between Mic level and Line level on their cameras</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good lord this. That, and having them stroll up and ask for an audio feed <em>as the show is starting</em>. No, fuck off, I’m busy now. I’m not going to hold the show just to go grab some more cables for you. You should have asked an hour ago like everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the person running the microphone isn't giving each group an audio file that they can broadcast. The microphone basically has a big splitter on the end of it. The raw electrical pulses from the microphone are split, and this raw feed is run outside and each news truck gets their own copy of this raw data. Each truck will have a different kind of setup in the truck to translate the raw signal into audio, and then transmit that to their studio.</p>
<p>So the ELI5 is like, notice how your MP3 player will sound different when you plug it into different kinds of speakers, even though the same analogue data is being sent down the cord? Same thing here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but there are more ears on the White house checking for discrepancies. A local police department press conference might only have 1 or 2 people trying to catch cheats, if any. If the White House doctors an audio tape, you bet your ass multiple people will catch it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am a live audio tech. Can confirm. I can use something called a press box to split any feed into as many camera feeds as I want. It’s called a press box because it’s used by (you guessed it) the press. I can run a single line level signal to wherever the press is setting up, then use a press box to split it into 12 mic level feeds. It saves me the trouble of running 12 separate cables, and ensures that all of the mixes coming off of that box are identical. I have 6 news outlets in the building? I can tell them “my press box is going to be here,” and they’ll know that is where they need to plug in to get signal from my system. I’m only really limited by how much hardware I actually have on-site.</p>
<p>My main audio console, for instance, has 32 outs. As in, I can send 32 entirely separate and unique mixed feeds out of my console. Then I can slap a press box onto each one of those, to split each one into 12 identical feeds. So I can have 12 of feed 1, 12 of feed 2, 12 of feed 3, all the way up to feed 32. That’s enough to send to a small army of cameras, and I’d never realistically need that many. But I could, if I had the hardware for it, (I only have 4 press boxes in my inventory. If a news outlet wants more than 48 feeds, they can bring their own damned press boxes...) Things these days have gotten even more advanced, where using systems like Dante I can send an audio feed to multiple places at the same time. So I can do something like send the same feed to six different rooms, so the news organizations don’t even need to be in the same room with each other.</p>
<p>Also, for live broadcast, you’ll usually have some sort of redundancy in place. They may have 2 mics on their lectern, but only 1 is being used. The second is purely a backup, in case things go sideways and the first one dies for some reason. They’re both sending to the audio console, which is mixing the incoming signals and sending them to various places. In the case of a redundancy, the second mic will simply be muted until it’s needed. If one of those mics catastrophically fails for some reason, you can’t just walk out in front of the cameras to fix it. So you need to plan for backups and redundancies.</p>
<p>...But all of this goes out the window when you’re not in an established building that’s equipped to handle a press conference. Setting up on the front steps of a police station or courthouse? Each news org is basically on their own, and will be responsible for handling their own feeds. There isn’t a house feed for them to rely on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. A snake usually has multiple separate ins/outs. A press box is just a single feed split into multiple identical feeds. Also, I’m trying to avoid using too much jargon, (or at least explaining the jargon I do use,) because people reading may not be familiar with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A snake is useful for sending multiple feeds to one location, say you had 10 mics for a panel discussion that all needed to come back to a single mixer. A Press box is almost the opposite, it takes a single feed and duplicates it to many different end points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only in the same way that a line&gt;mic level conversion would. That’s all it’s doing. It takes the line level signal and splits it into transformer isolated mic level signals. <em>Every</em> system will have noise, but the transformer isolation helps reduce things like hum from bad power on a camera.</p></div>		</li>
