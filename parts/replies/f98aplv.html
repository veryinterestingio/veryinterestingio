<p>I'd say that if OP wants to soften himself to the ticklish world that hardened him, he should experiment with tickling. Maybe tickle a close friend or partner, consensually of course, to experience the joyful stress of it all. Maybe involve some alcohol or caffeine (depending on what they like) to loosen the shackles around this writer's soul.</p></div>		</li>
