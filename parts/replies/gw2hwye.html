			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in home insurance and people try to offset the depreciation of their items by claiming everything is less than 3 years old. What they don't realize is that if you have a home worth $200K, you often have personal contents of $100K. If you turn in $100K worth of stuff in your fire claim but say everything is less than three years old, you are basically saying, &quot;Yes, I bought $33K in stuff every year for the last three years.&quot; This is how a claim can get flagged for potential fraud. </p>
<p>It runs the same as the principle listed above in Skatingraccoon's comment. &quot;You earn $50K per year and you spent $33K on things for your home? We are going to need some receipts.&quot; Fraud is bad. That's how dummies get caught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is funny but I &quot;fired&quot; my long-term homeowners insurance company because they kept boosting my premiums and claiming my furniture was worth ~$130k.  I kept calling them and arguing it down but every year their computer boosted the value back up.</p>
<p>My furniture is literally all from goodwill or the curbside.  Owning a house doesn't make me the Monopoly Man (tm).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a student I got contents insurance in case someone stole my computer or television. All up I might have owned $5k worth of contents, but every company I contacted insisted that I must own more than that. One insurer suggested that most people have on average $50k worth of stuff and that's what I should be insured for.</p>
<p>I had a bed that was twenty years old and worn out, a desk donated by a friend, an office chair I made out of an old car seat, a cupboard full of secondhand clothing. My electronics were the only things of value and they were nothing remarkable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just talked to my insurance guy.  He said personal contents are 70% of home value.  If there’s a fire, then they’ll nitpick what you lost and how much it’s worth.  It’s just a computer generated number.  He asked me if my stuff would be worth 70% of my homes value.  I said “I’ll go burn it right now in the back yard if you’ll write me a check for that amount!”</p></div>		</li>

<p>My 7 year old sofa set is in pristine condition because it's barely used (guest room) and is well taken care of. The insurance company is gonna rip me off for this and there's no way I'm going to be able to replace it for the amount they give me. But they sure didn't have any problems taking my money every month. Rant over. </p>
<p>That being said you've brought up a great point, didn't think about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I never got about insurances that only pay out the amount something is worth it <em>now.</em> I'm not selling it to you, I need to <em>replace</em> it. If I wreck my car, the point of insurance should be to get a new car, not to get what the old car was still worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) there’s no way to spend $20k in cash under the radar.
2) (I work in Anti Money Laundering) every time a customer deposits or withdrawals over $10k in cash from a bank, that bank reports that to the government. So when someone deposits a bunch of cash on a regular basis the government is gonna ask where the hell they got it.
3) Every time you buy a house or a car it is not a two party transaction even if it’s cash. That house is the sellers until they provide the government records of the sale. The local government records who owns every property so they can collect property taxes from them.</p>
<p>So ultimately you can spend dirty cash but in MUCH smaller amounts than you’d think. Like under $10,000.</p>
<p>Edit: yeah, I know that there are DEFINITELY ways to spend $20k under the radar in one lump transaction (not talking about multiple transactions) but I stated the point to illustrate that someone will likely have to report that cash down the road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while back me and a buddy had the “opportunity” to snatch about prolly 30k in cash.  TLDR : were firefighters and while cleaning up a house fire at the trap house, we found the stash about half burned up, soaked in water, torn apart.  We hesitated and didn’t take it.  Always thought I’d just buy little things the rest of my life. Coffee, diner, groceries.....shit like that to stay low key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many cash business owners use this method to get around paying taxes, problem is as soon as anyone gives you the least bit of scrutiny the whole thing usually comes undone.</p>
<p>Anecdote, but there was a guy in my area who owned a string of restaurants and would do just that, take a couple hundred from this business, couple from that business, no one world notice a small amount missing from a high cash business. His son ended up shooting someone in a parking lot, and since the son worked for his dad, they started wondering how the son could afford the car he drove there on the salary his dad gave him. </p>
<p>This led them to opening the books on the family business (unrelated to the murder), and the IRS ended up auditing him and found close to a million in cash in his home safe, all undeclared. He fled the country and his son is in jail, while the businesses were sold off. But for years he had been pinching money and no one was the wiser, until something totally outside his control caused him to be put under the slightest amount of scrutiny.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Had this literally happen on reddit yesterday.  Someone posted (now deleted) in another sub how their debit card stopped working, and when he called the bank said they had to come in to clear it up.  Dude says his &quot;business&quot; had suddenly increased how that everyone was no longer in lockdown, and he had recently made several large cash deposits into his account.    </p>
<p>Told him, yeah, that's pretty suspicious, just go into the bank with all of your business documents and receipts and invoices to show the origin of the money, and you should be good to go.  Basically responds saying he doesn't have any paperwork or receipts or anything like that &quot;lol&quot;, and a very quick check of his recent posting history shows almost exclusively drug-related stuff.  Yeah...I think your account at the bank may be in trouble with that, dude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat related being in restaurants, and on a much smaller scale, many people who earn cash tips just take them and spend them as cash not even realizing they are supposed to be reporting that. Some states like California apparently estimate your tips and will come after you for them if it looks too far off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can be audited by the IRS at any time and for any reason - some people are audited as a random sampling, and then you'll have some explaining to do. If you're serious about large sums of dirty money, you have to account for this scenario. Otherwise, if you've ever watched the first few episodes of Ozarks, all you have is a few years of groceries, disposable consumables whose record of their purchase and consumption is going to be effectively untraceable. I mean, how is the IRS otherwise going to know you spent $5k of dirty money, in cash, on yogurt, and ate the evidence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember this story my dad told me about my grandfather who had a farm and didn’t mind a bit of dirty money. He once had this surprise inspection by the equivalent IRS in his country. Obviously they found out about irregularities so he had to pay a fine. My grandma was pretty pissed off by this. My grandfather on the other had had a big smile on his face because the fine was close to nothing compared to all the money he succesfully hid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's assume someone committed a crime that resulted in $150K in cash. You could live off that for some time if you were willing to settle for a humble existence. You'd still need to drive a used car since you cant just go into a dealership and buy a $50K car with a bag full of money. I mean, you could, but that's how you get caught. You still need to live in the same place you're living before because you cant necessarily start paying a landlord $5K a month in cash month after month. And if you do use the money to pay your current mortgage or rent (say $1500 or $2000 a month), you still need to deposit that in cash at your bank in order to pay the mortgage company or landlord. After a while, a consistent pattern of cash-only deposits will get noticed. So you're going to find that $150K might make eating at a decent restaurant easy or paying for some new clothes at the mall a trivial thing. But that's about as far as you can take it without causing a pattern that authorities can pick up on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess in my mind I'm thinking I just stumbled upon $150k in cash while I still already have my current job / money. If you were homeless or something it'd probably be a little more difficult.</p>
<p>But if it is just my current life + 150k in dirty cash I'd definitely settle for continuing the meager life and spending the dirty cash on small things. I already have a car and all that I don't really want / need more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These aren't good examples because if you approached a small time landlord with an offer to pay in cash, they might jump at the chance of making their own tax-free money.  You not paying rent for a year (on paper) might not show up on anyone's radar because you might be paying a roommate/girlfriend cash, who then pays via check.  You can pay the mortgage or car note via money order, same deal.</p></div>		</li>
