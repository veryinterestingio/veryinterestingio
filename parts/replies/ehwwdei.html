<p>A generic question like 'favorite book' tends to not spark any context, but if someone said 'what's your favorite recent sci-fi book' I can instantly say 'the expanse'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on whether you have thought about a &quot;favorite&quot; before. If you sit down now and think about your favorite book, you can sit for hours and eventually you might come to a conclusion that book X is your favorite. When someone then asks you, you can immediately answer with X because you already thought about it and made the decision.</p>
<p>But if you've never made that decision before, you suddenly have to think about each and every book you have ever read and then value each and every one of them against each other in a matter of seconds and that just results in a metaphorical bluescreen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it also mean it's something you haven't considered before? And it would take some time to try to process how many books you've read.</p>
<p>Oddly, I can instantly tell anyone my favorite book because it hasn't changed in the 40 or so years since I first read it.  I can also tell anyone instantly the book I most despise since nothing I've read in the 35 or so years following has aggravated as much since.  But the hundreds (or thousands) I've read other than those two fall somewhere in the 'enjoyed to varying degrees' category and couldn't name a top 5 out of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, partially here it's because most people aren't making a mental list of their favorite books while they're reading them. They're simply enjoying them. There's no &quot;favorite book&quot; memory because that thought process was never made in the first place. </p>
<p>I have a list of favorite books in my head, and I could answer the question, because I've thought about it. But I also travel a lot and eat at local foodie spots, and someone asked me the other day &quot;what is the best meal you've had&quot; and I simply can't answer. I've never eaten a food and said &quot;this is the best food I've had of all the food&quot; so then I've got to try to evaluate every meal I've ever had, and that requires going through various random meal memories in my head and evaluating them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why &quot;memory palaces&quot; work: you connect a fact or idea with an image, because the brain is much better at recalling images than abstract ideas. Same as if you forget something you walk back into the room where you thought of it and something you see triggers it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did something like this in law school (but didn't have a name for it). Every semester, I'd pick one album and listen to only that, over and over, while studying for finals. Then during the test, I could just start playing the songs in my head and could practically read my notes in my memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to do this accidentally.  Like there are TV shows and songs that I watch or hear and instantly remember what I was doing last time I watched it heard that song.  I wish it happened with useful stuff though lol.  </p></div>		</li>
