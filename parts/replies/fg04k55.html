			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first question:</p>
<p>When it comes to a workout, you first and foremost try to find a workout you love. Then it’s really easy to create the habit. For example, this morning I went surfing. Twice. I love it, and it’s a really hard workout.</p>
<p>Your other questions —&gt; Can you ask them in a different post? They are really different from the workout habit question? </p>
<p>(Sorry for the extra step, but I want to keep posts and answers tidy, if I can)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>emotions</strong> - How you feel about this habit? What emotions do you feel when you do any action connected to this habit? Let's say you like riding a bicycle but hate walking. Your habit is to go to the gym every second day. If you will plan to walk there, you're less likely to succeed, better ride a bike to the gym.</li>
<li><strong>reward</strong></li>
<li><strong>social importance</strong> - People won't care as much about your morning jogging as about not being late to work so they will give you more feedback on what they think is good. I'm not saying to follow this but it can change how you feel about these habits and it can increase or decrease the chance for success.</li>
