			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. Dark mode can look nice but forget about reading for any length of time. White background/black text doesn't bother me. I just keep the brightness down lower than most people I know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank god, I felt like I was the only one. Saying that on threads about dark mode usually gets you downvoted. I really don't care if my eyes take half a second to adapt when I browse my phone in bed at 3AM, I don't really get why it's such an issue to some people. I'll pick whichever interface is looks best and until recently a lot of dark modes looked like shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely experience this. It's annoying because I typically prefer the aesthetics of dark mode, so every now and then I'll switch it on to enjoy it, but after reading for about 5 minutes my eyes are hurting and I'm seeing white lines everywhere I look. So I always end up changing it back to boring black text on white background. But it's just so much easier to read!</p></div>		</li>
