<li>We work closely withe the food group at Johnson space center and look specifically for plants that are high in key nutrients which may be low in the packaged diet.  We have no cooking now on the ISS (except the new cookie oven!) so we are focusing on pick-and -eat crops to help supplement the packaged diet.  The astronauts mix these foods with other things in the diet.</li>
<li>We are looking at this - these would be custom space crops plants that could flourish in this environment with it's associated stresses.  We have not had crops genetically engineered yet but have a list of traits that are of interest.</li>
<li>They are interesting. We would be especially interested in edible fungi that could be grown from inedible plant parts.  </li>

<p>They are experimenting with baking in space with a small oven. Sadly the astronauts canâ€™t eat the cookies for now since the samples have to be sent back to earth to study them.</p></div>		</li>
