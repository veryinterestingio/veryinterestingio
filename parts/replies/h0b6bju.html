			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone else here is wrong.  This is the right answer.  Molecules are hitting the hand directly and we feel that interaction and the loss of heat.  On the opposing side, some  molecules are slipping past the hand but mostly we are trying to sense a drop in pressure and that's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the right answer, not the most voted ones. So the hand would stop the straight  flow of air. Wouldn't have thought of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wohohooa.. MAMA!! That's correct. ;d   </p>
<p>But no matter how many holes are in your hand to allow the most straight flow possible.. the air still won't <em>hit</em> the flat surface of your hand itself.. and will still feel weird in comparison. ;3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if this explanation were correct, wouldn't you feel an air current initially as you interrupt the air flow?</p>
<p>Top answer might still explain the most of this phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>
