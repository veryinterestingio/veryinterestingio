			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the thing, narcan, when absorbed through a mucus membrane, stays mostly inert. It's why they can give it to addicts along with buprenorphine when taken sublingual.</p>
<p>It's most effective when taken directly through the blood or <em>inhaled</em> into the lungs. Again useful for addicts to keep them from insuffilating, smoking or shooting their meds.</p>
<p>So if the person isn't breathing, you arent going to get high enough useful absorption to help through the nose, and need an injector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re on the right track, but you seem to have a couple things backwards. </p>
<p>Narcan is not inert when administered through the mucous membranes. In fact, that’s exactly how it is being absorbed when it is atomized into the nose. It is not inhaled into the lungs; if that were the case, then narcan would be totally ineffective against opiate overdoses as those who have overdosed are often not breathing. It is worth noting, however, that Narcan is more readily absorbed through the mucous membranes of the nose as compared to the mucous membranes of the sublingual area. </p>
<p>Narcan is an added agent in the buprenorphine preparation known as Suboxone, which is typically administered via the sublingual route. The beauty of this preparation is that Narcan has a lower bioavailability via the sublingual route and the ratio of Narcan to buprenorphine is adjusted in such a way that the Narcan does not completely block the effects of the buprenorphine. Conversely, if a recovering addict where to attempt to melt down the Suboxone and inject it intravenously, where Narcan has a much greater bioavailability, the added Narcan would completely block its effects. The precursor to Suboxone, Probuphine, was a pure buprenorphine preparation and IV abuse was a common problem, thus, Suboxone was brought to the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The naloxone in suboxone is basically for patent reasons. Many addicts shoot suboxone with naloxone in it and say it's no different than shooting straight subutex, others however say it has a slight different feel to it but that could be psychological. Buperenorphine has a way higher affinity than naloxone so the naloxone is pretty much inactive. I've read stories of people using buperenorphine to bring people back from OD by putting some under their tongue and massaging it in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those stories were not true. There isn't enough in there to bring someone back to begin with</p></div>		</li>
