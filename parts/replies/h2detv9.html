			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the opposing waves actually cancel the vibration, or just the perception of it in our brain? Like, if you have perfectly opposed signals that are both very &quot;loud&quot; could it damage your hearing without you actually.. hearing..it?</p>
<p>Sorry if that doesn't make sense I'm very tired</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually cancel. If you have +10 and -10 (equal amplitude, opposite sign) then you really do get zero. </p>
<p>But they only do that at some very specific points in space. Everywhere else the cancellation isn’t perfect and you get some noise. </p>
<p>We don’t have the technology to totally cancel it well enough for us not to hear it at all. If you made it loud enough you’d damage your hearing. </p>
<p>If you could get it to exactly cancel across the whole surface of your ear (and everything else that can conduct sound into your ear) then you wouldn’t hear anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha gotcha, ty. In a similar vein, I know there are some sounds that are outside of our range to hear. Does not hearing them mean they don't vibrate us, therefore can't get &quot;loud&quot; to damage hearing? (In a perfect case scenario, not accounting for like bleeding into a frequency we actually could hear)</p>
<p>I guess I'm really fixated on the idea of a loud sound affecting you but not actually hearing it for some reason</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By cancelling out the sound wave, you can actually diminish the sound you want to hear. I did an experiment a decade ago, about the time of the south africa association football world cup. This was for broadcasting and recording, as opposed to noise cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>You listened to some speech on one pair of headphones, with background noise. Then different levels of noise cancelling were added on different headphones, by removing certain frequencies, or subtracting the recorded background noise from the speech. Then, you were asked to say which one was clearest and made the most sense. Surprisingly, the one with the full background noise was sometimes the clearest and certainly wasn't bottom overall. The brain is fantastic at zoning out what you don't want to hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are physically altering the waves. The main thing I think of is turning instruments together. You get this thing called &quot;beats&quot; when you are out of tune. And it is like the volume of the sound is changing in a wave pattern. Once you tune together, it mostly goes away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Noise cancellung works on physical sound waves.</p>
<p>Tinnitus is purely a &quot;brain hallucination&quot;. No actual sound waves involved, so nothing to cancel unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to wiki:</p>
<p>Rather than a disease, tinnitus is a symptom that may result from various underlying causes and may be generated at any level of the auditory system and structures beyond that system.[2] The most common causes are hearing damage, noise-induced hearing loss or age-related hearing loss, known as presbycusis.[2] Other causes include ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière's disease, brain tumors, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, earwax, and sometimes, the tinnitus is suddenly perceived during a period of emotional stress.[2][4]</p>

<p>I hear buzzing - so that must be some kind of high frequency constantly being heard / perceived.
Say it is at 17kHz, and that frequency has a specific sine wave, could the opposite sine wave of the same frequency not cancel the noise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This area remark is valid for either wanting to do noise cancelling rooms, or with extremely high frequencies, but even a 1 kHz wave has a wavelength of 34 cm which is at least a magnitude higher than the dimensions of your ear drum. Thus, the pressure is equal in your ear canal at low frequencies where the noise cancelling is used in earphones/headphones. </p>
<p>The reason we cannot get it to zero has mainly to do with both the microphones, speakers and software not being entirely linear, and thus the cancelling is not perfect.</p>
<p>Please note that the dB-scale is linear, so it would get increasingly difficult to get it down some more dBs. Currently we are around 30-35 dB of damping in the 200 Hz range which means a damping of around 30 to 50 times (no calculator at hand, so approximated).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I see I forgot the &quot;n't&quot; inthe remark about the scale. However, my approximations are 5 and 12% off respectively, which I think is definitely not nonsense. If you want to be more accurate than that, you also have to question the 30-35 dB stated above.</p></div>		</li>
