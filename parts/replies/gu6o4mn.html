			<div class="markdown"><p>You can always clip the waveform after whatever stage of amplification is changed by the volume control. </p>
<p>There's not really a hard line between will cause damage and won't cause damage. It's more likely the highest volume setting just slowly breaks down the speaker cone, or the materials just slowly oxidize and degrade until volume levels that were perfectly fine when new will immediately destroy it after it's been sitting unused for 20 years. </p>
<p>The companies that make consumer electronics neither try nor want to make a product that lasts forever. Their objective is to make it last long enough the consumer won't be pissed off, while being as cheap as possible to manufacture. Why put in a more expensive speaker when the cheap one will last 5 years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are buying speakers in that price range, you are also probably buying the amp separately, and how should that amp know how much power your particular speakers can handle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is because it's not only the voltage it's also the frequency. 5W at 20hz is not much but 5W at 15kHz is a lot as tweeters can handle way less power than bass drivers.</p>
<p>There are ways to clip the power and active speakers do it quite often. For passive speakers it's difficult as the amp and the speaker are in different boxes and the amp doesn't know what the speaker does. It's only + and - leads.</p>
<p>You could also detect when the speaker exceeds the max excursion. But all this is difficult and expensive so it's mostly studio quality active speakers that offer any protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are multiple ways to damage your sound system. Simply having loud noise is certainly one way; Just as you said, the louder noises will cause the speaker cones to move further, which can stretch them past their specifications. You’ve described a high power factor event, which can blow speaker cones. Another way is via heat, produced by a low power factor, due to something called clipping.</p>
<p>To explain clipping and power factors, (and how it generates heat) we first need to explain how sound works. Sound is a compression wave. It has a push and a pull. And so does analog audio; It mirrors sound by having a positive voltage (push) and a negative voltage (pull) which affects the speakers. But what happens if the sound is too loud for the hardware to handle? Those smooth waves get <a href="https://www.mtx.com/i/mtxcom/clipped-signal.jpg" target="_blank">squared off</a> at the top/bottom of the wave when they hit the maximum/minimum that the hardware can handle. We can hear this as distortion. </p>
<p>But it also generates extra heat, by requiring more power. See, producing that wave uses electricity. Bigger waves use more electricity, to cause the speaker cone to move further. But a square wave is slightly different, because it’s not something your hardware is heat rated for. A large sudden wave (like the kind that will blow your speaker cones) uses a lot of energy for a brief moment. But a square wave uses lots of energy <em>for a sustained period of time.</em></p>
<p>When they test and rate an amp, they use a sine wave. Go back to the image above, and notice all of the “empty” space in a sine wave. If you actually do the math, measure points, average them out, etc... Between the minimum and maximum values, a  perfect sine wave has an “emptiness” (or power factor) value of 3. As in, because it’s not usually at the maximum or minimum values, (it’s usually curving up or down) it has 3 times more “empty” space than it does used space. So to produce a sine wave of a given amplitude, you only have to use, (on average,) 1/3 of the maximum/minimum amplitude for said sine wave... Still with me?</p>
<p>In other words, let’s say I want to produce a sine wave with a peak power of 1 volt. On average, producing that sine wave will only use ~0.333 volts. Because I’m only <em>really</em> using 1v when the wave is at its highest/lowest values. Hopefully that makes sense? </p>
<p>But a square wave is different. Notice how the flattened top/bottom cause it to “hang” at its highest and lowest values for a little while before beginning to curve again? That means it’s using <em>more power</em> on average to produce that wave, because it’s spending more time at the peak values. Not because the wave is louder, but because it’s staying at that max/min value for longer. As a wave squares off more and more, the power factor approaches 1. As in producing a 1 volt square wave will require closer and closer to 1v as it gets more and more square, (meaning it stays at that maximum and minimum for longer...) </p>
<p>Remember how I said hardware is heat rated using a sine wave? This means that if an amp says it can produce x volts, it can only do so <em>safely</em> at a power factor of 3 or higher. As your power factor drops lower and lower by squaring off your waves, the amp has to push more and more power to produce those waves, which generates excess heat the unit isn’t designed to handle.</p>
<p>You can blow cones with a high power factor, (as in, a sudden sharp burst, which doesn’t use much average power but has a large amplitude,) but you’ll smoke your amps with a low power factor, (as in, a long sustained square wave, which your speakers may be able to handle but that your amp isn’t heat rated for.</p></div>		</li>
