<p>Somewhere in my deeply rooted child psyche that was raised Catholic, I immediately want to agree with this sentiment (despite having no religious anything in my life anymore)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well John the Baptist said he was the one who was to prepare the way for the Messiah. So his message was that Christ was coming. Based on that, John the Baptist couldn't compete with Jesus since he was just a forerunner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A key thing is to remember that you literally had different scripture.</p>
<p>I think the Gnostics were just as Christian as the Pope, but they did tend to accept a different set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nag_Hammadi_library" target="_blank">books</a>. (This is just an example of one gnostic sect, who still - like most of them, iirc - held Jesus as the &quot;true messenger&quot;. <em>Thomas</em> is the famous one, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Treatise_of_the_Great_Seth" target="_blank">this</a> one is a wild ride in which Jesus basically derides John the Baptist, among others.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the believers in John the Baptist you speak of are the Mandaeans. They still exist today. An interesting theory is that if a historical John existed, he was an adherent, and thus influenced a historical Jesus which injected a thread of Gnosticism (and baptism) into early Christianity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buddhism, in my view (have read many texts, theravada and mahayana) is simply the nature of suffering and how to end it. Thats it. Buddha wasn’t concerned about God or where the universe came from, but just the nature of suffering and how to end it. Gnostic texts speak of things like the demiurge and archons, things that basic Buddhism is unconcerned with.</p>
<p>You can get deeper if you want but I feel that is the best description of Buddhism overall. But you’re also right in a sense. If you take a certain interpretation, there isn’t much difference between them, or between any religions really. Check Perennial Philosophy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ElI5 version is that Buddhism teaches that we are ignorant to the true nature of reality - we see permanence in things and people and abstract concepts and beliefs that in truth are ephemeral, in a constant state of birth and change and death and rebirth. In being unable to see the truth about the impermanence of things, we form attachments to them that cause us suffering. Including, most challengingly, the impermanence/non-existence of the self as a separable entity, attachment to which causes us to be trapped in a cycle of birth, death, and reincarnation. Buddhist doctrine teaches that a prescribed path of righteous behavior and thought leads to enlightenment, that is, to reach those realizations of ignorance and thus be liberated from the cycle of suffering.</p>
<p>If we take the gnostic tenets in similarly high level terms, they teach that the reality we experience is an illusion, and thus it causes us suffering through ignorance of and distance from the true nature of god. They suggest a lesser deity is responsible for the delusion; our souls are the manifold emanations from the oneness of a supreme being, which become trapped in a devious fleshy prison and the material world. Salvation can be achieved by obtaining knowledge of the true nature of god, which was brought to earth incarnate in Jesus Christ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well. while the fundamental idea of escaping suffering through understanding is a similarity everything else is different.</p>
<p>Gnosticism was a monotheistic or dualistic religion that believed in a true/false universe and also, as far as I know, did not believe in reincarnation.</p>
<p>Buddhism is a religon that does not necessarily feature any divine being, where it's just you, the universe, your constant reincarnation into physical existence due to your attachment to worldly pleasures and suffering and how to detach your soul from all of that.</p></div>		</li>
