			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on Patient charting software (electronic medical records) and until there is no way to hand off all of your patients to the next shift in less than 30 minutes based on what doctors and nurses told me. You miss a detail and it’s someone’s life. Until machine learning can accurately follow someone’s symptoms shifts won’t be changing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely true. The problem is exacerbated in departments that require nurses to take 6-10 acute care patients. Now, I’m certainly not contributing all errors to this one factor. This is one factor in a sea of factors. </p>
<p>Let’s take for example, an RN administering blood. At a high level, let me try and take you through each step (make miss one or two):</p>
<ol>
<li>Patient has to decide to donate </li>
<li>The collector must accurately document the donors history and blood type. </li>
<li>the collector must properly label the specimen</li>
<li>the collector must properly store the specimen </li>
<li>the specimen must be transported to final destination properly</li>
<li>the blood specimen must be stored properly by receiving destination and logged into their internal systems correctly. </li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s just the donor part....continuing along into an inpatient setting:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nurse must properly collect the type and screen of the intended patient. </li>
<li>nurse must label the type and screen appropriately </li>
<li>nurse must identify right patient, send to lab in timely manner and process, spin, and result it</li>
</ol>
<p>And on and on....and I haven’t even gotten to the nursing administration part yet. </p>
<p>But you get my point. There are many many handoff touch points here, many points of potential failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lab tech here. If any of these steps is ignored / done improperly, we’re working with incomplete information. Any tiny error in the process that happens before the specimen gets to us causes the problem to get compounded, and the results we supply to the clinical team are inaccurate / erroneous. </p>
<p>For instance- nurse accidentally draws blood from the same arm in which patient is receiving IV fluids, nurse inaccurately records the time of draw, or nurse fails to chart that a patient is receiving a certain type of medication and the results we give to the clinicians aren’t worth much and can lead to some horrible decision-making.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>great write up. a lot of people that don't work in healthcare seem to think that it's all YOLO, but there's always a specific procedure on how to do things correctly and properly, and it's very time consuming and involved although for good reason most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Administration:</p>
<p>1: Nurse must order the blood products from from blood bank</p>
<p>2: nurse must call blood bank and tell them to send blood </p>
<p>3: Nurse must pick up blood from the blood bank, send their tech to get the blood, or if you’re lucky and have a tube system, have it sent to you.</p>
<p>4: Nurse must find an IV pole and pump  if the patient doesn’t have one and grab a bag of saline and an IV line for blood</p>
<p>5: Nurse or tech must take vital signs. </p>
<p>6: Nurse must grab a second nurse to sign off that you have the right patient, the right blood product, that it isn’t expired, and that consent is documented</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nurse must tubing, connect IV line to patient and start the blood at 50 ml per hour. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurse or tech must directly observe patient for the first 15 minutes in case they have a transfusion reaction. Nurse or tech must take another set of vitals after 15 minutes. If they show no signs of a reaction, increase the rate to 150. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurse or tech must take vital signs at 45 minutes in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administer saline after blood administration is complete. </p>
</li>
<li>Take post-transfusion vital signs and dispose of all tubing in a biohazard bag.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't hand off using the computer chart. If anything, just to look up labs (the results come back around the time of shift change). We pass along a &quot;report sheet&quot; each shift and we review that. It contains the problem, history, code status, allergies, assessment, vitals, lines/tubes/drains, how a patient voids/ambulates, important labs, the plan for today, the plan for discharge, procedures and notable tests this admit, and how crazy family is.</p>
<p>Most of what we are required to chart in the computer is never reviewed by a person again and it takes about an hour a patient (considering it's easy to lose your thought being <em>constantly</em> interrupted).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Around here, pretty much everyone uses either Epic or Allscripts.</p>
<p>One plus to consolidation into just a few EMR providers is the transportability between offices.  When my I can go to a Urologist and he can already see past test results and medication lists from my PCP, ENT and Pulmonologist, it makes errors much less likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on who you were working for. The trend right now in US healthcare is consolidation of healthcare companies into much larger companies. The large companies leverage economies of scale on EMR systems that are in no way cheap or shitty. </p>
<p>It’s also a trend for these larger healthcare companies to offer their EMR as a SAAS to other smaller companies.  This benefits the larger company by being able to create new revenue streams and the smaller company doesn’t have to host and maintain their old shitty software.  </p>
<p>I expect within the next decade the EMR companies are going to offer their products as a SAAS and this will all be cloud based. If it’s cost effective for the large healthcare groups to do so it will be cost effective for the EMR companies to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More happen if a nurse works with a patient they have no idea how to treat. Example: resident just gets a new order of Idunno nectar thickened liquids. They were on thin in the morning. If that order isn’t put in the computer it’s up to the leaving nurse to tell the nurse coming on. Along with every other change with that patient AND the other 10-20 patients who might be on that floor under their care. If you are totally new to the unit you might have to sit down and read up on every patient and what time they get what med, if they are diabetic, if they have a shunt, etc. that can lead to people getting medications or insulin late and so on. </p>
<p>It’s much easier to have the same nurse work multiple shifts and potentially give them the day off tomorrow. Or just drink a Red Bull.</p>

The briefing between two nurses at the changing of shift was damn thorough, had a lot of respect for those two after seeing it. Nurses deserve a lot more props than society tends to want to give them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12 hour shifts in a job like nursing where the pace is pretty fast, while exhausting goes by pretty quickly. You adapt to the length and it isn't necessarily more tiring than an 8 hour shift.  In either case you're basically a zombie after work so that day is pretty well wasted anyway. </p>

<p>Like many people here are saying, the perk of having a shorter week is a benefit. </p>

<p>Is this common in most hospitals? Or are you expected to do more shifts as overtime?</p>
<p>Also how often do back to back shifts happen?</p></div>		</li>
