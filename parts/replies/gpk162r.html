<p>1.35 million Americans per year have some kind of Salmonella infection. </p>
<p>A little more than 400 deaths per year from Salmonella infection every year. </p>
<p>Those deaths =  about 0.000122% of the country's population.</p>

<p>If there's 1.35 million cases in America, that's 0.3% of the population.</p>

<p>An estimated 70% of chickens raised in the UK are in &quot;intensive US-style factory farms&quot;. The number of factory farms in the UK has grown 7% in the past year. </p>
<p>The UK is just not there <em>yet</em>, but it will get there eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you're comparing apples to oranges there.<br />
My understanding is that the 10,000 cases per year is the number of times that a lab was able to confirm the presence of Salmonella in the UK. On the other hand the 1.35 million is a CDC estimate of the number of people who have any kind of salmonella infection (even if it was so mild that they never looked for treatment).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't give vaccines just to prevent death, but also to prevent illness. Chickenpox caused fewer deaths than that, but we vaccinate kids against it to prevent an unpleasant illness and shingles later in life.</p>
<p>But is there a Salmonella vaccine that's approved for humans?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria â‰  virus. You can vaccinate against varicella with two doses. If we had a human salmonella vaccine (we don't, not worth it), you'd likely need to get it every 6 or 12 months. And you might need <em>several</em>, as bacterial vaccines typically have much higher specificity (making broad spectrum vaccinations for poultry is an active area of investment).</p>
<p>That's fine for chickens (they only lay eggs for a couple of years) but humans are way better served by elimination of the vectors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can. Adding u/kyeosh to this post so they can see it, too.</p>
<p>The vaccine would be best given orally to induce IgA, a GI/Mucus membrane specific immunoglobulin.</p>
<p>There are oral Salmonella vaccines for human strains, eg <em>S. typhi</em>, so targeting chicken strains like <em>S. typhimurium</em> or <em>enteritidis</em> isn't too difficult a proposition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, just to flesh out this idea, how are the immune cells able to actually regulate the presence of the bacteria in the gut?  Aren't the t-cells and macrophages carried around by blood? Do they cross the lining of the intestines, or it some completely different type of response?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are more than 2000 types of salmonella and protection against one doesn't mean protection against another type. Bacterial vaccines work similarly to viral vaccines in that the body mounts a response against a foreign thing (whatever that thing happens to be) and if the thing is a close enough match to a bug, then the bug gets attacked when the body sees it. Usually bacterial vaccines are just the dead bodies of killed bacteria - they can't grow since they're dead, but the body might not react to them strongly either (because they aren't highly stimulating like modified viruses). That's where adjuvants come in... Which is a whole nother thing</p></div>		</li>
