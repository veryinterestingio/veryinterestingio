			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's physically how the processor is built. It's called architecture because it's like a house, like a building architect. The plans are laid out and to change them you'd have to physically change the internals of the processor (which for all intents and purposes is impossible for this discussion)</p>
<p>You need a new processor built by a different architect (built with a different architecture).</p>
<p>A 64bit processor is always 64bit. An Arm processor is always Arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not code, it's the way the internal parts of the processor is organized, machine code is binary code (that is, 0s and 1s), a different architecture will read those 0s and 1s differently than other architectures, and that is determined  by how the internal parts of the processor is organized</p></div>		</li>
