			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about psychoanalysis what you want but it talks about this ambivalence a lot. People are both interested in libidinal and aggressive gratifications and these gratifications are connected.</p>
<p>In other terms, there’s something strangely sexual in hating things. And such subs are literal circle jerks. They are jerking each other off with their hatred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been seeing these ads for a couple years now for games I had played very very briefly in the past (briefly because they sucked) so I knew for certain the ads were not representative of actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Earlier TODAY, for the first time in all these years, I saw one of these ads and it was for a game called &quot;Pull Him Out&quot;. </p>
<p>What are the odds I would learn about the real game TWICE on the same day after years of thinking it was just a stupid made-up thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is those games were only created ages after the fake ads came out. The problem was the ads were almost too effective and people actually wanted that game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon is the phenomenon where something you recently learned suddenly appears 'everywhere'. Also called Frequency Bias (or Illusion), the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon is the seeming appearance of a newly-learned (or paid attention to) concept in unexpected places.&quot;</p>
<p>Its basically just frequency bias, but I can assume that now that I've told you about this, you're gunna hear about it again soon :')</p></div>		</li>
