			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, a +10dB gain is perceived 2x as loud to the observer.</p>
<p>A gain of +3dB is 2x the power emanated from the source. </p>
<p>Since sound is non linear, it takes more than 2x the power to sound 2x as loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually wasn't fully bio degradable. That suggests you can put it in your yard and it'll disappear. It was made from PLA, which is made from corn and can be composted in industrial settings (low oxygen and high heat). The marketing used behind the packaging is used as a classical example of green washing. </p>
<p>The reason they got away from it was most due to cost however they blamed the noise (which was substantial) as a convenient scape goat. </p>
<p>PLA has made a lot of progress in reducing the noise because of the Sun Chips incident and all of the hype around the noise.</p>
