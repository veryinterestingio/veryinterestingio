<p>You could argue about the &quot;level&quot; of thought and get into a discussion about brain lobes and all of that...but, their brains are basically working in similar ways to ours. </p>
<p>Interesting part of this conversation here is for things like hibernating bears. Their core temp drops and in response their synapses actually start to degenerate and the brain temporarily ceases to work like normal. But, that's definitely an outlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've thought that animals thoughts are probably just as intense and complex to them as ours are to us. A dog might not go through an existential crisis but they seem to have a crisis every time their owner leaves the house. Playing fetch or ripping up a toy might be all a dog needs to keep their minds occupied but they seem just as, if not more invested in those things than most people are about their hobbies.</p></div>		</li>
