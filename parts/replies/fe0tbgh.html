			<div class="markdown"><p>They will absolutely do the same thing.  Lily's bars contain erythritol, a different sugar alcohol.  Erythritol is a little less sweet than sugar, so small amounts of stevia are used to bring it back up to an equivalent sweetness.</p>
<p>You can't make a candy bar with <em>just</em> stevia, because stevia is about 200x sweeter than sugar, and it would offer none of the feel of sugar if you could use it in the same quantities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Erythritol is a lot better than other sugar alcohols though. I've never had stomach pains and diarrhea from erythritol and stevia sweetened products like maltitol will cause. Some people might be more sensitive to it though.</p></div>		</li>
