In those cases mothers raise the chicks independently or with the help of cousins, previous chicks, siblings etc. as you mentioned. Researchers also reckon the helping behaviour by grandchildren (grandchicks?) might just be a way of not getting kicked out of group.
Interestingly, magpies that grow up in larger and more cooperative social groups are much faster at figuring out puzzles and react to novel objects and situations much better than birds raised individually or in a small group. Have more friends, get more smarter ?</p></div>		</li>
