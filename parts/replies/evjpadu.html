			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain doc here. Wanted to chime in that this is the best answer I have read so far. Also wanted to add that “high” and “low” pain tolerance is kind of a misnomer and not how pain perception actually works in real life. Honestly, people who tell me they have a “high pain tolerance” appear to have worse ability to tolerate small procedures than people who don’t make this claim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a Doctor too! Thanks, glad it got the tick of approval. I was going to go further into a lot of it but I thought it might get too detailed and lose the point in amongst the physiology. Just wanted to note that I agree - talking about your high pain tolerance is basically a guarantee you don’t have one in my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tell my doctors about my &quot;high&quot; pain tolerance because I don't always know when I am hurt- I walked on a broken leg until it mechanically failed. I also tend to be harder to numb, which may be related. I usually just deal with it, but it may make me flinch when MD is sure I can't feel it.  How can I communicate this better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there pain doc. I have a question: I am 59 years old. I have been suffering from debilitating pain for the last 10 years due to cysts growing on my spine. My neurosurgeon, Dr. Maxwell at RGH in Rochester NY said there is nothing he can do for me surgically. Not yet anyway. I have been to two other Drs. and surgeons. They all say the same thing. But for god's sake, I cannot get one of them to offer me pain meds. I am pissed off that I cannot, along with my Dr., make the choice to take opioids to help manage the pain. Not everyone is subject to addiction. And even if they are, at the age of 59, shouldn't I, along with my Dr., be allowed to make that decision? I am in agony every day and some days I cannot even leave my home. I do not want to live the rest of my life in agonizing pain. What are my options? Please don't tell me pain clinics. I can't afford them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, remember that it's contextual. They could lose a limb and not notice, whereas because a small procedure is outside their normal experiences the brain doesn't have coping strategies for it.</p>

<p>Like I have high pain tolerance... for some things. For others... I'm more sensitive. I reckon we're all like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the other way around. Burns hurt so bad I can't talk and it takes my breath away. Cuts, meh. It just stings. Even if I get salt or lemon juice on it. Probably because I do nail art as a hobby so I'm always using acetone on my nails, and finding every little tiny nick or cut. I'm used to that stinging sensation. But burns? I have no tolerance at all. One small scald burn on my thumb that blistered, and I couldn't speak a single word if I didn't have it wrapped in a cool compress. </p>
<p>Speaks anecdotally but persuasively to the OP's statement that pain is highly subjective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I'll remember to have someone speak for my pain tolerance for me.<br />
Edit* I'm serious, the police/paramedics didn't really seem to believe me when I was saying I was in pain but not really acting like it. Though I don't remember it that well due to the concussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my dentist hates me for high pain tolerance. have had teeth bad off enough that it would have had him doubled over in pain, my only indicator anything was up was the odd taste. </p>
<p>i have fractures in my left foot that i only know about because i had a super bad episode of gout that started with an Xray. </p>
<p>demolished the small metacarpal in my right hand via boxer break, felt nothing when it happened or in the weeks after, the swelling was evident though. </p>
<p>i'm afraid one day i will damage something VERY badly and it wont register and i'll have long term damage for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emotional state, prior experience, concentration and even language itself all have an impact on pain perception. It’s why an athlete might break their ankle but finish a race, while a person with a bad back experiences more pain when he’s having a bad day, or why injuries always seem worse at night when you have nothing else to focus on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad you brought up the fact that pain is all about the <strong>framing.</strong></p>
<p>If you're running on a treadmill and you are experiencing heavy breathing, heavy sweating, tendons aching and muscles burning, it's possible to feel ecstatic (runner's high). But if you wake up feeling those exact same symptoms in the middle of the night in your bed, you'd probably call 911. Physiologically, nervousness and excitement are the same raw sensation (an adrenaline rush or overwhelming arousal) but context can make them feel like polar opposites. Therefore, pain tolerance is highly mental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing explanation! The fact that your brain uses context for this reminds me of this Canadian psychologist/researcher who studies children’s pain. She started a campaign called <a href="https://itdoesnthavetohurt.ca" target="_blank">It doesn’t have to hurt</a> to raise awareness of this among parents and healthcare workers.</p></div>		</li>
