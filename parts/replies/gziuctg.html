			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as we can tell, space is expanding everywhere and uniformly. That includes inside you, but (1) the effect is so small that it's only noticeable on galactic timescales, (2) the effect scales with distance, so the effect is very small inside small objects like yourself, and (3) other forces like electromagnetism and gravity can locally counteract that expansion by holding things together.</p>
<p>For example the <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210308165239.htm" target="_blank">following article</a> gives the rate of expansion as:</p>
<p><em>This means that for every megaparsec -- 3.3 million light years, or 3 billion trillion kilometers -- from Earth, the universe is expanding an extra 73.3 ±2.5 kilometers per second.</em></p>
<p>So the dimensionless ratio of expansion is 73.3km / 3.3 million light years per second, or 2.34787321 × 10^(-18) expansion per second.</p>
<p>If you are six feet tall, then after a year the vertical space you occupy would have expanded 0.000000005 inches. That's about the size of a single carbon atom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this is just semantics, but is the expansion actually counteracted? I'm thinking that the expansion of space still occurs, but the object doesn't expand with the space because it's held together. Hm, I supposed the expansion of the <em>object</em> is counteracted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, the expansion of space is occurring, but the forces keeping us glued together are much stronger. </p>
<p>To use the much abused rubber sheet analogy, suppose you have two magnetic balls sitting on a rubber sheet. You stretch the sheet, which might cause the magnetic balls to separate, but the force of magnetism would rapidly bring them back together.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the approximation we use to make the mathematics (significantly) easier, and for the universe at large it works very well. But on scales of anything smaller than galaxy-sized, it breaks down.</p>
<p>There is a threshold density above which the expansion of space is halted and in fact reverses, with contraction happening instead. That's how collapsed structures like galaxies formed in the first place: they detached from the global expansion and collapsed instead.</p>
<p>This critical density is equivalent to about 10 hydrogen atoms per cubic metre, so anything on human scales is far denser than this. It's in fact this contraction that is counteracted by chemical bonds - without this, dense objects would collapse all the way into singularities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not inside you because you're held together by chemical bonds, or indeed even inside our galaxy because it's held together by gravity.  We only see expansion on larger scales between objects not bound to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the answer is yes, spacetime is expanding inside of you but it's not &quot;dragging along&quot; the material of your body due to local forces that vastly overpower it and hold you together (nuclear forces, electromagnetism, gravity)</p></div>		</li>
