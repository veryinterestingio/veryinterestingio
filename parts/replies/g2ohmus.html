			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the power you feed it, of course. More power, more thrust, more brightness.</p>
<p>And it also depends on the luminous efficacy of the light. Since the purpose is thrust there's no reason to optimise for brightness. You could make an infrared or even radio wave thruster that's invisible to the naked eye. That said a shorter wavelength means a tighter beam can be produced for a given thruster size.</p>
<p>If we assume a typical flashlight bulb, it's 15 lumens per Watt. So 1 Newton would mean 4.5 billion lumens. That's about 300 times the brightness of the world's brightest light beam (on the top of the Luxor in Las Vegas).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, running out of fuel.</p>
<p>In more detail. Reaction drives require both a reaction mass, except the photon rocket doesn't need reaction mass, and fuel to provide energy. If the fuel is carried on board then adding more fuel makes the ship more massive so it accelerates more slowly and you get diminishing returns.</p>
<p>That means that for a given power source, for example a fusion reactor, and some assumptions about the ship's mass ratio - the amount of consumable fuel and propellant compared to the mass of structure, engines, payload, and so on - there's a limit to the delta-V (change in velocity) that can be achieved even with the most ideal engines.</p>
<p>This limit can be circumvented by the use of an external power source. If instead of putting the flashlight on the spacecraft, we keep the flashlight on Earth and put a <em>mirror</em> on the spacecraft, it can keep accelerating as long as we keep shining the light, and theoretically approach lightspeed. (But how is it going to stop?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can the sun's light be bounced around and magnified a certain way to be focused into a method of propulsion? Sort of like using a magnifying glass to burn an ant, using a bigger one to push a spaceship.</p>
<p>idk, I am just thinking weirdly now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's possible, sure. Though whether it's <em>practical</em> is another matter.</p>
<p>Unconcentrated sunlight will of course push a solar sail.</p></div>		</li>
