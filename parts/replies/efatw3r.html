<p>So even when placing boxes randomly (ie throwing them) you favour 2d over 3d</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that is because of gravity and a flat floor.  Throw boxes into a bowl like at a skate park and they won’t favor 2d</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. In reality it is more energetically favorable for water to bond to the edge instead of to the top. </p>
<p>This gets outside ELI5 pretty quickly but you can kind of imagine it as if each box was a prism with a tallside and a small base. Also the boxes are coated in velcro. The boxes could maximize their surface area in contact with the other boxes by going in a level surface (so the long sides are in contact with each other). If you put a box on top of the others, it would have less velcro to attach to (because the base has a smaller area than the sides) and is more likely to tip over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should delete, or at least edit, your original answer then, because the implication that gravity rather than the  intrinsic properties of the “boxes” (ice molecules) is the explanation is rather misleading.</p></div>		</li>
