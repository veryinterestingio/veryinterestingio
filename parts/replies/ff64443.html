			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun slightly related fact: Our reactions to danger are actually more than just fight or flight. There are actually five standard responses: friend, fight, flight, freeze, flop.</p>
<p>Friend: Calling on allies or caregivers for aid</p>
<p>Fight: Attacking the source of the danger</p>
<p>Flight: Fleeing from the source of the danger</p>
<p>Freeze: Remaining immobile to potentially remain unseen and also to possibly prevent further injury</p>
<p>Flop: Submission and essentially shutting off higher brain functions. Complete surrender.</p>
<p>Edit: At the request from several people, here are links to articles discussing it:</p>

<p>Keep in mind, I can not speak to the science of this. For all I know, it could just be one of those fake facts that gets around.  So, grain of salt and all that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it varies, but as I understand it, it's your entire body going limp. Like when you read about 'their legs turning to jelly' or something like that. Your body believes there is nothing it can do so it tries to minimize the amount of damage by being completely loose, both physically and mentally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Begging for mercy is usually included under &quot;friend&quot;, you try to get anyone to help you, which can mean the person doing whatever you are currently afraid of. Flop is also sometimes just called faint, with flopping being a less extreme version of fainting.</p>
<p>Freeze is sometimes split into two forms too, the first response where you freeze in alertness, trying to orient yourself, (sometimes with time slowing down) and the most extreme freeze where the same alertness processes overwhelm your capacity to process the information.</p>
<p>The most important thing of course, is that they should all begin with F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would consider that something else.</p>
<p>Flop would be like a rape victim shutting off their brain and zoning the act out as much as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish this were more widely known, especially the freeze/flop reaction. A lot of people experience significant mental trauma after a stressful event because they think freezing up and disassociating is some sort of personal failure instead of a very deeply wired instinctive reaction to keep you from getting yourself killed in a futile fight or chased down and eaten by running. </p>
<p>It is also good to be able to spot it in others. Someone going from visibly stressed out and panicking to suddenly being serene isn't good, it is actually a sign that they've gotten worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a few years back around Halloween, my friends and I decided to do one of those Zombie Trails, where you walk through some woods and people dressed like zombies try to scare you.</p>
<p>So there we are, we've gone through probably 90% of this thing, and I've jumped at damn near every &quot;boo&quot; that was even whispered my way. Thoroughly spooked.</p>
<p>We've made it out if the woods and come into a little field with hanging laundry. Only, it's not laundry, it's those plastic sheets like in Dexter, and they're splattered with blood. Then, out of nowhere, this big guy comes out of the woods with a chainsaw.</p>
<p>Everybody takes off. My girlfriend, my roommate, my girlfriend's friend, everybody. Except me. I can't move. I'm frozen in place, staring this deranged chainsaw man in the face. What's worse is that I've got hold of a guy I had just met, my girlfriend's friend's boyfriend. Just holding him in front of me like a human shield.</p>
<p>So I'd like to add an addendum to the list. There's: Friend, Fight, Flight, Freeze, Flop, and Fuck You.</p>
<p>I thought I was Freeze, but turns out my response is much more malicious than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trying to put something between you and the cause of your alarm makes sense as a reaction, but I doubt it mattered that it was a person or living being. You probably would have grabbed anything. </p>
<p>So can anyone think of a word that means &quot;shield&quot; or similar but starts with F?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this during an adrenaline rush your body is operating at a higher metabolic rate than normal and burns through the glucose in your bloodstream faster than normal, and has hormones that slow digestion so as to divert blood from your stomach and intestines to your limbs for better use in survival. So you have a sugar crash afterwards as well.</p></div>		</li>
