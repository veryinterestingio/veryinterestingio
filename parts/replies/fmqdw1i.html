			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. Licking the point also works. Also, if you are heating the ball, as would be the case from scribbling, the ball would expand from the heat making it worse. You would have to heat the tip except the ball. Seems to me that it's more a function of the friction itself and not the heat generated by it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I google image searched ballpoint pens magnified and I found none of the balls to have a rough surface? In fact, they appear smoother than what I initially imagined them to be. What am I doing wrong and how do I fix that?</p></div>		</li>
