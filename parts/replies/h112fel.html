			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, that part is simple. Basically, there’s a limit to the speed things can occur within the universe. Light is just the most noticeable thing that actually does occur at that speed, and we named the speed after light, not after the actual limit that causes light to move at the speed it does</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I've wondered about for a long time but not had the words to ask. If the speed of causality gradually increased using space magic, would the speed of light consistently increase, or would light eventually stop getting faster because it has a limit that it just can't get to because of the speed of causality slowing it down?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This screams simulation to me. Are we just a universe created by some other-dimensional beings whose computers can only render our universe at the speed of causality?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic idea is there is a maximum speed at which information can travel through the universe. If I am standing at one spot and you are standing 1 light-year away from me, no matter what you do or what extraordinary future tech you have, and no matter how incredibly accurate the sensors I have to pick it up with are, you will not be able to send a message to me any faster than one year.</p>
<p>It takes some pretty wacky predictions to make this true, such as the idea that gravity itself takes time to update to its moving surroundings, but a lot of those have actually turned out to be true, for example we’ve actually measured gravitational waves now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, you move through time and space at the speed of light. Or the speed of causality, as you put it.</p>
<p>You can think of time like North, and Space like East. You can drive North at 100mph, which is kind of how we are moving through time. But as you start turning east, or increasing in speed, you are no longer moving North at 100mph. You start slowing down in the North direction as you speed up in the Eastern direction.</p>
<p>Hence, as you go faster through space, you go slower through time, and vice versa. At the speed of light, you'd be going directly East, so time would appear to pretty much stand still.</p>
<p>This is why the atomic clocks on the GPS array need to be constantly updated. If they weren't, the position given by the GPS array would drift off by ~4km a day, simply due to how fast they are moving compared to anything on the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, how fast are we moving? Secondly, if we could slow down to not be moving at all, would the universe end in an instant from our perspective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we are orbiting the sun at around 30 miles/second, and are moving through the milky way at about 210 miles/second. Neither of which even come close enough to relativistic speeds to matter.</p>
<p>And no, if you were full stopped, you'd experience time at normal speed, not dissimilar to what you experience now, maybe a fraction of a percent faster.</p>
<p>Its when you start moving close to light speed that things start getting weird.</p></div>		</li>
