			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. </p>
<p>I remember recharging non-rechargeable batteries as a kid ( I didn't know they were not rechargeable) several times and it worked really well until my father said I shouldn't do it because it could explode.</p>
<p>Does the risk of fire increase for each charge on non rechargeable batteries?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the other problems with charging ‘non rechargeable’ batteries is that the materials may not deposit uniformly onto the anode or cathode when charging. So what happens then is you can create a short circuit inside the battery, which if your charger is not intelligent enough to detect, can cause a lot of current to pass through a small bridge of material inside the battery, causing heating and a possible explosion </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, nearly all household battery chargers (those designed for 1.2V-1.5V cells) use a constant-current charging circuit, which means the power will be well-limited if a short forms within the battery.  To the user, all they will notice is that the battery gets warm (to roughly the same degree it does in normal charging) but does not come out of the charger with any useful charge, or loses its charge within a matter of hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alkaline batteries (which are the standard &quot;non rechargeable&quot; battery), when charged using the optimal charging cycle, are something like 75% reverseable.<br />
That is, if you try to recharge one you'll regenerate about 3/4ths of the spent chemistry into a usable form, and destroy or otherwise render useless about 1/4th of it (usually either turned into something you don't want or regenerated in the wrong place). This damage stacks, so if you recharge the battery a few times the capacity goes to down very fast. This can be fine for something like a TV remote where a battery can last years, but gets annoying in high drain applications.<br />
You also run the risk that the charging process or the destroyed/misplaced chemistry causes physical damage to the battery. Given that batteries generally use some unhealthy chemistry, you don't really want to deal with a ruptured battery, or a short, if you don't have to.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Wonder Chargers&quot; were popular &quot;as seen on TV&quot; products that a lot of people owned. </p>
<p>All these devices were good for was demonstrating how badly a normal non-rechargeable battery works after a charge. </p>
<p>You'd get about 60% of the original battery life on a first charge if you were lucky and then about half that each time after. You end up with piles of nearly useless non-rechargeable batteries in a confusing mess.  </p>
<p>I am pretty sure I have an original version Wonder Charger in one of my moving boxes and I should just recycle it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing too is that the reaction must reform physically back to the initial state. An alkaline battery, the positive electrode is just inserted in the paste. When discharging the electrode get eaten and disolved in part in the paste. When you charge it back the electrode get reformed, but in whatever shape it happend to be, depending on how it disolved.</p>
<p>Since there is nothing that control how it reform, it can form whiskers or whatever from the positive electrode to the negative and cause a short, which can be very bad.</p>
<p>A rechargable battery have means to control how it form so it stay where it belong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, part of the reason that some reactions in non-rechargeable batteries are irreversible is because the products of the original oxidation reaction that produces electricity may not stay in the same physical location as the reactants. For example in an alkaline battery, zinc metal is oxidized to form a zinc ion. This zinc ion is not attached to the zinc metal, and will drift into the electrolyte. This makes it very difficult to reverse the reaction, as the zinc ions need to return to the zinc metal. In addition, it means that with each charging/discharging cycle, the zinc metal will become increasingly degraded, until it is no longer structurally sound, and begins to leak. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think this is correct. All batteries have separated oxidation and reduction reactions. The fact that a reductant is in ionic form doesn’t imply that it’s irreversible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct.  All batteries have ionic atoms or molecules that leave the anode during discharge and then enter the electrolyte. This is important for the longevity of the battery, so that underlying material can be exposed and therefore undergo chemical reactions as well. </p>
<p>The issue is that when a battery (like a AA) uses the outside case as the anode, when recharged the zinc (or whatever the anode material is)  doesn't necessarily return to the same physical location on the anode. This can result in weak spots that will eventually leak. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is literally how electrolysis works, the potential difference moves the ions to the electrode (and the current gets them reduced there). </p>
<p>There's other issues like making hydrogen instead of zinc and releasing oxygen gas instead of oxidizing the manganese hydroxide. Then there's electrode shape distortion, most extremely you may not even have the electrode left (e.g. in a modern alkaline battery the zinc is usually a rod in the middle; in an old &quot;heavy duty&quot; battery it's foil on the outside; either way after a few cycles you can end up with pieces of the rod getting disconnected during discharge as the thinnest bridges get dissolved or holes forming in the wall, if dendrite growth doesn't short circuit you first)</p></div>		</li>
