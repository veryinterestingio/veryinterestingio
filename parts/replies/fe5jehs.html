<p>Actually, you are just supposed to <em>reduce</em> civilian casualties. Collateral damage is inevitable and war itself is a crime.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So yes thanks for expanding on my answer there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You said &quot;in general&quot; which was true, but maybe &quot;in specific&quot; is better. You can't specifically target civilians, but you can take operations knowing civilians are at risk.</p>
<p>You just have to <em>reduce</em> the risk which is vague and countries regularly drive trucks through it. Risk to civilians is balanced with military gain. If five generals are driving in a car with a civilian driver, the military gain vs civilian loss is too great not to take.</p>
<p>I mean, if the war is justified. And I'm not gonna push the button for you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ex: The Chinese were probably pretty happy the U.S. went to war with Japan and I would hardly call it a crime.</p></div>		</li>

Usually they respond but their prosecution may be weakened depending on which nation actually want to involve themselves. There are lot of reasons to not get involved like trade and alliances that prevent the formulation of any punishment</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of these are 'enforced' by reciprocity -- one side doesn't want their own captured soldiers tortured, so they agree not to torture others in return. The enforcement so to speak is that the other side will do the same to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give you a precise answer the law that applies to the responsibility of States for war crimes is called humanitarian law, because it originated with 4 conventions impulsed by the red cross. </p>
<p>the International Court of Justice judges crimes that involve the responsibility of the State. It includes direct orders, active support to the ones who committed the crimes,  even if those don't come from said State (like when the US supported the contras who overthrew the democratic gvt through the CIA), indirect support etc. </p>
<p>The law that applies to the the responsibility of individuals during war crimes (and other situations) is called international criminal law.
The International Criminal Court judges the individuals who committed war crimes (even in the cases stated above).
War crimes also include the use of rape as a war tool, torture, crimes against humanity (genocide, ethnic cleansing), etc.
The ICC can also oversee the crimes that were committed in another country by individuals, including former officials, even outside of war times (former officials cause officials like ministers or diplomats benefit from immunity during their mandate). For example it's the couet competent to decide whether a country must extradite  an individual.</p>
<p>The competency of those courts is submitted to the signature and ratification of their Statute convention, and the conventions they oversee. If the State didn't ratificate the ICC and/or ICJ statue, then it is not competent to oversee those crimes.
And to be completely precise, states can ratificate the statute convention of the courts with reserves which means that the convention won't apply to some situations. Ex: the US made a reservation on the use of torture in the war against terrorism.</p>
<p>But yeah, ultimately international law doesn't apply to all countries equally because most countries want to keep good business and diplomatic relations with bigger countries, especially when their sovereignty isn't directly at risk. International Criminal law is more applied and respected than international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>TL; DR : the International Court of Justice is competent to judge states who ordered/supported war crimes. The International Criminal Court is competent to judge individuals who committed crimes (war crimes and other crimes committed in another country). Ultimately it often depends on the power of country responsible for the crimes. Studying public international law for 4 years was quite depressing when comparing the law with the reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanna add: some crimes are considered so serious as impossible to make reservations. Committing said crimes makes the ICC and ICJ directly competent - as well as other countries' courts - even if the State didn't ratificate the treaties giving them competence and even if the State didn't recognize the competency of the courts. Those crimes are the crimes against humanity. If you want to know more about this you can look up jus cogens law</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would war be illegal?</p>
<p>There technically is anything as international law, because there is no single body that can enforce it. If effectly a multilateral agreement between government who can agree to abide by certain rules but its very difficult to enforce hence where sanctions come in.</p>
<p>Its effectively an international law that diplomats havebimmu ity, yet Iran detained one a few days ago. Nobody can charge Iran with anything there.</p></div>		</li>
