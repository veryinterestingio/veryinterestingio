			<div class="markdown"><p>I think so, but I don't think it'd be significantly thinner closer to the cuticle. The nail leaving the nail fold still needs to be quite strong in order to protect that area under the nail fold. Then again, toe nails tend to be quite thick at their ends. This likely represents the difference in how our fingers and toes experience abrasion (toes experiencing more abrasion than our fingers), which causes our toe nails to be significantly thicker than our finger nails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> the cells of the nail bed move along with the nail.<br />
&quot;The nail bed is the skin beneath the nail plate.[9][unreliable source?] Like all skin, it is made of two types of tissues: the deeper dermis, the living tissue which includes capillaries and glands,[10][unreliable source?] and the epidermis, the layer just beneath the nail plate, which moves toward the finger tip with the plate. &quot;</p></div>		</li>
