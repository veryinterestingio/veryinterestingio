			<div class="markdown"><p>Excessive cocaine use can cause coronary artery spasms which can restrict oxygenated blood flow to the heart muscle itself,  thus resulting in a heart attack. Classic heart attacks are when coronary arteries get clogged with plaque and restrict oxygenated flow. Cocaine can be cool and fun. Too much cocaine, or cocaine too often, can be deadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not even.  Many &quot;uppers&quot; like cocaine and meth have a small chance of triggering an arrhythmia any time you do them, which can cause sudden death.  You don't have to have &quot;ODed&quot; on it or even have been a regular user, just unlucky.</p>
<p>Medical examiners will report meth or cocaine use as a cause of death if there are no abnormalities noted at autopsy, but meth or cocaine is present in the system, even only a small amount.</p>
<p>Edit: Er, sorry I didn't mean to assert that the above user is wrong, just that there are much more dramatic effects that many people don't know about!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That just made me realize how amazingly reliable the <em>controls</em> must be to keep 4 separate groups of muscles working together, but also that they get more rest than we'd typically assume, since the workload is divided by 4. Fascinating stuff though, but it's simply gotta be that good to keep an organism alive for potentially decades..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s all automatic, too. The SAN and AVN ‘control’ the heartbeat and are not connected to the brain. That’s why you can be brain dead but not dead-dead</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more amazing. So for a computer analogy, instead of being on the hard-drive which is potentially vulnerable to errors or crashing, it's located on a virtually indestructible bios chip of sorts, that should theoretically outlast any other component of the computer – does that fly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only do the muscles take turns contracting, they take turns in a VERY specific order.  The short version is there’s a tiny spot on the top of the heart called the SA node.  Think of it as the spark plug of the heart.  It kicks off the electrical cascade to start the process.  This causes the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) to contract and pump the blood into the ventricles.  Then another electrical impulse from the AV node fires, and the ventricles contract from the bottom up, sending blood either to the lungs (from the right side of the heart) or out to the rest of the body (from the left side).  If any single bit of that system fires wrong, you get a heart attack or similar.  The medical condition “atrial fibrillation” is when the atria twitch when they shouldn’t, and when you hear on tv dramas “he’s going into v-tac” it means the ventricles are trying to beat too fast, and “v-fib” is the life threatening condition where ventricles beat totally out of control and out of rhythm and that condition requires a defibrillator to correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't do that to &quot;rest.&quot; It does it to more effectively pump blood throughout the body.  If the heart was constantly in a contracted state, blood wouldn't move anywhere.</p></div>		</li>
