<p>Well, where <em>one</em> of them was dropped actually. The Nagasaki bomb missed the aim point by almost two miles, almost halving the death count.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, however tests weren’t that far from Vegas. The tests were actually used as a pull for tourism, and people could see the mushroom clouds from their homes and hotel roofs. The atomic testing museum in Vegas is super cool and talks a bit about it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most, but not all. I'm born and raised Nevada, and so is most my family. My wife is from a small town about 100 miles NE of las Vegas. Almost all women in that town have thyroid problems, which us common to radiation issues. A bunch of the older people in the town get checks for the government due to health issues sustained from the tests years ago.</p>
<p>Both my grandparents would take a bus to and from Reno and Vegas, during the testing the bus would pull over and watch the mushroom clouds. Both of them ended up dying of cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Near Vegas at least, there's a prevailing theory that some of the very common thyroid issues also come from the water at Lake Mead. There's a level in the lake polluted with discarded jet fuel that gets into the local water supply. </p>
<p>My grandpa had thyroid cancer and his doctor recommended he only drink bottled water bottled in LA or elsewhere. Fun fact: &quot;Colorado Spring Water&quot; can also be contaminated Lake Mead water because technically the lake is fed by the Colorado River's Springs so <em>technically</em> it's Colorado Spring Water. Now I always check water bottle labels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What town? Because you know what else it cause radiation problems? Coal fired power houses. Like Reid Gardner in Moapa. Thankfully they've shut that down. There's more people who've died from the radiation from coal than has died from all the nuke activity; bombings, nuclear reactor accidents, etc. Coal sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I live near Nevada, not in it, but I’ve driven through a lot of it a bunch of times. Outside of Vegas and Reno there’s hardly anybody in Nevada and they’re spread out over a huge area.</p></div>		</li>
