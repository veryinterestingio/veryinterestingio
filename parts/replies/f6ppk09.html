			<div class="markdown"><p>That is fascinating indeed! As a kid I remember stepping outside at night during the wintertime; I'd flip on the incandescent floodlight on the deck and immediately touch the cold lightbulb while simultaneously feeling its warmth. That's an odd sensation for sure!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once became hypothermic and the strangest thing about it all was the point when things around me - steel railings for example - became warm to the touch even though it was around 5Â°C outside. </p>
<p>Other strange things included no longer shivering and no longer feeling cold. </p>
<p>When I was warming up again things once again became cold to the touch.</p>
<p>This confirmed to me that the feel of temperature is definitely relative. And that you sometimes don't quite know when you become hypothermic and how dangerous it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got that once surfing in Tofino as a young teen with zero wetsuit. I stopped shivering and my thought process was <em>awesome! That shivering was umcomfortable! Now i can surf more!!</em>. I ended up getting freaked out and leaving the water after I noticed large purple patches all over my body. It took many blankets, a snuggle buddy, a large fire, and about 4  hours to warm up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a thing called &quot;paradoxical undressing&quot;. People suffering hypothermia will sometimes strip off their clothes. Mountaineers are sometimes found dead stripped down to their underwear. </p>
<p>In the final stages, the muscles responsible for keeping warm blood in the core (vasoconstriction) give up. This rush of warm blood to the extremities makes the person feel hot. </p>
<p>Next time you have really cold hands, put them in some lukewarm water. It feels super hot. This is what people about to die of cold are feeling <em>inside their skin</em>.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;terminal burrowing&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
