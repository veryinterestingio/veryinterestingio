			<div class="markdown"><p>The first instance of this has been documentally written by Blaise Pascal, in French: <em>Je n’ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n’ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.</em> It could be translated to English as &quot;The reason I made this letter unusually long is that I didn't have time to make it shorter.&quot;</p>
<p>I personally met this sentence for the first time in Brazil, where I grew up, attributed to Machado de Assis, one of the most venerated Brazilian authors. Interestingly enough, Machado de Assis and Samuel Clemens are contemporaneous. (Clemens lived from Nov/30/1835 to Apr/21/1910 and de Assi from Jun/21/1839 to Sep/29/1908).</p>
<p>EDIT: Pascal wrote it in 1657</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked a lot of proposals. Some have had page limits, some haven't. The ones with a tight page limit are some how even longer to write than the ones that don't have a page limit. I would joke that we would spend two weeks riding a 50-page proposal, then two weeks condensing the 50-page proposal down to it a 15-page limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I see the argument, I don’t think it makes sense here because the Oxford comma is primarily about making clear lists rather than subdividing lengthy or ambiguous sentences.  </p>
<p>For example, “He interviewed Nelson Mandela, an 800 year old demigod and a dildo collector” is not a long sentence — and its humorous ambiguity would be far better cured with a simple Oxford comma rather than a tortured rewrite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ambiguity does lessen (but not go away entirely) if you re-ordered that list, though. </p>
<p>&quot;He interviewed a dildo collector, an 800 year old demigod and Nelson Mandela.&quot;</p>
<p>It would be a stretch for any reasonable person to think the latter 2 are descriptors of the former. Point is, I'm still in favor of the Oxford comma, but I can see how there may be restructuring that affects the need for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that example I could see the ordering being important. Like if you need to mention Mandela first for a strong start. I know you're in favor of the comma, just saying that refactoring your commas isnt always going to maintain the same impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way that sentence is structured makes it look like everything after the comma is describing the dildo collector to be &quot;an 800 year old demigod and Nelson Mandela&quot; and sounds both super awkward and ambiguous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Descriptivist grammar doesn't excuse unclear writing though. Even if it's &quot;grammatically correct&quot;, it doesn't mean it's effective or that your reader will easily understand it. Sure, put commas wherever you want them to help break up a sentence, but the fact is that most people have an easier time understanding text if it relies on other clues, especially regarding the oxford comma.</p></div>		</li>
