			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add that if the phone manufacturers changed their charging/discharge levels to have better battery management, the batteries would last a lot longer. See: electric cars.</p>
<p>The problem is that then the &quot;runtime&quot; on the phone would be overall lower, even though the battery would be good for years. And people seem to prefer longer runtime in a lighter/thinner/cheaper phone than a phone with a long service life. That may change as the year-to-year improvements in phones aren't what they used to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly - its a trade off.  Manufacturers make a choice on how to design their products - electric cars care about maximizing battery longevity, phones care about maximizing runtime.  Neither is trying to 'screw' the consumer over - they are just optimizing for different use cases, and is often the case optimizing for one means sacrificing the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. That and the average person uses their car for less than 2 hours per day (most expensive asset one owns that is used the least and has the most depreciation), whereas people use their phones constantly for work, school, friends, family, news, etc. You have to set the discharge rates differently based on use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long the phone runs/operates on a single charge. </p>
<p>If the phone lasted less time each day it might charge to the same level for more months. Since we squeeze everything we can out of the battery each day, the long-term lifespan is shorter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I'm in the minority of consumers that would have preferred a bulky phone that lasted a week. With wireless charging this is becoming less of an issue, much like the case of range anxiety for electric cars. You're not doing long distance driving every day, so you don't typically need more than 20km of range anyway.</p>
<p>A wireless charger on the desk and/or bed-side table where I would usually put the phone down means it has plenty of opportunity to charge. The same applies to my phone during my commute where it'll be on a wireless charging pad in the car or plugged in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many people would buy a bulletproof, long lasting phone when they compared the price tag to even a flagship iPhone?  </p>
<p>Most people don't actually want durable products when given the choice after they see the price tags.  I can spend $30 on a screwdriver, one screwdriver, that will last me a lifetime, or $8 bucks for a set of 7 or 8 that will last a year.  Most people go with the dollar screwdrivers not the lifetime one.  We'll even cry about &quot;cheap Chinese crap&quot; or &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; as soon as you turn the tip into cheddar the 3rd time you use the cheap ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to get both. I've got the expensive, fancy ones for regular use in my daily use toolbag. I've got the cheap ones available in case of apprentice, and also at home, in the vehicle and in a few other places. I can see why a lot of people buy the cheap ones. If I didn't use mine daily I'd rather have a set I don't care about losing or letting get rusty for the few days in a year I'd use it. They likely won't break in the light use environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that the concepts of planned obsolescence pre-date computers by a few decades. It was called 'creative waste' back in the 1930s and was stimulated by a drive to strengthen the economy. There's good evidence of that change in mindset in the movie High and Low from the 1950s. There's a scene early on where the heads of a shoe company debate whether they should continue to make durable shoes or cheap flimsy ones designed to fail. Companies still consider this same model. </p>
<p>I think the example of computers (or gaming devices, whatever) is a complicated one because they do have so many points of failure as has been mentioned. I think, without the concept of &quot;planned obsolescence&quot; they would still be failing just the same. But the concept extends beyond computers and is really a product of growth-driven economics. </p>
<p>If you're looking for an in-depth look at how these concepts came to popularity, this is a good essay:</p>
