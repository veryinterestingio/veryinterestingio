<p>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time" target="_blank">International Atomic Time</a>] TAI is a weighted average of the time kept by over 400 atomic clocks[4] in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.[5] The majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks; ... The clocks are compared using GPS signals and two-way satellite time and frequency transfer.[7] Due to the signal averaging TAI is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two parts to creating a new clock:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure it ticks at the right speed, i.e. one second is really one second</li>
<li>Setting it to the right time, so it shows the same time as all the other clocks</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first part: The length of a second is checked by comparing against a more accurate clock.  That clock was checked against a more accurate clock.  Repeat.Eventually you end up at one of a handful of laboratories around the world, who are able to do the science experiment that is the official definition of a second:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second is &quot;the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom&quot; (at a temperature of 0 K)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't worry too much about the details, but that definition means that scientists can build a big, complicated machine to measure a second precisely, and know that their measurement will match measurements done elsewhere.</p>
<p>For setting a new clock to the right time: There are a lot of really accurate &quot;atomic clocks&quot; at laboratories around the world, which count seconds.  These get averaged to produce a time called TAI, which is the foundation for all modern timekeeping.The GPS satellites have their own atomic clocks, synchronised to TAI, and they broadcast the current time.  So your phone's GPS receiver can get the time, incredibly accurately. Alternatively your mobile phone provider likely has GPS receivers at their cell towers, so they can send the time to your phone over the mobile phone signal.  Your phone likely used the mobile signal as that is likely faster - GPS lock takes a few seconds - and also lower-power as your phone doesn't have to turn its GPS receiver on.</p>
<p>Your phone will regularly update its clock, so it doesn't matter too much if the phone's built-in clock runs at slightly the wrong rate.  Even if it gains or loses several seconds a week, it will be being updated from GPS or from the mobile signal at least once a day, long before the phone's time goes noticeably wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandpa was an engineer for radio equipment in the 60's. He said that the US navy had a super accurate clock that would send out signals on a certain radio frequency, so you could pick up that frequency and use it to keep time on your clocks. I think you still had to get the time from somewhere but you could make sure your clock was ticking at the same rate as the signal.</p>
<p>Thats what they had 60 years ago so these days ita probably something like that but even more advanced</p></div>		</li>

<p>The modern equivalent is GPS, which uses atomic clocks on the satellites, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_server" target="_blank">internet time servers</a>, which get their time from terrestrial atomic clocks.</p></div>		</li>
