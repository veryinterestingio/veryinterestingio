			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe a sonicator doesn't simply shake apart bacteria.</p>
<p>The intense vibrations create airbubbles, which when bursting tear apart the bacterial cells</p>
<p>Source: Just took a biochemistry lab in which we used a sonicator. The instructor was adamant that we learned why we used certain things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anything that gets us collectively further from thinking lysol is instant-magic is a good thing! There are processes involved which take at least a little bit of time lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should clarify. Sonicators in labs like op mentioned do indeed break apart the cell membrane but not for disinfecting. </p>
<p>They are meant to break apart the bacteria so you can retrieve and process the contents inside of it. In our case we wanted proteins that we made using the bacteria and some recombinant DNA. </p>
<p>Not sure if ultrasonic cleaners work in a different way </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Sometimes the cell membranes are weakened with a lysis buffer as well though I've been led to believe that you can lyse most bacterial cell walls with sonication alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, it literally shakes them until they burst. The sonicator create fast bursts of very high and very low pressures that in turn causes shear stress on the bacterial wall. In most scenarios, the last think you want is to create air bubbles in your sample. Source: I'm a biochemist and I have lysed my fair share of e.coli.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Perhaps we used different methods? The method I used in lab used principles described in this paper.</p>
<p>I imagine the air bubbles are bad due to the amount of heat they generate and would denature the proteins if thats what you're trying to get. But we often did it on ice to counteract this</p></div>		</li>

<p>E. coli does start to smell strangely sweet after a few rounds through a French press, though. I’d love to know what that odor is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do really entry level stuff in a microbiology lab.  I can't give you any details on species but I can say that the incubator always smells slightly different with an indescribable fruity theme.  Blackberries sometimes comes to mind, but not everyone agrees.  It's not entirely unpleasant (again, not everyone agrees).  When you combine it with the background smell of many animals' faecal and urine samples the room is quite fragrant.  </p>
<p>One of the scientists was telling me that some of the cultures smell really interesting but that there has been a strict ban on smelling things since someone passed around a culture plate that turned out to be brucella, which is zoonotic and particularly dangerous when it has been cultured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really can’t. It was a mild sweet odor. Probably some particular ester or ketone liberated during lysis. It only started to smell like that when it was fully lysed, indicated by going from a cloudy yellowish suspension to something like watered down milk. </p></div>		</li>
