			<div class="markdown"><p>I do too, in a weird way. It’s vague and to the point, from a certain point of view. </p>
<p>The “mail” is information you want to send or request.  This can be as easy as a google search, or information you retrieve from it. When I say that, I mean a simple inquiry you input as a user, nothing more. And what output you receive from the other end that responds to the message, nothing more. The person “mailing” and the recipient of the “mail.”</p>
<p>The method or “carrier” is how you receive that message and who it goes through, or how many “people” (little black boxes or otherwise) that transcribes it to pass that information on. Or back and forth each way. </p>
<p>Does that help a bit? I may be wrong on a few things.</p>
<p>So we can go into more details if you’d like. I’m just attempting to correlate euphemisms.</p>
<p>Edit2: and also who can have access to that information or data! In certain cases everyone sees it, in others just a few. In other cases just a single “mailer” or recipient, and in other cases someone can’t see it but it goes to you but it goes through them. I think.</p>
<p>Edit3: this does not distinguish the differences between what OP asked, but rather reframe the top response. Clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate this &quot;literal&quot; five year old answers, so here's one that doesn't insult your intelligence.</p>
<p>A typical home network has a modem and a router.</p>
<p>The modem has the job of talking to your ISP. Everything must pass through this modem. The modem is what tells the ISP who you are so that they can authenticate you. The modem is like the bouncer at the bar. You aren't getting in without ID, and everyone gets their ID checked.</p>
<p>Edit: ^ So I’m wrong about the modem btw. What it does is translate messages between you (your network) and the ISP, or something like that.</p>
<p>Connected to your modem is then the router. The router has the job of routing messages (aka data). Say you are on the same WiFi as your mom and grandma, and you visit the hub of porn on your iPhone. Your iPhone will talk to the router which will pass the message to the modem which will go fetch the website. The website then goes back to your modem, to the router, and then the router is what makes sure those videos are sent to your iPhone and not your mother's iPad.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a typical home network. In such a network, the router is actually not just a router, but two devices in one: it's a router and a wireless access point. The router is what routes messages. The access point is the radio and hardware that handles the WiFi. You can have a router without an AP (so without WiFi) and you can have an AP without a router (so you'll have a WiFi to connect to, but it won't have &quot;internet&quot;).</p>
<p>Professional network equipment do not typically combine the router and AP because you typically don't want WiFi in your professional network for a business. And if you did, you want a dedicated AP with better hardware and software than whatever Linksys sells.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now let's address the switch.</p>
<p>I lied when I said a home router is two devices in one: a router and an AP. It's actually three devices: a router, an AP, and a switch.</p>
<p>The &quot;internet&quot; connects to your modem, which connects to your router. The router then connects to a <strong>switch</strong> which is then connected to your AP and PS4 and so on. In this scenario the switch essentially turns 1 port (from the router) into multiple ports: one for the AP, one for the PS4, etc.</p>
<p>So why do we need a switch? Why not put more ports on the router?</p>
<p>Depending on your business, you might need a &quot;router&quot; with 200 ports. Those don't exist. So you buy a good router with a small handful, and you buy a couple of good switches to make one. If your business expands and you need 300 ports? No problem, just buy more switches. Need to downsize? No problem, sell some of your switches. Router broken? No problem, buy a new one and just plug the switches back into it.</p>
<p>A <strong>hub</strong> is similar to a switch, but &quot;dumb.&quot; A hub is like a group chat. You send a message to it and everyone in the group chat receives it. A switch is like a private message. You send a message to it, telling it to send it to Betty, and it gets sent just to Betty.</p>
<p>More about the switch: a switch is also what allows two computers to talk to each other. All the computers connected to the same switch are on the same network. They can talk to each other to do things like stream locally downloaded video without going through the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what a modem does.  It translates between signaling types.  That your ISP happens to add auth is immaterial.  ELI5 is that it's like having your message transcribed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your computer talks to other computers by sending short messages. Everything on the internet is done by computers sending messages to each other. All of the internet infrastructure is in order to get these messages to the right computer.</p>
<p>That's harder than it sounds, because there's a bunch of computers and they're all spread out, and it's non trivial to even track where they are.</p>
<p>Hence the post office analogy. If you have a home network (wifi/wired for your phones/tablets/computers), it's kind of like an office building that gets mail from the post office, then has its own mail system to get the mail to the right person in the office. </p>
<p>Someone might address an envelope to Bob, customer accounts, Acme Corporation, 123 Whatever lane, and give it to the post office. Using whatever system they have set up, the letter will make it to the local post office, who will dump it in Acme Corporation's mail box (modem/router), where someone will carry it to Acme's mail sorting room (could be a switch or router). If the sorting room is a switch, they carry it to the customer accounts office and give it to whoever's there (ish, basically the customer accounts office registered their name with their room number, and the switch trusts that unless it's been told not to), if it's a router they might do something more complicated. </p>
<p>If they hand it to Bob directly, that's the end of the line and we're done. If there's an extra step where they hand it to Fred, who just shouts out the message to the whole customer accounts office, figuring that people who don't care will just ignore it, that's a hub. It's also why you probably don't want a hub if there's going to be a lot of traffic, all that yelling gets annoying.</p>
<p>Other stuff has similar types of functionality, but it's all down to various ways to try to get these messages close to where they're supposed to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about this?</p>
<p>Hub: Bob wants to send a love-letter to Sally.  Jane, Johann, and everyone else on the block gets it, too, because Bob really has no idea where Sally lives so he just gives a copy to every house on the block and hopes she gets it.</p>
<p>Switch: Bob knows the physical location of Sally's house, and it's not too far, so Bob just walks over and gives it to her.</p>
<p>Bridge: Sally lives a neighborhood over from Bob.  Bob walks over the love letter to their mutual friend, Joe, who lives between them - Joe then walks over and gives the letter to Sally.</p>
<p>Router: Sally lives a city away; he gives the love letter to the post office and lets them figure out how to deliver it.  So the post office in Bob's neighborhood sends the letter to the post office in Sally's neighborhood, and then someone from the post office walks it over to her house.</p>
<p>Modem: Bob just calls Sally on the phone and tells her the content of the letter</p></div>		</li>
