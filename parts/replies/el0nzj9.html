<p>2H2 + O2 -&gt; 2H2O</p>

<p>So, if I had 2 H2O molecules, then I remove one. Then I'd have exactly one molecule of H2O. Then let's say I add electricity to split it apart. Those 2 H atoms are going to bond and be a happy H2 molecule and go float away.</p>
<p>But what about that single O atom? It would sure love to find another O atom because it wants to be paired. But probably all those other O atoms nearby are already paired. So what's it do? Is it desperately trying to find something to bond to? What's it doing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so the answer is the reaction won't happen with only one H2O.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the reaction is that on one battery terminal, two water molecules split up to become O2 and 4H+ ions, (which will only exist if there's other water around to stabilise them) and they send electrons through the battery to the other side where those electrons combine with 4H+ ions over on THAT side of the battery to make 2 lots of H2</p></div>		</li>
