			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is worth noting that when you say mosin you are only talking about the most common M91  rifle, many of the other variants are to a much tighter tolerance and are more serviceable than many rifles of that time period. Notably Finnish M28-30 and M31. The Chattelerault (sp?) were alright too. Even for the most common rifle, They would test the most accurate ones, and those would be issued to soldiers of more proficiency in marksmanship, so the data will he skewed. They were generally fitting for their purpose as well: cheap, fast, and reliable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shorter barrels don't necessarily reduce accuracy. This is a myth. As long as we're not talking snub nose revolvers or something, and you have enough barrel length to burn off all the powder. And even then, that's only relevant in the case of wind affecting the shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree, your statement is only partially true. It does affect accuracy if the barrel is short enough to where a significant portion of the forces produced by the expanding gas is wasted due to the length of time it can be applied to the projectile being shortened.   </p>
<p>This obviously depends on the round. If a round only produces a smaller amount of energy, then a longer barrel isn't necessary. A desert eagle is a great example. The barrel is so short that a ton of the energy produced by the round is wasted due to the extremely short duration the projectile is exposed to acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why I said as long as it's long enough to burn all that powder. And regardless, that doesn't directly affect accuracy, only velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shorter barrel can actually be better for accuracy as it will often be stiffer and therefore introduce fewer harmonic variations during the shot. The longer barrels help with increased velocity which at long distance relates to less bullet drop and wind deflection. But very often when going with a longer barrel it is best to go with a heavier one because it's much more rigid. </p></div>		</li>
