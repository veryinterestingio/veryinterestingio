			<div class="markdown"><p>The orbits are just a nice picture to hide the complexity of quantum mechanics complexity. That said electrons in this case can only have quantised energy states. To keep in the orbital model the answer is it depends on how much energy was put into the electrons. They can be in the same orbit but they don't have to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the complex answer is quantum mechanical the high school answer is the electrons orbit slight father out due to inter-repulsion effects between the electrons reducing the attractive effect of the proton as can be seen in the radius of the hydride ion vs hydrogen atoms. </p>

<p>The high school level simplification in full for this situation is the electrons are point charges in the same orbit that moves out slightly compared to normal and these point charges are on opposite side of the atom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But... do hydrides have to have an explanation involving H^- ?</p>
<p>I mean, doesn't H simply take a place in the lattice, just like Li (or Na or K) would, making it a crystalline solid, with bands instead of discrete energy levels etc.?</p></div>		</li>
