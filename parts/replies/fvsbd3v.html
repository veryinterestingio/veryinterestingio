<p>&quot;My bread trees aren't growing, so I decided to try animal husbandry.  That donkey <em>really</em> didn't like it.  Hey, do you know how far apart you're supposed to plant pigs?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well. Transportation was a thing during colonial times. Transportation is basically the same as exile, except the transported doesn't have a choice of where to go.</p>
<p>Exile was also a thing in viking age scandinavia where someone who made too much trouble in the county could be exiled for a number of years (A famous example from Iceland. Eyjiolf the Foul killed a number of Eric the Reds thralls, and in exchange Eric killed Eyjiolf and Holmgang-Hrafn. As a punishment he was exiled from the County for 3 years in order to stop it from developing into a full-blown bloodfeud).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn’t excuse his crimes but fish gotta fly and birds gotta swim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is probably why Eric the Red only got exile. Exile with no bloodmoney paid is a very lenient sentence for murder, so no doubt Eyjiolf and Holmgang-hrafn were viewed as troublemakers (Holmgang refers to a duel, mostly because someones honour had been besmirched, but sometimes to settle judicial disputes by a trial of arms. Death was not uncommon).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transportation was more like forced indentured servitude, or slavery (with obvious parallels to current US penal system).  <em>If</em> you survived you and your children would be free though of course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are basically encouraging them to viking ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their face wouldn’t be as well known to as many people as it is today. They could probably move half way across the country and start a new life under a new name as a cook or something. But they can never become rich and famous enough to meet the king again. Which is a punishment in itself if you were rich and famous before.</p></div>		</li>
