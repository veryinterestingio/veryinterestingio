<p>There have been several to fire from the lower cylinder to greatly reduce the upwards recoil. Chiappa currently makes the Rhino that's built that way. </p>
<p>I've never shot one, so I don't actually know how well it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I shot one in .38 special (don't remember if it was the rhino or another). it was pretty bizarre. Not that it's a particularly punchy round to begin with, but there was no vertical movement at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've fired a rhino.  it doesn't flip as bad, but in some ways that increases the felt recoil.  </p>
<p>I imagine in combat shooting or hunting where you are less apt to notice recoil the follow-up shot advantage is superior to barrel movement eating up recoil impulse, but honestly aesthetics aside I'd rather have a ruger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>having fired a vektor as well, you can still feel it, it's less recoil than, say, a MAC-11 or Uzi but not immensely so.  reducing rate of fire is still the best way to control a SMG's recoil given the same caliber or close to it (not counting tiny bullet PDWs like the 5.7mm FN, or big hunks of lead like the Thompson).  for my money because of lower rate the MP-40 is nearly as controllable as a Kriss.</p>
<p>source: have spent way, way too much money on renting submachine guns because I am a child of the 80s and think they're the epitome of cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make a finger gun.</p>
<p>Now push straight back on your &quot;barrel&quot;. Your hand won't try to rotate. </p>
<p>This is however not where the barrel is on a real gun, it's higher up in relation to your hand.</p>
<p>Now push on your thumb instead. Notice that your hand start to rotate upwards around your wrist.</p></div>		</li>
