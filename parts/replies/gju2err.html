			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I remember that being called ‘kin selection’! Since the hive is all sisters and daughters and nieces and such, they are still ensuring that their genetic material survives to get into the next generation even if they die so long as the hive, and the queen, survives. That’s also why prairie dog females are the only ones to sound an alarm when they spot a hawk- even if the cry attracts the hawk to that particular female, she knows that all of the other females in the area are her kin and will survive. They drive the males away when they become sexually mature, so males are not certain they have any genetic kin (offspring) in their area so they don’t warn other prairie dogs and just hide. That was a really cool class (evolution of behavior)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not being pedantic, this is a genuine question! Is it true to say insects don't have an ego the way mammals do (which can be proven), or is it more a case of there is no evidence to support the idea of insects having an ego?</p></div>		</li>
