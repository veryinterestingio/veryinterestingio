			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 1/2 of 3/5 (or 3/5 of 1/2). Multiply the top two numbers and the bottom two numbers: 1*3 / 2*5, so you get 3/10. That makes perfect sense because 3/5 is equal to 6/10. Half of 6 is 3, so 3/10. Alternatively, 1/2 is equal to 5/10. Three fifths of 5 is, well...3. Again, 3/10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cut a pie into five slices and get rid of two of them (preferably by eating them). You now have three fifths (3/5) of a pie left. Now cut the remainder in half. That gives you 3/5 * 1/2 = 3/10 of the pie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine some crazy bastard cut a pizza into 10 slices (monster). You take 3/5 of the pizza, which is 6 slices. Then your free loading buddy shows up and asks if he can have half of your share. So what is half of 3/5ths of a 10 slice abomination of a pizza? It's 3 slices!</p>
<p>In math terms, you multiply the numerators 3 x 1 = 3 and the denominators 5 x 2 = 10 to get 3 / 10, so that's how you end up sharing 3 slices from your 10 slice pizza. Now I am hungry...</p></div>		</li>
