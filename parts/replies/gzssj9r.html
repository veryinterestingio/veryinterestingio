			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. It’s especially true for more mature manufacturing processes where the yields are good. When a majority of your chips have no defects whatsoever there is no need for binning (haven’t heard the term harvesting yet) and making the chip bigger only to disable (functioning) parts to sell them cheaper makes no sense. Yields are also inherently better for small chips (less area -&gt; less chance for defects in a single chip).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It can still make sense. Due to economies of scale it can be cheaper to manufacture a single more advanced design instead of having 6 different designs with low quantities. Since die production also has a long lead time you can react to market demands quicker.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that's one of the reasons why AMD is doing it this way currently, although they also use multi-die concepts on top of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends a lot on quantities and yield and chip sizes. Of course for a different chip you need a new mask set, new test equipment, new packaging etc., all costing millions to set up. But when you are also selling millions of chips it can make sense.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell AMD, Intel and Nvidia make at least 2 or 3 different chips for each architecture of their CPUs and GPUs. I think it used to be more but mask sets and equipment have gotten more and more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small correction, the process is called binning.</p>
<p>For the specific case of Intel they usually have a chip for each core count so an i3 and i7 are different chips since they have a different number of physical cores (the main difference). This is different for AMD who has a broader binning process and sells chips with disabled cores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You were probably thinking of the phrase &quot;harvesting a die&quot; which is part of the binning process. Specifically it refers to when parts of the die are defective and it's binned as a lower tier part (i.e. an 8-core has 2 defective cores so it's harvested as a 6 core), vs. binning which is a more general term that can include stuff like voltage and frequency binning as well, not just harvesting.</p>
<p>Actually this is exactly what you were talking about, so you weren't wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think amd disables cores anymore. I know a long time ago you could turn a 6 core into an 8 core with programming magic (albeit, usually not stable in the slightest if it would even run at all, I've heard success stories though), but iirc they physically destroy parts of the chip to prevent this from happening anymore, if they still even do it. Iirc this was like a 2000's era thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just meant the cores are physically there, but they're physically disabled as well so there's no way to reenable them. As you say long ago it was possible to reenable them with software and it would work in some lucky cases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>wait, so AMD chips can have cores that are perfectly functional, just disabled?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily &quot;perfectly functional&quot;, the intention of the system is that you can salvage a chip even when something goes wrong with the manufacturing of part of it.</p>
<p>Might not even be that it doesn't work at all, but it could be lower performance than the specification, so it's easiest to just turn it off.</p>
<p>But depending on a bunch of factors, theoretically yes it's possible that a chip might have been viable as a higher spec than it's labelled as.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, if, say, Intel wants to sell a 2 core, a 4 core, and a 6 core chip, they can do either of the following (or any combination of the two). </p>
<p>1) Make one piece of silicon with 6 cores, and disable however many they need to cover the lineup.</p>
<p>2) Make a separate 2 core die, 4 core die, and 6 core die, with each selling fully enabled.</p>
<p>The latter is better with high volumes on a relatively healthy manufacturing process (few defects) because the company doesn't waste money making 6 core chips only to disable 2 or 4 of them. The downside is higher initial development costs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What I can't infer is whether you actually took what he wrote as literally as possible, or if you just have an overwhelming compulsion to be as pedantic as possible.</p>
