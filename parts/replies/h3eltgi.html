			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point on how environmental factors contribute in a way which is incredibly hard to separate. I wouldn't dismiss animal models so quickly though - they are an excellent way to remove such confounding factors and gain insight into the biology.</p>
<p>I would also go as far as to say depression definitively <em>isn't</em> an imbalance in serotonin. It's been shown that depletion of serotonin does not induce depressive symptoms in healthy subjects. Serotonin dysfunction is likely involved in many depressions, but it's almost certainly not the main pathophysiology. Dysfunction across diffuse networks in the brain has to be considered to explain the various aspects of depression (interestingly, reduced plastic ability is thought to be one form of dysfunction crucial to depression).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would be nice if there was a trial with aspirin or ibuprofen. There have been trials with immunosuppressive drugs like Remicade (tnf-alpha drug) and they show improvements.</p>
