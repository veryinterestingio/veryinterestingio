It also seems to be pretty stable in humans, meaning not a lot of mutation has been observed (so hopefully it won't mutate into something more lethal).</p>
<p>Zika doesn't spread person-to-person, so it's not really comparable. edit: Zika can spread person-to-person through sex, but it's mainly through mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Ebola is not very contagious but can be very deadly.</p></div>		</li>

That doesn't roll of the tongue as nicely as 'coronavirus' or 'SARS' I guess? SARS was 'severe acute respiratory syndrome' which is equally vague and could really be used to describe 2019-nCoV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's still too early even for statements such as &quot;it's less deadly than SARS...&quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html" target="_blank">CDC</a> seems to feel the same way,</p>
<p><em>The complete clinical picture with regard to 2019-nCoV is still not fully clear. Reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying.</em> </p>
<p>In the case of SARS, a couple of people fairly early on in the disease went to Hong Kong, from whence it spread to Toronto among other places, spreading the disease where it was basically previously unknown yet reporting on cases and fatalities was accurate.</p>
<p>In contrast, this outbreak started at least as early as December in Wuhan, and there is skepticism about the reliability of numbers.  </p>
<p>There are multiple points of uncertainty:</p>
<p>- Have all infected patients been recognized?</p>
<p>- Have all fatalities been tabulated?</p>
<p>- How long does it take to die from the disease?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This last point may sound crass, but it is actually important.  If there are 11,000 ill, (and yesterday 8,000), then 3,000 were diagnosed only one day ago.  You can't simply divide 250 (dead)/11000 (infected) and get a fatality rate.</p>
<p>There was <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/" target="_blank">similar uncertainty</a> during the SARS epidemic:</p>
<p><em>On the basis of more detailed and complete data, and more reliable methods, WHO now estimates that the case fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the age group affected, with an overall estimate of case fatality of 14% to 15%.</em></p>
<p>It's also notable that the fatality rate may depend on many factors.  A couple of major ones are:</p>
<p>- Demographics (age, general state of health).</p>
<p>- Appropriate and timely treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stability definitely helps with a durable vaccine, but definitely do not count on a vaccine stopping this thing before summer (which might stop its transmission).  Vaccines take a long time to develop, and they are not trivial to make for all viruses.  That said, it looks like there is at least one MERS (another coronavirus) vaccine in development that has been tested already in humans, so I'd expect people to attempt to use the same strategy for this virus.  It doesn't guarantee it will work, but I know at least three companies have crash programs to develop a vaccine right now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ebola was bad but it was limited to Africa and majority of people in the affected area didn't travel much thus Ebola didn't spread far.    If the majority of people in the affected area loved to travel, could afford easily, and used airlines, we probably would have had a much bigger epidemic than what we got.</p>
<p>SARS did get some area shut down and many long quarantine period because it started in a major area of China and as people traveled freely (via airplanes), the virus spread pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That estimate was presented on Jan 23rd, which means it's already outdated. More recent estimates put the R0 at <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316" target="_blank">1.4-3.9</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30260-9/fulltext" target="_blank">2.47–2.86</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Health professionals are reminding us that R0 is not a static measure, that it will change depending on the response and change drastically should a vaccine be introduced. There is also mixed data on the transmission rates of historical outbreaks and comparing these numbers alone doesn't necessarily reflect the severity of this one. It's also important to give citations when describing the R0 of historical outbreaks since they are often modern analyses using incomplete historical data and thus varying wildly. It's one thing to describe the R0 of SARS for example, but another to describe the R0 of, say, small pox in the same terms. </p>
<p>This is an article being recommended to be included along with discussions of reproductive rates <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/how-fast-and-far-will-new-coronavirus-spread/605632/</a></p>
