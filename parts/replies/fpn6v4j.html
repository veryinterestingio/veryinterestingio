			<div class="markdown"><p>They're more distributed than that. Leaves for breathing, roots for drinking, xylum for transporting water up, phloem for transporting sugars down, bark for keeping stuff out, heartwood for keeping stuff standing up, flowers/cones for jizzing on absolutely everything in range.</p>
<p>They're very complicated on a chemical/cellular level, but in terms of gross anatomy, it's more effective to be simple and redundant, as to weather damages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! So what that mean was that tress allocate their energy to different processes in a certain order of importance. Basically, the work down this list until they run out</p>
<ol>
<li>Immediate survival (this is what I was referring to before) </li>
<li>Fine root and foliage renewal (this allows the tree to continue to take in water and minerals to produce more energy)</li>
<li>Reprodution! (This takes SO much energy! Once this process is started though it moves up to number one)</li>
<li>Intermediate survival (this is things like lateral growth and renewing the phloem)</li>
<li>Long term survival (things like growing thicker) </li>
<li>Developing resistance (things like resins and other defensive chemicals to ward off animals, insects, and diseases)</li>
</ol>
<p>So it's less about functions in the way that humans need to be able to move and keep out heart beating, but more about where/how its growing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation :)</p>
<p>Wanted to add a few things:</p>
<p>Monocot vs dicot isn't really that important here.  Monocots are a big group of flowering plants like grasses and palm trees.  Dicots are all the other flowering plants, but as a group they're not actually biologically related necessarily!</p>
<p>Some monocots have big storage organs, like onions, or ginger.  Even those that don't, such as grass, store enough energy in their roots to come back, it's just not in a huge lump.  You don't need to grow a carrot to store energy.</p>
<p>Also, blackberries and mint are dicots</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha okay! So I guess my division was a little bit off. So monocots and dicots ARE different, but they do both have the ability to store starches in the roots. In my example I mention blackberries and mint, they're actually both dicots! I was half asleep when I wrote it and I was trying to think of examples of rhizomes. </p>
<p>Okay but I'm about to go off about plants, so you're basically going to get the distilled version of my botany class. There are four classes you can divide plants into, they're all based on how evolved they are.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bryophyta: has no specialized tissues, reproduces via spores. These are things like mosses and liverworts</li>
<li>Filicinophyta: they have specialized tissue, like leaves and stems, and still reproduce from spores. These are things like ferns.</li>
<li>Coniferophyta: conifers! They have specialized tissue, but now they produce seeds. The key factor is that they produce seeds out of cones rather than flowers. </li>
<li>Angiosperms: these are alllll flowing and fruit producing plants. The thing is though, you have to widen your view of a fruit. Fruits are enlarged ovaries. Bam forget what everyone said about tomatoes, they're a fucking fruit. Grass seeds? Fruit. Maple fliers? Fruit. Acorns? Hell yeah. </li>
</ol>
<p>So bam. Now you know that. Angiosperms are then divided into two categories, monocots and dicots. This refers to whether the seed has one or two cotyledons. Cotyledons are basically little fetal leaves that live inside the seed. Monocots are generally grasses and palms.</p>
<p>Hers how to identify each one!
Monocots: </p>
<ul>
<li>loose, fibrous, and net like roots</li>
<li>The veins in their leaves run parallel to the edges
-the floral parts (petals and stamen) tend to be in multiples of three. </li>
<li>ex. Lillies</li>
</ul>
<p>Dicots: (basically the opposite) </p>
<ul>
<li>the veins in the leaves are net like
-taproots
-floral parts in fours and fives
-ex. Maples, pansies, carrots.</li>
</ul>
<p>And at this point I've 100% forgotten where I'm going with this. Any questions?</p></div>		</li>
