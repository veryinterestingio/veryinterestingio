<p>Your answer was something a child could understand so thank you :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last poster was correct. To clarify. This is known as Displacement. When you here modern engines discussed, they typically use metric (liters) or older engines (like in muscle cars) use English units. If you here someone talk about a 350 from a Chevy that’s a 350 cubic inch Displacement (roughly 5.7 liters). </p>
<p>You can achieve this displacement by a combination of piston cylinder bore (cylinder circle plane diameter) and stroke length of the connecting rod (cylinder length). From there it’s just a cylinder volume calculation times total cylinder count. There is an ideal geometry between bore and stroke for engine reliability as well, so it’s a balancing act for the engineers. Narrow long cylinders put stress on the rod and can cause rod failure. Wider diameter cylinders require a fatter engine that makes fitting it in a car hard. </p>
<p>More displacement makes more power. Some people over bore their existing engines to make more power. Then you don’t need to worry about fitting a larger engine in the car. But by removing cylinder wall material, you make the cylinder weaker and can risk breaking it with too much power if you tube the engine wrong. You also need to not go so big you cut into the oil or coolant passages in the block to move oil and coolant around. That’s where engine sleeping can come into play (bore out cylinders and press in cylinder inserts that are stronger). </p>
<p>Lots of fun things to learn about!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was very helpful, thanks. I had previously always thought a 3 L engine meant if you dunked the whole engine in a tub of water, it would displace 3 L of water over the side of the tub. Then I was confused by the term 3 L engine bored out to 3.3 liters. Never knew what that meant until now.</p>
<p>Then there was the time I saw on Mecum auctions, some older Russian car had a 1.1 L 12 cylinder engine. I thought those 12 cylinders must be the size of a fat finger. Now it makes more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact to add to that. </p>
<p>Motorcycles use CCs, or cubic centimeters. </p>
<p>So if you have a 1000cc motorcycle engine, and a 1.2 liter Honda Civic engine, the little motorcycle engine has almost as much space inside it for combustion as the entire 4 cylinder honda engine! (Think of some of those 1700cc Harley's!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I think this was a choice by motorcycle manufacturers to make their engines sound more impressive. 750cc sounds much better and ‘bigger’ than 0.75L.</p>
<p>The buying public are pretty stupid. No one in the US bought a 1/3 of a pound burger because they thought it was smaller than a 1/4 pound McDonald’s burger.</p>
<p>Bike engines are also built for high revs and high power whereas car engines are built for torque so generally have different characteristics. Car engines rarely rev over 6-7,000 rpm with a few notable exceptions. A high performance bike engine will easily do 9,000 rpm, some even as high as 12-14,000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - engines are rated in 'displacement' - i.e. the size of the 'bore' of the cylinders multiplied by the 'stroke' distance of far the pistons move within that cylinder.</p>
<p>It's possible to buy aftermarket crankshafts that have a longer stroke length than the original, and give an engine more total displacement.  </p>
<p>Displacement can be thought of as 'how much fuel-air mixture can it burn' rating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's referred to as &quot;displacement&quot;. So on a V8 with 5 liters total engine displacement, a spec sheet wouldn't read &quot;engine size: 5L&quot;, it would read &quot;displacement: 5L&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to get super technical/pedantic about it, yes. Cylinder displacement is measured with the piston at the bottom of its stroke. There's going to be a lower portion of the cylinder bore volume that's unavailable for combustion, so that the compression/oil control rings stay seated properly. But, like you said, this is if you want to get beyond eli5 territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it include the cylinder head volume where the valves pop open into but the piston never goes?</p>
<p>For example if a piston didn’t move (0 length piston arm) would an engine still have displacement?</p></div>		</li>
