<p>if RSA were suddenly solvable or more easily computable, most of the internet communication would need a complete restructure to function</p>

<p>This is true, but it's not quite as cataclysmic as it seems on the surface (particularly as it relates to Riemann). There was even an episode with this premise in Season 1 of CBS's Numb3rs, and while it's an entertaining thought, it's really not that much of a concern.</p>
<p>We already <em>know</em> the Riemann Hypothesis holds for realistic values since we've tested it exhaustively. If RSA were going to fall over due to the zeta function's connection to primes, it would have already done so. There just aren't any practical attacks which can be formulated on its basis.</p></div>		</li>
