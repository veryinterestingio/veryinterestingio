			<div class="markdown"><p>Proteins are long strings of amino acids (which are very special molecules, to simplify), and need to be folded in very specific configurations to work properly. One of the things that keeps them folded is water, because of the interaction between the charged parts of the protein's amino acids with those of water (polar and non-polar interaction). That is specially true in the subject of breathing, since the molecule that carries oxygen and CO2 is a protein called hemoglobin, which would not stay functional outside a water-based environment.  </p>
<p>Quick note: not all proteins need water, our hair and nails (and some other animal horns, claws, hooves, feathers...) are made of the protein keratin, which is extremely insoluble in water.</p></div>		</li>
