			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you mind expanding on the differences between ideation, thoughts and/or tendencies? I thought I understood it but I'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Also... I can't be thankful enough for the therapists who understand that talking about suicidal thoughts != increased risk.  Being able to talk to someone freely about subjects that would (and have) land me in a hospital   anywhere else was a huge part of what helped keep me... If not happy, then at least not miserable.  Thanks for what you do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty close descriptor!</p>
<p>I personally don't use the term &quot;morbid thinking&quot; (my clients do though); it negatively connotates thinking about death and dying. I prefer just to call it &quot;thinking' and the topic just happens to be death. This usually has some level of curiosity or from one's own spirituality, in addition to potential experiences of grieving or cultural/social discussions. This is generally considered routine. This also does not usually increase one's risk of hurting themselves.</p>
<p>Suicidal thoughts are different than &quot;morbid thinking&quot;; it goes into the realm of &quot;what if I just killed myself.&quot; The act of dying turns from &quot;any cause&quot; to &quot;me causing my own death.&quot; This is correlated by a bump in risk, the amount depending on how well you are able to manage the severity and frequency of those thoughts.</p>
<p>Suicidal ideation is pretty much what you describe, but I would also add that at this point a person begins to see killing themselves as &quot;the answer.&quot; It becomes less scary and they get to a point where they start to accept that they will eventually take means to kill themselves. This causes a higher bump in risk (especially if it occurs frequently- we consider that to be &quot;active SI&quot;.)</p>
<p>Tendencies are no really a term a lot of professionals use, since what it means tends to vary heavily within the profession. Instead, I would rather use &quot;planning&quot; and then &quot;attempt.&quot; Taking thoughtful or impulsive action with the intent of killing oneself. This is associated with the highest risk level.</p>
<p>And of course, the biggest predictor we have found to predict future suicide attempts is past suicide attempts. So, if you have attempted before, then chances are your risk level will remain at least at mild/moderate for quite a long time, even with proper treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Accurately assessing risk (to me) means that I have as many factors related to predicting one's chances of attempting to hurt themselves with the intention of dying known to me as possible. </p>
<p>&quot;Slightly&quot; versus &quot;Very&quot; is broad, and not super helpful in narrowing down a person's risk. Also, protective factors are important to keep in mind, too. So, I would break it down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low suicide risk- generally consists of morbid thinking, with some suicidal thoughts present. Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness may persist, with the client possibly meeting criteria for something like depression. May also include some slight non-suicidal self-injury (most people call it self-harm). Protective factors may include supportive family/friends, lack of accessible lethal means, little to no disinhibiting substance use (alcohol, opioids, benzos, etc.), a sense of faith/spirituality, and receiving active mental health treatment. For this level, not much is required other than checking in with the client on their suicidal thoughts and targeting either the thoughts themselves or the underlying factors that cause the thoughts in therapy.</li>
<li>Moderate suicide risk- generally has moved from just morbid thinking or suicidal thoughts to some ideation. Usually it is more &quot;passive&quot; (does not occur frequently) and so planning and method selection is in various stages. Protective factors are likely starting to lack in these situations; a client may have some relational difficulties within their support system, have some access to a lethal mean (pills, sharp objects, multiple ligature placements), and they may drink more than usual or experiment with opioids/pills. At this point, talking about safety planning is wise, particularly if multiple protective factors are lacking. If this is skirting towards the higher end of moderate risk, I may bump up the number of weekly therapy sessions. I am generally comfortable working with this risk level, so others who are not may refer to emergency services for an assessment of risk.</li>
<li>High suicide risk- at this point, suicidal ideation is very frequent (&quot;active&quot;), with potential more severe levels of self-harm and at some point an attempt. At this point, generally the person has selected their method and may have begun to set up the circumstances to execute this method. This level usually has little to no protective factors; the person may feel completely isolated from their support system, may be heavily self-medicating with substances, may feel like their spirituality has failed them, and may be at peace with killing themselves. This is the point where, as a clinician, engaging with emergency services is appropriate. It isn't the only answer here, but generally you will want a higher level of care than outpatient.</li>

What does &quot;engaging with emergency services is appropriate&quot; mean, I mean &quot;emergency services&quot; - what are they?</p></div>		</li>
