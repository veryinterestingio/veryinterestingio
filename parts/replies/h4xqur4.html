			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the differences in language are also the reason why some cultures have trouble getting along/understanding each other. The languages encode the way of thinking because there are words/concepts that are absent from another language. Not even some kind of special words but everyday things that you might need several words or a whole sentence to explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>language encodes the way you see the world to an extent, one famous example is how certain african languages have special words for differentiating shades of green/brown that don't matter as much to others. Inuit tribes having many words for different shades of snow or ice. </p>
<p>A simple example is how in english almost everything is contextual, meanings of words change with the way they are said and with some minor variation of sounding out the word. Russian for example is not as contextually driven. </p>
<p>So if you are not a native english speaker because you are not used to provide all the context you can come across as rude, or if people are still translating it directly in their minds vs actually thinking in english. That affects the structure of sentences and how you say them. And the opposite is true, an english speaking person trying to provide context for the things they are trying to convey could be seen as excessively verbose to the point of seeming to try to bury the meaning behind the wording so as a consequence being seen as deceptive. </p>
<p>This drives the way of thinking. If the words stay the same but context changes and that also changes the meaning then your whole idea is more malleable. Another easy example is &quot;you&quot;. In english there is no polite/impolite or personal/impersonal level of saying that. Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and plenty of other languages have variations upon where depending on who you are addressing the way you address them also changes. This is very important in Japanese, Korean and Chinese cultures where saying the wrong denominator of your social position in respect to the person with who you are speaking might be seen as rude or even insulting. </p>
<p>Probably apocryphal but there is a historical anecdote type thing where spanish/portugese travellers met chinese and learned some of their language what they thought was &quot;i agree&quot; was actually &quot;I understand what you said&quot; and so they were rather surprised when the chinese didn't keep any agreements they had made. </p>
<p>Plus of course there are the gendered languages. The way you speak constantly affects the way you think, and that's even without going into regional differences and dialects of the same language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least around me in Kentucky we say it's spitting when the rain is doing a drop every now and then. Like right before it comes down. So even more than just American English there's differences with region as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has made me realise that British English has a lot of nuanced ways to describe rain. It can be a drizzle, a drisk, a downpour, a torrent, a squall, a deluge or a shower. It can start spitting or start bouncing or be hammering or lashing it down. It‚Äôs a drizzle if it‚Äôs misty or sleet if it‚Äôs half-frozen or a flurry if it‚Äôs windy. But then again, it rains for 2/3 of the year in Britain, so it‚Äôs hardly surprising.</p></div>		</li>
