			<div class="markdown"><p>Are SD cards <em>that</em> unreliable though? I think of systems like smartphones and the nintendo switch that are accessing an SD card all the time, and they don't seem to fail any faster than, say, an HDD.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, so basically the answer is yes, they are that unreliable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The major factor is write endurance. Reading doesn't really damage anything, even over time. Writing causes permanently damage that eventually will cause the cell to become unwritable and possibly unreadable. Bad sectors will be marked as such and the device generally should continue working until a large amount of the card becomes unwritable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, writing is what kills them, but they are typically good for 100,000 write/erase cycles before a cell in a sector will go bad. The sectors used for the FAT table in a FAT based file system can get to 100,000 cycles a lot faster than you would think. Luckily FAT32 isn't used much outside of removable devices anymore.</p>
<p>Went a little more technical there than ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SD cards are typically used for long term storage.  Write a data file once, and it's a unit.  The only thing that keeps getting hit is the area showing how the memory is allocated, which has to be updated every time you write something new.</p>
<p>When you run as a hard drive, the OS or apps may hammer the SSD with thousands of little writes per second.  </p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi may carry programs on the SD card, but it manages them differently than an SSD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 3.5&quot; SSD's as well as 2.5&quot;.  Power really isnt a major issue between the two, especially when comparing to an HDD.  You could make a very large bulky SSD, but you would need to create a new form factor PC manufacturers would use so it would fit.  </p>
<p>However since everyone has a 2.5&quot; or 3.5&quot; bay, they use that size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the circuits themselves are physically different. Flash memory can only be erased and rewritten a limited number of times.  That limit is much lower in the type of memory used in SD cards, so even if you chained together a lot of them, they would still only be able to be rewritten the same number of times meaning they would degrade and fail at the same rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flash memory consisted of three major aspect to determine the TBW (total bytes written) or DWPD (drive writes per day).  Probably the most important aspect is the NAND flash itself.  Is it SLC, MLC, TLC or QLC?  SLC is extremely durable but expensive and are usually used for mission critical applications; whereas, TLC and QLC are consumer grade that will fail much faster.  If you want to know why, look into how a QLC needs to actually charge and differentiate 16 different states in one transistors; whereas, a SLC only 2.  </p>
<p>Next is the microcontroller.  NAND Flash technology requires a microcontroller to handle garbage collection, wear leveling and a whole bunch of stuff.  Usually, a SD card have some low cost weak microcontroller that isn't all that great.  Whereas, look into Marvell with their enterprise controllers.  </p>
<p>Lastly, this is between a low cost vs a higher end solution, DRAM cache.  SD card does not have the space nor have a budget to have a DRAM cache; whereas, most 2.5&quot;in have DRAM cache.  I can tell you first hand, a device with DRAM lasts several times longer than a device without it; because, a DRAM cache allows the SSD to store the temp information and write once; whereas, a DRAMless will always write to the flash.  Flash doesn't program/ erase per one bit, it does per block.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SATA is a bus interface. Like a  pin format. You can make a SATA port in any shape by shifting the pins around, as long as pin 1 still connects to pin 1 and so on. M.2 is a form factor, or one shape.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>M.2 is the physical socket. But the communication protocol supported by the socket can be NVMe or Sata (3), depending of the manufacturer of the board.</p>
<p>That’s why is important the full name M.2/NVMe or M.2/Sata for clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SATA can refer to either a connector or a protocol. M.2 only ever refers to a connector. M.2 SSDs can use either the SATA or NVMe protocols (there could be more, but those are the only two I'm aware of).</p></div>		</li>
