			<div class="markdown"><p>To properly use your analogy.  The vaccine trains the immune system to destroy the forged keys (spike protein) that can unlock the ace2 lock.  To reiterate the original question that wasnâ€™t addressed, will the immune system destroy legitimate keys and forged keys?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. That comes from the second part of the answer - the self-tolerance part. As the immune system matures, it learns to not respond to auto antigens/self-antigens - in this case, the original keys.<br />
- To understand this better - we need to expand the analogy a bit more. When B/T cells are produced in the bone marrow/thymus respectively, each B/T cell can detect one particular antigen (i.e. each cell can identify one key). This is made by a purely stochastic/random combination. As part of the maturation/training process, all B/T cells that recognzie a self antigen/key are killed off, so that the only ones that mature and end up circulating are the ones that can only find foreign antigens/keys.<br />
- What a vaccine does is, introduce a version of the key (broken down, or in some format of the other, but still recognizable) - so that the B/T cells recognize this key - take it to HQ (spleen, lymph nodes) and through another process generate immune memory - which is basically a retraining of the cells to recognize this key much quicker and much more accurately - like finetuning - and these new memory cells are the equivalent of supercharged T/B. (they have a bigger alarm whistle). So next time the virus comes, these memory cells spot it, and sound the alarm bigger, better and more focused than a regular B/T cell.<br />
The spike protein of the virus is also way different in multiple aspects compared to a free floating ACE enzyme in the body... in other words, even though the lock is the same, the keys are VERY different.<br />
The other reason is, if this is a concern - that the immune response generated could mistake self-enzymes, it would have shown up as a safety signal very early on in the trials. The fact that it hasn't is another supporting point.<br />
Hope that helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there, what about overreaction to other viral proteins that are similar, like from similar viruses. Is there a risk of overreaction to common colds that are coronaviruses etc? </p>
<p>Or is it that we would of seen this too by now in testing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I need to edit my post, I meant the ACE2 key our body makes, not the ACE2 receptors, but I see what you mean about being trained on not attacking our existing molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of the problem is that you're imagining angiotensin II (the ACE2 &quot;key&quot;) must be similar to the spike protein, since they both interact with the same receptor.  Angiotensin is a very small peptide, only 10 amino acids long.  The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is much larger, 1273 amino acids long.  Most of the spike protein looks nothing like angiotensin.  Small molecules like angiotensin also tend to not be very good targets for antibodies, although this is not an absolute rule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a different but related question. Could the fact that our own cells are going to be making the antigen promote an autoimmune response, not to the ACE-2 but to those cells or a protein associated with them? Or does the immune system not do that kind of guilt by association?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in the way you are asking.
The spike protein is distinct enough from our proteins that it shouldn't cause an autoantibody response. Just because these vaccines rely on our body's machinery to make the antigen won't cause the immune system to look at the machinery as suspect if that's what you're asking.
Think of it this way, the mRNA vaccines are the code to make the viral protein. The target cells make the protein internally. Once that protein is made, even within cells there are mechanisms to identify it as a foreign protein and start the MHC Class 1 Cascade to break it down and trigger the Cascade for intracellular pathogens. Alternatively the proteins can also go to MHC Class 2, or if they're secreted, get picked up by antibodies (which would also go through mhc2) .
I.e. immune system won't be directed against machinery. </p>
<p>Guilt by association is possible, and what we harness FOR vaccines by using adjuvants. Which are basically little signals that attract the immune system quicker. They don't generate immunity or anything. Just get the attention of the immune system to the antigen quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! To make sure I understand: the cell marks the proteins as foreign before they're displayed to the immune system. Is that a reasonable summary?</p></div>		</li>
