			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, Did Scientists Finally Create Metallic Hydrogen?</p>
<pre><code>French scientists believe they have made metallic hydrogen using special torus-shaped diamond anvils.</code></pre>
<p>Scientists have used diamond anvils to compress hydrogen into a form they believe is metallic. In Nature, researchers from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) describe how their hydrogen sample changed into a form that acts like a metal.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a promising experiment but to my knowledge it's not conclusive as there are always alternative methods to explain the results of that particular experiment through impurities in the anvils and feed gas. The diamond anvils used in that experiment have novel geometry which allows them get higher pressures so perhaps further experiments can validate these results. </p>
<p>The main thing needed to confirm, is proof the sample does not conduct electricity at some pressure and then, as the pressure increases, suddenly it does. This would be near conclusive proof as conduction is unique among possible theories of what could happen in the anvil. Unfortunately I don't believe there have been any experiment yet that have a design which allows that kind of testing with the accuracy required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It can certainly be argued that a definite proof for metallic hydrogen would come only from a measurement of the sampleâ€™s electrical conductivity at high pressure as a function of temperature. Solid hydrogen should exhibit a high level of electrical conduction that should then decrease as the sample temperature is raised. However, even with experimental techniques developed in the past few decades to study condensed matter in extreme conditions, electrical-transport measurements of hydrogen remain a huge challenge</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That iirc was made by crushing two diamonds together using very powerful lasers so if they did it was just a couple of atoms. I think it's cheaper to create antimatter than it is to create metallic hydrogen but don't quote me on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The use of diamond anvils shows they're doing very small tests with absolutely tiny amounts of hydrogen. Making a microgram in a lab is different from making a thousand tonnes to power a rocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick Sci Fi geek question:  Anti-matter has much the same basic issue in that we can currently create Anti-matter and contain it in a magnetic field but it is ridiculously cost intensive and time consuming to create.  Probably more so than making this metallic hydrogen.    </p>
<p>However given the energy potential of Anti-matter...would it be better to pour R+D into creating quality controlled mass production of Anti-matter since the payoff is far better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school about 10 years ago, after all the billions of dollars of research into making antimatter since it was hypothesized, they had produced enough to warm a cup of coffee. So yeah matter-antimatter annihilation would be an amazing energy payout, but would bankrupt the entire world haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. Nobody has produced more than a few dozen atoms of the stuff here on earth (and possibly not even that), certainly not enough to be able to say for sure how it behaves as a material.</p>
<p>But some theorists have proposed that their equations indicate it could be stable. Only time will tell if they are correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Teleports would drastically reduce travel times between all locations. The downside is, we don't know how to make them&quot;</p></div>		</li>
