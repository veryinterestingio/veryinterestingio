			<div class="markdown"><p>The oxygen tank is ‘liquid’ oxygen, so all of the molecules will be in a liquid state at the same temperature and pressure. If you have a gas mixture it is harder to get all of the molecules in a liquid state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that the gases mix well at close to atmospheric pressure but behave differently in a tank which is at high pressure. If you go high enough one of the gases might even liquefy while the other one stays in gaseous form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When people breathe the oxygen is used up / turned into CO_2, but the nitrogen stays as it is. So you need an oxygen tank anyway to replenish that. You wouldn't just exchange the whole mix, nitrogen and all. That'd mean venting it into space, a huge waste.</p></div>		</li>
