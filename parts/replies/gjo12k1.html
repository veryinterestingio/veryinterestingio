			<div class="markdown"><p>cinema cameras and lensing companies are like Hermes - everything is essentially bespoke and precise.  ARRI, the most storied cinema camera company, invest huge sums into R&amp;D and controlled manufacturing techniques to produce their components.   Some of their lens and sensor manufacturing has managed to overcome weird physics problems that involve lots of mathematics and cutting edge manufacturing tools.  In their master prime lenses ($30k-ish per lens, of which companies usually buy sets of 10 or so) I believe ARRI innovated the use of magnetic chemicals to grind the many lenses into perfect curves (and even funky asymetical curves) to bend individual colours of light to avoid interference and line the light up dead-on with the sensor.   You're paying for &gt;99.9th percentile precision.</p>
<p>TV cameras on the other hand are just like Gucci bags or police cars  -  chosen to perform well in general, but less reliant on rare manufacturers.  That and the niche of the product mean they can charge like $50k for them even though they're less perfected.</p></div>		</li>
