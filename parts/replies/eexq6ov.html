			<div class="markdown"><p>The redhead thing is because redheads often have a MC1R Gene mutation that causes them to have red hair, increased response to capsaicin, increased response to inflammation, require 20% more anesthesia, but &quot;reduced sensitivity to noxious stimuli and increased analgesic responsiveness to morphine-metabolite analgesics&quot; <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocortin_1_receptor" target="_blank">wiki</a></p>
<p>In short, due to a general mutation that is linked to causing the red hair, we are less sensitive to most types of pain but also find most types of pain relief/anesthesia ineffective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have so many dentist horror stories too. Now I go in telling them up front: I have bad experiences, I have a lot of anxiety, and lidocaine doesn't work. Instead they use something else that goes in the roof of the mouth (ouch) and works much better. The dentist's have been much more careful with my needs now.</p>
<p>... Still brush like crazy to avoid them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this translate over to lower rates of certain drug addictions? My thinking is that if the effects of certain drugs are muted or limited then maybe the desire to repeat the use would be as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for everyone. I know pain killers don't work as well for me. Which causes me to take more. And I do get a fuzzy headedness when I have enough, but I personally don't like it. If someone were to enjoy that fuzzy headedness, they would just need more pills to sustain their abuse. </p></div>		</li>
