			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a very plausible explanation, thank you!
I understand that the injected dose has to be high enough to cause a systemic involvement for it to affect the lifespan, through cell death and organ damage.
For &quot;humans&quot;, I guess one or few bites injecting the same type of venom but only resolving into localized symptoms wouldn't be expected to cause a significant lifespan reduction. Does it sound about correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is correct. In humans, loxoscelism from brown recluse bites can have cutaneous (localized) or visceral (systemic/multi-organ) manifestations, or both. Localized symptoms happen almost universally as a result of direct cell death at the site of the bite, and by itself skin necrosis shouldn't have as big of an impact on lifespan as multi-organ failure (this isn't to say that localized loxoscelism couldn't lead to longer-term complications down the road, such as infections).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV case is pretty special since it's a virus that targets the immune cells, and at this moment, you can't let T killer cells destroy the infected cells if those cells are basically themselves. Or you do and you just get no protection against this virus and any others (which is basically the case, infected cells are either killed by the virus or by other immunce cells). </p>
<p>Also a virus that is located inside a cell can't be targeted by antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV is indeed a special case, but it's not special exactly in the way you've implied. HIV specifically targets CD4 (helper) T cells, which are important for general immune system activation and coordination, but that effect does not become more prominent until late in the disease course (ie. AIDS). The CD8 (killer) T cell response is actually quite <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4575777/" target="_blank">important</a> as it is the main determinant for how quickly the viral set point is reached and how severe viremia is at that set point. CD8 T cells constrain the magnitude of HIV infection and overall viral load by killing infected CD4 cells, and in early stage infection the body is able to produce new CD4 cells quickly enough to keep up with loss resulting from the CD8 response.</p>
<p>Seroconversion (the appearance of antibodies) as measured by 3rd-gen HIV tests occurs pretty reliably at ~4 weeks post-exposure, and that process itself depends on CD4 T cell help, which is consistent with the fact that early on the immune response is still competent.</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons why antibodies are ineffective at clearing HIV infection, including but not limited to: (1) HIV can hide within inactive white blood cells in what is called the &quot;latent reservoir,&quot; (2) the polymerase used by HIV for replication is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7683675/" target="_blank">error-prone</a>, so existing antibodies and other aspects of the immune response become less effective as the HIV surface proteins mutate. This is in part why we don't yet have a vaccine for HIV - the antibodies we generate to HIV just aren't effective at neutralizing it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are patients who can maintain undetectable levels of HIV (and high CD4 T cell counts) in their blood for a very long time. They are rare (about 0.3% of patients) and are referred to as &quot;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/51/2/239/303856" target="_blank">elite controllers</a>.&quot; Their ability to suppress HIV seems to come more from the quality of their CD8 and CD4 T cell response (specifically those producing IFN-gamma and IL-2) than their B cell response. Which again suggests that for HIV in particular, antibodies just really don't play an effective role.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also a virus that is located inside a cell can't be targeted by antibodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, and is part of why the latent reservoir exists in chronic HIV infection, but this feature is not unique to HIV. We have effective vaccines for plenty of viruses such as measles, rubella, and HPV (all of which also sit inside of host cells for a significant portion of their life cycle), because the antibodies we produce in response to those vaccines can reliably neutralize said viruses before they infect enough cells to cause clinical infection.</p>
<p>My point is that just because an antibody response occurs doesn't guarantee that it will do the job we expect it to do. Almost by definition we must expect that the antibody binds in some way to the foreign substance (otherwise it wouldn't have been clonally selected in the immune response), but that doesn't mean that it is an effective neutralizer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a thread about spider venom, not viruses, thus I don't agree with your statement.
For a toxin (organic molecule) why not?<br />
This isn't a virus that mutates, or attacks the immune system.
Its not like the toxin is replicating itself inside cells, its just killing them.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't an antibody bond to an antigen, which in the case of an organic toxin rend it harmless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant that as a general statement. Clearly the fact that spider antivenom is used clinically somewhere in the world suggests that it probably does work - although if you really wanted to know for sure, you would need to conduct a randomized controlled trial, and I'm not aware of any placebo-controlled RCTs assessing the efficacy of brown recluse antivenom.</p>
<p>But just as /u/EmilyU1F984 says, as a general principle an antibody  can bind to any portion of a molecule, not just the active portion. You can't know a priori if a hypothetical antibody will neutralize the activity of a target molecule until you empirically test it. This is true of any antigen, viral or otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree 100%.  I never stated otherwise.  But if an antibody is ineffective there isn't much use for it,  and it won't help the animal survive.  If it's partially effective, coupled with cytotoxic T cell activity it may help the animal survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then it would not be an effective antibody.
This entire folder is based on using horse antibodies to treat spider venom.
That implies that the horse antibodies are effective.</p>
<p>This isn't some random hypothetical.</p>
<p>My understanding is  antivenom (i.e. antibodies) is successful at neutralizing the toxins.  Or at least some of them, since venom is frequently composed of multiple compounds.</p></div>		</li>
