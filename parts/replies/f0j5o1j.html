			<div class="markdown"><p>Important aspect of the theory:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's just a conjecture</li>
<li>It holds almost exclusively descriptive, rather than predictive, value. Since human languages are finite in number and structure, it's trivial to construct a grammar that &quot;universally&quot; encompasses them, but that grammar doesn't necessarily predict (and in fact has <em>been shown not to accurately predict</em>) other languages that we only become aware of after the development of the grammar. In this regard, the theory is highly suspect, and its core value is questionable.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a conjecture. It's the basis of modern linguistics, and the disagreements are about the specifics of things like language acquisition. The predictive value is in the fact that a newborn from a remote Amazonian tribe can naturally learn to speak German as easily as any native speaker, the fact that animals have shown no signs of any such cognitive faculties and the fact that there's a critical period in development that can expire without stimulus and leave you without any language ability, just as being blindfolded through the critical period for vision development can leave you functionally blind.</p>
<p>A prediction, for example, is that Skinnerean behaviorists would have exactly as much luck getting Nim and Koko to talk as they would getting penguins to fly. That prediction was proven correct, since all those &quot;experiments&quot; ended in embarrassing failure.</p>
<p>edit - To be clear, as a disclaimer, I'm talking about UG in the &quot;broad&quot; sense and not as any specific generative grammar framework, which is obviously going to be way more uncertain and contested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the theory of universal grammar <em>spawned</em> certain branches of research into things like acquisition (e.g. Jackendoff, a Chomsky disciple) more so than it forms the <em>basis</em> of modern research, but that's maybe just my opinion; I'm not a linguist by trade or education.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate on this answer? I've heard pretty much the same as the person you replied to - that Chomsky was trying to find what all known languages have in common, made some conjectures, from which most have been proven to be false by other linguists (i recall something about recursivity?). Overall he didn't seem to be well-respected outside USA and i wonder what exactly is the actual theory that is universally true. Is it just this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the idea that language is based on innate cognitive faculties is obvious and uncontroversial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what does it exactly mean? What does it say about humans, and animals? Do all humans have some kind of natural ability to learn human-made languages? Is it powered by particular part in brain, or genetically? How does a particular cat not talking to a particular dog prove anything? Would that mean that both cats and dogs are missing a component humans have, or that cats and dogs aren't even able to vocally produce the same sounds? Does <strong>language is based on innate cognitive faculties</strong> even have any informational value (as a theory or result of a research), or is it a statement that is vague enough so that it can't be neither proven or disproven since it relies on exact definition of each of the words?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a unique prediction of universal grammar. Universal grammar is the much stronger claim that children aquire language by filling in the gaps in an intuitive grammar they all possess. And that's what is most likely not correct.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In keeping with ELI5, think of it this way:</p>
<p>You can build a dictionary that holds all the words for a single langauge.  You might not be able to hold all the constructions of the words (like counting up through infinity) but you can hold the grammar rules for English, for Spanish, for Russian, for whatever other languages all in a single rulebook.</p>
<p>You can build a &quot;universal&quot; grammar by combining all the dictionaries and rulebooks together.  Instead of an English only dictionary, it's got English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Russian, Swahili, and all the other languages combined in the same enormous &quot;universal&quot; dictionary and rule book.  It would be enormous like a giant encyclopedia, but the theory says the universal grammar could be created.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>those logical characteristics are called Syntax.</p>
<p>ie, sentences, no matter the structure, require subject and predicate. there is a time-element (past, present, future, etc), evry language has accusatives, questions, declaratives, etc.</p></div>		</li>
