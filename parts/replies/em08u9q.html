			<div class="markdown"><p>The cavities are created in the lower pressure at the suction side of the impeller blade (not by heating the water, but by lowering the pressure. You might know that water boils at a lower temperature on Mount Everest? Same thing!), and as the next blade’s pressure side “catches up” with it the pressure increases again and the cavities collapse. </p>
<p>Thing is, now the cavities are really close to the blade surface, and they collapse inwards on themselves in kind of doughnut shape (think smoke rings). This creates a powerful water jet through the center of the cavity-doughnut of up to a 1000 times the ambient pressure. This water jet hits the blade (or whatever part it comes into contact with) and literally rips materials away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And any suspended calcium, aluminum oxide or other particles  help the bubbles attack the low pressure side of impeller vanes, intake valves, etc. Like a low rent sandblaster. The particles   get yeeted into surfaces as they are slung around the periphery of each bubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for the explanation, that was helpful.  </p>
<p>Not to bring us too off topic, but, does that all mean that, more or less, cavitation damage in pumps (where it results from pressure rather than heat) is inevitable and an ultimately unavoidable result of use? Or is there some way to mitigate the damage (apart from using stronger materials)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because of where it happens... in pumps  etc... cavitation is happening on or near the surface of the pump. The little shockwaves caused by the bubbles collapsing are close enough to the components to cause damage. In the kettle, the bubbles are rising and collapsing away from the element.</p></div>		</li>
