			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife started this as well. I didn't see the meaning with cooking anymore.. BUT it's the fibres in onions that she cannot eat. Meaning garlic and onion-oil is OK. We buy small flasks of it and flavour is back! You can make it yourself as well but we haven't tried. Maybe something for you? Also. The green parts of every leek-type is ok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much recommended to people with IBS or other gastrointestinal problems. </p>
<p>First you pretty much stop eating a bunch of (trigger) foods, call elimination. </p>
<p>Then you slowly reintroduce those foods (start eating those trigger foods) and see how it effects you. Some like onions might cause some people pain and stuff but maybe your body can tolerate it. Then you try beans, etc and see how it effects you.</p>
<p>So I can’t even look at dairy products or I’ll get a lot of gas and pain inside me. </p>
<p>But onions don’t cause me problems, neither does beans or mango or watermelon. </p>
<p>Fried Chicken really messes me up. Really really bad. Completely in pain for a week. As does menudo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same bro! Whenever I’m out with my SO, eating is the last thing in our day before heading home because of this.</p>
<p>It’s a nightmare! In my case, around 30mins after eating I start feeling that I need to go, and then I go early in case there’s a long line in the bathroom.</p>
<p>It’s a nightmare</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take this for what it's worth but I had bad IBS when I was younger (32-35, I'm 42 now). I started taking one of the first soil based probiotics (Prescript Assist, I was in their trials) and it cured my IBS in about four weeks. Side note: it and vitamin D mostly cured my depression in about four months. Highly recommend. I'd happily tell you more about it if you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds interesting! Never heard os soil based probiotics.</p>
<p>I think having constant stomach issues certainly give you a lower mood. I'm glad you're better!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's been several studies linking gut bacteria to seratonin and dopamine production since I started taking these. I've been on them nearly five years or so now and I noticed on my own that after four months of taking them I could start to feel my depression start and it gave me a chance to control it. Once I added 10k of vitD 5x a week, I was basically done. I mean, I may have my problems but not full blown depression like the family is known for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add: the recall they had was due to peanut dust possibly contaminating one of the lines, not a problem with the product itself. However, I have been trying out a cheaper one made by Codeage for maybe four months now. Switched because it was cheaper and let's be honest: we're all broke right now. They don't have all the same strains of bacteria but so far they seem to be working. I have noticed that a LITTLE but if ibs has been setting in but nothing what I had before. Before if I ate almost anything (processed sugar was a big trigger) I was in the bathroom within five to eight minutes. It was terrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had zero success with yogurt style pro biotics then I was asked to be in this study of the Prescript Assist soil based (I do not work for them or in any way get compensated from this... The product changed my life so I tell everyone). The theory was that we received our gut bacteria from eating off the ground so they made a pill with the common strains of dirt bacteria in it. It even smells like dirt (which is a reason I'm not 100% convinced of the codeage brand I'm trying now but I'll give it a couple more months if it saves me $20/month).</p>
<p>When I first took them I felt a little sick for maybe three days. I was told by my microbiologist friend (who got me in the study) that it was most likely the new bacteria killing off the old. If it didn't go away in a week to stop taking them. After a week of taking them I felt a very noticeable difference in how I felt... It was great. I can't explain why but I just felt good. Within a month my IBS was no more... Within 4 months I noticed my moods were better. My depression more controllable. I would notice it coming on and that gave me some control. It didn't cure it but it took the edges off... What was, before, a swing from +10 to -10 was now in the 6s and the swing lasted a shorter amount of time.</p>
<p>I'm still in month four of trying out the codeage brand. I told myself I'd give it six months. I have noticed that my moods are not quite as mellow on it but right now I'm chalking that up to the stress of the global situation. I do keep notes and I'll consolidate them in late October to get a better picture.</p></div>		</li>
