			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It's important to note trees only produce net positive oxygen while growing (which granted they are usually always doing). They do not passively produce more oxygen for the environment just existing. Conservation of mass; the carbon from the CO2 needs to go somewhere.</p>
<p>It's actually a bit of an issue. Humans have freed up and reintroduced a lot of underground carbon to the cycle and we may not physically have enough space to grow enough biomass to suck it all up, not before plants face other limitations on their growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prairie grass restoration is actually a pretty big deal because of this, they store their carbon in roots that can be hundreds of feet into the ground, and they grow much faster than trees do, especially with annual burns. Since so much of their growth is vertical, they more efficiently use their space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'carbon sink' of forests is not in their growth, but in the incomplete decomposition of the each tree when it dies.  Not all of the carbon that went into creating each tree goes back into the air as a lot of the matter will get locked up underground.  The buried dead trees are the coal deposits of 100s of millions of years from now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, but a huge majority of the coal deposits in the ground come from a time before decomposition existed; when trees simply sat on the forest floor until buried under layers of dirt and rock. I do not doubt carbon will still be sequestered but it's going to do so at a significantly slower rate than the distant past. The distant past which was already pretty slow considering it all accumulated over ~60 million years before things evolved to decompose it, and we are on pace to freeing all that up in a couple centuries. Natural forest sequestration would take potentially hundreds of milions of years as it now attempts to sequester in spite of decomposition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short-term, though, reestablishing forests that were lost in the last few hundred years would constitute something if a “sink” in the form of living tree matter.  But of course that has limited capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's obviously both...</p>
<p>If the tree didn't take the carbon out of the air to construct the material of its body in the first place what happened after it died wouldn't matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, a HUGE majority of the general carbon sink in the world comes from oceanic plant life, rather than forest life. Yes, forests make a pretty dang big difference, but at the end of the day, if we wanna suck up a ton more CO2, we want huge algal blooms in the oceans. After all, when they die off, then tend to off-gas less and, whether through predation or through just settling, just fall to the ocean floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, you seem like a great person to ask about plant stuff. Of course ignore this if you don't care or have time.</p>
<p>How do you calculate how much energy a leaf can absorb from light versus how much light is reflected and ends up as waste heat? Also how do you calculate transpiration rate? I assume this can be done based on cultivar possibly by using the Leaf Area Index however I'm at a loss as to who to call to show me how to calculate that or where to find that information online.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. I'm not against paying the right consultant if needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I use a spectrometer for this sort of measurement.</p>

<p>For transpiration rates I'd use a gas exchange chamber and measure the increase in humidity while also measuring CO2.</p>
