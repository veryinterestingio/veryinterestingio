<p>&quot;She says there’s no question that plants are capable of removing volatile chemical toxins from the air “under laboratory conditions.” But in the real world—in your home, say, or in your office space—the notion that incorporating a few plants can purify your air doesn’t have much hard science to back it up.&quot;</p>
<p>I litteraly bought hundreds of plants believing they would help clear the pollution out of my apartment because I live in a a very polluted city in Asian where the sun turns red and you occasionally can't see they house across the street because the pollution is so bad.  They did nothing.  I borrowed a friend's air quality meter to check air quality......  and no amount of plants did anything.  Formaldehyde and a few other chemicals were tested , but they ended up being negligible with our without the plants.  </p>
<p>Particulate matter(pm 2.5) is the real bad guy.  I remember watching a Ted Talk about this guy putting houseplants in his company in India to reduce indoor pollution...  what a joke that guy was. I remember hearing that the leaves need to be cleaned so they can suck in more dust.  Vaccume plants to the rescuen? </p>
<p>Turns out you need high grade HEPA filters that can actually trap pm 2.5  attached to a a good quality air purifier with a strong fan.  I have two large air purifiers 4 smaller air purifiers around the apartment and they do the job.....  most of the time.  I still have the plants....  they hide the view out the window.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They do need to be cleaned, but not because they suck in dust. With a layer of dust coating the leaves the plant cannot properly photosynthesise. </p>
<p>You should take a wet kitchen towel and wipe down any large-leaf plants like monsteras and rubber plants fairly regularly. For the ones with numerous leaves like weeping figs and jade plants a light dusting with a fluffy duster will do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Xiaomi Home Air Purifier Max and the Pro.  </p>
<p>The rest are Philips Ac4025 . Less useful but they were the first ones I bought.   The Xiaomi have built in monitors however they only measure the air in one location and it's best to have a second opinion.   The air monitor I'm currently using and I'm looking at now is...  LeKong Temtop M2000.
Chinese brand...  not sure how easily you can find that anywhere.  Tbh I'm borrowing it to see if the air purifiers at my sons school work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not OP but, I have a Steril-Zone room air purifier. It's a bit pricey, but it has a built in UVC lamp to kill trapped mold/bacteria. The filter material is huge and is rated for ~9000 hrs before replacement. Filters down to .3 micron, and has a carbon filter for odors.</p>
<p>It does not have any fancy screens or app or air quality monitors built in however.</p></div>		</li>
