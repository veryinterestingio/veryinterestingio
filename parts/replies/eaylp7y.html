			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a box called a Mobility Management Entity that keeps track of your nearest cell site so it can page for you. Your phone will periodically connect and do a Tracking Area Update so that it knows roughly where to page for you in addition to it paging the last cell that you connected to to send said update. I think IIRC it's like every few minutes this happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's actually sort of the opposite of how it works. All internet routing, as well as this sort of data routing, uses routers that are configured specifically to come up with the shortest possible route. </p>
<p>So, you send a message, that message has an address to a user. Let's say it's your friend down the street, with the same carrier. It's likely the router at the cell tower will recognize the user's address as being 'local' and one it can route directly to, and while it may go to a local server first, it might also go directly to that phone from that facility. </p>
<p>Now, let's say your grandmother, and on a different carrier. So, the same idea applies, you send it to your tower, and they route directly to a fiber line that connects carriers, and that other carrier immediately pushes the data to her locality's server array, where it'll be routed directly to the tower she's connected to. </p>
<p>The entire point is that it will take as short a trip as algorithmically possible. </p>
<p>Aside from, of course, when a copy is routed to the government to be saved indefinitely, but that's just a copy and doesn't slow your routing down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very likely miles out of the scope of the answer, but, just to be pedantic:</p>
<p>Routers will not always route the most algorithmically efficiently as possible to route a packet. Actually, they frequently won't. </p>
<p>It all depends on their BGP policies in their AS and the MPLS TE applied on their ISP; and lord, with the amount of politics, deals, conditions, etc. That goes into making the decisions that influence those particular routing policies, things can get less than algorithmically most efficient VERY fast </p></div>		</li>

<p>No it doesn't.   That'd be terribly inefficient.   And that'd be asking for a Nationwide SMS outage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. Although light travels at different speeds in different mediums. In air it's nearly the same as in a vacuum, in optic fibre it's about 30% slower. There's also the time for data packets to be sent and received at various switches and devices and parity checking to ensure all data packets are received.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's why going to space isn't a good choice.  Most of the time isn't transmission delay, it's buffers in the processors.  The speed of light over the 6-8 miles to a cell tower is a super small amount of time.</p></div>		</li>
