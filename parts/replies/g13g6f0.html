<p>Commercial substitutes typically only <em>partially</em> replace the NaCl with KCl and usually include a few other things, too, like potassium bitartrate, a.k.a. cream of tartar, which helps offset KCl's clumping tendency. They taste a little different from pure table salt but most find a combination tolerable and it can help <em>substantially</em> with hypokalemia and general K/Na imbalance. Most people aren't near the ideal at all for that (veggies are the most common natural K source), so the usefulness of a salt substitute applies to a pretty wide swath of people.</p>
<p>I personally just buy bulk food-grade chemicals and mix NaCl : K : MSG : potassium bitartrate at roughly 45:45:5:5 and it seems to work pretty well. One batch lasts ages so it's not as weird as it sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was pregnant with my first child, I was severely anemic, and the doctors had me taking giant iron horse pills, and put me on Potassium Salt (why, IDK).<br />
The potassium salt was <em>kinda</em> salty, but more strange tasting than salty...<br />
I just stopped eating junk food and using any salt for cooking or at the table while pregnant...<br />
If I only had the option of potassium salt today, I'd just give up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium Bicarbonate tastes salty, but a bit different. The sodium is definitely a driver in the flavor. The metal portion of the salt is the main flavor piece as this is what binds to your salt receptors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the technical sense, sodium doesn't <em>bind</em> anything. Salty receptor cells have sodium channels that let sodium in the saliva enter the cell, directly depolarizing the cell.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The channel exhibits also sodium selfinhibition at the extracellular aspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was curious about this so looked it up but still don't quite understand why the sodium channel would have a self-inhibitory mechanism. Is this something that only ends up happening when the apical sodium levels are above a certain threshold or what?</p></div>		</li>
