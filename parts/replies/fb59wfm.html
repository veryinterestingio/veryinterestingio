<p>Clean your washer occasionally, and keep the door open when it’s finished.</p>
<p>Also sometimes odors come from people using fabric softener on towels and gym clothes, which makes them retain odors. The vinegar wash will help get rid of that softener coating (as I understand it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fabric softener also builds up in the machine which will give the funk a place to breed there. I find that avoiding it's use and making sure we only use just enough detergent to clean the clothes makes it unnecessary. However, you may not be able to do anything about it if you use a laundromat or communal machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, fabric softeners actually make fabrics(especially towels) less absorbent. They're very hydrophobic(water hating) and adhere strongly to surfaces making them difficult to remove. They make clothing feel soft and fluffy though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question -and I'm not sure if you'll be able to help but your source seems credible enough- I've been looking into sodium carbonate and sodium percarbonate for cleaning thick 100% cotton Kimonos and pants. Think that will do the job, or do you have something else you'd recommend?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, it depends on what stain you're trying to remove. Sodium Carbonate and Sodium Percarbonate are what's in OxiClean. These products are also frequently used in laundry detergents as &quot;builders&quot;. Essentially, it does two things, it raises the pH, making soil removal easier, and the percarbonate is an oxidizer. Oxidizers essentially bleach things. Some, like Sodium Hypochlorite(standard bleach) are such strong oxidizers that they destroy dyes. Other like percarbonate, are very mild and will not damage dyes. Another recommendation, if you have hard water it affects laundry detergents. That's where something like Borax would help more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I chime in with a question too? You said hard water affects the laundry detergent. We have very hard well water. I use vinegar a lot. Is there something else I should be adding to my detergent? Or things I should avoid? Thanks so much for what you've shared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you seem to know a LOT about these things so Ill ask this if you can lay some knowledge on me. I have a lot of black shirts. Washing them kills them. I tried a few things (downey for darks) but basically I just try to not wash them for as long as possible (undershirts and such) - any suggestions on keeping or recovering the black-ness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a reason why sodium carbonate is commonly known as 'washing soda'. I often use it to clean grease stains off my driveway or to make pretzels when I don't have any food grade lye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve looked into all those homemade cleaning solution and I never understood the mixture of Vinegar and Baking Soda or Vinegar and dish soap.</p>
<p>Washer smells are from bacteria and mold which in theory is killed by the low ph acid of vinegar but then why is it still effective when mixed with laundry detergent? Isn’t detergent an alkaline solution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, if the order of addition were correct, it could work. But, you would have to put the vinegar in the fabric softener slot. Because Fabric Softeners would negatively interact with a detergent, modern machines know to dose it after the detergent and a rinse. If the vinegar was dosed after the detergent, you wouldn't get the neutralization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with industrial laundry chemicals for a living and the above person is correct. The other alternative (if your worried about detergent and vinegar mixing) is to run a Rinse and Spin program after your wash cycle and put the vinegar in the door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vinegar (acetic acid) is itself destructive to (in this case smelly) bacteria at a fairly low concentration (eg. 0.25%) which is why a quarter cup in a washer can be enough. The low pH is a bonus. High pH can also kill bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
