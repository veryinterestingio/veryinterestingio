<p>Is this true? My understanding is that the surface of the ocean (which is set as 0m) follows a gravitational equipotential. Picture a large bathtub where the water is perfectly level but the water at one end experiences slightly stronger downward force... That extra force will mean that water from the lower-gravity end rushes to the end with the stronger force until the surface of the water perfectly maps some &quot;contour&quot; of the strength of gravity - ie an equipotential - rather than following any smooth shape.</p>
<p>So most of the changes in gravity comes instead from altitude above sea level, because at sea level the gravity should be nearly perfectly equal (except due to local movement of water, weather, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an awesome remark of which I hadn't thought! I understand clearly what you mean and it's indeed a very reasonable thing to consider. Since I work at the Belgian Meteorological institute with a lot of scientists around me, I'll try to make sure about this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravitational force is the same. But you are subjected to another force, a centrifugal force caused by the spinning of our planet. This force is stronger in the equator, because that is where the earth is spinning faster, and it has the opposite direction of the gravity force acting on you aswel, canceling out a bit of the pull you feel, making you weigh a bit less. If i am not mistaken, the difference is about a pound (from a pole to the equator).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed that centrifugal effect exists and at, say, 6500km from earth's centre the effextive force of gravity is stronger at the poles than the equator.
But, I seem to recall that sea level flows until it balances that effective force (eg only gravity at the poles but gravity - centrifugal force at the equator), so shouldn't the force of gravity <em>at sea level</em> be identical everywhere?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, but the OP question starts &quot;If weight is the measured effect of gravity on an object...&quot;, when actually weight is the measured of gravity <em>plus</em> the centrifugal force.  At the equator, gravity is a bit less and the centrifugal force is a bit more, and they exactly cancel for the reason exohugh describes.  In other words, for a given object, a scale will give the same reading at sea level regardless of latitude.</p></div>		</li>
