			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much.  In ELI5:</p>
<p>Your brain stores all the books you've read (more or less), but there isn't any index.  So if you're asking it to list the books, it might find some that you've read recently, and some that made a big impression on you, but it won't find most of them.  If you give it a list of titles, though, it can look at them and quickly say &quot;yes, I have that one, no, not that one, yes, no, no, yes...&quot;  If you practice remembering the whole list, and do it often, your brain will eventually build an index and make it easier, but most people don't bother doing that, because it isn't something they'll have to do very often.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you don't have any &quot;index&quot; you don't know what to think about to get to the information you want.</p></div>		</li>
