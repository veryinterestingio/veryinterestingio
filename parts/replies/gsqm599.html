			<div class="markdown"><p>however, one has to be very careful to make clear that this is mostly <em>compressive</em> forces .. in other words, engine is pushing against the stack, and thats much easier to bear without squishing, while the same forces if they were <em>tensile</em>, equivalent of say lifting the rocket upside down by grabbing the nozzles, would quickly tear the rocket apart!</p>
<p>yet another way of visualizing whats going on is to think of it like the difference between a bridge pillar vs a bridge beam .. the pillars can easily be made of things like stone as they're just bearing compressive forces, while the beams holding a bridge are much demanding on the materials and need high strength steel to avoid being pulled apart .. the goal in designing lightweight rockets is to try and get as much of the structure in compression as possible as materials to withstand compression are a lot easier to find .. (on the flip side, materials that handle tension well commonly get fashioned into belts and cables, and find use to make e.g. bridge suspension cables, embedded belts in tires, fiber wrapping around pressure vessels etc)</p>
<p>*[And to clarify further, think again of the stone pillar of the bridge.. the stones there might be held together by just cement or in ancient roman ones by nothing at all other than the weight above them .. turning such a bridge upside down would quickly have all the stones come apart .. same with building a rocket .. since we're only mostly dealing with compression, you can get away with much weaker joints and connections which would quickly come apart if weight of the massive rocket were to be hanging on the nozzles rather than just pushing the nozzle onto the rocket]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The materials that make up the most heavily loaded structural components of most - probably all - rockets are going to have essentially the same strength in tension and compression. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110120213410/http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690073000_1969073000.pdf" target="_blank">For example, the Saturn V thrust structure was aluminum (pg. 6-8), either 7075-T6 or 356-T6, both grades that have equal compressive and tensile strengths.</a></p>
<p>Also, the combustion chamber and nozzle(s) - which are under, by far, the highest stress of any components - are experiencing very considerable tensile stresses. Think of the hoop stress in the nozzle, for example, and the pressure in the combustion chamber is tensile loading.</p>
<p>e: Actually, the fact that there is compressive loading is problematic compared to tensile loading because of the resulting need to avoid buckling.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>356 is a cast grade similar to 6061 (primary alloying element being silicon). It is roughly 60% as strong as 7075 with each in their strongest temper.</p>
<p>All aluminums have very similar stiffness, maybe that’s what you’re referring to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean the Space X heavy (SNxx) needs even greater tensile strength to deal with the force of moving from the belly flop position to upward for landing? It feels like there would be massive side stress if it was carrying a heavy load to land on another planet or back on earth. Yes, I realize much of the weight will be gone due to the use of most of the fuel from take off, but carrying 100+ tons, doing a flip and landing seems it would be pretty stressful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't this flip happen with lower gravity and aerodynamic pressure? The forces might not be that great, especially if they don't need to accelerate and decelerate the flip aggressively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just wondering this myself. Iirc SpaceX abandoned plans to built a plane launched Falcon 1 because of the difference in stresses that would occur from hanging a rocket from it's side vs launching it from it's rear.</p>
<p>I was wondering how the whole belly flop plays into that as well, though I suppose to the above point, a bellyflop would be compression from the side vs hanging it would be tension from the side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The capsules have a few tonnes and accelerate at several g, for a total force in the hundreds of kilonewtons. <a href="https://www.apollomaniacs.com/apollo/lese.htm" target="_blank">650 kN for Apollo</a>. That includes the force needed to accelerate the tower itself, which I didn't subtract here.</p>
<p>A kevlar fiber would need a cross section of just ~2 cm^2 to hold that, maybe 3 cm^2 with a larger safety margin. You don't pull your spacecraft on a single fiber, obviously, but in terms of tensile strength it's not that big of an obstacle. Add 50% area if you use steel instead.</p></div>		</li>
