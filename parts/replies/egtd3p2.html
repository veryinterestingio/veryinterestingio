			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to also add there are limits to every step in the development of a drug.</p>
<p>The process of developing a new compound is also a  lot of trial and error. Alot of early drug screening is done with an another known agent then modifying it via computer simulation and testing. This process selects for the &quot;best binding&quot; molecule. </p>
<p>This is a problem because the best may not actually be effective but those are the molecules selected because we don't have any better perameters. This becomes a problem later down the line because the strongest drugs aren't always the most effective. Slight changes in the compounds may lower its binding affinity but increase its absorbance amongst other things! </p>
<p>As we move from computer --&gt; cells --&gt; animals --&gt; clinic trials.  there are so many variables that factor in that cannot be accounted for. </p>
<p>I remember something like 50% of all new drugs, target the same receptors. But all the drugs act slightly differently, so there are likely &quot;off targets&quot; which also interact with the molecules - it's crazy to think about how little we know about the full effects of drugs. Crazier to think that the number of drugs approved every year has been the same - even though we have substantially increased the research behind it! </p></div>		</li>
