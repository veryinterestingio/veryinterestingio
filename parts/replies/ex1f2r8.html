			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally explained this top question to my bf this weekend.  I took in 2 feral kittens friday from under someone's porch and they were in quarantine in a large dog crate with food, water and a litter box. Even though they'd never seen one before they immediately took to using it and he was floored. 5 weeks old and not a single incident outside the box. Then I explained as the only diggable place in the crate.  The trick will be as we start socializing them and letting them explore more and more to make sure they keep using it and not say the laundry basket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will keep using the litter box, as they will try to find it and can smell it. The same thing happened to my kitties. I've even changed up the location of the litter box when I had to quarantine them in the basement for a day and they found it no problem :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my gosh, my 5 month old Ragdoll does this every time he goes! He spends about 3-5 minutes just pawing at the side of the litter box, then hops out! He will also paw at the floor randomly like he's trying to cover something up. I've been wondering why he does this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Because I once left a bucket with small aquarium gravel out. Cat took a piss in it within an hour. So it's really the materialistic availability that does the trick. Also, mine always go on the cleanest box. We have 5 cats and 3 litter boxes.</p></div>		</li>

In multi-cat households any resource should be n+1 spread across the house so that no one resource is guarded by a single cat. Also water bowls should be wide and shallow, ideally glass - or go for a fountain.  Also food, water and litter trays should be in separate areas..</p></div>		</li>

<p>YMMV. My last cat would hardly drink out of bowls at all, we tried several different types, glass, plastic, metal and ceramic and tried placing the water bowl in different places away from her food, even outside, but she wouldn't touch it. She wouldn't even go near a fountain.  </p>
<p>Eventually I found the only thing that would work for her is a tall cup or glass that she could get her head down into. I ended up using a large paper cup sitting in a heavy mug so she couldn't knock it over easily.</p></div>		</li>
