			<div class="markdown"><p>How do scientists determine the antibody response of breakthrough cases?  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7021e3.htm" target="_blank">When the CDC was tracking all breakthrough cases,</a> they determined 10% were hospitalized and 2% died.  Those numbers seem extraordinarily close to the hospitalization and death rates of unvaccinated cases from the numbers I could find.</p>
<p>With that being said, wouldn’t we expect the rate of those hospitalizations and deaths to be less if individuals that had breakthrough cases were generating an antibody response?  From a layman, like myself, it seems as though if you catch Covid after being vaccinated that your body had no response to the vaccine.  Any insight into this would be greatly appreciated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The population of my region is more than 60% vaccinated with at least one dose. To back your statement up, only ~20% of covid hospitalizations are vaccinated, and only ~1% is doubly vaccinated.</p>
<p>This means that &lt;40% of the population is ~80% of covid hospitalizations!</p>
<p>Unvaccinated people are showing up in the hospital nearly 3 or 4 times more often than single dose vaccinated people, assuming all other factors are equal.</p>
<p>After you've had a double dose, you could expect approximately 100 unvaccinated people to show up in hospital before you do.</p>
<p>My region collects and publishes detailed statistics that strongly show that breakthrough cases are uncommon, and that when they do occur, the symptoms are mild enough not to require hospitalization.</p>
<p>Right now we have daily new cases that are almost as low as pre-pandemic data (this region had the fortune of setting up tracking infrastructure <em>before</em> cases reached it). And &gt;40% of new cases are delta variant, likely owing to its ability to affect people with incomplete vaccination.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but the percentage of vaccinated people that experience a breakthrough was 0.1%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is not meaning to come off as the vaccine not preventing cases. It is questioning how we can tell there is any antibody response at all in breakthrough cases if, after getting covid, the hospitalization and deaths rate are similar in the vaccinated vs unvaccinated population. I hope that clears up the question on my side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The numbers you've quoted are correlated to hospitalization, but some were actually asymptomatic and hospitalized for independent reasons. If we instead count only the people that were hospitalized for conditions related to covid 19 the numbers drop.</p>
<p>Taking the data from your reference above, 6.9% of breakthrough cases were hospitalized for reasons relating to covid, and only 1.3% died for reasons related to covid.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting the age cohort, in the study above on breakthrough cases the median age of hospitalization was 58, and the median age of death was 82. This is older than the general population being hospitalized for covid. Comparing to like age groups, we find that the rate of hospitalization and death is drastically lower for vaccinated people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jeez I wrote a long answer before I read yours. I agree with you, and saw that the median age was 82. It seems they also attempt to properly account for asymptomatic positives dying for other reasons but, as with the pandemic #’s, this is imperfect at best and I’m not sure how they could publish this conclusion beyond the certain presentation of these numbers.
Furthermore, I’m confused. MRNA has stated that their vax is 100% effective vs severe infection or hospitalization (NVAX claims the same over a wider variety of variants). Are all these people dosed by PFE?
Just kidding but...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good question. AFAIK right now, there is limited research into the antibody response of breakthrough cases. From what I know, however, I would say the antibody response is limited as you guessed yourself. There are many causes of breakthrough cases, but I won't go further into them (unless you want me to). I fear the JnJ vaccine may be the source of many breakthrough cases, but I don't want to just say it outright without data in front of me. </p>
<p>However, the actual 10% and 2% numbers aren't quite accurate. They're closer to 6% and 1.2% because there were patients that were asymptomatic/were hospitalized for a different reason. In addition, these numbers are subject to intense bias. The bulk of identified cases were because the people had symptoms. It may be that the majority of vaccinated individuals were asymptomatic upon covid infection so they didn't go for a test. It's representative of those who got sick after receiving the vaccine, not representative of all vaccinated individuals.</p>
<p>What I would focus more on is the drastic reduction in covid cases and hospitalizations over the past 6 months. There were no real additional health measures put into place other than vaccinations, so there is a very high likelihood the reduction in cases is due to vaccinations. </p>
<p>As a little aside, vaccines aren't a magic shield that protects 100% against a virus. They train your body to recognize the virus and attack it before it gets too bad. If your body is already weak, then it doesn't matter how many vaccines are pumped into you - you're not going to produce a good immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or generating non-neutralizing antibodies in high titers in the absence of infection, then following subsequent infection with vaccine escape mutant (delta mutant per say), metabolic resources further taxed. Creates a scenario for one of the two mechanisms for antibody dependent enhancement to occur. Dengue is a solid example of what happens next.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not so sure about that... For example in many countries right now the number of Covid cases is extremely low... However, they were similarly low in many countries last summer, when there was no vaccination (also no lockdown, restaurants were open, etc.).</p>
<p>So the low rates over the past few months can equally be attributed to seasonal swings, not vaccination, no? With surges in the winter, decrease in numbers in the summer, and climbing again in the fall.</p></div>		</li>
