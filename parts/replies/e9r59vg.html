			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is there such a large stink about plastic pollution and very little on glass/ceramics?</p>
<p>Would we have the same stink about glass/ceramics if they were as durable as plastic on a per use basis? Thereby increasing the volume of manufactured glass/ceramic goods?  e.g., tupperware containers can be dropped and not shatter whereas glass does. So because of that fact, we just happened to produce a shitload of plastic instead of the other two?</p>
<p>genuine question btw</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fun hypothetical to me. I don’t really call it a conspiracy theory because it’s something nobody knows. But thinking about the graph where the X axis is how many years ago and the Y axis is how advanced a species was, and where the line is that we would be able to detect them, and the things we would look at to detect them, is fun. And yes I know “advanced” is an impossible thing to pin down but that’s part of the fun.</p>
<p>A Neanderthal-level species 200MYA? I don’t think there’s any way we could know. 1MYA? 500KYA?</p>
<p>There are two possibilities and they’re both strange. Maybe we are the first sentient species on earth. That’s strange because there has been life for millions of years, and it just pops up now? The other possibility is that there have been other species, but the strange (or scary) thing is that they aren’t around now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There might be ways to tell. Humans are rather anomalous in the brain size to body size ratio, so a fossil with a similar anomaly might be weak evidence. Fossilized bones with signs of tool-induced damage can be another kind of clue. It would really come down to lucky finds, however.</p>
<p>If we are talking about a civilization of our level and scale, then that would be clearly detectable across hundreds of millions of years, since we are essentially an extinction level event on the biosphere coupled with a global, unnatural redistribution of all sorts of chemicals and minerals. It would be a sharp strata delineation not unlike the K-T boundary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you be able to distinguish the sharp strata delineation of a anthropogenic climate change like event from a major asteroid impact?  The resolution of rocks from 65MYA isn't terribly high.  I mean - at that distance, wouldn't huge catastrophic things that happened over the course of a hundred years seems pretty similar to huge catastrophic things that happened over the course of a few hours?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take Göbekli Tepe for instance. The biggest megalithic structure on earth, but it was built 12000 ago, before agriculture was even invented yet. Some of the stones weigh in at over 10 tons and pillars over 60 tons. Lots of ornately carved stones and figures of high quality animals. This thing is bigger in scale then stone henge and the pyramids.</p>
<p>This structure would have had to have been built by hundreds of hunters and gatherers, with lots and lots of organization and construction skills. Not to mention this was built right at the end of the last ice age. Food should have been scarce and people should have been following herds of animals not settling down yet.</p>
<p>Maybe structures like these are proof there was civilizations with advanced construction methods before 12,000 years ago. Maybe some sort of catastrophe happened, and only a few survive, paying on only the skills they deemed most important to groups of hunters and gatherers in the area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok - so let's take the civilization component out of it. Modern humans lived for a long time with very low levels of technological development. They could have easily been snuffed out as a species by some catastrophe or simply been outcompeted before advancing. In the huge scope of the planet's history...is it more likely than not that intelligent beings like us evolved and then disappeared without living a trace or that we're the first example of such development in Earth's history?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have absolutely no way to know. How likely or unlikely intelligence is to evolve is pure guesswork as we have only seen it once. </p>
<p>This is in fact an important point of discussions on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter" target="_blank">Great Filter</a>: Or appears intelligent, space-faring civilisations are unlikely. Otherwise we would have seen them by now. So which step is the unlikely one: Any life forming? Complex life forming? Intelligence? Surviving what we are now? Building spaceships?</p>
<p>If it is one of the first, we made it and are special. If it is one of the last, we are probably not special and likely go extinct &quot;soon&quot;.</p>
<p>So far, it looks reasonably good for us as the solar system seems to be devoid of life. So life forming seems at least to not be overly likely. Then again Earth is by far the best place in the solar system to form life as we know it.</p>
<p>Edit: That means finding evidence of ancient non-human societies would be bad news as would be finding any life outside earth. Both would eliminate one of the &quot;good&quot; explanations for rare intelligent life more advanced than us. The worst news would be evidence of civilisations at a similar level as us on other planets of course. Receiving something like someone else's <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message" target="_blank">Arecibo message</a> would be a bad sign. If reaching our level of technology is common but it is extremely rare to advance any further, we are in trouble. Probably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the Great Filter/fermi's paradox never set right with me because it seems like it makes a lot of assumptions about what an advanced civilization would be like based off of a sample size of one, and a relatively primitive one at that considering what's theoretically possible. One of the major assumptions is that an advanced civilization would spread out as fast as they can or populate to the point of needing the energy of an entire star, or even that they would have our same level of curiosity that makes us want to seek out other worlds. </p>
<p>Another assumption they make is that we are doing a good job of looking for intelligent life. It may be the case there  is some galaxy-wide FTL communication network that advanced civilizations tap into once they develop the technology and we are still looking for the equivalent of smoke signals, as in radio signals, that are only used for a brief few centuries before better technology is developed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure the analogy to extraterrestrial intelligent life is perfect. In that case, we're wondering about the likelihood of life forming and then the likelihood of intelligent life forming. In the ancient intelligence thought experiment, we know complex life was there. So it's more a question of how far down the intelligence lane might it have gone. In the end, we can't know and probably don't understand enough to really guess that well...but it's interesting to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how you define it there are currently 3-4 different genus lines that exhibit notable intelligence.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Great apes: most of the great apes demonstrate language, social structure, and some tool use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pachyderms: elephants also use language, have complex social structures, and are capable of tool use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cetaceans: Many whales and dolphins demonstrate all of the above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corvids: ravens and crows have some form of social structure, experiments indicate that they have a fairly complex language, and they demonstrate fairly complicated tool use and problem solving skills.</p>
</li>
<li>Cephalopods: just look up some of the crap that octopodes get up to in aquariums.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean we don't have any perfect evidence but looking at how far we can see back on the planet it becomes more and more difficult. We can tell you the types of creatures that existed when the oceans were first created. If something existed with these creatures in droves then how come they were never fossilized but others were?</p>
<p>I recommend looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_evolutionary_history_of_life</a> which really gives you a challenge as to how one could imagine a world where a secret civilization somehow started before us or somehow advanced before us. Basically to the point for the conspiracy to make sense, they had to advance so far that they could actually undo the damage they caused by advancing. Removing things like glass and etc. Basically easier to just make a new planet at that point. Which then you could just say okay billions of years ago a very highly technical civilization or being(s) set in motion the events to create our planet. So basically a god civilization?</p>
<p>So if this is somehow the case what does it matter? They, at this point are either bored of us or so advanced that we will only ever see or realize them because they want us to. Thus the only reason this information already exists is because they are messing with us.</p>
<p>Best just move along with your day. Hope you get the memo if they build a highway through the solar system.</p></div>		</li>
