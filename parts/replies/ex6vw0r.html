I have normal eyes and do a lot of work where you need to see fine details in very confined spaces (usually exactly like your scenario, where you can't position your head to see clearly) and closing one eye helps because it &quot;turns off&quot; the signal from the closed eye so instead of trying to combine two images where the object you're looking at may be obstructed in only one image, by shutting off the obstructed view, you can focus on the clear view more easily.</p></div>		</li>
