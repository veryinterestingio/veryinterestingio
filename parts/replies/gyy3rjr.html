			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic answer.  I feel like this question and answer should be sent to anyone who doesn't understand science as it so perfectly encapsulates the process of questions, observations, and analysis that give us everything we have and know today.  No matter how complicated something is, it all started with these kinds of simple questions and observations!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just pointing out the periodic table is an organization of elements based on their electron structure therefore their chemical properties. Since increased electrons need increased protons to be neutral you get increased masses. The electron structure is the important part of the tablex and it allows you to deduce electron actions. For example the elements on the left are more willing to give up electrons in chemical reactions in order to achieve a more stable configuration. While the elements on the far right are more willing to gain electrons to go to a more stable configurations. As you get to the transition metals, the increased electron structure and complexities give rise to more different patterns of electrons.</p></div>		</li>
