			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Ants do know that storms are coming but the exact mechanism for detecting storms is still being explored in various species.  </p>
<p>I actually am currently working on ants living in the Florida Keys and hurricanes are of interest  but most of my work is more oriented towards the long-term effects (community-scale changes over years) but this is actually a topic I've played around with a bit as a side project at various points in my career. I've seen the same sort of thing before storms show up in coastal marshes and temperate forests and tropical jungles. Ants definitely have some indication that the weather is changing but exactly what they detect is a question that is still being explored  </p>
<p>For example, there is some older work focused on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25085325.pdf?casa_token=F2WpT955UbIAAAAA:_KC1DWqal4tr_xL9l5jB4y52RlK-iNdWWZttn015rw9cmmt7t2d58SLQJHndnjoUxwq2ooecixvksv-n2x2oGMxwASapRNb9neLkLTip7DWa2ud1Vfw" target="_blank">ant responses to electric fields</a> which suggests at the very least that they can detect changes in electric potential though whether that's sensitive enough to detect changes in atmospheric electricity is questionable (a quick aside but some of my colleagues work on the impacts of lightning in forests including insect response so this is something we may know more about in the future). <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/eth.12967?casa_token=8M5khQ0ZrAUAAAAA:TLgMfJf54PjDOeECs8uvmt8rxgKMyTlMn6Jkp0ma5oq22jp_xgx6wTVytUQnmVqf21L9svKSPdAvRw" target="_blank">A paper from earlier this year</a> also showed that leaf cutting ants respond to changes in barometric pressure. There is a lot of work exploring how ants respond to changes and <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00442-017-3825-4.pdf" target="_blank">temperature</a> and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063363" target="_blank">humidity</a> that is indirectly linked to weather events like storms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for your reply and the links! This is really fascinating to me. I lived in Florida for awhile and that's where I noticed the ants disappearing. I think it's pretty incredible how they can sense storms (maybe in multiple ways?). It does make sense that ants would be in tune to something like that to maximize the number that survive any flooding. I know some ants make rafts with their bodies to survive in water, in which case they'd need to be able to assemble the troops together before a flood hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, your expertise would be appreciated! Trying to identify these ants is driving me insane.  I have minuscule (&lt; 1 mm) all red, or all black, house ants. So small that I don’t notice or see them moving unless my eyes are a few inches from the counter top!  ( good vision )
I think there too small to be pharaoh ants?  GTS with no obvious match, any guesses?  Location- Central Coast, CA</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed last year in southern CA a major increase in the presence of an ant called <a href="https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Brachymyrmex_patagonicus" target="_blank">Brachymyrmex patagonicus</a>. They are an invasive ant that is pretty small but I'm not sure it would be as small as you're describing. Possibly some species of <a href="https://www.antwiki.org/wiki/Wasmannia" target="_blank">tropical fire ants (Wasmannia)</a>? It's important to keep in mind that there are &gt;14,000 species of ants (to put that in perspective there are \~6,000 species of mammals ranging from humans to dolphins to dogs and kangaroos) and many of the species-level diagnostic characters are incredibly minute and precise including features like the number of hairs on top of an ants head and the number of teeth along a mandible. This is probably the best I could do without an actual specimen and a nice scope and even then most of my work in the last half a decade has been in the neotropics so I'm a bit rusty on temperate ant identification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your reply!!
Im seriously laughing right now, without realising it, my description was 4th grade, at best, serious layman’s terms man!!  I can’t believe I pulled a
“describes a rash over the phone” scenario.  Truth is, it was late, I wanted a midnight snack, grabbed a plum and ate half of it before... well, i’m sure you know where this is going....! So I was up on Reddit trying not to puke when I stumbled upon this gem of a thread!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for doing this AMAnts! I drove to a different state yesterday and found an ant in my car when I got there, so I flicked it into the woods. What happened to that ant? Does he find a new colony? Spend the rest of his days searching for his old family? Eat some picnic and just vibe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She will unfortunately probably die off pretty quickly. Ants are highly social (eusociality is a diagnostic character for the family) and as a general rule basically fail to survive on their own. Without her colony, she won't last very long. There are some exceptions to this rule, the most notable are probably the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/99/9/6075.full.pdf" target="_blank">super colonies of Argentine ants</a> which will readily accept other individuals Argentine ants from all over the world if they are also part of that particular super colony group.</p></div>		</li>
