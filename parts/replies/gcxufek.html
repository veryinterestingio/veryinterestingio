			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is some overlap between molecular engineering and synthetic or molecular biology, molecular engineering encompasses so much more. Molecular engineering is related to any type of molecule whether that be small molecules, polymers, or biologically relevant systems. Applications are very diverse ranging from molecules for energy harvesting, energy storage, photonics, quantum materials, drug delivery, etc. etc. The application areas are endless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't necessarily different! In fact lots of people in the UW Molecular Engineering Ph.D. program are doing synthetic biology.  And you could think of molecular biology as providing the theoretical and experimental foundation for the systems-level engineering work done in synthetic biology.</p></div>		</li>
