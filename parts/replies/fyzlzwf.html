			<div class="markdown"><p>You're on the right track here. I don't remember the order, but it is definitely due to how the tendons in your hand are arranged. Though I might have to disagree on the &quot;pinky moving other fingers the most&quot; part. Try holding your fingers straight up and touching them one at a time to your palm. You'll probably notice that when you move your middle finger down, it actually moves the tendons for your index and ring closer to the middle of your hand and tightens them both up as well. Personally, if I close just my index finger, it moves all of the rest as well, where my pinky only moves my ring finger. Like I said, I can't remember exactly, but your ring finger and I THINK your middle are connected in such a way that you're pretty much physically incapable of closing your ring finger without moving the middle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right, I should clarify, your pinky moves the other fingers the most, in a way that is the hardest to resist. I can bend my other fingers in a way that doesn’t move the others as much. Failing that, I can at least use a surface or my other hand to help hold them in place, but there’s not much you can do to only bend your pinky.</p></div>		</li>
