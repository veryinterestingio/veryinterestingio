			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point you bring up that nobody else touched on.</p>
<p>However, I also move my body differently when listening to music of different &quot;sounds&quot; even when alone - I don't headbang when listening to, say, Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto, but I absolutely headbang to Raining Blood.</p>
<p>Could it be conditioned response, or could it be because one form of music is much more &quot;punctuated&quot; and less smooth than the other, making us want to move with the &quot;beat?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. I was listening to A Tooth For An Eye yesterday... Immediately started dancing very differently on my own. The percussion is much more... Tribal and aggressive than what I was listening to before. Don't know whether it's conditioned or automatic but the percussion is a huge influence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it triggers a part of our brain that we use for &quot;fighting as a group&quot; along with chanting, banging on things, and yelling. The overemphasized percussion and raw emotional vocals of rock and metal relate well to the hooting and shouting of a fight or before a fight, while the  sound of classical relates more to the sounds of nature and natural speech</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up going to rock shows: 5FDP, 3DG, Shinedown, breaking Benjamin, etc. It's a lot of head banging, thrashing, jumping, fist pumping.. And not usually alot of people on drugs. Alcohol, sure, but not drugs.</p>
<p>EDM on the other hand-- you've got two types of people at those shows. Those who love drugs and those who love music. Just about everyone is 'swaying', 'bouncing' dancing in a way I've never seen before. Ive always described it as people &quot;worming around&quot;.</p>
<p>And the people on drugs worm around the most. Edm shows have really cool graphics and light shows, so people like to drop lsd, but usually MDMA. Edm music feels really good on Molly. And you can usually tell whose on Molly because they are dancing in ways you didn't know your body was able to move. </p></div>		</li>
