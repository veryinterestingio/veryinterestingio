<p>And is there a big difference between hand cooled and the way they do it? Or is it just to work it how you need it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: /u/preesi corrected my history. Originally I said that a chemical company created Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing. I was wrong, a couple created Ranch dressing and sold it in packets that had to be mixed with mayo and butter milk. However, Clorox worked with the Hidden Valley company and created a shelf stable version by removing the buttermilk and finding a shelf stable emulsifier which replaced the mayo (mayo's emulsifier is egg yolks.) Clorox later became the main manufacturer of Hidden Valley Ranch.</p>
<p>ORIGINAL POST BELOW:
Random aside: the reason most Americans know of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing instead of the brands is that the chemical company that created Hidden Valley was the first to find a shelf stable replacement for egg yolks as an emulsifier in ranch dressing. Hence, Hidden Valley became synonymous with ranch dressing (for some people.)</p>
<p>Modified corn starch is the egg yolk replacement btw.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No chemical company invented it. It was invented by a plumber and his wife in the 50s, it became Hidden Valley.</p>
<p>Hidden Valley Ranch invented Ranch. Original ranch is a dry packet you add mayo and milk to.</p>
<p>The Mayo, Milk and packet emulsified it.</p>
<p>Just use the packet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One study on mice using two synthetic emulsifiers (polysorbate-80 and carboxymethylcellusoe) doesn't exactly mean there is consensus that all emulsifiers (as indicated by your comment) &quot;compromise your stomach lining.&quot; That's the result of bad journalism being echoed in the blogosphere and social media. In fact, the study in question (unless there is other research I'm not aware of, which could certainly be the case) shows that <em>some</em> emulsifiers can behave as detergents, causing bacteria to cross the mucus membrane. It's not a problem with emulsifiers in general so much as it is with these specific chemicals. Egg yolks, for example, are a common emulsifier. And even in the case of that study, there's only a correlative link, not a casual link. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be hesitant to do the actual chocolate tempering part with sous vide though because melted chocolate and water should NEVER mix (unless you're making ganache or other confection), and this just seems prone to water accidents.</p>
<p>However, there's a better way if you're okay with a less &quot;pure&quot; method that ends up adding extra cocoa butter: <a href="http://chocolatealchemy.com/how-to-temper-with-silk" target="_blank">silk</a>! It's basically tempered cocoa butter, and all you have to do is stir it in while the chocolate is cooling and let it work its magic. Even better, if you have cocoa butter, you can turn it into silk with sous vide. Or, you can use silk to make more silk from raw cocoa butter. Either way, cocoa butter won't seize if you accidentally introduce water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that, you can pasteurize chicken at a lower temperature (I like 140F-145F) by holding it long enough, so you don't need to cook it to 165F which causes all the muscle fibers to squeeze the moisture out.</p></div>		</li>
