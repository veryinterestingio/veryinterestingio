<p>I don't see why you feel the need to attack video games on that issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than 40% of the US population are gamers? Doubt it. </p>
<p>I mean, gamer is a hard metric to pin down. Lots of people play games, I play some from time to time, but I’m definitely not a “gamer.” Also id say I’m probably in a demographic that would be conducive to having lots of gamers in my life, and I would definitely not say that 40% of the people I know are gamers. Maybe 10%.</p>
<p>There are definitely more obese people in the US than gamers.</p>
<p>And remember obese doesn’t mean 400lbs, if you look up the requirements, it applies to a shit ton of people who are at an unhealthy weight</p></div>		</li>
