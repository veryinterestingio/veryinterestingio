			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had 2 knee surgeries on the same leg and cartilage removed. Our scar tissue takes up room and makes us more sensitive to the tissue/fluid expansion during low air pressure drops due to rain. The cold is more of a tightening of everything because of the contraction to keep the body warm, which again affects people with previous surgeries/scar tissue moreso. I wake up some mornings with my knee not feeling like it wants to straighten all the way, this usually happens after a night of rain and a temp drop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also if you have any metal surgical implants, a rapid change in pressure/temperature such as from meteorological events can cause minute changes in shape or size that lead to soreness or pain.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a solar flare event in the 1800s, I believe, that extended into earth atmosphere. It was insane. Metal nails were heating up until fences caught fire. Telephone poles exploded. Metal everywhere on the planet, affected by the flare, burned red hot because of electromagnetism and other sorcery.</p>
<p>Now imagine surgical implants.</p>
<p>We cannot predict a solar flare [of that magnitude again] with enough time to..well we cannot do anything.</p>
<p>Sleep well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fortunately most implants are titanium, not iron, so they shouldn't be quite as susceptible to large-scale magnetic anomalies.  People with implants should be able to wield a rifle and hold off the lawless hordes after solar flares trigger an economic apocalypse just as well as meat-bodies can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, body is full of metal.  Bad weather fucking sucks.  Well, any change in pressure more than a few dozen
millibars too quickly, really.  TX at the end of summer is brutal.</p>
<p>Cold weather, too -- when it's really cold, the metal &quot;feels&quot; colder, in that it's more noticeable.  And when I warm up my skin quickly, I can still feel cold metal inside.  Odd feeling, but mostly centered around my right ankle.</p>
<p>(plate/pins in lower back [L2-L3], plate/screws in right hip, plate/screws in right femur, screws in both knees, 3D printed metal bone scaffold in/over/part of right tibia, plates/screws/pins in my right ankle)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. When it rains the water in the air captures and absorbs a lot of the pollen, dust, and smog that floats around in the air and forces it back to ground level. So after it rains the air is literally cleaner. </p>
<p>Having asthma and iving in Arizona where we get a lot of dust and smog, it smells great right after rain, and I can breathe better as well.</p></div>		</li>
