			<div class="markdown"><p>2,000 hertz is the frequency of a double high C, quite a bit higher than most trained sopranos can sing. That is the lower bound of your 'human speech' range. The typical human scream is nowhere near that range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Nowhere near&quot; is a bit overblown. While the fundamental isn't even close to 2 kHz, many harmonics of speech are found in that 2 - 4 kHz range. Telephone systems wouldn't waste bandwidth on unnecessary frequencies if they could, yet typically have a passband of around 300 Hz - 3 kHz, as it makes speech easier to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No doubt harmonics range that high, even higher on essentially all human speech. In musical terms however, double high C is a perfect fifth above F6, which is often described as the highest note a soprano can hit. Thatâ€™s a 2:3 ratio in frequency, which seems like a huge gulf to me. Harmonics range into the kHz for even the lowest notes, so including those means nearly every sound covers that range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have your frequencies right. Human speech is composed of many frequencies, including those much higher than a soprano could sing as a pure note. </p>
<p>For example the 't' 'k' 'p' sounds in speech consonants are around 3000hz, and our ears are therefore sensitive to those frequencies. If you get noise induced hearing loss (from too many loud concerts or working a noisy job) you can lose the ability to hear these frequencies properly, which can make hearing speech difficult, which is why you have to speak slowly and clearly sometimes to elderly people.</p>
<p>Sounds which are unpleasant can be rich in these frequencies. They can also contain frequencies which cause something in your head or body to resonate which can even be painful. Because we're all built slightly differently, we can find different sounds annoying. For one person a sound can cause a pleasant resonant ringing but for another who happens to be more sensitive to the particular frequencies in that sound, it can be so intense as to cause pain.</p>
<p>There are many components, some psychological, in how we subjectively perceive sound and noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to google, the fundamental tone of speech is between 85 and 180 Hz. The spectrum of a scream (the only one I could quickly find on google) peaked at a little less than 1000 Hz. I don't think this explanation is correct.</p>
<p>The ear is simply most sensitive to the 2k and 4k range. I don't think this fully explains it, though, as there are other sounds in that range that don't cause the same reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's much more to a voice than the fundamental tone. Much of speech does reside up to 4000 Hz and that's how different voices are distinguished</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. I am still very skeptical about this explanation though. There are many other sounds with similar frequencies that do not have the same effect on people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are fundementals. Human apeech spans up into the top of the spectrum. The &quot;bite&quot; of your voice is in the 2-4k range</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh ok. That's wierd. I was always told it's because it has the same frequency as a scream. Guess not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be, but as far as I know, that's just a hypothesis which hasn't been tested. I think the most honest answer would be &quot;no one knows for sure&quot;</p></div>		</li>
