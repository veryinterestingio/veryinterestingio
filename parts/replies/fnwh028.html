			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be like trying to get directions from someone from 200 years ago. The concepts of miles and cardinal directions are the same, so the game mostly works. However at some point that person tells you to turn left at the horse buggy factory and you have no idea what they are talking about, and the game crashes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot of scenarios, but it likely doesn’t do what you want it to do and throws errors behind the scenes.  Apps have the power to catch errors but continue and that behavior can be inconsistent based on the type of exceptions being thrown which changes based on hardware or operating system updates</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because, while that's a good explanation, it's not really that simple. You might have a game that was designed to interact with a particular operating system version, and makes assumptions about the functionality that the OS will make available to the game. Now let's say we're two major versions away. Operating systems tend to preserve some backwards compatibility, and things that work well won't necessarily be rewritten between versions. So maybe 90% of the functionality that the game expects to be available is there, but when it hits something that uses the 10% that's no longer compatible it crashes. Or maybe the game was designed to take advantage of a feature in order to improve performance, and will still run if it isn't there, but will run more slowly even on newer hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry to say I can't point you to a singular source. This is a fairly well understood phenomena, the technicalities of which become self evident through foundational knowledge of IT systems.</p>
<p>However, the basic idea of Backward-Compatibility is the general 'solution' to solve the very issue presented by OP. I would suggest you start your search there, as it will likely branch out into the areas your interested in.</p></div>		</li>
