<p>Nose and ear hair would surely be immune system things, acting as filters, right? I reckon there’d be a survival advantage to not being knocked on your ass with recurring ear infections in a time before frequent bathing in clean, treated water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weirdly enough, I had a phase where I had almost no beard hair,  but MPB had already begun on my head. Later I surmised that I had probably also had a zinc deficiency, but even with zinc supplements, while my hair looks shinier now, it's still falling out. But I'm not completely bald yet and my beard looks better now.</p></div>		</li>
