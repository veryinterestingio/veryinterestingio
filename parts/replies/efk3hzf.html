			<div class="markdown"><p>For concepts or objects that come from other cultures, Chinese will also sometimes use loanwords, choosing characters that sound like the word from another language but are nonsensical otherwise. For example, 咖啡 ka-fei coffee, 沙发 sha-fa sofa, and 巴士 ba-shi bus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And those loanwords are limited by what complete syllables exist in Chinese, so they are often verrrry loose transliterations. Also those characters carry meanings so they have to make sure the transliteration has a favorable meaning in Chinese. The result is they tend to care more about that meaning and the words end up being like new invented words in Chinese that have a loose basis on the pronunciation of the foreign word it’s “loaned” from </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The transliteration doesn't necessarily have a positive meaning in Chinese. That only happens with company names and products. Most transliterations just sound like complete nonsense.</p>
<p>To be fair, transliterations into English have the same restrictions. If a sound doesn't exist in English, it'll change when a word is loaned over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best loan words are the ones that are definitely from another country but not at all what another country calls the thing.</p>
<p>Autobike is a great one in Korean. That's motorcycle. For every silly word like this, my Korean teachers would blame the Japanese for doing it first. Lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The system the Chinese use for writing logographically is also similar in Korean Hanja. North Korean tends to use non-western loan words while South Korea uses Western ones.</p>
<p>So instead of telephone you get electric speech machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's not uncommon to have all three in the same sentence. The logographic system, kanji, consists of borrowed Chinese characters and is used to write most &quot;content words&quot;. The phonetic hiragana are used mainly for grammatical words, particles, and conjugation, as well as some content words that happen to not have a common kanji representation. Occasionally you'll even have the Roman alphabet added in as a fourth script (called romaji), so you can see sentences like 花子はあのビルで働いているOLです = &quot;Hanako is an office lady working in that building&quot;. Going word by word, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>花子, &quot;Hanako&quot;, kanji</li>
<li>は, a grammatical particle indicating that Hanako is the topic of the sentence, hiragana</li>
<li>あの, &quot;that&quot;, hiragana</li>
<li>ビル, &quot;building&quot;, katakana (phonetically &quot;biru&quot;, contracted to just the first syllable &quot;buil&quot; and adjusted to fit Japanese phonetics)</li>
<li>で, &quot;at&quot;, hiragana</li>
<li>働いている &quot;working&quot;, one kanji followed by some hiragana characters for conjugation</li>
<li>OL, &quot;office lady&quot;, romaji</li>
<li>です, a word linking the subject to its description in a similar way to the English word &quot;is&quot;, hiragana</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese is weird. I can read hiragana and katankana, and I know a modest number of kanji. I don't always know how the kanji are pronounced in context. And even when Roman letters are used for abbreviations, I'm not always sure of the meaning. By consequence, I can meet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text that I understand and can pronounce</li>
<li>Text that I understand but can't pronounce</li>
<li>Text that I can pronounce but don't understand</li>
<li>Text that means nothing to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly the last one.</p></div>		</li>
