			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was in a band in the studio, we played one take as a band with a metronome playing. From there, all the instruments were played and recorded individually with a metronome. Then as the vocalist, I would sing with just the music through the headphones. Metronome wasn't needed with everything else on time.</p></div>		</li>
