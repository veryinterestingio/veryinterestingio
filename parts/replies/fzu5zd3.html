			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses are like spores or sperm - they're engineered for maximum distribution but very low success rates. They're a chemical box with DNA and a few molecule tools stuffed inside. They don't contain any extra machinery for self-repair, because creating that machinery would take more energy compared to just making a ridiculous number of backups.</p>
<p>If you scour literature I'm sure you'll find an exception to that principle, since biology doesn't deal in absolutes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, take a look at giant viruses like mimiviruses. Their genomes can be over a megabase in size and code for over 1000 genes! They’re not well characterized at all but they’re a really fascinating example of how diverse and complex organic <em>things</em> (since they’re not actually organic life) can be</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. Once the virus is disabled it’s down for the count. Part of why a virus shouldn’t be considered alive is they have no metabolism. They can’t reproduce, repair, or do general life stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually a lot like popping a balloon—or, more accurately, ripping out pieces of a lincoln log filled with pressurized spaghetti and meatballs and watching it all fall down. Viruses are <em>packed</em> with DNA (or RNA), and they’re under a lot of pressure. Alcohol works so well because it dissolves the barrier like a tide pod in water. But just like a tide pod—which dissolves in water but not latent humidity or your hand’s perspiration—a virus needs a certain <em>concentration</em> of alcohol to realistically wiped out on a surface or in a liquid. Those numbers vary by application, but make sure you hand sanitizer is at least 60% alcohol for reliable cleaning, although many are 70-90 percent alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, and this is I swear this is true, 70% alcohol is more effective than 95% alcohol.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm referring to the commonly used Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)</p>
<p>Say you had one bottle each, of 70% and 95% alcohol, the 70% would be a better choice.</p>
<p>When you use 95% alcohol, the outer layer of the bacteria/virus 'dries' (technically : coagulates/denatures) so fast that it kinda forms a protective layer.<br />
Think rusting but instead of flaking, it forms a protective layer. So the remaining amount of alcohol can't enter the cell properly to kill it.</p>
<p>70% IPA on the other hand, is just the right balance to let the outer layer get damaged, allow the alcohol inside and cause lysis (or breakdown) from within.</p>
<p>Also higher concentrations of IPA tend to evaporate rapidly, and thus may be less effective.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any source to back that up?
Not saying you are wrong, I'm just curios.</p>
<p>I have for e.g. one desinfectant with 99% and afaik it's the best.
It is: bactericide (including listeria and salmonella), yeasticide, tuberculocide (mycobacterium terrae), limited virucide (enveloped viruses), virucide (enveloped and non-enveloped viruses)
Talking about Sterillium virugard, and as I said, I think that's one of the best (also in Germany listed on RKI which lists only &quot;real-tested-good stuff&quot; so to say) because it works against almost everything. This is also used in Hospitals for doctors and surgeon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote that comment from my memory of a lecture in med school.</p>
<p>However,  I did find a source that you may find satisfactory:  <a href="https://labproinc.com/blog/chemicals-and-solvents-9/post/the-difference-between-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-99-and-70-25" target="_blank">https://labproinc.com/blog/chemicals-and-solvents-9/post/the-difference-between-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-99-and-70-25</a></p>
<p>Also, I'm sceptical if you're truly using 99%IPA as a disinfectant, because it's mostly used as an industrial solvent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If we discover viruses on Mars, should we not consider that we found life on another planet?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cell technically isn’t necessary if replication can happen as part of the environment. We don’t know how he first viruses formed, but it’s possible that self-replicating RNA predates cellular life. If there is liquid water below the surface of Mars that is warm and nutrient rich, you could have simple RNA molecules which code for a few proteins that replicate the RNA. I would call that a virus, even if it still isn’t necessarily alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finding virus on Mars would indicate life on Mars, because viruses can’t exist or multiply without cellular life to hijack. But I don’t believe finding viruses on Mars means we found life there. Viruses are absolutely in a grey space, but they don’t meet pretty much all the criteria for life. Cells, metabolism, self replication/reproduction.</p></div>		</li>
