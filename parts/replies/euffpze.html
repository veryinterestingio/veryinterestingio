			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be higher. I studied linguistic anthropology in college and a big part of the course was spent discussing how language is separate from communication. It occurs in humans, too. Universally, humans share the same facial expressions, laugh when they're happy, scream when scared, yawn when tired, make the same noises when in pain, etc. That's what non-linguistic communication is. It's also almost entirely how animals communicate. Some animals can be trained to learn some language skills, like Koko the gorilla, but because their language doesn't self perpetuate or create novel ideas, it doesn't qualify. It's like how a dog can learn to respond to specific commands with specific behaviors, but they're not going to go teach those commands to other dogs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a note, there is actually a lot of doubt about the abilities that Koko really had. Essentially everything reported about Koko's ability to use sign language came from her handler, and there was very little real science or oversight on the process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criticism from some scientists centered on the fact that while publications often appeared in the popular press about Koko, scientific publications with substantial data were fewer in number.[40][41][42] Other researchers argued that Koko did not understand the meaning behind what she was doing and learned to complete the signs simply because the researchers rewarded her for doing so (indicating that her actions were the product of operant conditioning).[43][44] Another concern that has been raised about Koko's ability to express coherent thoughts through signs is that interpretation of the gorilla's conversation was left to the handler, who may have seen improbable concatenations of signs as meaningful. For example, when Koko signed &quot;sad&quot; there was no way to tell whether she meant it with the connotation of &quot;How sad&quot;. Following Patterson's initial publications in 1978, a series of critical evaluations of her reports of signing behavior in great apes argued that video evidence suggested that Koko was simply being prompted by her trainers' unconscious cues to display specific signs, in what is commonly called the Clever Hans effect.[45][46][47][48][38][49]</p>

<p>For further clarification, the two main disqualifying factors of why animals don't have language are these:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Language is learned and self-perpetuates. An animal raised conpletely separate from others of its kind still makes the same communicative noises. A person raised in isolation still makes the same universal human gestures, but will lose the capacity for language if too much time passes. Parents teach their children language and it is specifically inherited. Japanese people raise Japanese speaking kids, and those kids will never spontaneously start speaking another language. There was once a scientist who sent children to be raised in isolation with a mute mother figure who believed that the babies would spontaneously start speaking Hebrew. They didn't. </p>
</li>
<li>Language relies on a set of building blocks which can be arranged in new ways to create new ideas. English hasn't changed significantly in the past 100 years, yet look at how much new vocabulary there is - especially in relation to technology. Airplanes, spacheships, astronauts, smartphones, facebook, nanomachines, Xbox, WiiMote, iPad, etc. These are all specific things with specific language surrounding them that all just... Developed. Animal communication can't come close to equaling that.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re mostly on point, except in assuming no other animal can use language. We are unable to understand what a whale or dolphin or elephant or parrot or well anything is trying to communicate. Thus, we can’t say if they are communicating abstract ideas, future plans, reciting a poem, or babbling. </p>
<p>It would be more accurate to say we have not seen concrete evidence that other animals can use language as humans can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the way language is posited (like lying for example) makes direct evidence really difficult. It may even be that we accept only a definition of language that matches what humans do. Even if not, we are seeing how animals use reasoning and abstract thought far beyond what we thought just twenty years ago. So who knows, just about every other hard line between animals and humans has had to be reconsidered, perhaps this one will too.</p></div>		</li>
