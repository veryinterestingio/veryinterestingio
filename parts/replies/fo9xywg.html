<p>Like, if I 'strum' the teeth of a comb the noise is very quiet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, the frequency of a cricket chirp is between 2kHz-8kHz which sits nicely in the peak zone of the Fletcher Munson curve, i.e. human hearing is more sensitive to the range of frequencies they chirp at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because compared to a cricket, the teeth on a comb are huge, so the frequency is much lower. You could get a much louder sound simply dragging sweaty hands across a tabletop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's kind of my point, to make such a loud sound I need (relatively) big hands and a big table, yet a tiny cricket can produce a sound of a similar loudness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The teeth of a comb aren't designed to be amplified, and they are made of soft plastic, not a stiff material. Basically everything about a comb absorbs the energy of the bristles. When you amplify high pitched sounds they can carry for a very long distance, since we are sensitive to them. A harmonica for example, is very small, but can cover a radius magnitudes larger than itself. Another example would be a phonograph, able to take &lt;mm variations in disk depth and turn it into music loud enough to be heard. They use their wings as an amplifier, like a horn, while they strum their noisemaking teeth. Because of resonance and the shape of their wings while they strum, the resulting noise has a lot more power than expected.</p></div>		</li>
