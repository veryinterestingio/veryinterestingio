			<div class="markdown"><p>I had 10 years of heavy alcohol addiction. Much of my (mis)using was to prevent the onset of the fear, which if you think is bad when you haven't actually done anything wrong, is crippling when you're compounding years' worth of alcohol-fuelled behaviour. </p>
<p>I remember having the fear really badly and decided to take pyschedilics for the first time. My idea: if I endure the worst fear/experience of my life, then it'll never be as bad as that again. Ended up having the worst fear/experience of my life. Took me a few more months to finally surrender and get sober. Fwiw I'm the happiest I've ever been now.</p></div>		</li>
