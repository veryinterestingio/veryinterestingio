			<div class="markdown"><p>It really has to do with oxidation and reduction, which is when one atom steals an electron from another.  This depends on electronegativity, and oxygen is the second most electronegative element behind fluorine.  As an aside, to really bake your josh-noodles, fire didn't even exist on Earth until about the time of the great oxygenation, making fire a relatively recent thing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but oxygen can be pretty rough on the delicate balance you need for life. Fluorine is even more reactive, so it would probably be an even tougher environment to evolve in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/Kradget pointed out, fluorine is VERY reactive with a lot of things. Oxygen is reactive, too, but much less than fluorine. Also, our air is only like 20% oxygen. Even too much oxygen can be bad. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4925834/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4925834/</a></p>
<p>People like to theorize about the different interesting ways life might form, but the reality is that there are many very good reasons why life evolved the way it did with what it uses. For example, carbon and silicon are very similar for these purposes, but just being similar isn't enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be difficult - fluorine tends to form strong bonds.  For example, once fluorine is bound to carbon, very few things can release it, possibly only temperature and radiation.</p>
<p>The high end plastic lab bottles are made of fluorinated plastics - basically whereever the plastic would have had hydrogen, it's been replaced with fluorine, and these bottles can tolerate almost any substance in contact with them without any degradation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why doesn't fluorine form a strong bond with itself if it tends to with other elements? I assume it's because of electronegativity differences something something... Also, is there some reasoning one can use to understand why eg oxygen forms stronger bonds with itself than fluorine? My understanding of chemistry is at a basic level, but love this discussion! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Oxygen&lt;Chlorine&lt;Fluorine.</p>
<p>And then there are lovely chemicals where people have bound oxygen and/or chlorine and/or Fluorine with each other...</p>
<p>Some of those chemicals are lovely things that can 'burn' materials like, sand, asbestos, and react violently (Either spontaneously catching fire or exploding) with most materials one might find in the world, including all known safety equipment and organic matter. </p>
<p>Here is a wonderful video of a chemical called 'Chlorine trifluoride' because what could be better then just chlorine or fluorine other then adding 3 fluorines to one chlorine. they just love being together! /s</p>

<p>This <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time" target="_blank">description</a> of chlorine trifluoride, quoted in the same series as the FOOF article u/aeschenkarnos posted,  is priceless:</p>
<p>&quot;It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that’s the least of the problem. It is hypergolic [i.e. spontaneously ignites] with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and <strong>test engineers</strong>, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water―with which it reacts explosively.&quot;</p>
<p>His recommended safety equipment is &quot;a good pair of running shoes.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
