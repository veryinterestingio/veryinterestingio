			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a great explanation, well if its accurate. This might be out of your realm of expertise but do you know why some people get migraines if they don’t go to the bathroom for a while? Or why your nose starts dripping when you stay up late?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Migraines and constipation:
The short answer is a drop in serotonin levels. Most people think of mood and depression when they hear serotonin, but there is actually more serotonin activity in the enteric nervous system, aka in the gut, than in the brain. It is thought that drops in levels of serotonin are a direct cause of constipation as serotonin is a regulating neurotransmitter in the nervous system in the gut. Less serotonin = less neural activity in the gut = less or more difficult vowel movements.
Serotonin also does play a big role as a neurotransmitter in the brain; when those levels drop, headaches can occur as serotonin receptors go unfilled by serotonin and brain signaling is effected. This is the same reason caffeine headaches can occur - caffeine bonds to adenosine receptors and increases the number of receptors. Lack of caffeine = receptors going unfilled = the brain not signaling as it is used to. </p>
<p>Constipation and headaches are consequences of the same situation instead of one causing the other. That said, straining on the toilet can lead to an increase in tension headaches as muscles tighten and blood pressure increases. </p>
<p>Runny nose when staying up late:
Histamine. This may sound familiar in anti-allergy meds “anti-histamines.” Histamines are a chemical released by our immune systems in response to inflammation, but is also a key neurotransmitter in the sleep-wake cycle. The brain releases histamine to wake us up from sleep or to keep us awake when we really should be sleeping but we’re fighting it. This is why allergy pills can make folks so drowsy; they block histamines from the inflammation response to an allergen. If the runny nose is a debilitating problem and sleep isn’t an option, non-drowsy histamine blocking allergy pills may help. OTC allergy meds have been shown to increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease due to their effects on other neurotransmitters however, so use with caution.</p></div>		</li>
