<p>Without wet markets, China would probably roll back several decades, to a time when they were facing huge issues with famine &amp; starvation, simply because food would become scarce.</p>

<p>So then how do we realistically prevent this in the future? I imagine 50 years ago this would have been contained but in a global market and economy itâ€™s only time before a virus that is as lethal as SARS and MERS but with a more significant spread (as we are seeing with this) happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't the wet markets selling mostly wild animals? No way are their enough wild animals in China to significantly add to the amount of food a billion people eat. No. Way. At. All. </p>
<p>Also, whether wild or bred in captivity, the same animals could be killed in a sanitary slaughterhouse and refrigerated to get to the marketplace. Nobody in China is going to suffer because the meat they eat was dead before being sold. Plus the news articles about the wet markets claim it's the wealthier people there wanting wild game meat.</p>
<p>My ancestors lived off the land, right here in the US, back before WWII. Hunting was always a strong family tradition. But that doesn't mean I have an unassailable right to kill wildlife. Or to create global pandemics because of my feels about tradition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wet markets are farmed animals that are usually found in the wild. It would take a lot of money and many people would suffer if the system was changed. Wet markets exist because wild animals were raised to provide food during the great leap forward. There wasn't enough of other animals to feed the population, and ~50m people died. The wild animals fed a significant part of the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the thinking about why wet markets are so important to their food supply? Isn't it reasonable for them to shift to slaughterhouses for these animals where things can be made more sanitary and then brought to more sanitary markets in place of these?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the food supply. Wet markets became popular back when people had very few opportunities. The Chinese government funded a lot of ways people provided for themselves. Wild animals being one of them, it allowed anyone to basically get a small income.</p>
<p>Nowadays it's more of a commodity and the animals are used as fancy meat and medicine / luxury goods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm not convinced the wet markets are THAT huge a source of calories for a population that big, animals just don't reproduce on that level outside domestication.  But.  Assuming OP to be correct, every stage of safety added to animal slaughter adds cost.  And the reason people resort to non-domesticated protein sources is primarily cost.  Catching and maybe spending a little time raising/fattening an animal then immediately slaughtering it before purchase is cheap.  Running it through a sanitized and refrigerated slaughter house, packaging it, and maintaining refrigeration until it's sold is expensive.  That would price most of the people using these wet markets out of any meat at all.</p></div>		</li>
