<p>Some things cannot be adequately explained at the level a 5 year old can understand.</p>
<p>The better way to think of the sub is explanations for people who do not have background knowledge in a subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another real-world limitation: time and dates.</p>
<p>Many systems store time internally as the number of seconds that have passed since January 1, 1970. With a 32-bit system, the largest date you could represent like that would be January 19, 2038, which is a large motivating factor for changing to 64-bit systems. If we didn’t, in 2038 many systems would basically think that we time-traveled back to the 70’s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those wondering how long it would theoretically take for 64-bit systems time counters to overflow (assuming they use all 64 bits), 2^64 -1 seconds (minus one because computer counting starts at 0, so an <del>16</del> 8 bit variable has 256 possible values from 0 to 255) is greater than 584 billion years.</p>
<p>However, the practical application is a bit more complicated, due to backwards and cross compatibility issues and whatnot. See <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem</a></p>
<p>Edit: 16 bit to 8 bit (thank you u/noodles_jd)</p>
<p>Edit: as u/WoodenBottle pointed out, the date variable is a signed integer (first bit is used to determine whether the value is positive or negative), so the maximum value for a 64-bit system would actually be 2^63 -1, or 292 billion years and change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  It's not that hard to emulate 64-bit integer data on a 32-bit system using software.  There are 64-bit types (long long etc.) that work on a 32-bit OS.  And the default integer type on most 64-bit systems is still 32 bits wide.  Programmers have always been allowed to pick the size of integers they wanted (generally from 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits).</p>
<p>Address space is a different story, since the number of bits is built directly into the hardware - the number of physical wires that connect the CPU and memory system.  Programmers don't get a choice of how many bits there are in &quot;int *&quot;.</p>
<p>P.S. I'm ELI'm16 here, so no nitpicking for lack of details please.  I know it's a lot more complicated than this.  X-D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not true, actually. 32bit vs 64bit is the size of the memory <em>address</em> (and instructions and registers) not the size of the memory that address points to (usually 8 bits). You can easily store 64 bit data by using 8 1-byte memory addresses, independent of the size of the address. The main limitation is that a 32 bit system can’t process a 64 bit value in a single instruction, meaning dealing with larger values is more computationally expensive.</p></div>		</li>
