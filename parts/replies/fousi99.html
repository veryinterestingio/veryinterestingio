			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that NASA could keep such a thing a secret, even if they wanted to, is one that exists solely in science fiction.</p>
<p>The reason we know about all the asteroids and comets we do is because NASA publicly shares that data. Even those that may pose a threat to us in the future are listed, with the realistic chances of an impact (all chances are low to extremely low, by the way). They have also posted everything they know about ones that were detected prior to entering the atmosphere. I believe there have been two of those(?). </p>
<p>The reality is, numerous astronomical surveys around the world gather observations of asteroids, and feed that data into NASA &amp; ESA databases. Amateur astronomers also make observations. It would be impossible to keep an impending impact a secret. </p>
<p>As astronomer Katie Mack said on Twitter in early March: &quot;The way you can tell if a near-Earth object is actually something to pay attention to at all is if all the astronomers on your feed are LOUDLY OBSESSING ABOUT IT CONSTANTLY. If you have to link us to the Daily Express and ask us if it’s real, it’s not real.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now thats funny.  Every other day with them an Asteroid is going to hit the Planet.  If it was actually true there would be a bunch of scared folks that day using that crap newspaper to shield the sun from their eyes so they could see the asteroid! </p>
<p>Here is my question.  How long after being ejected from a star or planet can a meteor continue to off gas such as Oumuamua?</p></div>		</li>
