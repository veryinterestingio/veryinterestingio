			<div class="markdown"><p>If you start looking, you'll find them. Just check around any large glassy buildings. As part of our local Safe Passage program, I coordinate volunteers twice a year to survey several buildings in the area for bird collisions, and in November and June my freezer is always packed with bird corpses. Often I think about how much more full my freezer would be if scavenging rates weren't so high (as mentioned by /u/pompousrompus below). <a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=321492&amp;Lab=NHEERL" target="_blank">Here's a cool paper on it</a> (only a Master's thesis, but still one of the first papers out there measuring scavenging rates for birds!)</p>

<p>PS don't start wandering around grabbing birds, you need permits for that since they're federally protected! I'm subpermitted under the museum curator at the local university, which is where the birds go after we're done surveying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a glass building and was always amazed by how many birds and bats would fly into the building. Especially bats.  It was always a heart clencher when I would hear the pings on the window, but a good majority of them would be fine and fly away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The major killer of birds tend to be cats and they'll eat them</p></div>		</li>
