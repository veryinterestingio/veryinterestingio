			<div class="markdown"><p>Sum frequency generation is a 2nd order non-linear process, so any material that on a microscopic scale doesn't have reflection symmetry will work (ie. if the mirror image doesn't look the same). Naturally, you'd also want it to transmit both of those wavelengths.</p>
<p>The efficiency of the process will depend on just how asymmetric the material is and also the speed of propagation of the UV, IR, and visible wavelengths in the material, but is generally an extremely inefficient process unless you design the material and tune the wavelengths particularly for maximizing this effect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow, so you are actually heterodyning the waves, kind of.<br />
Like those weird combination tones you hear when you play, say, 1000Hz and 1440Hz. Because of nonlinearities in the ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback on this, you don't even need to combine UV and IR to generate visible light. You can do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-harmonic_generation" target="_blank">second harmonic generation</a> on IR light (this is what happens in pretty much all green laser pointers) or the inverse half harmonic process on UV.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Frequency doubled 1064 Nd:YAG into 532nm green is a possible route to that.</p>
<p>Most laser pointers are dirt-cheap laser diodes though.  It's quite a bit more efficient (they can be like 50% efficient, though the cheap ones won't be), and lets you do it in one step.  Otherwise you need electricity -&gt; xenon/krypton flashlamp -&gt; Nd:YAG -&gt; frequency doubling, with some significant efficiency loss at each step.</p>
<p>Fun edit: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/G/dp/B01ITK4PEO/" target="_blank">Here's some green laser diodes for $0.50 each</a>.  Good luck even getting a BBO crystal alone for a fraction of that price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In case you're still interested, I didn't really see any answers that cut to the core of how sum and difference frequency generation or second-harmonic generation actually work.</p>
<p>The 'second order nonlinearity' people are talking about just means that your material produces an electric field in response to an applied electric field, and that a component of the produced field has a magnitude that is the square of the magnitude of the applied field.</p>
<p>If you plot out what happens to a sine wave (or the sum of two sines) when you square them, then hopefully the reason you get these optical effects is a lot clearer. I made some graphs here: <a href="https://imgur.com/xtSPgVs" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/xtSPgVs" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/xtSPgVs</a></a>.</p>
<p>Crossing two lasers in free space just gets the sum of the two sines (aka interference), but only in the region where they cross. This does give you the exact same result as for acoustic waves overlapping, i.e. you generate a beat note (or difference frequency) in the intensity. Measuring the frequency of this beat note is a useful way of tuning or measuring wavelength. It's usually quite fast though, so can't be seen by eye - you could use a photodetector and an oscillioscope to see it.</p>
<p>Adding a material that's actually emitting its own oscillating field means that the produced beams can carry on outside the material, which is easier to observe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a completely different mechanism compared to acoustic beats. Acoustic beats are a purely linear phenomenon. The mechanism behind beats can be derived from the angle addition and difference formulas, so it appears in any wavelike phenomenon. If done with light the result should be a frequency intermediate to the inputs that appears and disappears. However it would require coherent inputs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP did specify lasers.</p>
<p>I know with sound it's already been done to use two ultrasonic beams to create a 'ghost voice' only where they cross at a distance, eg in a crowd.</p>
<p>I wonder if there are practical light wavelengths that could be used? Although wouldn't you just get a dot of colour in mid air? With a lot of control I guess you might be able to get a free space image or hologram though. I bet the UV laser power required would be through the roof and blinding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ghost voice thing is yet another phenomena. That one does it by modulating an intense ultrasonic carrier with amplitude modulated regular audio so that when it hits a surface the natural nonlinearities in the interface leads to spontaneous demodulation of the carrier.</p>
<p>If you wanted an optical analog you'd need to blast an extremely powerful laser amplitude modulated at visible light frequencies (read: not possible). And if you hit a point in space with two different lasers that individually aren't strong enough to act extremely non linearly in free space, the EM field strength at that point will be a combination of the two lasers and you might get spontaneous demodulation/nonlinearities.</p>
<p>I may have heard something about high energy lasers causing nonlinearities in air, let me check and I'll get back</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amusingly, I think you would get ionized air long before you manage any kind of interesting nonlinear effect.  You'd need to do that in vacuum, I think.</p>
<p>... Unless you're okay with your holographic image being black and white and made out of exploding air.  Then we should be able to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid answer.</p>
<p>As a bit of extra background: a significant fraction of all applied and experimental optics is linear (or close enough to). This means that optical elements (lenses, mirrors, optical fiber etc) can be treated as black box operations that apply to each input light completely separately, and in a way that is independent of intensity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, nonlinear optics does not behave this way and is a lot more complicated to work out and experimentally implement. However, nonlinear optics is incredibly powerful, allowing for relatively common applications (green laser pointers) as well as cutting edge scientific tools (optical frequency combs, optical amplifiers, four-wave mixing, single-photon switching, etc. Etc.Etc.)</p>
<p>There are two general ways of achieving nonlinear interaction: in a bulk material with appropriate chemical and material properties, by which a strong electric field is able to perturb the distribution of charge on the scale of the optical wavelength. This in turn affects the way that another electric field interacts with the bulk material.</p>
<p>Alternatively, coherent nonlinear imteraction can be achieved in atoms or molecules with long lived states and strong optical transitions. Here, multiple optical fields can interact if they match up with the various transitions in the atom (or molecule). In this case one light field can be used to 'switch off' atomic interaction with the other by essentially keeping all the atoms busy with its own transition.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can produce light resonant with a particular optical transition if you can find the right chain of transitions between states that allows you to push atomic population into the higher of the two energy levels. By allowing it (or forcing it) to decay down to the lower of the two states you can generate that colour light using a set of different coloured light to start with.</p>
<p>Hope that we interesting and not too complicated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parametric downconversion is the same as difference frequency generation, except that there is only one input, at frequency f1, rather than two. </p>
<p>There's a very slight probablement that photons at frequency f1 get split into two daughter photons, whose frequency satisfy the condition f2+f3 = f1. </p>
<p>Those photons are correlated in a very peculiar way. In fact, they are a resource of entanglement in many degrees of freedom, such as polarization, space/momentum and frequency/time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parametric downconversion and DFG are the same thing.  </p>
<p><em>Spontaneous</em> parametric down-conversion, which is where quantum optics comes in, is the same thing but without the second beam.  With probability about 1*10^-8 you can split a single photon into two lower-energy photons in a properly-designed crystal.  This is how a lot of people (including me) make &quot;single photons&quot; for use in quantum experiments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you want to know? Lithium Niobate when used in spontaneous parametric down-conversion is usually &quot;domain engineered&quot;, meaning it's periodically inverted in order to flip the momentum mismatch, and through this one can achieve much better phase matching over longer crystals (called quasi phase matching) and as a result stronger interactions. It's also used quite a bit in waveguides, as LN is quite a nice material for this, and you can generate photons at telecom. For bulk single photon sources ppKTP is used more though.</p></div>		</li>
