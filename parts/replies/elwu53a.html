			<div class="markdown"><p>Some needed clarification from Wikipedia, </p>
<p>&quot;A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not &quot;guesses&quot; but reliable accounts of the real world.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it's &quot;theory&quot; in the same way evolution is theory. There is an ass ton of scientific (geophysical) evidence collected from independent sources that support this theory. Of course it's not certain, but that's the nature of science. Things are pretty well never certain, but that's doesn't mean we should doubt them with no evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Edit: lol fixed geophysical..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised. While tectonic plate theory is fairly well supported, much of geology still doesn't have the rigorous testing and evidence of evolution or relativity or quantum mechanics. Our deepest holes get about halfway into Earth's crust, anything below that is only known through extrapolated data from seismographs and similar instruments. Changes occur very slowly (famously in geological time) and the only &quot;experiments&quot; we can really do are with computer models because we only have one planet to work with. Where there's lots of certainty in physics and chemistry and biology where we can relatively easily observe the subject matter, there are still many mysteries and assumptions being made in the field of geology. In a way it's similar to psychology in that regard. Yes we're lightyears away from ignorance but the answers don't come nearly as easily or concretely as those other fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except we can't easily observe the subject matter in any of those fields and we have to use extrapolation as much or more. We can't see molecules in chemistry or see how or why they interact, so we guess based on the start, the end, and what we know about other reactions. We still don't have mechanisms for many. We can see cells, but we can't observe the human body as it's working in many cases. Which is why we don't understand nutrition well and constantly dispute it. Physics is too broad for me to cover all of it, but it's basically the same as the other two. Basically, all field of science are loaded with uncertainty. Certainty is for engineering. And we achieve it by lowering the bar on how certain we have to be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not true, we have many mantle xenoliths that came from below the crust and got spat up by a volcano. This is the only way we get diamonds too btw, the pressure needed to form them is far too great to form anywhere in the crust. </p>
<p>Although not from Earth’s interior, we also have many meteorite samples which are iron-nickel, indicating that (1) iron is abundant in our solar system, and (2) it is entirely possible for it to be concentrated into a fairly pure iron content by natural processes in the solar system. </p>
<p>It’s a fair assumption to say that these are products of early planetary accretion and that gravitational differentiation concentrated iron in planetary cores - and that we have no reason to believe Earth is any different, particularly when our magnetic field and the density of the core both agree with this. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the only &quot;experiments&quot; we can really do are with computer models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can do experiments on the aforementioned mantle xenoliths. There are also experimental petrologists who work with synthetic rock preparations to constrain phase boundaries and such - these are still very much real experiments that exist in the physical world and not just in a computer. </p>

<p>Yes, this is true of all sciences. </p>

<p>Don’t ever say that around a geoscientist if you want to keep your limbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I'd be less surprised than you think. Of course we don't have the ability to drill to the core. That's why we use geophysics. Yeah there's uncertainty when you perform waveform inversion, but not so much that we aren't pretty damned sure about what's down there. I mean we're not even completely sure whats under most buildings when we build them, but we're close enough (usually) so it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>I think I have a pretty good grasp on the annoying amount of uncertainty in geomaterials with a bachelor's in geology and geophysics, masters in geotechnical engineering, some time as a practicing engineer and most of a PhD in Geotechnical earthquake engineering.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it? I honestly did not know that. I though we knew for certain what Earth's core is.</p>
<p>Edit: just to add, I am aware we have never been there. I just meant that with what we know about the planet, I thought we were pretty certain about the composition of Earth's core. I didn't know there was any doubt about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My knowledge of this hypothesis (though usually with Theia as the giant impactor, I hadn't heard of it being an asteroid) says that the two cores combined, which might explain why Earth's core is seemingly much larger than expected. I don't think it makes sense for two cores to roll around inside the Earth and create friction like that instead of combining together to make a larger core.</p>
<p>It sounds like one of those woo &quot;alternative science&quot; ramblings.</p></div>		</li>
