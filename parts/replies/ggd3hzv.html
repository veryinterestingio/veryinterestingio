			<div class="markdown"><p>Not my field, but I'd assume everything before actively coding. E.g. character design, plotting story. Depending how detailed you want to get, you could also write all the dialog, record voices, compose music, and build 3D models. None of those things are strictly dependent on how the game is coded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is clear from even 2018 they did not have story down. Given the visual style probably a shit ton of art work. Bugs aside the game is stunning in a way GTA or other games just arent. GTA/RDR etc are all heavily grounded in real world architecture and SRIV had some sci fi elements but not nearly on par with Cyberpunk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concept work. It's where a lot of the general idea of the game gets made. What's the &quot;gist&quot; of the game. You make some art assets to get a feel for the look of the game but very little coding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each studio has a different definition, but generally the idea is to have all teams be able to confidently staff up and start producing the content for the game. Each group has a slightly different focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design - Core gameplay loops and systems demonstrable, either in prototype engine or in draft. Story outline to inform character style, writing, and environment creation.</li>
<li>Engineering - Core production tools and technologies in a usable state for the content teams (environment art, character art, animation, UI, audio, VFX, etc.). Ideally at least one sample of every asset has been run through a tools pipeline. </li>
<li>Art - Samples of environments, characters, animations, audio, VFX (ideally built using the prototype tools).</li>
<li>Production - Schedule, budget, and staffing plan for creation of the engine, assets, and testing roadmap.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
