			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this;</p>
<p>Tornadic destruction isn’t just due to direct wind damage but also pressure changes in structures. Tornadoes have extremely low pressure which, combined with the direct external winds, will obliterate structures of any type. See the schools in Moore or the hospital in Joplin.</p>
<p>Also, Ive lived in tornado alley all my life, 39 years, and never had a tornado threaten my home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. But it wasn’t meant to say Ill never have to deal with, a tornado hit the town north of us just last week and they hit around us all the time, but to address that indeed, you can years even decades and never be hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Had 2 close calls in Arkansas but never close enough to do major damage. 1/4 mile away though was a line of total devastation...doesn’t matter if your in a concrete building if you get a direct hit because it’s probably throwing a buildings worth of debris around at high speed to hit you with anyways.</p>
<p>The difference between a near miss and hit are huge and fortunately most people just aren’t unlucky enough to experience a direct hit in their lifetimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I maintain that a direct hit from a tornado is more destructive than any other weather phenomenon. (Unless you count volcanos weather. It’s hard to compete with boiling rocks.) Hurricanes do more total damage because they hit a wider area and can flood entire cities. But if you look at those flooded neighborhoods the houses are still <em>mostly</em> there, just not livable for humans. A tornado will remove your entire house from the foundations, sit half of it down across the street, and scatter the rest across the county in pieces.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I live in the western part of Denver, and everytime a tornado alert goes out everybody goes out into the street or onto their balconies to check out the clouds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I grew up just a couple hours away in Central AR (Conway) and I've never seen a tornado either. I've seen their paths of destruction (Maumelle, Vilonia), but never seen one with my own eyes.</p></div>		</li>
