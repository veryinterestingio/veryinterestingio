			<div class="markdown"><p>As always you will gain weight if you take in more calories than burning. I had no problem drinking calorie-dense shakes, mine where 500kcal in a 500ml bottle. I would drink 5-6 of these each day with a normal activity (no sport)... boom, there is your weight.   </p>
<p>I just really enjoyed drinking that stuff, that certainly helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which meal replacement shakes did you use cos none of the ones I tried ever did much. I only gained weight eating high calorie heavy meals 4-5 times a day and I went up 7 kilos but couldn't go beyond that. And I lost it all so fast once I got tired of forcing myself to eat so much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had YFood, but i don't think there is any magic in any specific product (although i liked the taste of that one which of course helps drinking the required amount). You either take in more than you burn or you don't, it's a simple as that. In your example you stopped eating and you burned it all away again. If they didn't do much, you probably didn't drink enough. If you struggle with calorie absorption that might be more than expected, but otherwise it's the same as eating, with the exception that fluids are easier to digest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't say the same.
I drank 3 bottles of huel each day in addition to breakfast lunch and dinner which were 3000+ kcal a day. I did this for half a year and gained almost nothing. Maybe 5 kilos at most.
The thing is I would do almost nothing other than eating, drinking huel and processing it.
I stopped doing it and, suprise suprise. Almost nothing changed. Im always hovering at 65 kilos at 1. 76m height.
I had more energy throughout the day, but i also got tired very fast especially at lunch time.
Also drinking these meal replacements all the time gets disgusting after a while</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, it's easy to underestimate how much exercise you do too.  I always thought I had a fast metabolism, and like you, bragged about being able to eat whatever I want.</p>
<p>Unlike you, my calorie intake <em>was</em> huge.  But then over the pandemic, without changing my eating habits, I put on four stone in a year.  It turns out I don't have a fast metabolism, I just underestimated how much I burnt off cycling, which I stopped during the pandemic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or eating a little. My mom insists she doesn't eat a lot and doesn't know why she isn't losing weight but I clearly see she eats so much crap that she can be happy she isn't actually gaining weight.</p></div>		</li>
