			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that this is was the strategy of some insects but we had -20Â° days here for 2 weeks straight and the ground was frozen 2 ft deep. Even the lake was frozen 2 ft down. I didn't figure insects that burrowed less than 2 ft would be able to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A  big compost heap, for exemple, produces enough heat not to freeze even when the ground freezes. I'm from Canada as well, and I used to keep my compost going through the winter. Snow would pile up on it, trapping the heat inside, and it would not freeze. We would dig it out once a week to put stuff in there, and then bury it back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that similar to the igloo concept?</p>
<p>Ice is cold but also, it's a really good insulator.
That plus decomposition would make it sustainably warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great example of this would be hay bales in a field.  They get quite warm inside even in the middle of winter.</p></div>		</li>
