			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true!</p>
<p>I should point out that I believe this is just a coincidence.  The conversion number from miles to km (1.609) just happens to be very <del>very</del> close to the golden ratio (<del>1.608</del> 1.618).  This was not by design.  They didn't use the golden ratio to help define miles from km (or vice versa).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder sometimes if it is coincidence. Is there some other measuring system humans have devised for a purpose (in this case, distance) that matches the sequence? Are we as hard-wired to create the pattern in our measuring as other organisms who use it, whether trees or mollusks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a neat coincidence that's really interesting, but practically speaking it's easier just to multiply by 1.6.  It's just as close an estimate, and easier to apply to arbitrary numbers than trying to find fibonacci sums to describe them with.</p>
<p>I.e. if you ask me how many kilometers 200 miles is, it's way easier for me to multiply that and say it's about 320 km, than it is for me to find a bunch of fibonacci numbers that add up to 200 and then add up their next-in-sequence numbers.</p></div>		</li>
