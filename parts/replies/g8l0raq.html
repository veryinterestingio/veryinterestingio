			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned it from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/louie/comments/258p0e/does_anyone_have_the_full_quote_about_spines_in/chet4ap/" target="_blank">Louie</a></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bigelow:</strong> What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>Louie:</strong> Uh, well, I hurt my back today really bad. Uh. Can you help me with my back? I mean...</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bigelow:</strong> What's wrong with your back?</p>
<p><strong>Louie:</strong> It hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bigelow:</strong> My professional diagnosis is your back hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Louie:</strong> Well, what can I do about it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bigelow:</strong> Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Louie:</strong> Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bigelow:</strong> The problem is you're using it wrong. The back isn't done evolving yet. You see, the spine is a row of vertebrae. It was designed to be horizontal. Then people came along and used it vertical. Wasn't meant for that. So the disks get all floppy, swollen. Pop out left, pop out right. It'll take another. I'd say 20,000 years to get straightened out. Till then, it's going to keep hurting.</p>
<p><strong>Louie:</strong> So that's it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bigelow:</strong> It's an engineering design problem. It's a misallocation. We were given a clothesline and we're using it as
a flagpole.</p>
<p><strong>Louie:</strong> So what should I do?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bigelow:</strong> Use your back as it was intended. Walk around on your hands and feet. Or accept the fact that your back is going to hurt sometimes. Be very grateful for the moments that it doesn't. Every second spent without back pain is a lucky second. String enough of those lucky seconds together, you have a lucky minute.</p>
<p><strong>Louie:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bigelow:</strong> Come see me when you have something fun
like a blood disease. That's what I went to school for.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That one had me stumped for a while. We have a hills hoist clothesline, one of those ones with a single pole in the centre and it rotates around. Basically looks like a flag pole with horizontal bars and rope coming off it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, you'd be better off just <a href="https://youtu.be/XxSgdX7lX6E?t=6" target="_blank">strengthening your glutes, abs and back</a> (especially the low back). </p>
<p>The Louie clip is funny and memorable, but it forgets that almost all soft tissue &amp; joint issues (knees, hips, shoulders, back, etc) can be mitigated by enough musculature (and the necessary mind-muscle link to activate the right muscles).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, your kneecaps aren't made for supporting that much weight and I'd assume the weird horse girl crawl would just make things worse because your back isn't designed to be on that much of an angle either. Not to mention you'd look absolutely unhinged</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say that as well. Most vertebrates are organized horizontally. Even most primates only stand vertically for short periods. The mammalian spine spent millions of years adapting to horizontal weight support, but then only a few dozen thousands suddenly being vertical. There was never time to work out the bugs (so to speak) with that relatively sudden change in design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There is no selective pressure eliminating people with back problems from the reproductive pool. Humans have more or less defeated any kind of evolution of our species through a combination of culture and technology. People with life-threatening diseases or conditions are frequently able to survive and reproduce.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, this is a gross oversimplification. I did not expect this comment to get as much attention as it did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Difficult to say; my guess is no. Modern medicine has supplemented survival (and, more importantly, reproduction) so thoroughly that it's already essentially suspended improvement via evolution.</p>
<p>That said, that assumes dozens of thousands of years of the status quo, which is not sustainable. Assuming a societal crash that returns humanity to pre-modern technology, evolution may again be a factor.</p>
<p>If evolution were to continue working on the spinal issues, you'd probably see incremental improvements, but the truth is that vertical vertebrae are a somewhat flawed conception to begin with. There's probably not a way to do it <em>well.</em></p></div>		</li>

You won’t feel it when you’re young but it will be creeping up on you and it’s so much easier to keep your strength up than it is to build it back up later. A little workout here and there goes a long way!</p></div>		</li>
