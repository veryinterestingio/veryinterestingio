			<div class="markdown"><p>Burn organic matter and you’ll produce CO2, a greenhouse gas. Turn on your gas-powered car, you emit CO2. Use electricity supplied by coal or natural gas power plants, you emit CO2. To limit how much CO2 enters the atmosphere, you can either capture it from sources or capture it from the atmosphere (like in direct air capture). In our method, we capture CO2 directly from flue gas emitted by power plants. In direct air capture, you need a technology that acts like a powerful magnet to find a needle in a haystack. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The rest is injected into deep geologic reservoirs to prevent it from reaching the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, how are you sequestering the captured CO2?</p></div>		</li>
