			<div class="markdown"><p>The major problem with surgeries was that there was no Anesthetic until the 19th century.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact with appendicitis is that the medieval reference book for anatomy did not include it because it was written by studying some ape species that did not have an appendix...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No aenesthetics and we didn't know about germ theory for a long time, so if you even survived surgery, post-surgical infection would probably kill you afterwards.</p>
<p>If you want to learn about how we overcame this, check out the book The Butchering Art. It focuses on Joseph Lister, who was the father of modern surgery.</p></div>		</li>
