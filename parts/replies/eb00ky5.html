			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the scar tissue already IS your body’s attempt at making it grow back properly, it’s just doesn’t have the information anymore to put it back the way it used to be exactly</p>
<p>Edit: I’m not a dermatologist, apparently there are treatment methods based off of this principle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true. Excision is a valid treatment for removal of  scars. It's more complicated than cut out and grow over, specifically the excision is first sutured in the sub-dermal layers, then in the outer layers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i am not sure this is correct. as /u/Kashmir_Slippers has answered in more detail, a scar only remains if the lowest of skin layers is damaged enough. a little scratch on top of your skin will not come back for a long time.....</p></div>		</li>
