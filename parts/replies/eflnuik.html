			<div class="markdown"><p>Angular momentum is conserved unless there is torque. The conceptually simplest way is attach a sideways rocket to the planet and continuously fire it. Reducing the inertia of the planet without any torques can still speed it up to conserve angular momentum, either by making it much more dense or removing mass. This is why neutron stars spin so fast, because they get much tinier. Even moving Earth's mass closer to its axis (either North/South from the equator or Down) can change its rotational speed, for example when the Three Gorges Dam raised so much water that it slowed down the day by a few microseconds.  Another not-crazy scenario is for a large object to pass by a planet's orbit, transferring angular momentum through some kind of gravitational slingshot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently there was a U.S. research project during the cold war to do this with huge rockets strapped down to the ground. </p>
<p>The reasoning behind this idiotic idea was that if the spin could be slightly changed Soviet nuclear ICBMs preprogrammed with a certain earth spin would overshoot their targets in the event of a nuclear war.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were several supercontinents before Pangaea. Supercontinents form and break up in a cycle, called the Wilson cycle. The supercontinent of pannotia was the one before Pangaea and it existed about 600 million years ago. Pangaea was 300 million years ago btw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A Wilson Cycle is actually that of an ocean basin, from rifting to eventual closing and suturing. A supercontinent cycle is how long it takes for all the continents to break up and then come back together. Obviously, the two are closely related, but theyâ€™re not quite the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loads of them. Earth is 4.5 billion years old and  the supercontinent cycle takes around 250-400 million years from supercontinent to supercontinent.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, I can also name Rodinia from a billion years ago, this one came before Gondwana, although there might have been Pannotia between the two.</p>
<p>Evidence tends to get subducted or eroded, but there's probably also a Columbia before Rodinia and we're still not even half way through Earth's history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  Roughly every 500 million years the continents will cycle through a breakup and reconstitution into a super-continent.  </p>
<p>IIRC, North America is currently on it's way to merge with East Asia Australia is on it's way north similar to India, Africa is moving to the Northwest, where it will collide with Europe, closing off the Mediterranean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're at a pivotal point right now. North America could go either way. Either the Pacific Basin will close, or the Atlantic Basin will close. The Atlantic is right now the most active seafloor spreading zone, and the Pacific's mid-ocean ridge has now failed and fallen beneath the North American continent, tearing off part of its western seaboard on the way.</p>
<p>This could reverse at any point. If the Atlantic spreading slows for any reason, the Pacific could reassert itself and tear off (more of) the west of North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings me onto another topic entirely!</p>
<p>Dinosaurs probably survived in Antarctica long after the K-Pg event, possibly millions of years after. They were already adapted to survive long, cold polar nights! The impact winter would have been harsh, but not cataclysmic. For endemic fossils around the Australia/Antarctica area, we can't recover an extinction boundary from the deposits we've examined.</p>
<p>However, 30 million years ago, the whole continent was glaciated. Glaciers destroy anything they touch. Quite possibly Antarctica does not record any strata from the K-Pg boundary.</p></div>		</li>
