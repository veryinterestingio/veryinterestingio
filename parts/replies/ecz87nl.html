			<div class="markdown"><p>That all makes sense. But why is that random dinner in middle school important? It seems to me that it is supremely <em>un</em>important. I can think of absolutely nothing significant about that memory that would cause me to have remember it so easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How often have you thought back on that as a &quot;mundane memory.&quot; I can remember a dream I had when I was... maybe 4 or 5. It had robots, so it WAS pretty cool at the time.</p>
<p>But since then, I have used that memory as &quot;The earliest dream I can remember and possibly my earliest memory.&quot; Which means it is NOT mundane at all. I have gone back to that memory and given it new connections over and over. The retelling of memory or spending time thinking about a memory gives it more life, makes it last longer. </p>
<p>Then there is the question. Which is weirder? Thinking back and being able to remember a mundane memory that had no real impact on your life? Or not being able to think of a SINGLE mundane moment from your entire life? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Oooh. Interesting point.</p>
<p>I guess I remember that memory so well <em>now</em> because it's sort of the memory I always think of when I wonder &quot;why can I remember this?&quot; I guess it's notable because it's the memory that I remember as being completely meaningless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have more connections to it. You remember it when you see an Olive Garden, when you play a record, when you eat with your family. Itâ€™s been replayed more than meeting your wife for some reason. You might remember meeting your wife next time you smell the disinfectant spray that the bowling alley uses in its shoes. You just need to put the memories together somehow.</p></div>		</li>
