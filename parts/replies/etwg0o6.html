			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but what I'm imagining is them orbiting each other, but so slowly that it takes about the same as an orbit around the planet to orbit around each other. Like if you positioned a camera fixed relative to their combined centre of mass, it would see them orbit each other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Its more that they're in two separate orbits, but so close that the orbits interfere, such that once the inner orbit begins to catch up, the gravitational attraction of the outer moon speeds it up, which acts as a prograde burn and bumps it into a higher slower period orbit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the outer moon slows down due to the momentum exchange, and retrograde burns into a lower faster (in time) orbit.</p>
<p>Essentially every time they meet they swap orbits from each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Each dot is on its own path, but if you zoom your reference frame out a little, any two opposite dots are clearly orbiting each other, and a central point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say A is the moon at the larger orbit and B is the moon at the smaller orbit.  When B approaches A, A speeds B up such that B and A swap places.  Let's imagine that when this swap occurs, B passes in front of A.  </p>
<p>So now B is at the larger orbit, and A at the smaller one.  The next time they pass by each other, B speeds A up, causing them to swap places again.  Now let's imagine that A passes in front of B.</p>
<p>So the first time they swap, B passes in front of A.  The next time A passes in front of B.  Doesn't this constitute them orbiting each other, since A goes from being ahead of B, moves inward to be behind B, then moves outward to be ahead of B again, then repeats?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me think of electron orbital shells and now Iâ€™m envisioning planets and their moons as basically giant atoms that make up some sort of compound where gravity acts like van der waals forces.</p></div>		</li>
