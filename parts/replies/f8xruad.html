			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite correct. The problem always has a unique maximum, and it's attained at a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n for some particular n, which is close to (but not necessarily exactly equal to) a/e.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What this means is that if a is not an integer multiple of e then the problem doesn’t have a maximum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect. There is always a maximum product. The relevant function to maximize is f(N) = (a/N)^(N) over the positive integers. The function f(N) is increasing on (0, a/e] and decreasing on [a/e, inf). So if a/e is not an integer, one of the two closest integers to a/e does give the maximum.</p></div>		</li>
