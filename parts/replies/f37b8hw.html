			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Don’t think of the speed of light in meters; think of meters in terms of the speed of light. First, we discover there exists a speed at which all massless particles travel. Second, we discover that massive particles cannot travel faster than massless particles. Third, we establish units of measurement to describe length and time relative to that speed. That’s not historically accurate, but it’s a helpful way to conceptualize the problem. To speak of meters as if they exist independently of the speed of light is to ignore the fact that all of our physics relate back to that universal constant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here’s a question: why is it 300 000km/sec? Why not 150 000, or a million? What makes it so that it’s 300 000 km/sec?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're asking why it's any value (and not the specifics of why it almost rounds easily with meters and seconds, which is partially coincidence and partially by redefinition of units). </p>
<p>Ultimately physicists would love to give you a good answer for this — e.g., &quot;it <em>has</em> to be that number for a very good reason&quot; — but as with many physical constants, there just isn't a good &quot;why&quot; answer. For many of these physical parameters there are basically only a couple answers available:</p>
<p>/1. It's just arbitrary and that's how the universe is (unsatisfactory)</p>
<p>/1a. ...because God did it, otherwise why would seemingly random values happen to be there? (unsatisfactory for those who want a naturalistic explanation)</p>
<p>/2. there's actually some deep (naturalistic) reason that it works out this way, but we don't know it yet, and maybe never will (kind of unsatisfactory, but holds out the possibility of deeper knowledge, e.g. a &quot;theory of everything&quot;)</p>
<p>/3. maybe there are like an infinite number of universes, man, with random values for all of these physical properties, and we just happen to be in the one that has the parameters work out for life, and if we weren't, we wouldn't be able to ask the question, man! <em>takes another bong rip</em> (unsatisfactory to many people because it doesn't give you a real &quot;reason,&quot; also totally unfalsifiable; satisfying to some because it gives you a naturalistic account that feels kind of plausible, if unfalsifiable)</p>
<p>These are all kind of unsatisfactory unless you're willing to invoke divine will, and obviously a lot of naturalistic scientists find this unsatisfactory. Physics in particular finds the ultimate <em>why</em> problems hard; it's better at <em>how</em> problems. <em>Why</em> problems quickly get you into philosophy (or god forbid, theology), and while these topics <em>are</em> of interest to physicists today, there currently aren't a lot of easy ways to tell whether any of the above options are <em>true</em> and so that means that progress in differentiating between them is going to be probably nil. #2 and #3 are the ones that I get the sense that most working physicists today subscribe to, but this is an impressionist assessment, not based on data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that answer.</p>
<p>I definitely do not mean to ask the question in a metaphysical sense. We observe that light travels at the speed it does, in a vacuum. My question was: since we have made that observation, and confirmed that the measurement can be reliably reproduced, is it a factor of a property of light [photons] or the intermediary [the vacuum of space] that dictates what the limitation should be?</p>
<p>Which leads me to: what gives actual rise to a photon? We can obviously ‘make’ light but how does that happen in the natural world in stars? What defines how light comes into being and how does it acquire an impulse to travel in a certain direction at a certain speed? In nature we see light from stars, we generate light using drastically less energy-intensive means and some animals can generate it themselves. This would indicate that the generation of light in stars is actually a happenstance, a byproduct of a star.</p>
<p>I’m also wondering about the intensity of light. Some light is ‘soft’ and other light is ‘hard’. That is of course just a personal perception but why isn’t all light the same if it’s just being photons generated?</p>
<p>You’re giving me a lot to think about. Thank you for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another question: what do km and sec <em>mean</em>? The second is defined in terms of hyperfine transitions of the caesium atom - this is some physical process, and we define the second to be the amount of time it takes for that process to happen a particular number of times. The meter doesn't even have a definition (these days) independent of the speed of light: we define the meter to be the distance that light travels in a particular fraction of a second.</p>
<p>What I'm getting at here is that when you have a fundamental constant with <em>units</em>, like the speed of light, the value of that constant has no independent meaning. This is in contrast to <em>dimensionless</em> constants, where dimensionless means they don't have any units. A good example is the fine-structure constant, which is about 1/137. That's a fundamental number that nature gives us for reasons unknown (see /u/restricteddata's post, which really applies to dimensionless constants). But light being 300,000 km/sec is meaningless, because nature doesn't know what km and sec are.</p>
<p>This is why physicists tend to just set the speed of light to 1, which you can think of as working with (for instance) seconds and light-seconds as our units. The actual numerical value of the constant is entirely meaningless.</p>
<p>There are ways to ask similar questions to yours in dimensionless (and therefore meaningful) ways. The official definition of a second is &quot;the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.&quot; So for example you could ask why the caesium atom has exactly 9,192,631,770 hyperfine transitions in the period of time that it takes light to travel a meter. And the answer to that question would involve a lot of generally quite complicated atomic physics. (Don't ask me!)</p>
<p>But there's a well-defined dimensionless number here, 9,192,631,770, and if you could calculate it from fundamental physics (which I'd imagine is difficult or impossible in practice, though certainly possible in theory), you'd find that the answer would come down to the values of various <em>dimensionless</em> constants, like the aforementioned fine-structure constant. And then the question of why 9,192,631,770 becomes the question of why these various dimensionless constants have the particular values they do, and that's when you start getting into the philosophical questions that /u/restricteddata summarized well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about the speed of light being directly related to vacuum permittivity and EM Permeability? Did we define those based on the speed of light or is there an intrinsic property of nature that just so happens to have them directly related to the speed of light? When we added mu knot and epsilon knot to our EM equations, did we do it because knew their connections to the speed of light, or did we only find out afterwards?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is in reference to the way we measure Distance (space) and Time (relative # of vibrations of a cesium atom, if I remember my coursework right off the top of my head). We could redefine the length of a meter to be something different, or redefine the number of atomic vibrations to make time a different 'length', and it would change the number for the 'speed of light', but it doesn't actually change what the speed is. 300,000 km is the Distance that light travels in one Second.</p>
<p>It matters in relationships between A and B. Sure, we could change things around to that the Speed of Light is 1.5M Gulags/Sneeze-Time, but it really doesn't matter what it is because it is a part of the Relationship between Space-Time that builds into other aspects. It's like asking why the alpha (fine structure) constant is about 1/137.</p>
<p>Whys are typically relational, and Physics is generally more concerned with the &quot;What is going on?&quot; and &quot;How is this occurring&quot; when faced with the puzzled look of &quot;Huh... That's interesting.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>I totally get that it is our arbitrary value. We could say ‘attoparsecs per nano fortnight’ and it would make the same difference.</p>
<p>My question was more for: what factors contribute to it being that value? And then I’m not really concerned with what our measurement of that is, since nature obviously wasn’t waiting for us to name it. I’m more interested in knowing: why is it not slower or faster?</p></div>		</li>
