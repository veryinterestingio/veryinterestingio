			<div class="markdown"><p>What seems unfair is that when someone makes a false claim, YouTube does make a decision to block the revenue of the original poster, forcing them to go after the claimant. If YouTube is so neutral and uninvolved, shouldn't YouTube stay out of it, and force the claimant to prove ownership BEFORE they penalize the original poster?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it costs YouTube less to use their system as is. YouTube operates defensively for copyright stuff, because the cost of going the opposite route would be more expensive for them when a large copyright holder comes after them. The little guy gets fucked unfortunately </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If YouTube forced people to provide ownership first then all the large media companies would sue YouTube. The system they have in place is because they were under fire from companies like Viacom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with what you propose is it would open up <em>YouTube</em> to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>If YouTube is notified that they are distributing copyrighted material, and they <em>do nothing</em> about it, they can be sued for distributing that material. That's how the laws are built.</p>
<p>YouTube cannot just be uninvolved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but the something they do, favors the false claimant. There needs to be a better system.</p></div>		</li>
