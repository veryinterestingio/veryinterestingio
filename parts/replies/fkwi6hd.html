			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, yes. </p>
<p>Bond are sold to anyone who wants to buy them - mostly US Gov, public, corporations, but also foreign governments, people, corporations. They’re incredibly popular right now (considered a safe investment during stock market turmoil), and so its is cheap for the US Gov to borrow right now.</p></div>		</li>
