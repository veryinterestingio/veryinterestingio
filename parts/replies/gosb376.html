			<div class="markdown"><p>While gradients of longevity and fecundidty do exist across many taxa, Giraffes are no where close to R selected in the strictest sense.  </p>
<p>Tortoises are long lived, and reproduce with fairly large bouts, irregulraly over time. Clutch size is somewhat indicative of R selection, as juvenile survival is likely lower in tortoises than the mammals in the above example, but lifetime fitness may be equivalent or greater. </p>
<p>Semelparous species are often thought of as the archetypes of R selection. Species that breed once, die, and have large clutch size. This is common among invertebrates and fishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had the exact same question! Anyways, as per Wikipedia page, r K selection is a spectrum, so many animals fall somewhere in between, also, some species might have trates of both..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the vulnerability of a species contributes heavily to lifespan? If so it makes sense that Tortoises would live so long because they're a fairly easy target even into adulthood but especially when they're young. It really does make sense because even humans have been like this in times when birth rates were a lot lower than they are today, biology always finds a way!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also might add that the tortoises have been around for a long time, most of this time they had no natural predators, they lived on isolated islands in the Pacific or SE asia, they are herbivores and not dependent on other fauna. Hence, they could live for very long time, they were not hunted, they had good protection from sun and other external factors. They were mostly hunted almost to extinction when man found them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other factors that can lead to animals living long or not.  Tortoises have a slow metabolic rate which is probably why they live so long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could also be that when summed up, their reproductive strategy, combined with predation and available food, means that they need to live longer than the average &quot;sow your seeds&quot; animal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>agreed i was going to point out tortoises, who give &quot;birth&quot; to multiple and live 100+ years. and do nothing to raise them. </p>
<p>but in nature not everything fits into our classifications I'm thinking of the platypus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned a lot about k and r selections, but how it was connected with the question by OP begs the question. </p>
<p>Elephants invest lots of time in raising their one offspring, therefore they must live longer. Well why <strong>can't</strong> giraffes live as long?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well why can't giraffes live as long?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The direct answer to this is:</strong> because giraffes have bodies who's mechanisms, pretty much across the board, starts failing for all manner of reasons at an earlier age than that of elephants. </p>
<p><strong>Ok, then. Why do giraffes have bodies that starts failing earlier than elephants?</strong></p>
<p>This is where evolution and offspring strategy comes in: due to their position on the r/k selection spectrum, evolution isn't pushing for long life in giraffes to the same extent it's doing to elephants. </p>
<p>Due to the nature of their offspring strategy a long living elephant will have a comparatively much bigger impact on the local elephant gene pool. Which is to say that genetic combinations that result in a shorter life, like for example something that would make your heart start to struggle after becoming 30 years old, is likely to be outcompeted and weeded out relatively quickly.</p>
<p>By comparison the gene pool advantage of living long isn't as strong in giraffes. There is still an advantage to living to a certain age, so evolution will favor weeding out genes that give you trouble reaching this age, but the advantage drops off at an earlier age for giraffes than for elephants (due to differences in their offspring strategy) which means evolution in giraffes isn't pushing as hard, or at all, to weed out genetic combinations that give them trouble later in life.</p>
<p><strong>The point is:</strong> regardless of species, &quot;genetic faults&quot; will accumulate to a critical degree past the average age that give you a optimal advantage over your gene pool; simply because there is no longer any evolutionary pressure in place to weed them out. This 'optimal average age' is lower for giraffes than for elephants; primarily due to differences in their offspring strategy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My background is in biology and the real ‘why’ for me relates to selection pressure. Everything else are anatomical and physiological changes selected to fit under those pressures. It’s a really great answer from a biological perspective but I could see why people would think it is incomplete. I was trying to think through why I was so satisfied when others weren’t. Maybe because I’m already pretty knowledgeable in the field, things like genetic differences and ridiculously long necks I knew already so didn’t need them in the answer.</p></div>		</li>
