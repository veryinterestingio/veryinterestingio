			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. This explanation is perfect. I'm not sure that I could answer ELI5 questions. I tend to overthink things, which would make nice, neat answers such as this impossible for me to come up with. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll still have plenty of fat on your body, just not an <em>excess</em> of fat.</p>
<p>Lean people still have 10-15% body fat. Most elite athletes about 5-7%. Michael Jordan at his peak, roughly 3% body fat. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Looking at the Olympia for example the athletes on stage are roughly around 3% bf imagining someone in that state playing ball seems crazy to me! </p>
<p>You could be right though, what do I know :D </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s weird, I guess genes play a huge role. I have 12% BF Yet most of it is seemingly stored as visceral fat as well as primary sites around my stomach. But if you look at me you’d definitely say I’m “lean”. Same for every male in my family. </p></div>		</li>
