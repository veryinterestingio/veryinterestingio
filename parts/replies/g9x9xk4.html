			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a very important point that was glossed over in the most upvoted answer (that's 90% correct, not a knock on the other guy)</p>
<p>I'm not very familiar with the film industry, but in the game industry this is pretty common. Square told their investors Hitman 2016 would make 3 dollars for every dollar invested. It made 2 dollars for every dollar invested, so it was written off as a loss.</p>
<p>&quot;But UndercoverDoll, how can it be a loss if it made more money than it cost?&quot; Because to an investor, it's not a matter of &quot;how much money did I make&quot; but &quot;how many times did the money I made is bigger than the money I've invested&quot;. If they got less than promised, they are less likely to invest on the business again, lowering the price of shares and making the company lose money. They could've invested the same amount elsewhere and gotten bigger returns</p>
<p>To give a simple example, imagine you have 1000 bucks to invest, I tell you O can turn it into 3000, another guy says he can turn it into 2500, you go with me and I return 2000, while the other guy kept good on his word to people who invested with him. You don't feel good for making 1000 bucks, you feel like an idiot for missing out in an extra 500, so you'll be more likely to go with the other guy the next time, even if his promises are lower</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right - it's opportunity cost. Movies are a relatively risky venture and the big ones take years, so investors expect a pretty high return - substantially more than they could have gotten investing in an index fund over the same time period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the lack of polemics this time, I'd assume so. IoI going indie must also have helped, since now they don't have to answer to shareholders and investors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also not just expectations for stock markets - it's also the opportunity cost for the company. While yes, the production company isn't the ones filming and editing and stuff, they still have a limited staff for what movies they can produce in a year. If movie X returned 20 million net, but the usual movie of that type/cost would return 200 million, then the production company lost 180 million effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is the real answer, just like a company can release earnings results where they made millions but still disappointed investors and react by changing strategy, layoffs, etc.</p></div>		</li>
