<p>Hang on, so these parasitic wasps can have a symbiotic relationship with viruses that help them parasitise other insects?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell yeah! Some of these viruses can can only replicate inside the reproductive tract of female wasps, and as mentioned before <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4553618/" target="_blank">their primary function is to protect the wasp offspring from the immune defenses of the host</a> </p>
<p>And not only symbiotic relationships! Plants also releases what’s called ‘<a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/5/eaar4767" target="_blank">Herbivore Induced Plant Volatiles’ (HIPVs)</a> that are like ‘emergency calls’ to attract parasitoids and predators when plants are under attack from herbivores like caterpillars (and caterpillars also have ways to avoid the plant from emitting these too! They are smart fellas! 🐛 Some cut the main vein of the leave, some produces chemicals in their saliva to ‘numb out’ the plant defense mechanisms, etc.). </p>
<p>These HIPVs are thought to mediate trophic chains as plants ‘recruits’ natural enemies to protect themselves (and plants can also ‘talk’ to other plants when they are under attack so that the others can start producing defensive chemicals to protect themselves).</p>
<p>Its crazy!! and very interesting 🤓</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, very good explanation. I would imagine that the venom of a tarantula hawk for example could immediately kill most caterpillars, while any caterpillar specific wasp may find it difficult to contend with a spider.</p>
<p>One thing I would like to add is that the larvae don't have a a way to move on to a new host, so they absolutely rely on that one host being enough for their entire larval stage. So even if a tarantula hawk (somehow) successfully parasitized a caterpillar, its larva might just eat through the whole thing and then starve before reaching adulthood.</p></div>		</li>
