			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be higher up! It's a great (and true) story that most people don't seem to know! One of those cases of someone being incredibly influential and unfortunately holding others up to a ridiculous standard. It can be dangerous training people to be like yourself. His legacy still has strong ripples today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For instance I’ve heard the Air Force gives pilots  dexadrin. I’m guessing this is an active field of research for obvious reasons, curious what they’ve found </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They certainly <em>did</em>. Check out the wiki for dexedrine </p>
<p>In general, military soldiers (and leaders!) were the first user base for amphetamines. I find the history interesting as amphs are one of the defining substances of the current world, whether people like to admit it or not </p>
<p>Maybe they’ve switched recently?</p>
<p>I do know many programmers and traders which have switched from adderal to moda in the past few years </p></div>		</li>
