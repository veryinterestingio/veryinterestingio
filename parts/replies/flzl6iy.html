			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy cheeses! Sheep and goat have very little (and often zero) lactose and are a great substitute- you'll find versions of all your favorite cow's milk cheeses made with goat or sheep! Goat gouda (looking at you, Cypress Grove Midnight Moon) is one of the greatest examples and in my opinion can be better than the original.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://sciencelife.uchospitals.edu/2011/09/14/lactose-tolerance-in-the-indian-dairyland/" target="_blank">Only 1/5 of Indians</a> are genetically lactose-tolerant. However, fermented dairy products like yogurts and cheeses have less or no lactose, so are less likely to be a problem for the other 4/5. </p>
<p>But there is a secondary path to being able to digest lactose, which is to have your intestinal microbiome do it for you. Lactose-intolerant people who consume dairy consistently enough can foster gut bacteria that beak down lactose (like Lactobacilli, which are some of the same bacteria used to ferment yogurt) and gain some tolerance that way.</p></div>		</li>

If you only consume small amounts of milk at the time and dont think about some cramps and diarrhea you have deeply then you dont notice.</p>
<p>It took me a visit to the doctor including a lactose intolerance test to connect the dots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. I discovered my lactose intolerance at about age 23. I reckon I was consuming milk daily morning and evening perhaps daily till I was 17-18. Then I switched to tea for a few years. Then at 23 when I started working out, started drinking milk again and only then I realised the diarrhea 15-20 minutes after drinking milk was a pattern and called lactose intolerance.</p>
<p>15 years later, I can still have tea/coffee with a little milk in it. But a glass of milk, or oats, cereal in milk churns the bowels inside out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. They have a higher chance of not developing lactose intolerance somewhen in their life. Just because you can drink milk now that doesn't mean you won't get problems later. I'm a european, i have a family tree hanging here showing me that all of my ancestors at least 8 generations back all came from here. I grew up with cows in a rural area, i drank at least a liter of milk my whole life.</p>
<p>And yet i still started to develop slightly digestion problems at the age of 30-32 that took 6-8 years to further develop into problems worth visiting a doctor. Turned out it's lactose intolerance at the age of 38.</p>
<p>Or in the words of my doc: &quot;Everyone develops this or that intolerance somewhen in his life, the question is only if it makes you enough problems to be detected&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never had any problems digesting dairy either, then got very sick at the age of 23: Had food poisoning twice in a very short span of time, then a bad case of gastritis on top. Afterwards, I was a hundred percent lactose intolerant all of a sudden. </p>
<p>My GP explained to me (probably very simplified) that I had been sick enough to destroy lots and lots of cells in my digestive tract which were perfectly capable of dealing with lactose. However, at some point during our lives, the human body stops producing the enzyme that’s needed to digest it (lactase). As a result, the new cells my body produced to make up for the ones destroyed during my sickness are completely useless when it comes to dairy, and thus I am now going to be lactose intolerant for the rest of my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could try to re-develop a gut microbiome that’s more tolerant of lactose.<br />
I was on an antibiotic regimen for a while in my mid-20’s, and suddenly became lactose intolerant.  My doctor was not helpful in explaining it to me, so I had to carry lactaid pills at all times.<br />
Until I saw something about yogurt bacteria being possibly helpful, so I started gradually incorporating it into my diet.  Nowadays I can eat dairy without fear.<br />
But that’s just my personal anecdote.  I’m not a medical professional.  Defer to the experts for actual advice.<br />
If you do decide to experiment, start with small doses, and go for those with live cultures.  Maybe a couple varieties of strains as well.  Good luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can introduce some amount of lactose tolerance by populating your gut with bacteria that deal with lactose in a more pleasant way than causing gas and diarrhea btw.</p>
<p>that way small amounts of lactose like from a slice of cheese will hopefully not cause problems.</p>
<p>The lactobacilli used to produce yoghurt (which is them eating most if not all of the lactose to make it) work just the same in your gut.</p>
<p>Plus there's experimental gene editing treatments with a n of 1, that had perfect results.</p></div>		</li>
