			<div class="markdown"><p>This is false. Naturally occurring sounds consist of a fundamental frequency and harmonic overtones with a particular distance on the spectrum. Even if an overtone is louder or even the fundamental tone is missing, our auditory system is wired to perceive this as one tone with a pitch related to the fundamental frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An experiment was once done by sticking probes into an owl's brain on the auditory centers. When you played a fundamental into the probes, the owl would voice it. They also played overtones without the fundamental and the owl still voiced the fundamental. This demonstrates what blutfink is talking about. Interestingly, scientists found that sound, unlike sight, travels through the brain at the frequency of the wave.</p>
<p>I remember it from this book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0452288525/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_MVEdFb92TFRQH" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0452288525/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_MVEdFb92TFRQH</a></p>
<p>Or this book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400033535/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_jXEdFbP9TF4KY" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400033535/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_jXEdFbP9TF4KY</a></p>
<p>I can't recall which one. They are both fascinating though.</p></div>		</li>
