			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, water has the highest specific heat capacity of any stable and abundant liquid, meaning it takes an IMMENSE amount of energy to heat it up. Specifically, it takes 4,184 joules to heat 1 kg of water by 1° Celsius (consider that an entire kilogram of copper takes only 385 joules to increase temp. by 1° Celsius). This is why it is used to cool things like power plant equipment/exhaust and why even a small temperature increase in a heat-sink as large as the ocean is terrifying.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this point most underwater lights are probably using LEDs, which produce almost no heat.</p>
<p>Edit: I should have been more specific - underwater they produce little heat unless you’re holding it an inch away from your face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They might be LED or might be Mercury Vapour. </p>
<p>LEDs are energy efficient but their light spectrum is narrow and tend to be a bit blue. Mercury Vapour lamps are the one that produce a very bright and pure white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They produce far less heat than incandescents or HIDs, but by no means do LEDs produce &quot;almost no heat&quot;. I have flashlights (small, pocket sized ones) using modern CREE LEDs that require 10-20 amp 18650 batteries, and the LED is bright enough to cause second degree burns if held directly to the skin quite literally within 1-2 seconds. New studies also prove they are bright enough to cause severe eye damage, that's the whole point behind tactical flashlights, to temporarily blind someone. With enough intensity, and you want a high intensity light when you're underwater, there is a fair amount of heat being put out even with LEDs.</p>
<p>That said, if it's underwater the other posters are correct that the heat will dissipate much better than through air cooling. I imagine even HID lights underwater would produce a negligible amount of heat as far as affecting marine life, unless a creature got very very close to the light. Just like with air hot water will rise in surrounding cold water, creating a current that dissipates the heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LED's produce a lot less heat than halogen,  but it's not insignificant, especially since we take advantage of the LED's efficiency to produce devices with more light output than halogen.</p>
<p>My 1000 lumen small form factor flashlights get very, very warm. My 1500lm and 2400lm bike light housings get hot, you don't want to hold them.  </p>
<p>Wide angle diving lights suitable for video might be 5000-10,000 lumen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The answer there says the animals are harmed and usually go blind and die from the exposure to our subs lights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always wondered, what is the likelyhood of there being some creature down there that we never see because it can detect the lights and swims away in fear?</p>
<p>I feel our method of deep sea exploration is a bit like trying to find new species in a forest while playing death metal. Like, we can see all the plant life but the only animal life are ones that either can't hear, can't run, or don't care.</p></div>		</li>
