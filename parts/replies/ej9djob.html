			<div class="markdown"><p>But how does crying reduce these chemicals? Our emotional tears don‚Äôt contain serotonin or epinephrine or any other other chemicals. Also, when you‚Äôre happy, and then you cry, you‚Äôre not less happy due to the crying. Not trying to argue, just trying to understand. If you have any source I would enjoy reading it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Tears produced during emotional crying have a chemical composition which differs from other types of tears. They contain significantly greater quantities of the hormones prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and Leu-enkephalin,[5] and the elements potassium and manganese.[3]</p>

<p>We don't know but it's speculated that these are some by products the body is trying to get rid of to get into a hormonal equilibrium again.</p>
<p>This is why crying usually helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary standpoint, crying lets others know something is wrong. This most important in infancy.</p>
<p>An infant is hungry as hell? Says nothing? Dies. Infant is hungry as hell? Cries? Gets fed.</p>
<p>From an adult and emotional standpoint? It's a catharsis. We generally feel like we've 'let out' what we needed to and can focus better on the rest of our life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the guy you are responding to but crying is a signal that you need help.  Crying around friends (and sometimes strangers) motivates them to drop what they are doing and help you figure whatever it is out.  It's not hard to see how that kind of social signalling could be beneficial.  </p>
<p>Also, just because stress hormones are present in emotional tears doesn't mean your body is explicitly attempting to excrete them.  It could just be that there is a high concentration of those hormones in your body at that time, so some of them happen to leech into your tears.  This is another case of correlation not necessarily meaning causation.  Better evidence would be needed to show causation, like for example if a study showed that the act of crying significantly reduced the presence of stress hormones in the body then you might have a case for saying that that is a function of crying.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Verbal language is only one way that humans communicate. Physical, non-verbal expression is also communication ‚Äî and used by many species. </p>
<p>Humans have extremely expressive features on their face to convey a whole array of emotions. We can tell through a combination of eyebrow shapes, mouth shapes and eye shapes whether someone is bored, happy, sad, angry, surprised etc. etc. </p>
<p>There is no reason not to suspect that tears are just another tool we have to express more intense degrees of emotions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't make the previous comment, but it could be similar to why we display facial expressions. If showing your feelings/emotions to others leads to a stronger social bond and a stronger social bond leads to increased chance of survival, Darwin does his magic and the less-expressive individuals die out. The same could be extrapolated for tears.</p></div>		</li>
