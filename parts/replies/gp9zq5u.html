			<div class="markdown"><p>No. At some point an equilibrium is reached. On a geological timescales parts of the ocean get cut off from the rest and in most cases the water evaporates from these parts creating things like the salt veins we are mining or the salt plains in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also lots of organisms remove dissolved elements from the ocean by forming organic matter or mineral shells - like the shells you find on the beach, but usually smaller as they mostly made by single celled bugs. Some of that stuff gets into the sediments at the bottom of the ocean &amp; eventually turns into rock - think like limestone or chalk. Some stuff also is removed from seawater in hydrothermal areas &amp; reactions with basaltic rock (I think Mg does this for example). Lastly, minerals will literally form out of the seawater all by themselves if the concentration becomes too high.</p></div>		</li>
