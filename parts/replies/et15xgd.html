			<div class="markdown"><p>D-Oh! Ofcourse it's SONAR.
I'm not exactly sure the exact working details but would LIDAR allow us to do the same? Or because of the depth that light has to travel in a denser medium, it loses its signal strength?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oceanography major here: lidar won't work, the laser wavelength does not penetrate water effectively. Sonar or a fathometer does very well at determining depth, especially when paired with an XBT (expendable bathythermography) which allows us to measure temperature (some expensive ones also do salinity. These help with sound speed modeling for the top part of the ocean. Ocean depths and alternatively topography can be estimated using gravity measurements from satellites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LIDAR is used extensively by the hydrographic service in Australia to aerially map shallow littoral areas of the seabed very accurately, (I hate “ocean floor” btw)</p>
<p>Think, for example, of the Great Barrier Reef and all the heavy marine traffic, bulk carriers etc. They all require accurate navigation to avoid environmental damage, not to mention damage to the vessels themselves.</p></div>		</li>
