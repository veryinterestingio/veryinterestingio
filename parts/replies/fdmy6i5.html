<p>My wife still comments that being hungry shouldn't physically hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching a show on PBS called “Eating Psychology with Betty” and she talked about the difference between actual hunger and conditioned hunger. If I remember correctly, conditioned hunger is what you feel around lunch time when you normally eat because your body is expecting food and preparing itself for it. A example of that is when some people skip lunch and say, “Weird...I was starving 30 minutes ago, but now I feel fine”. It’s like a Pavlov’s dog effect. I’m guessing what you are feeling is actual hunger since you skipped a few meals. I usually get a bit of an upset stomach too if I go to long without food.</p>
<p>Oh and I should mention learning the difference between the two has helped me to not over eat as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hungry feeling you get is caused by a hormone and not your stomach being empty like you would think. It does release it when you have an empty stomach but also when it anticipates a meal. So if you eat lunch at the same time everyday and set yourself for that pattern your body is going to make you feel hungry at that time everyday. That's why you can &quot;push&quot; through it, after awhile your body stops dumping that hormone into your system.</p>
<p>Edit - Ghrelin is the hormone. Had to look up the name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should be able to feel something, yes. However, if you wait a while you’ll feel fine again. Missing two meals isn’t enough to starve and your body can definitely (not medical advice) handle it.</p></div>		</li>
