Think of all that tonnage of displaced water from the shockwave, and focus all of it in a lens style of movement based on the explosion's center. Needless to say, that's a big thump on an already compromised hull.</p></div>		</li>

Thick cables would be run around a ship (horizontal along the water line, and currents passing thru the cables would cause a magnetic field to oppose any this ship might have - thus rendering the ship no longer magnetic.</p>
<p>Edit-Looking at google maps, the station is actually on Marina Green - part of Chrissy Field</p>

<p>Installing such special equipment was, however, far too expensive anddifficult to service all ships that would need it, so the navy developedan alternative called wiping, which Goodeve also devised, and which is now also called deperming. This procedure dragged a large electrical cable along the side of the ship with a pulse of about 2000 amperesflowing through it. This induced the proper field into the ship in theform of a slight bias. It was originally thought that the pounding ofthe sea and the ship's engines would slowly randomize this field, but intesting, this was found not to be a real problem. A more seriousproblem was later realized: as a ship travels through Earth's magneticfield, it will slowly pick up that field, counteracting the effects ofthe degaussing. From then on captains were instructed to changedirection as often as possible to avoid this problem. Nevertheless, thebias did wear off eventually, and ships had to be degaussed on aschedule. Smaller ships continued to use wiping through the war.</p></div>		</li>
