			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even an accounting view, Tesla wasn't close to bankruptcy period. It's a completely inaccurate statement. Bankruptcy is more a legal terms that implies that either the company filed bankruptcy themselves or a supplier filed bankruptcy for the company. Which happens when the company has failed to pay off their creditors and has to go into a legal process of liquidating assets and having the court decide who is first in line to receive some of that (always starts with IRS, then court fees, then others).</p></div>		</li>
