<p>1) Blowing into it</p>
<p>2) give it a little jiggle</p>
<p>3) smack it a bit</p>
<p>4) shake it like a polaroid picture</p>

The key is to not hit it hard enough that yout crack the casing of the device,  but enough that it knows if it doesn't start working properly you will end it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was a parent trick to keep us kids from smacking the shit out of the tv or nintendo when it didnt work. He called it the TV-Glove and it was the only way to make stuff work.   We believed him 100%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original Macintosh computers had some issue where some chip would work it's way loose or something and Apple tech support's solution was &quot;pick up the computer a few inches then drop it on the table&quot; (NOTE: there were no hard drives in the chassis). The impact and momentum would reseat the chip.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in the Navy, an old timer told a story of fixing a computer.</p>
<p>The computer had a ton of little circuit cards and they'd be in there and when they failed, you swapped it out for a new one.  After a while, you'd start to have weird faults that you couldn't isolate.</p>
<p>The manual had a troubleshooting step of removing all the cards, turning the assembly upside down and drop it onto a table from a few inches up.  Do this a couple times and reinsert all the cards.  It usually fixed the problem.</p>
<p>The problem was that the metal of the contacts would sliver off tiny little metal hairs as the cards were removed and inserted and they'd make random, spurious contacts inside the box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Semi-related, according to my local repair shop I am one of a tiny percentage of people who has managed to unseat the hard drive of a 2015 macbook air.</p>
<p>Lemme tell you, having my laptop fall off my nightstand and then go &quot;oh no I don't have a hard drive!&quot; is panic-inducing, with a close second being the repair place telling me over the phone that it's extremely unlikely I just knocked it loose because that doesn't happen with solid-state hard drives. </p>
<p>Well. It doesn't <em>usually</em> happen. </p>
<p>(It also needed the battery replaced. They only charged me for that. My local shop is great. :D )</p></div>		</li>

<p>Faulty connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to add that old electronics had more imperfect connections to begin with. They didn't have electronic switches and so had to make do with actual mechanical switches everywhere.</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes had a lot of little pins pushed into a small round socket, and those were notoriously unreliable in the long run as well.</p>
<p>The strategy pretty much doesn't work with modern electronics because they don't have all that stuff anymore.</p></div>		</li>
