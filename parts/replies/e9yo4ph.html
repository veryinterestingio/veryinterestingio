<p>I don't know why the page on Newton's laws of motion has it worded like that, but it is not correct. It should be &quot;a nonzero net force,&quot; or &quot;an unbalanced force.&quot; </p>
<p>Everything on Earth is being acted upon by multiple forces, but some of them are still at rest relative to the Earth  If you're sitting down right now, you're being acted upon by one main force (your weight), but you're probably still at rest. That's because your weight pulling you down is balanced by the upward support force of the toilet, or whatever you're sitting on. Hence the wording that is usually used, which is how I teach it in my physics classes.</p></div>		</li>
