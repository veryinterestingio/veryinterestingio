			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't compare efficacy of the johnson and johnson vaccine to the others. In order for any vaccines to be compared they would have to have identical sample sizes and methods. Pfizer and moderna were closer as they were similar sizes and I believe primarily in the USA. They were also before the large spike of cases. J&amp;J was later, as cases were spiking, and in many countries including Brazil and South Africa. Many cases in the J&amp;J case we of the South African variety. For all we know the vaccines could be equally effective.</p>
<p>The vaccines also are different types. Pfizer and moderna are mRNA. J&amp;J is using a disabled virus. This is part of why J&amp;J only needs one dose and doesn't need to be stored as cold. There are benefits and disadvantages of each type. Because of the different types you may not be able to compare one dose of J&amp;J to the others although I would trust health official recommendations.</p>
<p>Vox has very good videos, you linked one, explaining the types and also efficacy rates that are definitely worth watching. Basic summary is that all work and all are effective at preventing serious illness. Everyone should take the first vaccine they are able to get.</p></div>		</li>
