			<div class="markdown"><p>This! Zimbabwe experienced ludicrous inflation in ~2009. They printed up to One Hundred Trillion dollar notes. They ended up crashing ATM machines since I assume the machines couldn't handle that many zeroes.<br />
One advertising company created a billboard papered entirety in bank notes as a form of protest. The government eventually had to create a.new currency to get things under control.<br />
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for further info.  </p>
<p>The notes can be picked up on eBay. I've got everything from $1 to $100 trillion framed. It looks really sweet.</p></div>		</li>
