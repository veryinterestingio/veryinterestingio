I'm an occupational therapist as I work with kids with autism all the time.
This is pretty much bang on. Different sensory information can have alerting or calming input on your body and studies do show that deep pressure is consistently calming. So weighted blankets provide deep pressure across your body which calms you neurological system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have fibromyalgia, and heard weighted blankets can be a real godsend. Now this completely makes sense, as it's currently believed that fibro is caused by an overactive nervous system, always pushing out adrenaline, always in fight or flight mode. I have my boyfriend lay with his entire body weight on me sometimes, me laying face down and he on top, which can bring great relief to my pain. Might have to get a blanket so he can be relieved of duty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've tried other ways to get this input then it might help!
You can also always try heavy down duvets, or tucking sheets in really tight if you want to continue experimenting without spending big $$. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! It used to be really common for kids with autism to use pressure vests. Sometimes I recommend compression shirts instead because they give the same type of input but look &quot;normal&quot;.
The only down side is that you get the most impact from intermittent sensory input, otherwise you attenuate to the feeling.  Like, when you put on a shirt in the morning at first you can feel it on your skin but then your body starts to &quot;ignore it&quot;. </p>
<p>But obviously this won't completely address anxiety etc, but it can be a tool you use</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this really interesting. The idea of my whole body being covered with an even pressure <em>makes</em> me slightly anxious though, rather than helping me feel secure. Would it not make you feel a little trapped? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth I've never felt that way. But I was sold as soon as I heard they existed..I've always enjoyed the weight of those led blankets they cover you with when giving x-rays, so I assumed this would be more or less the same. I guess you could feel trapped if you are predisposed to feeling trapped, but they also just don't feel all that heavy once you have it stretched out over you. It isn't much weight per square inch, and you can easily lift a corner and fold it over to get out, or stretch a limb out from under it.</p>
<p>Although I also feel like you get used to it and I question any real long term effects it has because of that, especially once you factor in the weight and how hard it is to clean the thing.  Also if you have pets they can scratch holes in it and now you have a slightly less weighted blanket and tiny glass beads everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having the effect 'wear off' because of getting used to it is certainly a problem.  Your brain stops paying attention to the constant stimuli.  I rotate all of my sleep and anxiety tools every few days or weeks, and that has made a huge difference for me.  I go between using my weighted blanket, diffusing lavender oil, super soft flannel sheets, cuddling a small heating pad, and I  use a variety of relaxing soundscapes as well.  By changing them regularly they don't get worn out.  I do the same with daytime coping tools.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that's really good to know about the beads! I didn't consider what the weight was actually made of. I have two cats who like to sleep on the bed, so that wouldn't end well! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't had that problem with mine.  It does make a difference what weight you buy.  From what I have read you want around 10% of your body weight.  Also, I don't tuck mine in, so it is easy to throw off.  Most of them are honestly too small to tuck into the mattress anyway.  I prefer to sleep with my feet sticking out from under it, but still under a warm blanket.  I kick a lot and I'll wake up twisted sometimes if they're covered.
edit: their to they're</p></div>		</li>
