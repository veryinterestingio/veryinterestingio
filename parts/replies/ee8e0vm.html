			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, it was only 6 years (and one day) for me!</p>
<p>I work in materials science, but there's a lot of overlap with physics when it comes to the wrinkling bits.  There are a lot of reasons for it, apart from just trying to understand how the world works.  Adaptive smart materials is a big one - imagine being able to change a surface's appearance, texture, stickiness, etc., by turning the wrinkles on or off.  Microscale patterning is another potential application area, since wrinkles form these patterns with no prior &quot;mold&quot; so to speak, and there is no theoretical lower bound to the size of wrinkles that can form.</p></div>		</li>
