<p>So, if you dig a hole down 75% through the mantle, the gravitational pull at the bottom of that hole would be the same as if you stripped away the outer 75% of Earth (in terms of its radius)</p>

<p>Assuming constant density, which is not really a good assumption for the Earth (or any differentiated planetary body for that matter).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the point is that the 75% bit doesn't work out because of non-uniform density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean the radial density or variations based on position on the earth? They side stepped the radial density variation by not directly saying the force goes down by 75%. They only said that it'd be the same as if the 75% of earths <em>radius</em> above that point was not there. There would be a minor correction for density varying around the planet, but I can't believe it be very significant, especially at that depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh shoot I remember doing these exercises for E&amp;M, but with charge. Makes sense since  they're both inverse square laws, but I always get excited when I get to reuse models for other stuff. Neat!</p></div>		</li>
