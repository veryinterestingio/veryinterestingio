			<div class="markdown"><p>It was also a pain in the ass to fly. To pilot an SR-71 you had to be married to prove you were responsible enough. Once the jet got to altitude and cruising speed, it would heat to tremendous temperatures which expanded the metal. This required expansion joints in the materials that also allowed fuel to pour out when the jet was on the ground. This required it to immediately need in flight refueling after take off. Problem is, it was so fast that only incredibly skilled pilots could actually match the speed of tankers and maintain the correct distance while refueling in air.</p></div>		</li>
