			<div class="markdown"><p>PV is caused by a mutation (most commonly in the JAK2 gene) that stops your bone marrow cells from regulating cell division. You get extra red blood cells, platelets, and certain white blood cells. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's usually due to a chronically activated JAK2/STAT5 pathway which produces more red cells, EPO would normally activate JAK2. So yes, oversignalling from cells.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PV is overcontstruction of red blood cells due to a mutation in cell signaling.</p>
<p>Hemochromatosis is iron overload.  Your confusion likely stems from the fact that iron is used in the synthesis of RBCs, but the pathways of the two diseases are different.  Hemochromatosis does not lead to too many RBCs, there's just extra iron around, which ends up depositing in organs and causing dysfunction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are places where arteries exit the bone. </p>
<p>I found a little chunk of bone from some animal's legbone, and it has a channel for a vein/artery, and at least when I found it, had a trace of red in the area. I'll see if it still does, and take a photo. </p>
<p>Here you can see that there are two holes though the bone, one straight through, and you can see the pink of my finger behind it. The other hole leads deeper in.</p>

<p>By my thumb you can see a bit of the marrow. Up close it looks foamy.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is fossilized. Doesn't seem like normal bone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response!  </p>
<p>I’ll just add that we can actually drill into bone to access this space for IV access.  It’s called intraosseous access and it’s used in emergency medicine for when we need vascular access and are having trouble getting into a vein or don’t have time to try for a vein.  </p>
<p>The fluids and meds get uptaken just about as quickly as through a vein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, if it's fossilized bone, you can touch it lightly with the tip of your tongue, and if it feels like it &quot;sticks&quot; a bit to the stone, it's likely fossilized bone as opposed to unfossilized bone or petrified wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what others have said, marrow is actually filled with capillaries. That's why, if you were in a trauma and they needed IV access but couldn't get it, they would just stick a large bore needle directly into your bones. It works like an IV, but you can't give a lot of fluid through it, and it usually doesn't last very long. But it's huge in an emergency situation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an adult the overwhelming majority of hematopoesis (the process of making new blood cells) occurs in your axial skeleton (spine and pelvis) so with an amputation of a leg you aren't really losing hardly any bone marrow actively participating in this process.  Only the very young would have a noticeable dip in production from an amputation.</p></div>		</li>
