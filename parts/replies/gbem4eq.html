			<div class="markdown"><p>The flow of electrons is actually from the negative to the positive terminal. The positive charge is what flows from positive to negative. Itâ€™s like this because we defined current before we actually understood how it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the electric polarity between the electrodes.</p>
<p>In a voluntary electric flow, like a battery, the cathode is the positive electrode.</p>
<p>In electrolysis, a forced flow through applied voltage, the cathode is the negative polarized electrode!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the terminal is positive because the electrolyte steals an electron from it, basically creating a void to balance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for escaping, the electrons want to go to the other side of the battery but are limited by the flow your device allow so it takes time</p>
<p>That is also why you damage/break a battery if you directly connect the two poles without any device in between</p></div>		</li>
