<p>Alcohol damages cells indiscriminately</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I'm imagining a donated-liver looks just like half of a healthy liver, and all the healthy cells can regrow normally. But then an alcohol-damaged liver is intact, but with random cells damaged and the cells around them can't regrow because <em>technically</em> the damaged cells are still there and don't need replacing?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you donate half a healthy liver, would it grow into the full-liver size for both the donater and the receiver?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Usually they take a bit more than half, but both will regrow to the size of the donor's original liver. Living liver donor's are still rare though, it takes 6 weeks of intensive recovery, it's still a very invasive surgery, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, because damaged cell when reproducing a new one, would either end up damaged or not working. that's also where cancer comes frome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't really make sense. Cells have an upper limit to their size, and liver cells definitely aren't macroscopic. How can the liver &quot;regrow&quot; without creating new cells, which effectively replaces the damaged/cut off cells</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You liver cells evolved to clear toxins so they will happily do that without any permanent damage. The problem is when you overload the cells by drinking too much or for a prolonged time frame.</p>
<p>Even a single evening of binge drinking will cause inflammatory changes such as accumulation of fat in the liver. These changes will revert again after some time if you stop drinking, but if it happens frequently it can cause irreversible damage.</p>
<p>However, a beer a day does not notably increase your risk of alcoholic liver disease. It may increase your risk of other disease such as cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fairly nuanced and depends on some factors like genetics, but for practical purposes, health guidelines for men used to be something like no more than 2-4 drinks in one night <em>and</em> no more than 14 drinks in a week. Why these numbers matter is because if you have one heavy night of drinking 6-10 &quot;drinks&quot; your body is going to recover from that just fine. But if you drink that much every day, your liver doesn't get the time to recover and heal (nor do other parts of your body which are also affecte). So the guideline said that generally more than &quot;a couple&quot; drinks in one night is slightly risky, but if you keep it under the 14 drinks in a whole week you're being reasonable as you are giving your liver a chance to recover.</p>
<p>These numbers I gave are from memory, and were for men. Women used to have a lower threshold for maximum. Recent changes have adjusted the numbers down for men to be basically the same as the amount for women. But depending on where you get the data and who you ask, you may run across different numbers. Pay attention to the most conservative estimates.</p>
<p>Longer cycles also matter. Drinking 14 drinks a week or more for 10 years is likely to cause &quot;some damage&quot;, but if you go through 1-2 years of that amount of drinking and then reduce your alcohol intake, you're probably going to help your body a good deal. </p>
<p>Health is hard, because everybody has slightly different genetic makeup, and even if you don't have genes which help you be more robust against risky health habits (like poor diet, lack of exercise, heavy drinking, etc) you might still just live a long time anyway. Likewise, some people can practice strict healthy behaviors and die much younger than average. Statistics are a weird and fickle thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Permanent damage&quot; is hard to reliably predict, because of how complex biology is. The liver could sustain some amount of &quot;permanent&quot; damage - i.e. scarring - withoit losing its ability to do its job under healthier behaviors. So you could drink heavily into your 40s and maybe cause permanent damage, but if you reduce your drinking to no more than 1 drink a day, you might be in great shape. It would be like maybe causing a 25% reduction in your liver's ability to filter toxins, but if toy reduce drinking enough your liver may be just fine. Or maybe not, because again, biology is hard. &quot;Permanent damage&quot; doesn't necessarily mean you have reached a point of inevitable failure. It could mean that you just have reduced the effectiveness of your organs and need to change your habits before you weaken your body too much.</p>
<p>If you started drinking heavily in your teens, this is also riskier. If you started drinkinf around 20 and you're 25, try to start making some better habits and be honest with your doctor. If you're older than that and are concerned then you may want to ask for blood tests to check your liver's health. Your liver isn't the only thing affected by drinking but it is one of the main ones, and testing it early can let you know if it's healthy or not.</p>
<p>Finally, if you think you have a problem with drinking, you probably do. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to go full AA and sober forever, but alcohol is strongly habit-forming and addictive so be aware of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;A bottle of beer&quot; is not likely to have any significant effect on your liver. It's evolved to handle that. Most alcoholic liver disease (the kind that results in doctors putting you on a lobe transplant list) is a result of a decade or two of daily hard drinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, just like a deep scar on your arm, it may heal but the scar tissue remains and is different. Regular tissue has strands oriented in different directions where as scar tissue has  strands oriented in a linear fashion that donâ€™t regenerate well. Thats why they stretch oddly.</p></div>		</li>
