			<div class="markdown"><p>The main difference in the RNA appears to be the 5' and 3' UTRs. UTR stands for UnTranslated  Region, which means it is the part of the mRNA that is not encoding the actual protein (this coding region would called ORF, or Open Reading Frame, or protein coding sequence).</p>
<p>UTR sequences can have an inpact on translation efficiency (how much protein can be produced by a single RNA strand) and influence RNA stability (i.e. how long the RNA hangs around.</p>
<p>I don't have the sequences in front of me, so I am going of memory here:</p>
<p>it seems that Moderna uses pretty much an of the shelf 5' and 3' UTR. The sequences are pulled from a gene that codes for beta-globin (which makes up hemoglobin). This gene is a classic in genetics and is a known quantity.</p>
<p>BioNtech (who is working with pfizer) uses more custom built UTR sequences. At the 5' they use a beta-globin sequence that has a single nucleotide substion to create a perfect Kozak consensus sequence (which is a short motif that helps the ribosome get started with protein production). There is also sequence in there which i think is a relict of another amplification system (other than the T7) but id have to look at the sequece again to be sure.
At the 3' UTR, BioNtech has conducted an in vitro (in cell culture) screen that results in progressive enrichment of very stable RNAs. It is actually a pretty neat variant of a classical approach called (SELEX):</p>
<p>They generated a library of DNA constructs that produce RNAs with different 3'UTRs. These DNAs were electroporated into cells. The cells made the RNA, and then the researchers used a chemical method to prevent the cells from making more RNA. They then let the cells sit in the dish for several days. Unstable RNAs would progressively get eliminated and only the stable ones survive. They then pulled out the surviving RNAs and made a new library from that. They repeated that a number of cycles until they had sequences that made the RNA very stable (think of it in sortof darwinian terms).
The sequences they pulled out were somewhat unexpected (for example parts of the 12s mitochondrial ribosome), but they appear to stabilize the RNA.</p>
<p>More stable RNA means you need less for the same effect. I'd like to think that Pizer BioNtech can get away with less (30 vs 100mg) because they put in this extra work at the outset.</p>
<p>With regard to the coding sequence, I don't remember if the two have different codon usage (which means slightly different writing to make the same proten) but they both use a pre fusion stabilized version of the spike protein. Which is essentially the version of spike that is springloaded to penetrate the membrane. A couple amminoacid substitutions will prevent the &quot;spring&quot; from accidentally going off. This makes the production of good antibodies more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

It is also interesting to see how their approach has changed over time - some of their publications provide some insight here:<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Study design and now they have to go with what they showed works in their respective trials. At some point some smart people sat in a room and drew upnthe study design. Everyone was probably eager to keep the times as short as possible... someone in the moderna conference room probably said something like &quot;Three weeks for a booster seems awfully short don't you think&quot;... someone else probably nodded a little, others shruggrd and said &quot;You're probably right Jane...&quot; someone else, who is a little bit higher up in the chain of command probably said. &quot;Ok, how about four, should we do four?&quot; Someone else probably said. &quot;Yeah... that sounds more reasonable, I guess&quot;.</p>
<p>And there you have it. That is what they are stuck with now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To take that a bit further, they told the FDA that's what they were going to do during phase 3 trials and the FDA agreed. </p>
<p>Moderna's Phase 3 trials were ultimately successful with the 4-week spacing so that's now the protocol. </p>
<p>At this point no one knows if a 3-week or 5-week spacing works better or worse but we know 4-weeks does work so that's the protocol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Virtually all new treatments have to go through multiple phases of clinical trials before being approved, with different goals in each phase. The first phase is designed to determine treatment dosage and timing. A major aspect of early phase trials is that they are for very unknown treatments, so we typically use as small a sample size as we realistically can. The result is a sample size that is big enough to determine a ballpark appropriate dosage, but small enough that there may still be a reasonable amount of variation in the exact dosage that is found to be appropriate. While it’s possible that the two vaccines may actually need different spacing between dosages, it’s also distinctly possible that there was enough randomness in the trial that led to a 3 week value for Pfizer and 4 week value for moderna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed answer! One thing I've been curious about, that I'd suspect you know the answer to:</p>
<p>One of the important features of the Coronavirus is the spike protein, which helps it bind to our cells. After it binds to a cell it fuses with it and deposits its genetic material inside to begin the replication process.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines don't have any such spike protein, though, they just contain the mRNA in a lipid layer that (I assume) floats around until it bumps into a cell and fuses with it. After which point the RNA is in our cells and the replication of the spike protein begins</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>Why is it that the Coronavirus needs a spike protein to bind with cells to replicate, but the vaccines' lipid bubbles don't? Are the vaccines bubbles significantly smaller than the virus so can bind/fuse more easily? Is the number of lipid bubbles in a vaccine shot much higher than the number of viruses particles you'd normally ingest, so they don't have to bind as efficiently to cells? Or is it something else?</p>
<p>This has been very befuddling to me every time I've read about the vaccines' mechanism...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The SARS-Cov2 spike protein (and viral fusion proteins in general) help it bind to cell receptors on a wide variety of cells. This binding kickstarts the process of the virus enter those cells. Now for the vaccine, they aren’t trying to enter the same, broad types of cells that viruses attack. Instead, they’re looking for antigen-presenting cells (most commonly dendritic cells) to decide its foreign, essentially consume it, and then these presenting cells will take the mRNA instructions and present the spike protein on the outside for T cells (essentially cellular assassins) to learn from. Because it doesn’t need to “trick” a wide variety of cells, only need the immune cells to notice them, the vaccine doesn’t need a viral spike protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect, this is exactly the information I was missing, thank you. I didn't realize the vaccine's Lipid bubbles are intended to be picked up by a specific type of immune cell; I had assumed that (like the virus particles), they tried to fuse with lots of different types of cells throughout your body. The articles I've read on this didn't make that clear. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>They replicate only a portion of the spike protein, but sure.</p>

<p>Cells love lipids. That's why lipids are used - super easy vehicle because cells mop it up. The spikes, on the other hand, aren't just welcomed inside. That's why they come in kicking doors down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>where do you get from that they only replicate a portion of the spike protein? I'm fairly confident it's full size with a few mutations to force the conformation the spike protein would assume when attaching to ACE2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, it's why most of Modernas clinical trials failed for other rarer diseases. The lipid nanoparticles were being cleared out too fast and not reaching the site of interest for theraputic intervention and had cytotoxic effects at higher dosing. In the case of the vaccines they are actually using that to their advantage!</p></div>		</li>
