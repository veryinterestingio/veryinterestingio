			<div class="markdown"><p>ShakeAlert is adding hundreds of sensors to the earthquake monitoring network that already existed in Washington, Oregon and California to achieve a density of about 20km between sensors. Our goal is 1,675 total sensors and we’re about ⅔ of the way there. We have been thinking about extending to other high-risk states, especially Hawaii and Alaska. Doing so would require additional support. - Doug Given, USGS</p></div>		</li>
