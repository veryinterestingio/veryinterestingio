			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there's no rule that the bandwidth has to be +/- 100 KHz. It can be effectively anything you want, as long as the receiver is expecting the bandwidth to be what the station is using. In the amateur VHF bands, for example, a very narrow bandwidth is used and FM ham radios generally can tune in 5 or 10 KHz increments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great graph, to really visualize the bandwidth of an FM station. </p>
<p>Just curious: what generates those narrow spikes (which I guess we would call &quot;noise&quot;) between stations? </p>
<p>I'm guessing some of that may be noise from space itself, and/or distant lightening, and things like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, the small spikes of noise are likely something weak and close to the receiver that generated the graph. RFI from electronics (especially switching power supplies) looks like that. Lightning is very broadband and shows up as a thin horizontal stripe on the waterfall plot (the lower half of the plot is basically the history of the upper half, with time as the vertical axis). Background noise accounts for the absolute floor of the graph, like what's going on between 97.7 and 97.8 MHz.</p></div>		</li>
