			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not just the itch. You are also used to how your body has looked and your desire to get back to &quot;normal&quot; helps you overcome the understanding that the scab will heal naturally and better without you fucking with it. </p>
<p>Its a big reason why kids will pick at it, especially when its visible instead of covered by their clothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the topic of releasing histamine- if you have poison ivy, you can run it under hot water (as hot as you can handle) to release bubbles of histamine from your skin, providing some relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically that will work
But not because of release of histamine bubbles</p>
<p>Hot water will cause your blood vessels to dilate
This will cause the histamine in that region of the body to literally be washed out and diluted all over the body, thus providing relief!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experienced the opposite. When I was a kid and got a bad case of poison oak, I used to like to go to the beach. We lived in the SF Bay Area and the water was <em>cold</em>. </p>
<p>I'd spend hours in the water until I was blue. Something about the cold and salt made my skin feel much better for the rest of the week that it took for the poison oak to run its course. It dried out the rash and made me feel better every time.</p></div>		</li>
