			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that it's actually effective. </p>
<p>We feel pain to learn to avoid the thing. Heartache is no different - &quot;our brain&quot; wants to teach us to help the people we love, kinda thing. Same way that a burn teaches us to avoid steam, pain is just the mechanism our bodies evolved to let us know when we're damaged in some way. </p>
<p>The physical pain is what keeps us coming back to the memory so often. When I lost my childhood dog, I felt like I literally couldn't get out of bed it hurt so much, which meant that I was constantly only thinking about one thing. </p>
<p>But if you can get rid of the physical pain, you can go do something that will distract you, lessening the emotional pain.</p></div>		</li>
