<p>What does &quot;stressed&quot; actually mean in this context? Like, what does experiencing stress actually do to contribute to fatigue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but in the context they are using, &quot;stress&quot; is anything that causes a hormonal stress response in the body.   </p>
<p>A long time ago, these stressors would be getting chased by a predator. Today, we know that these hormone dumps can be triggered by anything from worrying about bills to a disagreement at work. Over time, this constant state of hyper vigilance burns your body out.  </p>
<p>One of the easiest ways, so they say, to &quot;de-stress&quot; your life is to drop social media. Even just reading about things that make you worry or upset are enough to trigger your hormonal stress response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck social media, get rid of all of it. It serves no purpose really other than reading dumb people say dumb things, discovering that people you like are also dumb, and seeing the best of each person's life, which can make yours look worse in comparison. And don't forget that, the moment you least expect it, some random shit you wrote three months ago can become a monumental drama out of the blue.</p>
<p>I keep myself to things like reddit that don't really resemble mainstream social media.</p></div>		</li>
