			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the virus means to kill it's host, it just ends up overwhelming the hosts immune system and then the other cells in their body. A novel virus needs time to recognize that it needs to adaptâ€”although obviously it isn't consciously making that decision, it kind of just does it to ensure further survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well nothing but the is no difference between a dead host and recovered host, so long as the virus spreads before one of them happens.</p>
<p>Viruses that kill their host before they can spread will die out rather quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful with your wording - evolution is not directional (i.e., a virus cannot 'naturally evolve' to be something; it simply has random mutations that may or may not be selected for by the environment present at the time of the mutation).</p></div>		</li>
