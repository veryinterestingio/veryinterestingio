The basic need is protection from predators and the harsh environment of the ocean. Different shells offer different advantages and disadvantages in terms of strength, camouflage, and speed, like the different armors one might choose from in a role-playing game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The most common are calcium based minerals for sure; the other mineralisation process for many marine organisms is based upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_silica" target="_blank">silica</a>. This is especially important for many types of plankton which can be found throughout the world’s oceans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, totally forgot about silica. For anyone still reading, that's pretty much why glass is made from sand, which can be ground up or even whole, but tiny, shells.</p>
<p>I don't think people think of sand when they think of the word seashell, but it's technically true and kind of neat to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, whilst sand can definitely be finely broken up shells, I think the vast majority of silica sand that you would find on beaches is produced by the weathering of continental material (given enough time, quartz - a form of silica - is the only stuff that sticks around), which then gets transported to the coast by rivers. There’s an excellent <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=pxmHHoTPSKI" target="_blank">Minute Earth explanation here</a>. The sand predominantly made from broken up shells tends to be calcium carbonate fragments, which give the sand a particularly bright look, like the golden white beaches of the Bahamas. </p>
<p>The kind of silica I was thinking of - making up the microscopic shells of certain plankton like diatoms, radiolaria, silicoflagellates... those shells are already smaller than sand sized. Once the plankton dies, they rain down into the seafloor and build up sediments to form a siliceous ooze. This may then become lithified into some kind of siliceous clay or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chert" target="_blank">chert</a> if it gets buried deep enough.</p></div>		</li>
