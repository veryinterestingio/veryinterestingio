			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I call someone's name in a crowd, they usually don't respond instantly. Only after I change my tone and/or speak louder.</p>
<p>I think that we notice it because their tone/volume is in contrast of normal conversations. I also notice it when someone else gets called.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's why you can be in a crowded room where the conversation just sounds like a dull roar, but the second someone on the other side of the room says your name, you instantly hear it...</p>

<p>Bold of you to assume I need someone to say my name to hear it</p></div>		</li>
