			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's safety reasons only.  For speed you want to minimize friction.  To do so means you want a film of water everywhere.  Crossing your ankles creates pressure points which break through the film.  Also,  crossing the arms increases the pressure exerted by the torso which reduces the film thickness.<br />
Keeping your arms alongside might result in severe injury if they get caught when exciting the slide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely doesn't break through the film of water. As someone who got to spend a couple days at a park with family when it was ridiculously empty, we refined our technique.</p>
<p>Crossed legs/ankles so that only one is in contact, with an arched back so that only your shoulder blades touch, as well as ensuring you lift your head slightly so it doesn't touch (normally won't most people don't rest there head on the slide).</p>
<p>The rest is timing and slightly adjusting your arms/weight to adjust for the turns. We got to the point that after the second day the three of us could come up even with the top edges of the slides on the jumps. Got to the point that the landings almost hurt too much to to continue but damn could we get down those slides fast.</p>
<p>The one guard relaxed the rules for us a but and we got nice fast starts at the top as well. Still the most fun I've ever had at a water park...</p></div>		</li>
