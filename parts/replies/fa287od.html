			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome. Thanks you for the response. The theory of why females mate with multiple partners is especially interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, i'm pretty sure female dolphins do this to ensure the safety of their offspring. It would be interesting to see a list of animals that do this. It seems like a trait that only fairly intelligent mammals have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smell definitely matters with some. If a ewe lost her lambs and you want to give her some others to raise an ancient trick is to tie the dead lamb's skin on the ones she's supposed to adopt, or at least vigorously rub the new lambs down with the dead one's wool. The scents mingle, which seems to be enough. Sometimes. A few ewes will take on whatever lamb you pair them with, others won't take any replacement ever, or not even their own.</p>
<p>Mice are more &quot;generous&quot;, any baby that smells like the collective nest is fine. They'll even steal each others pinkies. The individual doesn't seem to matter, they just grab any baby and carry it to their own spot in the nest. Some collect ALL the babies, others just want the number to be satisfying again. Any mouse that doesn't smell right gets fought mercilessly. Accepting babies at all for mouse mothers is mostly a matter of stress and age. Too young and/or stressed and some eat their young, sometimes right as they're born. Recycling at its grossest.</p>
<p>A friend did a study on whether pig litter mates recognize each other even after they were separated for some time, and yes, they do. It was about reducing aggression when raising piglets for meat. But that might be smell or sound. Pigs and sheep recognize each other's voices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely feel like it boils down to an animals' primary sense or primary close range one. Like birds are very good at picking up on different vocalizations, and if you look at penguins they can locate their mates over large distances and in a crowd just by calling out and being able to identify their exact voice. They can also tell which chick is their's when they're trying to feed them, and others are trying to get in on the action.</p>
<p>I believe it's been observed that parrots have distinct names for each other, which considering how social they are and their vocal range isn't too surprising, but definitely points towards them being very aware of who their children are, even while they're growing and going through different phases of feathering.</p>
<p>I think part of it might also be how they're raised socially and taught to interact, like hyenas are notoriously good at keeping track of relatives, provably identifying ones as far as great aunts and uncles. However, as far as I understand it, they don't really have contact with any adult hyenas outside of their mother for the first few months of their life, so they probably learn their relationships to others through observation (or maybe their mother interacting with family members makes their scent more familiar?). No clue, but it's definitely interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ll add that another component of mating with several males is sperm competition. In a Darwinian evolution model it is one more way of making sure the fittest male with the fittest sperm gets to reproduce</p></div>		</li>
