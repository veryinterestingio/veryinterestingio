			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, egg yolk peritonitis. Very common amongst hybrid birds that have been bred for max egg production and nearly always fatal - essentially the egg breaks inside the bird and the nutrient -rich yolk is a perfect growing medium for all sorts of bacteria.  Cue massive infection in the peritoneum and usually death.
Our girl had a prolapse with an internal broken egg and we had to cull before either infection set in or the others killed her. Super sad but we gave an ex-battery hen a pleasant retirement and thatâ€™s what matters!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had the same happen a few months ago with one of our egg battery chickens, minus the prolapse. We put her inside and gave her antibiotics, as well as anti inflamatory meds on the last day, but it didn't help. Also looked like she did not defecate anymore. In retrospect, we should have put her down, but I was not sure her survival chances were that bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is more common in chickens than people realize because we bred them to lay eggs extremely more often than is natural for them.</p></div>		</li>
