			<div class="markdown"><p>Not possible with smartphone tech. </p>
<p>GPS positioning in phones is only accurate to about 4.9 m (16 ft.) in ideal conditions. e.g. Open sky above. Put it under a roof and it's less accurate.  Cell signal tracking is only accurate to within 3/4 mile.    </p>
<p>No possible way a phone can determine if it's in the drivers seat or 1.5 feet away in the passengers seat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can determine when someone begins to enter a vehicle (and define it); then you can determine physically where inside of the car (dimensionless to begin with) the phone is situated and in what orientation. That doesn't rely on external sensors or inputs such as GPS. It can be done with rudimentary and publicly available libraries or of course, by writing your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically by using sensor fusion algorithm which uses data from the phone's built in accelerometer, gyro and GPS you can predict if the phone is in the driver seat or passenger seat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it would be a minuscule difference in time, and it would have to compare both phones to each other. Neat idea though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually meant it could track your position and determine the tightness of the turn for lack of a better term. But you're probably right about it being too small a difference :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a cool idea, but not sure how that’d work in the back seat though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people when driving will have their phone either in a mount, or placed somewhere stationary on the car vs a passenger holding the phone in their hand. Although the phone is moving around with the car as it drives, it isn’t moving with in that space much except for when someone is texting or changing songs occasionally(not advocating but these definitely happen). </p>
<p>It seems they would determine passenger vs driver based on phone rotation and usage during various maneuvers. It can’t be that hard to tell that some is texting and driving if they coast or are at a stop every time a text is being written.  </p>
<p>As they state in their site they collect data from several sensors to determine driving habits and phone usage habits while driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably it is tracking how frequently the screen is being touched, how it is being held, what it's being used for.</p></div>		</li>
