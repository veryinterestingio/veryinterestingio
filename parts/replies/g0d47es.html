			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some medications used for people with growth hormone deficiency but they're really expensive. One I saw was over $1k for 10 mg where you dose 0.06 mg/kg 3 times a week meaning a 30 kg child would cost ~1.2k a week. Also you end up having big feet and hands when you take it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not what I learned. In acromegaly, growth (epiphyseal) plates are closed. This is why you see large hands, feet, heads, organs, and other tissue types that are affected by growth hormone without epiphyseal plates.</p>
<p>The growth of long bones (and thus, height) secondary to pituitary adenomas releasing massive amounts of IGF/GH is dependent upon epiphyseal plate presence - this is generally called gigantism and occurs prior to the age at which Adam Rainer's growth spurt occurred. Puberty's release of testosterone, and, more importantly, estrogen - in both genders - is chiefly what triggers epiphyseal plate closure</p>
<p>This raises the interesting question - how did he grow so tall so late after puberty?</p>
<p>Given that the man was suffering from some form of achondroplasia/dwarfism prior to his growth spurt, it's entirely possible that in his specific circumstance, his epiphyseal plates never closed, be it due to some genetic mutation, pubertal hormone deficiency, or other unknown cause. This would leave him primed for exponential growth the moment his acromegaly onset - unlike most other patients with the same disease.</p>
