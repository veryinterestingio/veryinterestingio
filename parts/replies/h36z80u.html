			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, both predator and pray do benefit from the signaling behavior as they both conserve energy when they avoid a chase. Thus its evolutionary favorable for the antelope to display it and the predator to believe it.</p>
<p>This is hard to fake because the antelope is actually taking more risk by jumping when it sees the lion instead of fleeing as soon as it can. The antelope is confident in its ability to recover and thus can take the risk in order to conserve the energy. </p>
<p>This of course leads to copycat behavior, so even a weak antelope might display this behavior. On the other hand predators will still chase sometimes even if the signal is displayed and there's a chance its copycat behavior. Like in all evolutionary processes a balance is eventually reached.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There might also plausibly be a direct correlation between running speed and stotting height, since both rely on general leg fitness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possibly more than just a display: quite likely a behaviour that is intended to tire out the predator even faster by provoking unecessary movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would require predators to initiate vigorous movement after seeing prey stotting, which I do not think is generally the case.  Also it seems difficult for prey to &quot;come out ahead&quot; in the exchange because stotting itself costs energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be a case where the instinctive behavior of stotting serves to teach individual predators frustration, so if all antelope do it, they all benefit from reduced predation, even if understanding the behavior is not instinctive on the lions part.</p></div>		</li>
