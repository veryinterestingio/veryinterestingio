			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me sleeping on a futon at a friend's house. Except my completely cold and dead arm fell across my face and woke me up.  </p>
<p>I woke up in a panic with something cold and heavy covering my eyes and nose and I tried to grab it with my dominant right arm only to find my arm won't respond. I came flying off the futon arm just flopping and tripped and ate it tangled up in the sheets with only 1 arm to brace myself.</p>
<p>About 2 seconds after I landed I realized my right arm was beginning to tingle and I put 2 + 2 together and felt really stupid. Scared the shit out of me though and took hours to go back to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened to me once also. My arm felt huge. Felt so much pain when it started to come back alive also. Looked a million fucking needles jamming into every part of my arm.</p></div>		</li>
