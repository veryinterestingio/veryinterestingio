			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the full picture. The concept of viral load is very relevant and no healthy person will get infected from a low number of virus particles; that's not just getting lucky with low probability, but rather minimum exposure thresholds existing for transmissibility.</p>
<p>The reason for this is the existence of the very underappreciated innate immune system, which is your first line of defense before the much better-known adaptive immune system kicks in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system</a></p>
<p>Your innate immune system essentially has a clearance rate that balances against the reproductive rate of the virus. As long as it can clear faster than the total number of virus particles can reproduce, you'll resist the infection.</p>
<p>The sheer numbers we're talking about — a single cough can have <em>hundreds of millions</em> of individual virus particles — make the microcosmic probability aspects collapse into a very deterministic equation.</p>
<p>Viral load and minimum exposure thresholds are exactly why indoor environments and low-ventilation areas are so problematic; it's easy to build up concentrations that are guaranteed to overwhelm the innate immune system of anyone with only a few minutes of exposure. And once that happens, if your adaptive immune system isn't already primed for response, it's going to be a rough time as the comparatively glacial adaptive immune response catches up to the runaway viral growth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So this makes me wonder, if a sub critical amount of virus enters and is eradicated by the innate immune system, where does that leave immunity?</p>
<p>Can you get immunity from this minimal amount of contact in the wild?  Or does a virus always have to overwhelm the innate immune system for the adaptive one to develop immunity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. This is a nuance I haven't seen talked about often enough. Viral load is very relevant, and inoculation/rebreathing seems to have a negative effect. Free air exchange helps us massively.</p>
<p>People would always cite the &quot;minimum effective dose&quot; for infection as one viral particle... which, while makes sense mechanically, is quite unrealistic given the body's natural defences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there a certain threshold of infected cells that the virus needs to infect too? One infected cell  isn't enough to start an infection with any virus. Could be wrong about that though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would also be a probability function: some percentage of newly-produced particles from the first cell tumble into ACE2 receptors on other cells, infecting them and reproducing more, and the cycle continues. Infection requires this process to hit whatever critical mass it takes to be self-sustaining, but I don’t think we have any idea what the mean minimum infectious dose would be (and it would only be a statistical average, not an absolute threshold).</p>
<p>But it seems certain that more virus particles inhaled —&gt; higher chance of infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it's cloudy out, a substantial amount of UVA makes it through, which does kill/disable the virus to some degree (I won't speculate about how much).</p></div>		</li>
