			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/fired#" target="_blank">dictionary.com's</a> etymology of &quot;to fire&quot;, which looks like it's just using an older version of Online Etymology Dictionary.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The sense of &quot;sack, dismiss&quot; is first recorded 1885 in American English (earlier &quot;throw (someone) out&quot; of some place, 1871), probably from a play on the two meanings of discharge: &quot;to dismiss from a position,&quot; and &quot;to fire a gun,&quot; fire in the second sense being from &quot;set fire to gunpowder,&quot; attested from 1520s.</p>

<p>Nothing against you, just the question.</p>
<p>Edit: ELI5 how to type</p>
<p>And i mean a question where a solid answer is just an easily understandable sentence lifted from the first hits on google. Plenty of stuff you can google that still makes for good questions here.</p></div>		</li>
