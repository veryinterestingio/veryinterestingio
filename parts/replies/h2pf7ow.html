			<div class="markdown"><p>The first documented case in the US was in the 80 but it’s speculated it may be early as 1930s HIV was found. The wide belief is first documented case was actually in 1959 in Africa. It’s crazy to think how long HIV has been known but yet a vaccine remains elusive.</p></div>		</li>
