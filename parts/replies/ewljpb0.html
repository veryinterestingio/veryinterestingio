			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a nail clipper to one in my armpit in my teens and it was the worst pain I've ever felt. I had a doctor stick a rod in my nose and smack it with a hammer to realign it (re-brake) and straighten it out with no anesthesia, that was a close second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one hanging out from my armpit, and after determining I was too scared/clumsy to cut it off (and too cheap to pay a doctor to remove it), I used dental floss wrapped several times around the base of the tag to choke off its blood supply. Took a week and half for it to turn purple, burst (I wiped down with rubbing alcohol), shrivel, dry up, and fall off at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the skin tag was turning more and more purple, I tied more dental floss tighter at the base to prevent any blood/liquid from the tag from flowing back. When it burst, clear liquid came out (no smell), but I wiped with rubbing alcohol just in case. After the tag fell off it has not grown back and left no trace that it has ever been there.</p>
<p>Only pain (a bit of a pinch) was in the beginning when I tied the skin tag.</p>
<p>I am so glad I didn't take a nail clipper/scissor/knife to the tag, especially since the skin tag just squished around the sharp edge whenever I attempted to put pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have exactly one in my armpit. I took a swig of whiskey and clipped it off with fingernail clippers that I had sterilized a few years ago. It hurt like a bitch. It grew back to be nearly identical within about a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tied a piece of floss around mine and it eventually died due to loss of circulation and fell off. Still painful but manageable. I considered the nail clipper thing so many times but never had the balls.</p></div>		</li>
