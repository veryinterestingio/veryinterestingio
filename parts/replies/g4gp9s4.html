			<div class="markdown"><p>Not likely. Manufacturing the vaccine correctly and proving you can do it every time takes several months. Most companies that are close to making through phase 3 trials will stick to their vaccine despite someone else beating them to the punch. The amount of vaccines demanded by world is far too high for this to be shouldered by one company.</p>
<p>Source: I'm a Biomedical Manufacturing Associate producing one of the vaccines. We're slated to produce 100M doses next year with the first production run being somewhere around November</p>
<p>Edit: November this year</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh absolutely, were cranking them out in hopes that the phase threes come up positively. The shelf life is pretty long and phase threes are very sure to come back with good results</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think so. Some vaccines will be cheaper to produce, some may be easier to store and therefore be easier to adopt in less developed or hotter countries. Some may work better in different ages. I don’t think vaccine development will stop but it may slow as there will be less of a rush.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are potentially billions of people who need the drug. all manufacturers succeeding in their clinical trials and outputting vaccines as fast as humanly possible will still not be enough for everyone.</p>
<p>i foresee all of them coming to market and you just get vaccines based on your region or hospital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’ll keep on with their studies.  No one vaccine could quickly ramp up to vaccine the whole world, and since production has already commenced on several promising options, the best-case scenario is that every trial is successful.  If that were the case, already-manufactured vaccines could be used, and production lines could remain intact.</p>
<p>Many of these vaccine candidates are entirely different in how they vaccinate, and manufacturing is accordingly different.  You can’t just swap over a vaccine factory in a day or week to make the first option.</p>
<p>If a vaccine works, it will sell.  So every vaccine with a reasonable path forward will keep on that path to be able to sell their vaccine.  And there are billions of buyers.</p>
<p>Parts of the world will not be getting a vaccine until late 2021 or even 2022 even if every candidate does great.  It’s a monumental task.</p></div>		</li>
