			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep true. I switched to using thermal pads for all my builds. They perform a couple of degrees worse than fresh thermal paste, but they don’t degrade over time, and so for me it’s worth the trade off (especially since I’m not overclocking anyway).</p>
<p>And they are reusable and much simpler to deal with when assembling machines or changing out parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but always try to hold them as close to right side up as you can. If you flip them upside down they tend to blow REALLY cold air that condenses water in the air and can kill your components</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but hold fans in place, they can get damaged if they rotate too fast (not sure if a concern with air cans but it's certainly is one with a compressor). Air cans do leave some residue though which isn't per se harmful but some contain bitterants which can damage circuit boards, canned air for electronics usually doesn't have that though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who's hoovered/vacuumed his pc plenty of times, I doubt it's that likely to damage anything.</p>
<p>Just don't hoover/vacuum the fans at 100000rpm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most likely answer in my opinion. People underestimate how much thermal effects your cpu and gpu. And there is so much dust that humans generate. If there is a smoker in your house then you can also get sticky dust that gums up the fans even more.</p></div>		</li>
