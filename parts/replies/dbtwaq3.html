			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this it comes down to substrate usage.  Your body uses 3 energy systems to power muscle contractions.  Atp-cp, glycogen, and oxidative.  Each of the 3 systems produces ATP at a different rates, produce different types and amounts of metabolic wastes, are stored in different capacities in the body, and because of this, are able to work for different periods of time. The atp-cp system is responsible for most of the energy provided during sprinting. <a href="https://cdn2.omidoo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full/images/bydate/20131014/chart2.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> chart gives an idea of how long it takes for each system to kick in and provide most of the bodies energy for an activity.  The actual limiting factor for sprinting long distances is the relatively low supply of ATP ready to be used in the body combined with the time required to clear metabolic waste and produce more ATP by the other systems.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In Plain English</p>
<p>Due to the time-line, the oxidative system provides energy much more slowly than the other two systems, but has an almost unlimited supply (in your adipose sites - yeah, that stuff you can pinch!). The oxidative system by itself is used primarily during complete rest and low-intensity activity. It can produce ATP through either fat (fatty acids) or carbohydrate (glucose).</p>
<p>Because fatty acids take more time to breakdown than glucose, more oxygen is needed for complete combustion. If efforts are intense and the cardiovascular system cannot supply oxygen quickly enough, carbohydrate must produce ATP. However, in very long duration activities (i.e., marathons), carbohydrates can become depleted and the body looks to fat as the energy producer.</p>
<p>A Few Words on Protein</p>
<p>In extended activities protein can be used as a “last resort” for energy production (in rare cases where carbohydrates are depleted and stored fat is minimal). In such cases, it can supply as much as 18% of total energy requirements. The building blocks of protein - amino acids - can be either converted into glucose (via gluconeogenisis) or other sources used in the Krebs cycle, such as acA. But understand protein cannot supply energy at the same rate as carbohydrates and fats, thus it’s basically a non-issue).</p>
<p>Programming for the Energy Systems</p>
<p>It is estimated that the ATP-PC and glycolytic systems can be improved up to 20% and the oxidative system by a whopping 50% (but in untrained subjects only). Regardless, sport-specific conditioning plans and optimal nutritional intake need to be implemented. But be aware of the reality of genetics: your unalterable muscle fiber composition plays a huge role. If you possess predominately slow type I fibers (endurance) or fast type II fibers (strength), you can only do so much. For me, this explains why I never got a sniff of any national-level competitions back in the early 1980s.</p>

<p>Is there a way to 'test' what your natural ratio of Type I to Type II fibers are?  Either medically or informally on the track with a stop watch?</p></div>		</li>

<p>800m is a like a 50-50 combo of the two, meaning 50% of work(=power*time) comes from each muscle type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is why I always considered the 800m to be one of the two most grueling races in high school track. (the other being the 300 hurdles, my state didn't have steeple chase)</p>
<p>The 800m when run at a competitive level is basically a sprint. My 400 splits in my PR 800 were better than half of our 400 runners PRs and I wasn't even close to the best 800 runner on the team (we had three sub 2:00 800 runners in my senior class).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to hate the 800. I ran the 300 hurdles and 4x4 so naturally coach wanted me to try it. He put me in the JV 4x8 as a test and purposely blew it so I wouldn't be asked again. I ran a little too slow and he was pissed because it was obvious, but he didn't ask me to do it again. </p>
<p>That race was way too difficult. Easier to make a distance guy try to sprint than to try to get a sprinter to run a longer distance. A couple of our distance guys stepped down all the way to the 400, one was even good enough to be an alternate for the main 4x4 team.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our best 800 runner was a 400 runner who was just naturally very gifted. He'd only do sprints all year long, but toward the end of the year, around the city meet, he'd jump in the 800 and kill it. He won the 400 and the 800 our senior year, and I think he came in 2nd in the 200, plus our 4x400 won as well. We had a great team that year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to states for discus when I was in high school, and ran long distance sometimes for funsies since I usually only had a few heats when I threw. I wasn't great but I still ran a ~6 min mile at my best. </p>
<p>At states one year a guy on our 4x800 relay team tore his ACL and they asked me if I could fill in for him. I said yes to be a team player but it was a grave mistake. I ran as hard as I could and basically blacked out at the finish line but we still finished last by a considerable margin. I mean I'm proud I showed out for my team but I ran that race for the first time ever at the state championships and felt like I was going to die. I had never even run a relay before, let alone the 4x800.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source : Ran both, but now focus on the 800m and did a sub 1.50 this year!?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about this when there is a chase on foot in movies. The characters wouldn't be able to sprint at full speed for more than like 20sec, so they would have to pace themselves. The only movie I remember where this happens is Rock'n'Rolla.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just started watching Dirk Gently with Elijah Wood. There's a great foot chase in the first episode between two main characters. It lasts for all of 250 meters before they're both winded and attempting to talk it out instead. Definitely felt more realistic and added to the humor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just finished watching Dirk Gently.
Genuinely think it's one of the best things I saw in 2016.
It's insane, it's captivating, it's brutal, it's clever, it's funny, it's just brilliant.
My favourite element to it was Bart
She is such a complex character that makes complete sense, you get to see her change completely yet stay the same, she has the most tender moment of the entire series whilst being easily the most brutal character. I see her as the Punisher, but much cooler and so much funnier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try Death Sentence with Kevin Bacon. There's an on-foot chase about an hour in that's one, continuous shot lasting over 5mins. By the end of it, Bacon is knackered and gasping, and I have no idea if it was authentic or not, but definitely one of the best foot chase sequences I've ever seen on film. </p></div>		</li>
