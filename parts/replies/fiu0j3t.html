			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I have random cramping in those smooth muscle fibers, and it hurts so bad I thought I had appendicitis and the doctors didnt actually know what it was until I went to a specialist. Pain medication does absolutely nothing for those muscles and feels like a knife is being twisted in my gut</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I had to specify, I'd say it feels like someone was grabbing my colon, squeezing it and twisting it. It hurts so much for what is really just nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate this when I’m driving. It has gotten bad enough to the point where I have felt like I need to pull over and wait for it to be done with. Incredibly painful, and sucks when it happens when you are talking to people or you are walking and have to slow down or just stop until the “attack” is over.</p></div>		</li>

I still can't find a way to describe it more accurately than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooooh! I sometimes have this but not regularly enough to want to do anything about it. Same with the 'someone's cat with knives for nails is clawing at my intestines' kind of cramps. :o </p>
<p>I have had periods where the cramps were so bad I had to sit very very still for a few minutes to half an hour and wait for it to pass, but haven't had serious cramps in months/years now. Once had to tell my teacher/supervisor to please wait for a bit before trying to explain to me how to do part of my analyses because I couldn't concentrate on anything she said or pointed out because of the pain...</p></div>		</li>

Makes your poop perfect consistently was key, no cracks on it, not too dark, not in pieces... then those pains just vanish</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify; while they're fundamentally different than pain cells (which are specialized nerve cells) there are special muscle cells woven into all our muscles. These bundles relay information about how stretched they are. This is how you can close your eyes and know where your hand is in space. When they stretch too far, those bundles of cells let us know with a signal we perceive as pain so that we don't injure the muscle tissue.</p>
<p>These bundles are woven into the smooth muscle of our intestinal tract as well, which is why we feel big farts as painful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This person is not correct, muscle spindles are the thing they are talking about but they are only present in skeletal muscle. </p>
<p>In smooth muscle, you get increased calcium release related to the level of stretch of the muscle cells themselves. This changes how the innervating nerve fires, and makes it spontaneously discharge, which is interpreted as painful by the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called the muscle spindle. We have a bunch of nerves attached to that which communicate to the brain how long the muscle spindle is, and our brain interpret that information to figure out where in space our body-bits are, or, if the spindle is too long, it will interpret that as &quot;possible owie&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more a different method your body uses to sense potential damage. Strictly speaking, &quot;pain&quot; receptors are nerve cells that respond to various stimuli (called nocireceptors). Each nocireceptor is triggered by a specific stimulus. Some react to chemicals (such as those released when cells are damaged, like when you cut your hand), some react to heat, and some react to mechanical stimuli such as pressure or stretch.</p>
<p>These stretch receptors are wrapped around the muscle spindle (a bundle of muscle fibre that exists just to report back how long, or stretched, it is.) Long story short, the muscle spindle tells the stretch receptors how long it is, and if it's longer than our brain expects it should be, we interpret that as pain. If that stretch causes a tear, chemoreceptors notice some cellstuff that falls out of the damaged cell body and tells us that something tore, and we interpret that as pain as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically pain is only the output from the brain, inputs are potentially nociceptive, and the integration occurs in the higher centres, and involves the messages recieved from the peripheries on mechanical deformation (stretch in this case), chemical exposure, or thermal exposure, the emotional state, and historical experiences of nociception and pain.</p>
<p>This is why things hurt more when you're sleep deprived, if you anticipate pain etc. Or why people who live with chronic pain find touch inputs can be confused with nociception. Or why people who get shot in tense situations are able to function until the situation settles, or they notice a big hole in themselves.</p></div>		</li>
