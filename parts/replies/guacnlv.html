			<div class="markdown"><p>When you feel the lump and crying feeling starting, take your tongue off the roof of your mouth and run it along your bottom teeth. If your tongue is still on the roof of your mouth no matter what you do, curl a finger and bite your molars down on it while still maintaining calm, deep breaths.
Im not sure the science behind it, but opening your mouth and taking the tongue off the roof of the mouth helps the emotions come out without being a &quot;full display&quot;, if you will. </p>
<p>Add this to deep breaths and work on removing any self imposed judgement about crying and you can work through an emotional episode in seconds or minutes instead of bottling it up and having it eventually be a big explosion of feelings. </p>
<p>Also, as a preventative measure, if you ever feel sad or just generally down, take your fingers to the corners of your mouth and push your mouth into a smile. It's ridiculous, but no matter what, you will naturally smile after a few seconds and feel a wave of energy return in place of whatever negative emotions were there.</p></div>		</li>
