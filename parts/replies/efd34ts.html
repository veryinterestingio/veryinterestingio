			<div class="markdown"><p>When somebody says &quot;low temperature,&quot; or &quot;low <em>blank</em>&quot; where &quot;<em>blank</em>&quot; is anything with units, you should always immediately ask: low compared to what? It makes no sense to call a quantity with dimensions inherently small, you need to compare it with something else.</p>
<p>So to answer what &quot;low temperature&quot; means: in a lot of systems, there is some characteristic energy scale E, and low temperature means T is much smaller than E/k_B where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. Often, if k_B T/E is very small, we can safely approximate the system as being at zero Kelvin, and we get basically all of the physics correct up to small corrections (the corrections are usually of the size of k_B T/E).</p>
<p>So anyways, what is E/k_B for the nuclear decay mentioned by /u/VeryLittle? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_energy" target="_blank">Decay energies</a> are usually in the range of keV-MeV. This corresponds to a E/k_B of 10 million - 10 billion Kelvin. So at most accessible temperatures, nuclear physics can be treated as taking place at absolute zero. But there are interesting cases when it cannot (the early universe being an important example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a noob layman here, but I’ve heard from admittedly unreliable sources that the reason it is impossible to cool something down the absolute zero is because “time itself stops at absolute zero”. Is there any truth behind this claim?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. It's impossible to cool anything to absolute zero because the effort required to extract energy from a system increases asymptotically as it approaches absolute zero. This is referred to as &quot;the unattainability principle&quot;, and is derived from the third law of thermodynamics. Nernst described it as: &quot;It is impossible for any process, no matter how idealized, to reduce the entropy of a system to its absolute-zero value in a finite number of operations.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is also not true. Particles still move at absolute zero, they're just in the ground state.</p></div>		</li>
