			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Sound&quot; in the geographical sense is even more ambiguous than &quot;Sea&quot;.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, it is a fjord on steroids that was named or re-named by an English explorer. An area bounded by land [especially steep terrain] on at least two sides, both of which you can see while sailing between them. They are usually very deep, formed where the sea meets a broad river or runs between a peninsula or large island and the mainland. Washington has Puget Sound, Manhattan sits at the west/south end of Long Island Sound, the sound then narrows into East River which is a narrow spot connecting the Sound to the Harbor, and both of those in turn are connected to the open sea on both ends, so &quot;East River&quot; is not actually a river...</p>
<p>In some sense, Delaware &amp; Chesapeake Bay areas could both be sounds, at least in the narrower areas; but the explorers naming the areas charted them both as Bays and they have remained &quot;bay&quot; since.</p>
<p>&quot;Strait&quot; usually refers to a type of Sound that connects to open sea on both ends, though the term is used as loosely as &quot;Sound&quot; is and has only loose meaning unless you are a geologist; and if you are a geologist you probably hate that non-geologists got to name everything, not to mention that they named everything while having no idea what the hell they were talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here. Can confirm that waterbody names are ambiguous and frustrating. Bay, bayou, gulf, sound, bight, estuary, creek, lagoon, basin... None of these have standard definitions as far as I'm aware, or if there are standard definitions, no one has used them to name waterbodies in our area (northern Gulf of Mexico).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The word sound (or in many languages sund/sond/sunt/etc) goes back to proto-Germanic, i.e bronze-age or earlier, and even further in linguistic history.<br />
The word holds the same meaning in Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, German, English, Scots and also French (which is the odd one out, not being a Germanic language). </p>

<p>After reading him as a child, I was stunned to learn in my 50s that he wrote a book on Shakespeare plays.</p>
