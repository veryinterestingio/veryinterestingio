			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Specifically the additives in the fuel and the amount of ether. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random question now, are the prices linearly correlated between 87-89-91 (or whatever the octanes are)? If the lowest one goes up 10 cents, will the highest one as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true. As with most things its marketing and price setting. Oil is a commodity and you can get high octane without a significant change in cost at scale, but higher octane can be marketed differently and therefore drives value. I studied the fuel markets professionally extensively. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For higher octane gasoline, yes due to additives and additional production steps. But between diesel and gasoline it mostly boils down to taxes. Refineries can not really push only one type of product due to how the separation of the crude oil works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true at all. The reason we saw an increase in diesel over gas is because in 2007 the EPA made all vehicle Diesel products meet a 10ppm sulfur spec. So all refineries had to build a desulfurization diesel unit at an average cost of 200mil. Also if the refinery wants to take the diesel and maximize jet fuel because the price is better thay can do that as well and send less crude diesel to the DD unit. Added more supply and demand for diesel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The price difference comes from the extra additives.
Most of the time there are only two tanks, one with the lowest (usually 87) and one with the highest (93 or so) and the ones in between are made by mixing the two at certain ratios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost fully correct. Source: I work in engine combustion research. Edit: I went more in depth than I meant to... sadly this comment will probably get burried and read by none. </p>
<p>Pinking is a actually called pinging as that's what it sounds like. Pinging is usually used when referring to knock rather than pre-ignition.</p>
<p>You're correct on pre-ignition (that it happens before spark), however, true pre-ignition is rare(ish) and often one pre-ignition event like you've described is enough to kill the ending. Pre-ignition is making a comeback though in a major way in engines which are downsized, direct injected, and turbocharged. This newer phenomenon is known as LSPI (low-speed pre-ignition) or Super-Knock.</p>
<p>What one is usually trying to avoid when using higher octane fuels is good-old fashioned engine knock. Knock is the spontaneous ignition of the remaining air-fuel mixture ahead of the flame front after the spark event has started combustion. In the ideal scenario, the sparkplug creates a kernel which turns into a flame front that propagates in a controlled manner (at a certain speed known as the turbulent flame speed) until the flame is quenched against the cylinder walls. When the engine knocks  (i.e. the spontaneous reaction of the fuel and oxygen not yet consumed) the cylinder pressure and temperature spike massively. Usually the piston is aleady on its way down though so it's not quite as catastrophic of a failure as with pre-ignition. The severity of knock is dependent on how far into combustion it occurs, in some cases engine tuners will even aim to have the engine knock just a tiny bit, they're looking for end gas detonation which ensures they're really getting everything they can from the engine. Most engines are knock limited meaning if you're running right on the knock threshold then you're making peak power and optimal efficiency. </p>
<p>I'm getting a bit lazy now but if this comment does well I can explain how modern cars actually knock all the time by design. Oems use advanced controls to keep the cars right on the edge of knock. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea of purposeful knock is actually very prominent when talking about chemical supercharging NOS. NOS isn't actually flammable, however the combustion in an engine separates the nitrogen and oxygen and continues the downward force later into the power stroke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda, but you are missing some key points. The reason for nitrous use is because you are forcing more oxygen into the combustion chamber by the separation of the nitrogen and oxygen atoms. This alone is not enough without the addition of fuel as well. That is what increases power in an engine. It's always how much oxygen and fuel you can stuff in the combustion chamber. Someone above mentioned ethanol based fuels and inefficiency. That also is a semi truth. E85 and E90 fuels can make much more power than their gasoline counter parts. This is because you can add more timing to detonate earlier in the power stroke with higher ethanol content (More timing=More power almost always). Using it to ensure full ignition when the cylinder is at it's highest pressure. It is purposeful knock, but every engine tuner out there is creating purposeful knock to increase power. With and without nitrous. </p>
<p>Now, if you get into a situation where you have too much air and not enough fuel you create pre-detonation, which as you know is very bad. That's when you have too much nitrous (or boost) for your application.</p>
<p>Again, you weren't wrong. Just wanted to clarify it a bit.</p></div>		</li>
