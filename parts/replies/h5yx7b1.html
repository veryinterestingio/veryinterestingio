			<div class="markdown"><p>This might explain why when the first time I had weed, via a brownie and it turned out I ingested more weed than my stoner roommate smokes in a few days, I ended up spending 6+ hours having paranoid delusions of not being able to tell the difference between what I was thinking and what was actually happening. </p>
<p>Probably didn't help that I ate them and then immediately went to bed, so I woke up in the middle of the night HIGH AS SHIT having no idea what was happening or what to expect. </p>
<p>7/10 would do again.</p></div>		</li>
