			<div class="markdown"><p>You raise some very interesting points.  You are correct that there is evidence that vaccines like pertussis and mumps have been shown to have decreasing immunity with increasing time since vaccination.  For pertussis, the group most at risk for serious complications are young infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated against the disease.  They can be protected when mothers have antibodies against the pertussis organism, which are transferred across the placenta.  Because of waning, pregnant women are recommended to be vaccinated against pertussis in each pregnancy so that they can transfer their antibodies to their fetuses who will in turn be protected in the first months of life.  For mumps, there is a recommendation to consider a 3rd dose in outbreak situations.  Because mumps is still relatively rare and because the duration of immunity after a 3rd dose is not known, a 3rd dose is not recommended routinely.  </p>
<p>I think a universal influenza vaccine is extremely important.  There are some candidates that look promising.  A major problem with influenza is that we tend to focus our immune response against a part of the virus that can vary.  Influenza viruses mutate and then escape the immunity conferred by prior vaccination or prior influenza infection.  There are some promising candidates.</p>
<p>Another vaccine that has been difficult to develop is an HIV vaccine.  There are some promising candidates and it would be great to have a vaccine.</p>
<p>Other vaccines that are important are those against emerging infections such as Ebola.  At least 2 candidates have looked very promising.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can’t babies just get the dtap? If the mom can get it while pregnant and help protect the fetus why can’t women who didn’t get it while pregnant just get the baby vaccinated? I don’t understand what the time period of waiting is to delay babies getting these vaccinations. I got the dtap while pregnant and was wondering why the baby can’t just get that one until a certain age. I’m sure there is a good reason I’m just not sure why say- a baby has to wait til 6 months for first flu shot etc. is it that their immune system is just too immature? But then if immunity is passed to the fetus is that not too immature as well? How is the effect of a vaccine different for a fetus vs a new baby?</p></div>		</li>
