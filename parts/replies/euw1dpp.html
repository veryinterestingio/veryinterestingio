I think you can have a reasonable discussion about “flexible base load.” For example, you could argue with enough wind and solar and some energy storage (pumped storage or batteries to support it) that is sufficient. </p>

<li>
<p>See the answer about efficiency from my colleague to another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/chm70g/askscience_ama_series_were_from_the_pacific/euxe2ue?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x" target="_blank">redditor</a>, but short answer, round-trip efficiency is about 80%. It’s an efficient resource.  </p>
</li>

<p>Also, see the other answer.</p>

<p>Yes, transmission losses are significant, but our system is reasonably optimized and those losses are minimized. Ideally, you would locate your generation as close to your load as possible, but it’s not always possible because of where the resource is available. On average, transmission and distribution losses are about 8% across the system.</p>

<p>The 22 GW number is for the U.S. The Australian National University has conducted a study estimating that there are 616,000 potential sites. That is a hundred times greater than what the world needs for a 100% renewable electric system. See: <a href="http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global/" target="_blank"><a href="http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global/" target="_blank">http://re100.eng.anu.edu.au/global/</a></a>. The site breaks down estimates by region.</p>

<p>There are no ideal elevations or reservoir sizes. It is all specific site-dependent. Generally speaking though, the higher the upper reservoir, the less reservoir capacity you need to hold the same energy (the equation you mention, energy = mass * gravitational constant * height). Reservoir depth and surface area also depend on the site. You want to build what is cheapest to achieve your desired outcome.</p>
</li>

<p>Again, see the other answers about technology costs. Pumped storage is the most mature of the storage technologies, but that said, battery costs have been coming down significantly. At the moment, lithium-ion is the battery technology of choice, with low costs helped along by research and production at scale from the electronics and electric vehicle industries (it is basically the same battery packaged differently). But on a per energy and per power basis, it is still more expensive than pumped storage. Pumped storage, however, is generally a much larger plant and therefore project costs in aggregate are higher.</p>
</li>
<li>See the other response about this as well. Pumped storage is measured in both power (watt) and energy (watt-hour). The instantaneous generating or pumping capacity is the power. The total amount of storage is the energy held. A 100MW plant with 8 hours of capacity is a 100MW/800MWh plant.</li>
