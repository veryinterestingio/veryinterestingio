			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it depends on how you shake it.  Shake it perfectly up and down and there's no flexing of the bottle?  Water is probably not getting mixed up, except for the miniscule amount that water is compressible.</p>
<p>Spin the bottle? Friction will mix the water up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah not true, internal drag forces from the bottle edges are going to cause velocity gradients, and then internal flows. Even in a hypothetical 100%-filled bottle</p></div>		</li>
