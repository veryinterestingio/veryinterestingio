From the wikipedia page on the litre:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One litre of water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at about 4 Â°C. Similarly: one millilitre (1 mL) of water has a mass of about 1 g; 1,000 litres of water has a mass of about 1,000 kg (1 tonne). This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1 mL of water; <strong>however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.</strong></p>
