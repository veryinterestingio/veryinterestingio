			<div class="markdown"><p>The only key point it's missing is that China and India also had wide access to an important crop: Rice. Rice is ultra efficient when it comes to the idea of not starving to death, and the fact it grows in water would help kill out competing weeds. It's a more efficient food source than wheat and other comparable crops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that massive population would also be a very large liability. </p>
<p>That population needs fed, and in a total war, cropland will be a massive target. It doesn't take a whole lot when you destroy the food source for a nations war effort to collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern warfare doesn't work such that millions of soldiers are necessarily an asset. You need to be able to feed, arm, transport, and otherwise maintain that army. Meanwhile, infantry by itself is extremely vulnerable. An army of millions of soldiers can be defeated without any of them firing a shot through modern air power.</p></div>		</li>
