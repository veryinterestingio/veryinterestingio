There are also many agricultural applications too. Heritable CRISPR in people is so complicated and ethically thorny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about CRISPR as a treatment for genetic mutations?  A simple base pair change (or maybe insertion or deletion) or insertion/deletion of a sequence at a given locus?  Are those becoming more pissible/ethical? </p>
<p>I'm a little rusty on the various delivery systems for CRISPR too.  How would such a treatment be delivered if there were 1 speific target area (targeting a spontaneous mutation for example) as opposed to using a viral vector to change every cell in the body (if that's possible at all)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great questions.
CRISPR or other gene editing could be the basis for addressing harmful mutations in people, and there many labs researching that. I think a key factor is whether one wants to try this in actual people after the fact (treat) or in human embryos (prevent). As to the latter, embryo screening is already an effective, safe approach, although it has some ethical issues too.
Delivery issues don't get enough attention! They are really important.</p></div>		</li>
