			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only actual ELI5-Answer in this thread. So many replies just go into great detail about what exactly makes the difference, but nobody answers the actual question of *why* the differences start to occur in the earliest stages when everything is still more or less the same.  </p>
<p>Good job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the earliest stages, cells decide what to be through the notochord. It's a chord that runs from head to butt, almost like a spine. Everything develops based on that.</p>
<p>Then cells signal to each other what they are so adjacent ones know what to do. For example, skin cells will induce nearby cells to also become skin. That way, you don't have a bone cell growing nex to skin cell next to nerve cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. The earliest time there's genetic differentiation is when the genome switches on at the 4-8 cell stage. You already get left right patterning through nodal flow involving Hensen's node. Then you have gastrulation occuring through the primitive streak which occurs before formation of the notochord - cells are already determined into the germ layers at this point. </p>
<p>Somitic differentiation only occurs once the mesoderm has formed into its constituents, including the chordamesoderm (becomes notochord) and paraxial mesoderm (becomes somites). Skin cells are so because they form from the dermomytome region on the somite, a more accurate statement (just more detail - you're correct) is saying you don't have a bone cell growing next to a skin cell because the dermatome and the sclerotome are distinct regions of the somite. And you don't have nerve cells growing next to skin cells because nerve cells are ectodermally derived from the neural plate (which I think forms from the area of the ectoderm above the notochord). </p>
<p>But I mean you do have nerves running throughout the skin layers eventually, once synaptogenesis has developed significantly</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A part of this worth looking at is inter-cellular signalling.</p>
<p>Especially during early development, cells will &quot;claim&quot; roles. For example, a cell may decide it's in a good spot to differentiate into a nerve cell. Outside of the brain, there's not a lot of nerve cells in one area (compared to, as an example, muscle cells which come in organized, dense bundles). This cell will release a chemical that's basically the cell saying, &quot;Hey, I'm gonna be a nerve cell, nobody else be a nerve cell!&quot; And nearby, the other cells will receive that signal and decide &quot;Oh boy, nerve cell is taken. Maybe I'll be a muscle cell or something.&quot;</p>
<p>To go a little deeper, it does this by locking that part of the DNA away. This process is called epigenetics, but basically it wraps the DNA up in layers of tight coils that the DNA reading and RNA producing proteins can't get through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder about the first cell, right after a sperm fertilizes an egg to form a person‚Äùs first cell, and the cell divides into 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. at what point do these cells specialize? At what point are red blood cells and veins required for the organism as it embiggens?</p></div>		</li>
