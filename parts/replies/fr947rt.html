			<div class="markdown"><p>The quantity of steam generated is being ignored in many of these comments because they’re thinking of a campfire versus a structure fire.</p>
<p>Convert just a few gallons of water into vapor (steam), and that’ll displace a substantial amount of oxygen, enough to get some knock-down anyway. Then it cools off a bit, some steam condenses, and because the heat is still there or the fire is in the walls or the attic, and the job begins anew, trying to rout it out like peeling an onion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1000% this gets buried but thanks u/shouldabeenapirate for a great explanation. There’s always the false assumption water will put out any fire (ignorance, cool it off, etc.) I know the original question was about water extinguishing fires but a high level deeper dive may help the op. </p>
<p>This is no slight against you and your professionalism, I thank you for all you do. Please correct me if I’m wrong.  My experience is as a merchant mariner with USCG STCW requirements. </p>
<p>This is mostly for anyone that may see your post as its high up. This is redundant to you. </p>
<p>Water (and latent heat of energy referenced above) are mostly specific to a class A fire. Water can saturate (wet wood for a campfire doesn’t burn well), or absorb so much energy the fire can’t sustain itself (the time it takes to boil water, but in reverse). </p>
<p>An easy Fire science 101 is:</p>
<p>A - Ash: it could burn in a camp fire.
B - Boil: (Oil) too much oil in you turkey deep frier on Thanksgiving and your porch is on fire. Also, oil floats on water so... Don’t use water.
C - Current: you flipped a light switch and your cell charger/wall is on fire. Don’t use water. Switch off the switch/source then see class A.
D - Metal fire... nope.  Magnesium etc. Time is your friend. Try sand. Water is fuel.
K - Kitchen. Specialty equipment installed in restaurants but essentially a “B” fire on a deep fryer in the back of your favorite restaurant. Relies on saponification of the cooking oil. </p>
<p>Fire extinguishers (everyone has one right?) come in various classes with different mediums to extinguish. </p>
<p>Water will always work on a class A fire, no guarantee how long it will take. </p>
<p>Most useful in the household is an “ABC” (Ash, Boil, Current) extinguisher. ABC-type typically use a powder to interrupt/blanket/suffocate a fire and break the fire quadrilateral (fuel, heat, oxygen, chemical reaction) referenced above by removing oxygen or breaking the chemical reaction. </p>
<p>BC extinguishers work on “BC” (Boil, Current) fires and use (primarily) CO2 to suffocate (get rid of oxygen) the reaction. Useful for a small oil fire, or sensitive electronics where the powdered media of an ABC may damage sensitive components. The CO2 displaces oxygen long enough to break the oxygen component of the fire quadrilateral. </p>
<p>For a kitchen pan, covering (smothering) or baking soda (breaking the chemical reaction) is effective, the sink is not. Only the vapors of an oil fire are “on fire”; the displacement of oxygen by CO2 will extinguish a class B fire, however the powder media from an ABC extinguisher (baking soda) may prevent re-ignition by settling on the liquid surface.  </p>
<p>Class C fires involve energized electrical equipment so water is always a bad idea; once de-energized any remaining fire should be treated as class A unless flammable liquids are present. The CO2 suppresses  the fire until de-energized, water will take the rest of the heat out. </p>
<p>As u/shouldabeenapirate referenced, there are specific media and additives that can be included depending on the circumstances. A great example is AFFF, aka firefighting foam. Typically used in fuel (oil, gas, diesel, jp5,etc.) fires, it coats the fuel surface in a foam creating an oxygen barrier and preventing the chemical reaction while cooling the fire (latent heat ).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, in Australia there are similar but different classes. A is the same, B is combustible liquids, C is gases- think propane, D is combustible metals, E is an electrical fire, F is cooking oils and fats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the appreciation. You’ve added some great information.</p>
<p>One thing that surprised me when dealing with fire extinguishers was how quickly they run out and how important it is to properly use them because of this. </p>
<p>Pull the pin
Aim at base of fire
Squeeze handle
Sweep side to side</p></div>		</li>
