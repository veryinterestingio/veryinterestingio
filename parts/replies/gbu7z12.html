			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the parent comment is the best eli5 answer. For further reading, a part of the brain called the angular gyrus has been implicated in having a role in L/R confusion.</p>
<p>Some other comments mention the L/R confusion co-presents with other issues like not being able to read/write/do simple math well; these deficits are also associated with the angular gyrus in some way.</p>
<p>It's function isn't 100% clear but we definitely know its a key component in language comprehension. It also plays roles in memory and spatial recognition which may be it's link to L/R confusion.</p></div>		</li>
