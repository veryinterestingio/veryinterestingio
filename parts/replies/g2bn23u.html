			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you not have different nozzles for different fuel types? At least in the UK, there is a nozzle for each type and they're just fed from different tanks. If that's not the case where you live, then there must either be some clever valve technology in the fuel line somewhere, or you are actually getting a hose full of the last guy's fuel.</p>
<p>You can safely put a small amount of petrol in a diesel tank and vice versa, as long as you dilute it with the proper fuel. Disclaimer: I absolutely do not recommend doing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have different nozzles for diesel vs gasoline. But we also have different grades of gasoline (an octane rating that's different by a few points). And to answer OP, you're absolutely getting a hose full of shit gas if you buy the good stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we generally have a different nozzle for Diesel and Gasoline, I think he's talking about octane levels.</p>
<p>Regular, Mid-level, and premium generally use the same nozzle, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US. There’s typically one hose for three or five octane grades of unleaded fuel [87/89/91/93] or some combo of that. I’m certain that the middle grades are just a ratio mix of the top and bottom grade fuel. However, it’s a single hose from the safety release coupling to the nozzle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, TIL! We have different hoses for 95 and 98 grade. That's usually the only ones we get, although I have occasionally seen others.</p>
<p>Edit: given the choice of grades we get here, I don't think I could bring myself to put 87 octane in my car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. The typical modern gas station only has storage tanks for regular and premium, if you have 3 or 5 different grades those are just mixed in different ratios out of those 2 storage tanks. This is also why “no alcohol” premium stations will only have regular and premium, anything that is not branded as premium is required to have 10% ethanol. </p>
<p>You can still find older stations that have more storage tanks and older dispensers, but any new station will be of the mixing type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! I managed a gas station for a couple years, and we only had 2 types of gas in the underground tanks but we offered 3 types. The pumps pulled from both tanks for the middle grade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are getting a hose full of the previous fuel. But it's less than half a gallon. Not really anything to be concerned about. Unless, perhaps, you have a motorcycle with a smaller tank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you not have different hoses for each one? I’m from Australia and all our hoses are the individual fuel types so that you have 2-4 hoses per filling station depending on what the petrol station offers</p></div>		</li>
