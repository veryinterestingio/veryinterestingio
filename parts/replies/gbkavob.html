			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a rare pregnancy condition called hyperemesis which is apparently very similar. I’m on all the same anti-vomiting meds they give to chemo patients and it’s still miserable. I’ve lost about 20 lbs but some women lose 50+. If hyperemesis is even half of what chemo patients go through, I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I want to add, for anyone that is going to go through chemotherapy in the future, that this is not necessarily true. I had Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) when I was 20 (eight years ago), and I don't think I ever vomited because of chemo. For ALL the primary treatment is chemo, so I have had quite a lot of chemo.</p>
<p>I don't want people that are going to sometime get chemo to be worried unnecessary. These days the antiemetic medicines are really good, and it is also very individual how well you handle the chemo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Nan was on cisplatin for sclc, and even tho cisplatin is in the highest bracket for causing vomiting she only had mild nausea, in the 4th round. Antiemetics are so well researched now, there are countless combos and options they can give you. If you are struggling with nausea and vomiting please talk to your care team, they may be able to help you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think it varies a lot, i had a lymphoma 2 years ago, and my chemio was the one that causes nausea, thar's because it killed every cell in your body that replicates fast (hair, intestin bacteria, cancer)</p>
<p>But a guy i knew in the hospital had mieloma and the drugs in his chemio didnt make him have nausea, but his immunitary system was radicated, he risked dying by a common cold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the worst pain I ever had was when I was doing infusions of 5FU that gave me these awful mouth sores. I was so incredibly bloody and in such pain and then adding vomit on top of it -- that is a hell I would not wish on anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's crazy is my mom did radiation and chemo (and bone marrow transplants) and did not throw up even once. Without anti-emetics (which were prescribed to her anyway).
She had pretty aggressive leukemia too. She was a champ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemo drugs are classified by how much nausea and vomiting they usually cause, Mild, Moderate, or High emetogenicity.
My chemo is moderately emetogenic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is one of the main benefits to using marijuana to assist in people undergoing chemo. It can assist with chronic (pun intended) conditions such as pain/nausea associated with chemotherapy with only minor side effects.</p></div>		</li>
