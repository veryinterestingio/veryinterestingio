			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly! Melanin is a dark pigment which absorbs over 99% of the UV photons (light particles) which hit it, meaning that fewer high-energy photons are available to hit DNA. Mutations caused by UV light happen when photons bump into molecules in DNA called “thymine”, which is one of the four bases that comprise the DNA code (kind of like how computers are encoded in 0 or 1, DNA is a code of A, T, C, and G). When this happens to a place in the DNA molecule where two T’s are next to each other, they unpair from the opposite strand and bond to each other, forming what’s called a “thymine dimer” and causing a bump in the DNA that leads it to be “read” incorrectly when cells divide. This leads to mutations, and over time these mutations lead to cancers. So, pretty much, the melanin absorbs all the sunlight so it doesn’t hit the DNA in cells, like a shield. People with lighter skin have less melanin, so more photons can cause the reaction that forms vitamin D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn that was a great response. I've only got a high school level of biology education, so this might be too complicated to explain, but why does UV light only damage the T and not A, C, or G?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's a question. </p>
<p>I'm caucasian, English, German, Norwegian, etc. A real mutt. </p>
<p>I Work outdoors most of the year, and never wear sunscreen (don't make this a thing please, a stranger on the internet won't change my mind). I tan a lot, enough that I'm usually darker toned than some native Americans, but I never burn. When we transition from winter to summer (very cold, very long winters), I get my tan within a month of warm/hot weather, I can honestly only remember getting burned once, and it was on my ears. </p>
<p>Then winter rolls around and within a month of wearing jackets my tan disappears. </p>
<p>Is my tan a form of protection against the sun? Or is it damage from the sun. Or is it somehow both? I'm just wondering because I go year after year without ever burning, but then friends or family who regularly use sunscreen will forget to put it on or reapply one day and burn immediately. </p>
<p>And why don't I ever burn? Is it because I get a smooth transition between the cold and heat, where my body slowly builds up protection as the sun increases its intensity? Or am I just genetically resilient to burns?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes -- the pigment is in the top layer of the skin, so it absorbs the UV rays before they can hit the cells underneath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a stupid question, do black people feel heat more intensely compared to white people since their skin reflects less sunlight than that of a white person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black also radiates far more, so the grey hairs will reflect it while the black skin will be better at losing heat than pale skin would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our European ancestors spent more time outdoors than modern office workers. So they developed a tan every summer, which acts as some defence. Also working in the Sun isn’t as bad as Sun bathing, because you are moving around and presenting different bits of skin to the sun.</p>
<p>I can get though a summer in Canada without burning, but one afternoon sunbathing in February in Miami left me with a bad case of lobster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the tilt and shape of the Earth, Miami’s sunlight is significantly more intense than Canada’s, too. Imagine shining a flashlight at the center of a basketball - the top and bottom are naturally going to be darker than where you’re shining the light, and the way sunlight hits the planet works similarly. There are a lot more photons hitting your skin per square centimeter in Miami than in Vancouver or Winnipeg or wherever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also you figure in people didn't vacation thousands of miles away from where they were born, I think the entire population as a whole was more stagnate where they lived than we are now a days.  People simply could not afford to travel long distances for &quot;vacation&quot; and there were certainly no planes or trains to take you far distances until recently.</p></div>		</li>
