			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, your teeth have blood vessels giving them nutrients. If your teeth break down, there is a direct path for the icky stuff to get into your blood stream! The blood stream is like a highway in your body. If icky stuff get in there they travel EVERYWHERE!  The icky stuff will sometimes get stuck on the valves in your heart. Valves in your heart are like doors that only open one way. They keep your blood from going in the wrong direction.  Icky stuff will cling to the valves and grow and grow until your valves become damaged! This causes problems! Yikes! Brush your teeth and floss and use mouthwash and chew sugar-free gum after drinking soda and coffee!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what does sugar-free gum do specifically after drinking soda or coffee? Or do you just mean that if you're going to chew any kind of gum at all, that it should be sugar-free? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this but still try and keep it relatively ELI5...</p>
<p>Our mouths have bacteria in them that grow. </p>
<p>Brushing and flossing every day keeps our teeth and gums clean.</p>
<p>When they aren't clean the bacteria grow and hurt our teeth and gums. </p>
<p>When teeth get hurt they get cavities. </p>
<p>When gums get hurt they get inflamed. </p>
<p>When gums get inflamed they get weak and mushy. Now the bad bacteria can get past our gums and into our bloodstream!</p>
<p>If this happens often enough and for long enough, some of the bad bacteria are going to get past our bodies other defenses and land someplace inside where they don't belong, like our hearts blood vessels! </p>
<p>That's no bueno ☹️ </p>
<p>So remember kids, brush and floss every day! 🤡</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will start to feel feverish. Some people may not feel anything if its chronic.  Some people will feel heart palpitations and what-not. I wouldn't wait for symptoms before getting your teeth fixed. If you have a cavity either get it fixed or get that tooth pulled. Keep in mind that prevention is key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went for years with just some random tooth pain.  The pain was actually worse after brushing really well (something that was rare) and actually made me LESS likely to brush or floss.  Normally your gums regress and your teeth will become lose and fall out.  With molars, you can actually have them damaged enough that they crack or in case of one that I had, it completely broke in half.  I also had some stomach issues (because I could not chew food properly, either because of tooth pain or because I have many missing teeth in the back of my mouth) and was tired a lot (ended up being mitral valve prolapse, a heart condition).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What’d you do to fix your teeth/gums? I’m currently going through this where my gums on my front bottom teeth are nearly all gone and my back molar cracked in half. I just thought it was from grinding my teeth when i sleep or something. I have no dental insurance and I’m a college student fml </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a specific amount of dental hygiene that is safe or unsafe.  The risk is related to disruption of the surfaces in the mouth which allows the bad bacteria to enter the blood in sufficient number to infect the heart valves.  Certain high risk individuals, including those with replacement heart valves, may receive an antibiotic course prior to having dental operations as a precaution. </p>
<p>Infective endocarditis is a difficult disease to diagnose!  It has symptoms that may be mild or variable and tend to be vague in that many other conditions can cause them too.  The most important system for diagnosis of infective endocarditis are the Duke criteria.  You can easily find these online if you're curious and they include many physical exam findings you can keep an eye out for if you're really worried for some reason. </p></div>		</li>
