<p>Current VR headsets still offer a decent sense of depth, but fixed focal point does limit it from being as good as it could be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't see how this would help.  The point is that a single lens makes <em>everything</em> in view appear to be the same distance away.  Yet in reality, different things are different distances, all in the same view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite what's going on.  </p>
<p>The brain does triangulation to figure out how far things are.  What happens is that objects in VR closer or further away look out of focus, they don't all look like they are at the same distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into lightfield displays, they're being developed right now and VR is a central use case! Instead of being flat, the lightfield seems to act as if the objects seen are physical. Or some such. It's cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure how those work, so can't confirm or deny.</p></div>		</li>
