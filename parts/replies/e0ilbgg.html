			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain something to me then? I was diagnosed with bipolar depression, chronic anxiety disorder in my teens. Have been on and off meds. Ive watched people smoke meth and crack and snort coke. I myself have dabbled myself. How come when the people Ive used with got high, they got all speeded out, got paranoid and did weird stuff. When I used the same substances, I got a calming euphoric feeling and relaxed and just sat around watching a bunch of idiots tweeking their minds out, and jonzeing when the drugs were gone. I couldnt relate to their reactions at all.  I have had the same result with or without my prescribed meds. I was told good drugs were a waste on me, I agreed, so I never bothered using again.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Very hard, and actually unethical, to give you an answer here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Wrong person, my bad. Gotta wait 8 minutes to repost.</p>
<p>I have ADHD (But not anymore, say state insurance funded doctors ?) &amp; meth was okay with toning down my hyperactivity by ALOT, but only for a few hours, because then I'd crash. Even with smoking it. </p>
<p>Since I admitted that my parents were abusive to state docs, I've been diagnosed with Bipolar instead of the PTSD &amp; ADHD that I was being treated for when I was with my parents. No documentation, parents are abusive, so I'm stuck living a low-competency life with no real social network to help me out. </p>
<p>Thanks mom, thanks dad. </p>
<p>I've been told it's possible to have bipolar &amp; ADHD &amp; also develop bipolar later in life, but I learned a lot from my ex's mom &amp; my coping skills ease me out of the severe lack of funtionality to moderate functionality. Don't let my routine get messed up though. I will lose/forget anything &amp; everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay there are many neurochemicals not just dopamine which meth affects but lets look at specifically dopamine and not explain all the things meth does.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>But one of the things meth does is it triggers the trace amine receptor #1 and this modifies inside the nerve cell communication with a neuro chemicals called secondary messengers.  Modify them just right and they will cause the release of Dopamine from inside the nerve cell to outside the nerve cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not counting combination receptors but you have 5 different types of dopamine receptors with different structures and different properties of how they are &quot;triggered by dopamine&quot; but they are all triggered by dopamine release where the dopamine interacts with the receptor like a key and a lock.  This in turn tells the nerve cell with the receptors to do things with its own secondary messengers (inside the nerve cell chemical changes.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We break down the 5 types of dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, DRD5) into two families. D1 family and D2 family for the DRD1 and DRD5 receptors do many things but one of the things they do is  the increase the levels of the secondary messenger called cAMP inside the cell.  D2 family with the DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4 receptors when they are triggered lower cAMP levels.</p>
</li>
<li>Let me repeat the last bullet point in a simpler way.  D1 family of dopamine receptors and D2 family of dopamine receptors do opposite things and they are located on the same type of nerve cells.  Aka there are feedback mechanisms where these different types of receptors are getting more feedback by sensing the levels of dopamine in different ways, and then using this feedback to determine the behavior of the nerve cell and what the nerve cell does.  Affect more D1 receptors and it does different things compared to affecting more D2 nerve cells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is not just the drug meph that triggers all 5 types of dopamine receptors but how the meph enters the body and whether it is in short but intense bursts vs slow but gradual increasing levels affects which ratios of the dopamine receptors are triggered.  Short but intense bursts trigger the D2 family which triggers more reward but also can trigger paranoia and other things (increase the saliency of what you are doing) while triggering the D1 family helps you focus better by diminishing the saliency of non primary activities that can distract you helping you focus and mellow out.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a reason why if your goal is to get high you smoke, snort, or inject these meds instead of taking them orally.  Taking them orally slows down the absorption and causes 20 to 40 minutes for your plasma levels to rise, while smoking or snorting it will cause the drug to enter your brain in a timeframe measured in seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note many of the meds we use for bipolar and schizophrenia work as one of their methods by making it harder to turn on the dopamine d2 receptor family.  This is good at stopping the paranoia, hallucinations, and sometimes the volatile mood, but too much of these meds dose wise can &quot;zombie&quot; you out temporarily where you have little to no emotional affect and you feel robotic and unmotivated.</p>
<p>Note a stimulant can do the same effect but in a slightly different way.  Overstimulation of the d1 family can zombie / mellow you out if there is not enough d2 family stimulation happening at the same time.  So understand the side effect I am describing is caused by d1 and d2 family mismatch but there are several ways to cause this mismatch and how stimulants and antipsychotics cause this mismatch is in different ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note I hyperfocused on dopamine in this post but it is actually over a dozen neurochemicals some trace amine some other things that are neurotransmitters but do not have an amine backbone like dopamine does.  It is more than dopamine so be careful of anybody that hyperfocuses saying dopamine causes X for in reality dopamine is just one of 50 neurochemicals we call neurotransmitters and there are even more neurochemicals besides neurotransmitters chemicals we call neuromodulators: stuff like hormones, immune signal chemicals (cytokines), secondary messenger modulators, ion channels etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's well documented (generally unofficially, on blogs and whatnot) amongst coke users that people with certain severe mental illnesses (I suppose severe is subjective in this case) have a calming euphoric/ normalizing effect from cocaine use. From what I can gather, people with certain anxiety disorders (GAD) and bipolar disorders (I prefer dissociative disorders and other less narrow terms) seem to be in a different state of brain chemistry from your average addict/recreational user chasing a high. This different baseline chemistry seems to result in a different effect from the drug, usually a calming normal feeling similar to taking xanax or adderall (depending which disorder you have and which drug makes you feel nornal).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This because cocaine is an anti-anxiety drug.  If your anxiety makes you more hyper than an upper, then removing that anxiety will get you to calm down.</p>
<p>This doesn't tend to work for panic attacks, just general nervousness.  Also, there are prescription drugs that are better suited for this sort of thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also quite common for doctors to get an MBA (for hospital or practice administration) or M-Public Health or other degree in a supporting academic specialty. There are also PhD-MDs that are more common in focused medical research or experimental therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine was heavily addicted to meth. He was on it basically 24/7 for almost two years straight. After a while, meth psychosis started taking over his mind. It wasn't just from sleep deprivation, either. It was much more pervasive than that, and sleep didn't fix it. Only a few months away from meth did that.</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<p>He was tearing out the plaster from his basement because he was convinced the horsehair plaster was made with the hair of dead children. He tried to convince me of this many times.</p>
<p>He claimed his landlord was many things: dead, a ghost, or a program on the internet. His story changed often. He also often claimed that he had no landlord and owned a lot of property.</p>
<p>He claimed that he could tell when houses were &quot;dead&quot;, and so would often go roaming around inside vacant properties. He took a realtor's &quot;for sale&quot; sign because he was upset that they'd put that up on &quot;his&quot; house.</p>
<p>I saw him scream at his furnace for 5 minutes because it was making a clicking noise.</p>
<p>He branded his hand using an L-bracket and his meth torch. &quot;L&quot; stood for &quot;Loser&quot; according to him.</p>
<p>He was paranoid that people were out to take his boyfriend away from him. He trapped his boyfriend with him, going so far as to slash his tires so he couldn't use his car to get away. His boyfriend eventually escaped. I would've helped, but his boyfriend was afraid to message me because about it because he knew that his messages would get read, and the trust I've built with my friend would quickly be destroyed as I would become one of the people trying to take his boyfriend from him. I guess his boyfriend thought it was important that I remain in my friend's life.</p>
<p>He would get violent with the people around him. Never me, though, for some reason.</p>
<p>Near the end of it all, he had stopped being a functional person. His apartment was a mess. His car wasn't running. He couldn't purchase food to eat properly. He also couldn't procure a steady supply of meth.</p>
<p>It was scary. I was scared for him. I wish I could've helped him more than I did, but he was keen on pushing me away despite my best efforts, and it wasn't long before his behavior got him picked up by the cops. Being in jail was honestly good for him, though. I couldn't stop him from smoking meth, I didn't hold such power over him, but being in jail sure made him stop.</p>
<p>He's been clean for over a year now and is doing so much better.</p></div>		</li>
