<p>I had psoriasis for years, and after six months of a low carb diet, it went away, as did my acid reflux. I went back to eating like a racoon but neither ever came back. I don't know if it was losing weight or staying off a high carb diet (beer and snack food) that made the difference. </p>
<p>My doctor said I would have it for life, and it was miserable, both outer shins from ankle to kneecap and a little on the temples. I have worried for years it will come back.</p></div>		</li>
