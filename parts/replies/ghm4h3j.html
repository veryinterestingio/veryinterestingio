			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean the laws of physics are already pretty broken with the titans - where's all this extra energy and mass coming from/going? Eren's Titan shouldn't weigh any more than Eren does unless mass/energy arrives from somewhere, which would require theoretically an endothermic reaction - drawing in energy from the surrounding area, so the area around a newly formed Titan should freeze. Except instead it's an exothermic reaction where heat is released. </p>
<p>The laws of conservation of energy are being egregiously broken without explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The colossal titan does cause a nuke like explosion when transforming. And we always see lightning sparking when they change so energy could be rapidly be brought in when they do and then rapidly converted to mass</p>
<p>Edit: I missed your frozen comment. Why would it freeze around them?</p></div>		</li>
