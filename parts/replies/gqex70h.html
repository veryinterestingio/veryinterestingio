			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But that river is flowing somewhere. It doesn't just go away. </p>
<p>Salt gets absorbed into the soil and plants. A lot does get washed off the top while the ground is still frozen. But the stuff that stays goes into the trees. They can suffer from Salt poisoning like any other organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I did a study on that for my college degree, and also trying different solutions, like beet extract to melt the ice. Long story short, everything is connected, and the impacts of salt can be seen miles away, depending on slopes, texture of terrain and precipitations.</p></div>		</li>
