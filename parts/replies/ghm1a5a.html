			<div class="markdown"><p>But couldn't a theoretical giant evolve some kind of biological internal gear system which would reduce the output required to move? Or could they theoretically evolve to move as an arachnid using a type of hydraulic pressure to move? Sorry I am genuinely curious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gears in an internal system would get slower as they got larger, just like the wheels in my example. Whatever power source pumps a hydraulic system would have similar diminishing returns.</p>
<p>As a non-hypothetical example, a rocket hauling cargo can only carry a pacific amount of weight because each pound requires a certain amount of fuel, which itself isnâ€™t weightless. At some point, the weight of the fuel would become too heavy for the engines to lift off the ground.</p>
<p>Evolution has an infinitely long journey to catch up to rocket science.</p></div>		</li>
