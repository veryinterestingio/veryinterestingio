			<div class="markdown"><p>Having oxygen poor blood flowing is better than having 0 oxygen which is what happens when the blood isn't flowing. </p>
<p>Oxygen rich blood won't do you any good if its not flowing.</p>
<p>Blood oxygen level doesn't drop to 0 right away if you're not breathing, takes a while before all the oxygen is used up. So doing CPR to push oxygen poor blood through the brain will still bring oxygen to the brain.</p>
<p>I'm unsure what the OP you replied to meant by brain needs constant blood flow, AFAIK brain needs the blood flow because of oxygen (and glucose) so not sure if the literal flow would do any good if blood actually had no oxygen in it. </p>
<p>The reason in CPR chest compression is more important than breath is as I mentioned above - blood will still have oxygen in it when you stop breathing, so its more important to push that oxygen to the brain through compressions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did say that the brain needs constant bloodflow, but that's because it's the medium by which oxygen (whatever is left in the blood) is delivered to the brain. If a person happens to have the technological means to bypass the lungs, alveloili, and blood brain barrier to deliver oxygen, obviously it's less critical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If blood flow suddenly stops, people fall unconscious regardless of their blood oxygen levels. Not that blood oxygen isn't important. It's just not the critical factor in this situation.</p></div>		</li>
