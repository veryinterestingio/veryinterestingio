<p>I would argue, oddly, no one has understood his question. He knows the RPM is the same, he's saying the speed past the needle slows and he is correct. If you played it at the same &quot;speed past the needle&quot; the pitch would change, it's simply automatically compensated for due to the way it's recorded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the risk of adding confusion, the master lacquer (not vinyl yet) is cut with a cutting head on a worm drive whose inward rate is varied to make the groove spacing larger during loud passages. When cutting from a tape, that rate is controlled by a second tape head a few inches ahead of the primary one.  And yes, one can slow the tape speed and the lathe rpm by half and get a better result, but that requires special bias if filters so it was not common.</p></div>		</li>
