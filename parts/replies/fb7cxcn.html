<p>I asked the stewardess once why they keep the shutters open for take off and landing.</p>
<p>She said, highest chance of malfunction is during take off and landing, the shutters are kept open so we have extra eyes on the wings etc for fire or damage since the pilots don't have clear visual</p>

<p>She said that to make you feel better.</p>
<p>Is a pax going to even recognize something truely wrong with the aircraft or how to describe it accurately to the crew?</p>
<p>Guarantee 99.9% of people riding in back won't.</p>
<p>The other .01% are actual airline pilots (rated ATPs) who are dead-heading and could recognize something truely wrong with the aircraft and know how to describe it accurately.</p></div>		</li>
