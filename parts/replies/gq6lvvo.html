			<div class="markdown"><p>But arthropods pretty much always have their eyes or eye spots on the head, near the brain (except for species that have lost eyes altogether). Same goes for antennae. So arthropods generally confirm the pattern of colocating the brain and important sensory organs.</p>
<p>So do the cephalopods, some of which have both very advanced brains and eyes. Even the wider mollusc class generally has brain/ganglion and sensory organs together, like the tentacles on a snail (used for both smell and sight).</p>
<p>Even the common ancestor to all bilateria likely had this basic layout with sensory organs and a cerebral ganglion concentrated together at the head end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, cephalization is still in the basic structure for most invertebrates, though their nervous systems are less strictly clustered exclusively in their heads. Ears in particular don't seem to be part of the general invertebrate head, so several arthropod groups have their own solutions in the form of peripheral chortononal organs as a secondary development.</p>
<p>It's mainly to illustrate that enough evolutionary pressure in a diverse group can lead to some structures that defy the layout commonly associated with vertebrates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah but all their body mass is so small that those organs might as well be attached right to the brain anyways, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would even go a step further. Insects and spiders don't have a brain like we do. They have accumulations of brain cells all over their body (ganglia) which do computations for the respective body part. Therefore an ear in the leg is actually pretty close to the crickets &quot;brain&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arthropods have the supraesophageal ganglion in the head, which is effectively a small brain. Yes there are ganglia elsewhere, but they're definitely more concentrated in the head.</p></div>		</li>
