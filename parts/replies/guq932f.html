			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like none of these answers are answering the question.</p>
<p>Would I see the asteroid if I stood in front of it - I think that’s the question. And in fairness I don’t know the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this question depends on multiple factors:<br />
1) How far away is the asteroid from the nearest Star<br />
2) What's the albedo of the asteroid(basically the amount of light it reflects back)<br />
3) Are there any other giant bodies(planets, moons) near it? </p>
<p>Now let's say you're in deep interstellar space and there is no source of light (no star nearby). In this case, the asteroid won't be visible.. <em>BUT</em> it will still block the background stars. So you'd basically infer that <em>something</em> is blocking the light from the far away stars.. that must mean there is a large object right in front of me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.topviewnyc.com/content/uploads/packages/5b6073e798d38_4_800.jpg" target="_blank">You cannot see the Brooklyn Bridge</a>. You see an object blocking the view of the sky and you see some lights in a certain pattern. Your brain comes to the reasonable conclusion that the object blocking the twilight sky and having that traffic pole pattern has to be the Brooklyn Bridge, so you recognise it at such.</p>
<p>Same would happen in the vacuum of space. If you're looking to a place where you know a star or a something should be, and that something isn't there, chances are there is an object between you and the star you want to see.</p>
<p>That's actually how astronomers find planets outside of the solar system: if you know a star looks a certain way, and during a period of X nights there was a dark spot blocking a portion of the view, that dark spot was most likely a planet orbiting that star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s probably not true. Stars pass close enough to do some funky things with the Oort Cloud more than once every 100,000 years or so. That’s enough to knock some comets and other large rocks straight towards us.</p>
<p>Stars don’t have to collide for gravity to do some wacky things to their systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about it is that since stars around us are basically bobbing around in the galactic disk at random, you can think of our sun's path over the past few million years as a continuous slow-speed &quot;collision&quot; with the Milky Way and the distribution of close encounters with passing stars will be fairly similar to what we'd encounter if another galaxy of similar size passed through, just time-compressed because of the faster speeds everything will be moving at relative to each other.</p>
<p>Even the orbits of the outer planets are a pretty small target to bullseye on an interstellar scale.  Neptune is about 30AU out and the closest star at the moment is passing us at over 250,000AU.  In about a million years, we'll have a &quot;near miss&quot; as Gliese 710 passes by at only 14,000AU (making it look about the size of Mars in the night sky), which should be close enough to scatter some new comets around but still will be far too far away to have any significant impact on the orbits of planets.</p></div>		</li>
