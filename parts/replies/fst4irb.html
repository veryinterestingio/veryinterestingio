			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t feel bad. The team responsible for programming the game in this video are working in a completely different style than you as a web developer. Their considerations may seem abstract, since you’re not used to the problems they’re solving, but what they’re doing isn’t so far removed from what you are.</p>
<p>In your case, optimizing CSS declarations and JavaScript functions is your version of pallet swapping style data or reusing meta tiles, respectively.</p>
<p>For instance if you have a site or application that has a light and dark theme, instead of maintaining 2 complete css files for both themes, design it so one of those themes only holds color overrides and is applied on top of the default theme. Granted this doesn’t save you a huge amount in this one instance, but making these same considerations across an entire project results in a much faster and enjoyable user experience.</p>
<p>I say all this as a web/application developer with 12+ years of experience. You’ll learn little tricks as you debug your own code or read blog/stackoverflow posts where people solve interesting problems in ingenious ways. As long as you keep learning new techniques that eliminate redundancy or complexity you’ll always be a bit better of a developer today than you were yesterday. </p>
<p>In the end that drive to learn and always be better is what separates good from great developers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah the last project I worked on I approached as if I was using something like Bootstrap but just coded it from scratch to have reusable elements with classes for different color schemes, etc. That was fun. I just kind of wish I started off with more of an actual computer science background and had more experience with data structures, etc before jumping head first into code. I had a loose HTML background from when I was a kid in the 90s so when I decided to go back to school the web development route seemed a natural fit even though I had no experience with logical languages. Thank you for the kind words and advice.</p></div>		</li>
