			<div class="markdown"><p>I also did the mirror thing.  I held up a measuring tape with millimeters on it and closed my right eye and lined up the 0 with the center of my left pupil, then switched eyes and saw what was lined up with the center of the right one.  I came up with 58, and when I got it checked later at an actual eyeglass place it was 58.5.</p>
<p>You're correct that some places are reluctant to measure it for you if they know you're shopping online, and they'll try to say how shitty online glasses are and how you never know what you're getting but I've personally never had a shitty pair from Zenni (the only one I've used).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been looking at getting a set of prescription sunglasses from zenni 'cause I'm running out of contacts and my health insurance doesn't cover eye exams. My old glasses are fine 'since prescription stayed the same the past few years, but can't wear sunglasses over them haha.</p>
<p>Any tips or info to keep in mind when ordering from Zenni?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My only complaint on the 6 or so pairs of Zennys I've bought was that my last few pairs don't use screws to attach the frame to the lenses, but instead have little plastic clip things, which are fine until you stress them even a little then your glasses will be very wobbly and sit crooked.</p>
<p>I don't know if the screw vs plastic clip thing varies by frame or if they changed it.  My first pair had screws and I still use them daily, the ones with plastic I have to replace about every year.  Honestly replacing them yearly isn't such a big deal since most people's prescription will change over time too.  Just be aware of things like that when you shop cheap, but hey, saving money is good too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source: ordered zenni glasses too small the first time. Have now purchased 7 or 8 pairs for my husband and I that we love.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can measure with a tape before a mirror, but please to it in a monomolecular way. Look with your right eye in your right eye and close the left eye. Thats the best way you can do the &quot;Vincent-Method&quot; solo. Better, let someone else make a line on your old glasses. Also they should just make the line when looking with their opposite eye (your right eye, their left eye, both on the same &quot;side&quot; when standing in front of each other, to be clear.)<br />
Dont mess up with your pupil distance please, that could cause permanent damage!  </p>
<p>copy of another answer of mine for the interested ones:<br />
&quot;Before you believe anything else: Yes, its absolutely important to have the exact pupil distance!
The usual hand held device for measuring it is in 0,5mm steps. The big modern computer cammera scanner things are like 0,1mm but thats unneccecary and mostly for show.
How much tolerance you have before you squint depends on the strengh of your prescription and the deviation from the optimal point of view.
If you dont look through the optical (not geometrical) center of the lens you will have prismatic dioptries act on your eyes. This would result to a wrong eye positioning by squinting to counteract the wrong pupil distance.
The higher your prescription, the lower tolerance you have before you encounter real, permanent squinting and headaches.
Also the tolerances for different directions are different.
As an optitian apprentice in germany you have a tolerance of 0,2mm when grinding the glasses by hand on a grindstone. We wouldnt be so pernickety if it werent important! (or we germans ^ ).
Every diviation from the optimum will be stress for your eye muscles and can lead to permanent miss alignment. And having tense muscles in your eyes is like the cramped neck of people working all day at the computer.
Yeah, you can tolerate some stress and compensate some misalignment but thats not quality of life.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had tried to buy from zenni and the glasses didn't work. It was like looking through a fish bowl. Twice it happened and zenni was refusing to remake them again. Saying they were made right. I cursed the lady out and was going to light up social media, as it turned out I had gotten a prescription from walmart doc, and went to a second doc to finally get some glasses and it turns out walmart doc wrote a + when it should have been - considering it was a 5 and heavy astigmatism it didn't work. After two weeks being almost blind I had snapped at the wrong person. No justification for how I acted and I still feel terrible to this day, I am truly sorry zenni lady.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any Eye Associates (for sure) but probably more broadly any eyeglass shop will measure your pupillary distance for free. They have a tool for it.</p>
<p>Edit: To be more specific you should go to the eyeglass shop in the Eye Associates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Find a shop that will let you pay for your PD, and that will measure it with a tool rather than eyeballing it. Your PD won't change, so you'll be able to keep using it. Just be polite. &quot;It is $20? No problem, I'm happy to pay.&quot; Then go and get your $25 online glasses, rather than the $425 ones from the shop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I walked into an optician and told them I had bought a virtual reality headset and would like to know how much it would cost to measure my inter pupillary distance. They responded as if I was a criminal asking something heinous of them. I swore to never return to that place even though it’s in the building I work in. </p>
<p>I really did need my IPD measured for a VR headset and had to resort to the questionably accurate self-measurement feature in the headset, which produced unstable results. Yes, this was early days and the very first primitive Oculus Rift development kits had only just come out, but I don’t think that lack of awareness of VR needing IPD measurements excused their attitude towards me as a potential customer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it is understandable that they reacted this way. Retail shops connected to opticians must be struggling. I used to pay $400 for glasses, and now pay $15-20. Are they as good quality, and do they come with full service fittings? No. But I lose or sit on my glasses every 6 months or so.</p>
<p>I've also had luck in places like Target (perhaps the people selling glasses there have not been in the optical shop as a career, and don't mind as much).</p></div>		</li>
