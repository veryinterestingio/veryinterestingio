			<div class="markdown"><p>That is cool indeed, would suggest that (at least some) stuttering is caused by an &quot;out-of-sync&quot; auditory feedback loop, right? </p>
<p>Also makes it much easier to put yourself in a stuttering person's shoes, knowing that no amount of concentration and effort can overcome the effect of delayed audio feedback and how it feels to have your brain constantly hard-overwrite what you were <em>trying</em> to articulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! There’s something wrong with the connection between our speech center and our hearing center. If I put on headphones and blast music and then speak, I won’t stutter because I can’t hear myself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is me at work every day! I normally have a mild stutter/impediment type issue when speaking, but the drive through at my job we get about a quarter second echo on anything we say through the speaker box. Never realized why but I always seem to talk better with it. This thread has been connecting lots of dots!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is really interesting! I'm sure you could find some researchers that would be keen to test that out in a studio. You could potentially design a hearing aid that does the same thing as your drive through speaker, though you'd want it to just echo your voice, so maybe some sort of conductive microphone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've thought about the link between stuttering and DAF a bit, but I don't have any scientific studies backing me up. It's just weird experiences I've had.</p>
<p>I don't have much of a stutter, but sometimes if my anxiety/adrenaline gets too high my brain becomes very sensitive. I basically just start repeating the same word/syllable over and over again when this happens.</p>
<p>I kinda interpret it as my brain &quot;hearing&quot; what I want to say before I'm going to say it. So then I end up stuttering and saying the same word over and over again because my brain can't stop hearing what I'm about to say <em>and</em> what I just said, then I just get stuck on it.</p></div>		</li>
