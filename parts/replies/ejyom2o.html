			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a military helo pilot, autorotation is the best way indeed and your description is accurate. You can land an autorotation on a single spot or let the helo slide depending on the size of the LZ. Still it's a hell of a training, and quite stressful when the instructor actually shut the engine mid-air...
The only issue is that if you're flying very low (20m or less), you hit the ground before realizing your engine's down... Making an autorotation without speed is also quite difficult. Still, when I learnt to fly a plane I was more comfortable with autorotation than plane landing as you can stop on short spot. The main goal of autorotation is crew survival, too bad for the helicopter if the LZ is not clean enough. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A great landing is one where they can use the plane again.</p>
<p>Thanks for your service.</p></div>		</li>
