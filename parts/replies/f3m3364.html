			<div class="markdown"><p>License plate nerd here. Illinois made them until 1948. I have also heard many stories of animals eating them off cars.  They were more like a heavy fiberboard material rather than what we would think of today as plastic (they were more similar to the temporary cardboard tags some states issue, but thicker and water resistant). Surprisingly, even after 70 years, many of the ones I find have held up better than their steel counterparts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also moved away from them because they are highly flammable. Like terribly. </p>
<p>One of the few products left still using cellulose is some ping pong balls. And if you have ever tried to burn one of those you’ll know it’s slightly less flammable than gasoline. </p>
<p>Now imagine people wearing a dress containing some of this material, or a corset. People were going up like torches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're getting all cellulose-based polymers with nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose was one of the first &quot;film&quot; polymers, and is extremely flammable, to the point where it's now used in gunpowder. Old movie film was made from it, which has led to many disasters. A different cellulose-based polymer, cellulose acetate, is used for a lot of different products, including cigarette filters, which are specifically designed <em>not</em> to burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now? It was the first (edit: smokeless powder propellant, i forgot that bit) to be invented and used. Over 150 years ago. Nitro compounds still form the basis of all gun powders today, as it doesn't produce smoke and has far more power than traditional black powder.</p>
<p>Though it is a bit too unstable and powerful and is mixed with other compounds to slow and control its burn.</p></div>		</li>
