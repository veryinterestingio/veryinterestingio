			<div class="markdown"><p>Mineral water usually has salts and sulfers in it, it's actually just a fancy pants way of saying it's spring water that hasn't gone through some sort of purification process (like reverse osmosis). These imperfections in the water break those hydrogen bonds just like sugar so depending on where the spring is and how many impurities (minerals) there are in the source, they could very well be just as fizzy.</p>
<p>The Rock Mountain brand (I'm in the US and have never had it) is probably very pure so it can hold the carbonation for a really long time.</p>
<p>Good way to test the purity is too let them go flat, like completely flat, but protected from outside contaminates (like dust) and put it in the freezer for a few hours. If it's super pure, it will stay in liquid form until you agitate it (give it a knock). That will introduce nitrogen (most of the air we breathe) and create a nucleation point for the water to form crystals around. You will literally see ice rapidly form in front of you.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fizzy water is at least as fizzy as pop where I am (UK) but I think OP is referring to the fizzing over that happens when you pour say, coke, quickly and foam is created at the top, which (at least in my experience) doesnâ€™t happen with sparkling water.</p></div>		</li>
