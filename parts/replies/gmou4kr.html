			<div class="markdown"><p>Not totally related to acoustic noise or EM waves traveling through the air, but adding on to the attenuation through the air of a signal, or path loss, signals at higher frequencies are also subject to more attenuation through denser and more lossy materials such as walls than are lower frequencies. The amount that the signal can travel through the denser material is Penetration Depth (he he). There are applications of this effect and the reflected signal in detecting underground materials, or Ground Penetrating Radar. Again not totally related but a cool tidbit I remembered!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;generalized relation&quot; can be found as eq. 40 and 41 in this article <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287249513_Connecting_the_grain-shearing_mechanism_of_wave_propagation_in_marine_sediments_to_fractional_calculus" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287249513_Connecting_the_grain-shearing_mechanism_of_wave_propagation_in_marine_sediments_to_fractional_calculus</a>
And why you have encountered &quot;apparent&quot; contradictory information is explained in the paragraph after eq. 42. It explains the competition between phase velocity and attenuation affecting penetration depth. Also see fig 3, 4 and 5 there.</p>
<p>Comment left by Vikash Pandey (comment left on research gate answering a similar question to yours that I found cause you got me curious.)</p>
<p>I dont think it answers your question entirely, the question this was a reply to was about sound, but it might help. Im too tired to figure it out turns out, and im only so curious right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound waves need a physical medium to propagate, if you think of an air molecule kicking around near the limit of the atmosphere* you can think of it as a fairly regular old kinetic energy system. If you threw a ball into space, since you can't throw it at escape velocity all that will happen is it will come back.</p>
<p>In macroscopic terms you could say the sound wave bounces off the edge of the atmosphere. This isn't strictly true but it would be good enough for most uses. Certainly enough for casual talk.</p>
<p>If there was actually a medium to propagate the sound waves, the sun would be deafening. Since the system can't lose energy in this way by definition the energy must be retained unless it gets converted into a form where it can, for instance if the levels of sound were so great that it heated the system to equilibrium where enough energy was being lost as light.</p>
<p>*What we define as the end of the atmosphere is pretty arbitrary. But basically when it's not imparting energy to other particles via collisions, then it'll convert energy into GPE.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so not only would we be deafened, but cooked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might the lack of transmission of the wave result in the particle moving ever so slightly higher into orbit? Thus maintaining the overall energy level? At some point the particle may drop back down and either reflecting some of the wave back or turning it into heat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that point you're basically just throwing a handful of air into the vacuum until it falls back to the atmosphere. Sound requires air or some other medium to exist. Otherwise the energy just becomes motion in your diaphragm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If by running out of atmosphere you mean everything removed from something like the air, you'd end up with a vacuum, which then would mean the attenuation of the wave would only depend on the frequency of the wave and the distance traveled by the wave. To reflect or refract a wave, there would need to be some obstruction. Water, for example, has a higher refractive index than air, which is why waves such as light and sound die off or attenuate in water more than over the air. Highly conductive materials such as metal used as an obstruction to a wave can essentially &quot;shield&quot; something from incident waves, leading to things like RF shielding of cables or sensitive components that could be otherwise damaged by being exposed to certain levels of power by waves of certain frequencies.</p>
<p>Edit: I may be wrong about the attenuation of waves due to refaction index. Might be just because the waves are spreading, someone correct me lol, been a while!</p>
<p>Edit: If I remember correctly, a wave passing from a medium with a lower refractive index (i.e. air) to a higher refractive index (i.e. water, metal) experiences reflection/refraction, as compared to a wave traveling within a medium like water or metal, like how sound travels faster underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation, I just wanted to add that the inverse square law is due to the spherical wave propagation. The area around a (point-)source (i.e. a sphere) increases with the square of the distance to its center. That means the acoustic energy is overall constant, but it is distributed over a much larger area the further the sound propagates.</p></div>		</li>
