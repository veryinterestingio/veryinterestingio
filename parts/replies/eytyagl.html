			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the really exciting colors are actually produced by the physical structures of feathers and scales rather than by  pigmentation. Hair is mostly limited to coloration by pigmentation and gets stuck with 'boring' colors as a result. </p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, mammals tend to have limited color vision since early mammals were primarily nocturnal. Without color vision, there isn't really a selective advantage to being brightly colored since it might make an animal easier for a predator to spot, but won't make that animal better at attracting mates (since they can't see color).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, to an extent. But greens and yellows are more advantage than say black or white in a jungle or sandy environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: see cool colored lobsters as an example of structure effecting color. Different layers of the shell combine to make the &quot;normal&quot; lobster color, when one layer has something off about it (They dont have it, its not the right color, it didn't absorb the right protein) it makes cool colors like orange, blue and red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's because they're <em>smaller</em>.</p>
<p>Scales in particular, like on a butterfly's wings, can have layers so thin that the light bouncing between the layers cancels out some of colors of light shining on them and reinforces other colors. Like iridescence, but stacked up and amplified. </p>
<p>That's one reason that there are so many blue butterflies, when there are so few blue pigments in nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to /u/bugzilianjiujitsu if you're interested you should look up why blue was such a hard pigment to come by. It's really fascinating. Almost all of the bright blues we see in nature are not the result of pigment, but the actual structure of the scale/feather/shell. When they're ground to make a pigment or dye, the color disappears because it's produced by the way the structure reflects light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are definitely some colorful fish up north, certainly tons once you get to US latitudes....darters, shiners, and some sunfish are the most noteworthy.  </p>
<p>Fish show the same increase in numbers as you move toward the equator (as with other species, this is plausibly a consequence of the poles getting bulldozed with glaciers regularly) and with fish, color is definitely used a lot for species recognition (this is true with birds too, and to some extent with reptiles but they also use color for warnings).  Anyway, when you crowd more species together (like on a reef or a tropical stream) it kind of makes sense that you'd start to get more color, because species need more and more visual variety to stay distinct from each other.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, this probably is also related to mammal color somehow, mammals tend to rely more on scent than sight for telling who is who (primates are an exception) so that, along with the hair thing, helps contribute to their relative lack of colorfulness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that is important, especially in temperate latitudes for fish is that the water has high turbidity, and doesn't have as much light penetration.  It's not advantageous to have a lot of color if you can't see it.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have more &quot;bland&quot; colored bottom structure (kelp/gravel/rocks), which is easier to blend into if you're a similar color.  Now, a good phycologist will tell you that red alga are beautiful, and lots of mid-latitude fish and invertebrates are red-banded to match these colors.</p>
<p>For a lot of fish you get a white pectoral surface, and a dark dorsal surface.  The reason being that if you look up towards a fish, you see white, which should blend into the sun, and when you look down on a fish, it's darker, which should blend into the bottom.</p></div>		</li>
