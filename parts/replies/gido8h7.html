			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Usually not at the frequent rate that you do when you're awake, due to some more complicated reasons that your body undergoes. However, it does happen.</p>
<p>There are situations where you can even cough up even more tough when unconscious. If your sleeping position forces your mucus to store up at the back of your throat, you may start coughing to prevent soft-choking from occurring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok has anyone else woken up unable to breathe because of mucus in their throat? It was when I was a kid so I wasn’t as scared as I might be as an adult but it was a weird thing. I was able to wash it down by drinking some water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only know this is a thing because I get year round hayfever and post nasal drip sometimes clogs my whole airway and I wake up violently coughing. I woke up to it recently and was coughing heaps of it up. I get bronchitis amd asthma as well which just makes it worse. I don't hsve sleep apnoea, have been tested its just gunk. But yeah small coughs I tend not to notice and I can go back to sleep easily but big coughs will wake me fully up. Edit: Also reflux and GERD can also do this as you lie down acid can rise up into your throat which can cause a similar choking sensation and automatic coughing which can wake you up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I downloaded an app to record any noises while I sleep to catch me sleep talking. I can confirm, at least one person (me) has coughed in their sleep</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, it's a recording right? How do you know the one coughing was you and not the creepy long haired girl sitting at the end  of your bed watching you as you sleep?</p>
