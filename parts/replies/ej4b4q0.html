<p>on CDMA networks (Verizon/Sprint 2/3G) the way the tech works, you can't actually read the data without first knowing the ID you're looking for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), works like this (ELI5 style):</p>
<p>Tom, Mike and Jane are all on the same tower.  Tom is being sent the message &quot;cat&quot;, Mike is being sent the message &quot;dog&quot; and Jane is being sent the message &quot;sky&quot;.  Tom's message is encoded as 1,0,0; Mike's is being encoded as 0,1,0; and Jane's is being encoded as 1,1,0.  Now, there is an encoding algorithm on the RAN (the Radio Access Network) that says if a 1 + 0 + 1 (the first bit in each person's message) to broadcast a &quot;1&quot;.  If the bits are 0 + 1 + 1, then broadcast a &quot;0&quot;.  And for the last bit, if it is 0 + 0 + 0, then broadcast a &quot;0&quot;, if and only if the preceding bit is 1.  If the preceding bit is a 0, then broadcast a &quot;1&quot;.  </p>
<p>Now every phone on that tower, receives a 1, 0, 0.  Since the phone knows the RAN's coding algorithm, all devices receive the same packet &quot;1,0,0&quot; and since they know the rules they can reconstruct their messages back into cat ,dog and sky. </p>

<p>And if you have heard the name Hedy Lamarr - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr#Inventor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr#Inventor</a></p>
<p>As for TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), every one gets a slice of time.  Think of a bicycle chain where each sprocket is the tower and the mobile devices.  When link 1 hits mobile 1, then link 2 hits mobile 2, and link 3 hits mobile 3.  So Tom, Mike and Jane, get their messages as c, d, s, then a, o, y, then t, g, y.  </p>

<p>Also; Basically all our mobile communications are easily logged/read by governments, 3 letter organizations, etc...</p>
