			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also enzymes / acids that cause the intestines to flush.</p>
<p>Vitamin C being one.  Once you pass an ascorbic acid threshold, your body flushes it out through your intestines by flooding them with fluid.</p>
<p>It is not an ailment, it is a natural process, but the byproduct is diarrhea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Try two heaping tablespoons of pure ascorbic powder in a glass of water. If you can make it past it's intense tart/sourness and finish the entire glass, you will develop diarrhea.</p>
<p>Orange juice has other things diluted into it and not as much vitamin c as a pure solution. You would develop other issues before you can reach the amount of orange juice to develop diarrhea from its vitamin c content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The specific way choleratoxin(from vibrio cholerae) works is not causing an inflammation but by blocking a special intracellular pathway by binding on the GTPase in enteric cells, therefore preventing the transformation of GTP to GDP, therefore resulting in an continues production of cAMP, which will result in a change in the intracellular Cl- and HCO3- - Channels, so those electrolytes will be set free into the lumen, resulting in an osmotic change and a following solvent drag of water and more electrolytes into the lumen, resulting in massive diarrhea. </p>
<p>I hope I translated that correctly, didn't learn biochemistry in english...</p></div>		</li>
