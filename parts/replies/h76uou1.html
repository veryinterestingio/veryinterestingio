			<div class="markdown"><p>When the light was emitted, 13 billion years ago, the galaxy was much closer. In the time it took for the light to get here the space between us and that galaxy has expanded by 80 billion light years or so. We can tell because the light was emitted with a certain color and as it traveled through expanding space the color shifted. How do we know what the original color was? Most of the matter in the universe is hydrogen. Hydrogen emits a specific pattern of colors. Astronomer look for that pattern across the spectrum. When they see the pattern but at the wrong color they know how much the light has shifted since it was emitted.</p></div>		</li>
