<p>That said, I agree with most. But some particles get eaten by immune cells, which then get into lung walls. Then the cells die as they can&quot;t digest those particles, embedding them in the lung.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black lung is caused by coal dust, which are solid particles. Usually, these particles are too large for cells to take care of which, is why they remain in the lungs.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoke is, at least theoretically, filtered by the orange filter at the back of the cigarette. Cigarettes cause health problems due to carcinogenic gases or vaporized liquids in the smoke which get through the filter. These, if they condense in the lungs, can be more easily removed by the cells. However, any damage they do (due to their carcinogenicity) can't really be repaired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree but with the minor comment that tar from smoking is not solid particulates like coal dust (or asbestos although that is a different problem, same idea of solids).  Fiberglass from filters, sure.  So, ya, it kind of depends.  Some people come back from the harm and some don't.</p></div>		</li>
