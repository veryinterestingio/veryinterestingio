			<div class="markdown"><p>Several research groups have calculated the energy return on investment between 3 and 4. This metric means that for every unit of energy required by the process, 3 to 4 units of energy are recovered in the biocrude (mass * energy content of the biocrude). The Aarhus group calculates overall thermal efficiency of \~70%, their paper is open access on MDPI Energies (Pilot-scale HTL, authors Biller, Anastasakis, et al.). <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/en11102695" target="_blank"><a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/en11102695" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.3390/en11102695</a></a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this still make an engine that would run on biocrude products more efficient than say coal fire fed electric motors? </p>
<p>Assuming you lose 25% of your efficiency in processing and then another 50% or more as heat when used in an ICE</p></div>		</li>
