			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP is curious if the core can be so hot that the surface temperature is a sort of cooler version of Earth. (at least, that's what his question made me curious of). </p>
<p>I think it would require an atmosphere that dissipates heat at a low constant rate to maintain a &quot;normal&quot; temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's tidal heating from Jupiter. If it was on its own I don't think it could keep that. Although there's little reason to think rouge gas giants couldn't have moons kept warm just like that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be possible for intelligent life to exist in Europa's oceans? Whenever I read about Europa, it seems scientists ponder about microbial life, but why not larger life more biologically advanced life forms? Does more advanced life require a land-based approach to evolve intelligence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... That we know of. We don't know how warm Europa is underneath that ice crust! Jupiter pulls on the core quite a bit, but without exact density measurements, we can't say what is going under there for sure. Something interesting no doubt!</p></div>		</li>
