			<div class="markdown"><p>So the effective answer would depend on how much CO2 is actually in the exhaled air, which would depend on how long it took person 2 to get to person 1 and how much physical exertion was involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much longer would they last if person 2 was breathing 100%  O2 before giving it to person 1. Would the still present Co2 still harm the person at the same rate?</p>
<p>Would the time be extended long enough for oxygen toxicity to start playing a role, as partial pressure greater than 1.4 or pure Oxygen below 10 feet. Assuming the person 1 is below that depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of CO2 received by person #2 still the same, 100% oxygen or not for person #1.</p>
<p>And in closed loop 100% O2 diving systems you get CO2 absorbtion, the lungs of #1 won't do it - air or pure O2.</p>
<p>I had a link opened in incognito mode but closed it by accident - a document going into detail about various issues surrounding CO2, hyperventilation, nitrogen/oxygen mixrures, etc.</p>
<p>In short the document also covered hyperventilation - it isn't about increased saturation of O2 but about flushing of CO2 prior to freedive. It's the CO2 saturation which triggers the breathing reflex which forces you to inhale if you've been holding breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are fine down to a ppO2 of about 0.16 bar or so, before bad things start to happen. As other have stated, the extra CO2 would be the bigger issue.</p></div>		</li>
