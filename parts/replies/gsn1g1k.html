			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically you can just throw the eggs at the wall after lining up 64 of them and you'll get like 10 chicks that pop out. I use a water trap to bring the eggs around to a place so the chickens can't get out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stack the chickens on a single cubic meter of space and trap them so they can't escape, and use a hopper to collect the eggs with a dispenser to fire the eggs into a slab with lava above it. When the chicks grow up they automatically die in the lava, giving you a steady supply of cooked chicken.</p></div>		</li>
