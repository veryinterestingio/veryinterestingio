			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description of the plant competition is amazing. I can picture someone like David Attenborough narrating your words. I'm so used to hear competition between animal species, and not conditioned to think about that same competition plants have for limited resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I actually listened to an interview on the radio with this lady who studied how trees interact with each other and they actually found that trees in a forest will actually lend each other nutrients and stuff through their root systems, with the help of this underground fungi. They tested this by putting a bag around some trees canopies and filling them with some kind of gas. They then tested trees several hundred yards away who hadn't been directly exposed to the gas and they found traces of the same gas they had exposed the other trees to! It was pretty amazing and definitely made me appreciate trees in a different way after that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy to watch time lapse videos of plants and trees and to see how much they are all moving around. They are quite literally alive in every sense of the word. A forest floor is like a rave if your deep in a k hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re interested in the chemicals that plants use to battle each other aka allelopathic compounds, the most heavily studied one that I have read about is Juglone which is most famously produced by the Black Walnut Tree whose allelopathic effects can be easily observed by any outdoors enthusiast in most parts of North America.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plants aren’t always passive observers to the forest, they’re active participants and they compete with eachother.</p>

<p>this is beautifully put and makes me want to take a walk in a forest</p></div>		</li>
