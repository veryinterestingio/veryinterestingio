			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite was the take on &quot;what if everyone on earth jumped at the same time in the same area&quot;. The answer to that was... nothing. But the analysis about what would happen after, as every person on the planet attempted to go back home after all gathering in an area the size of Rhode Island or whatever, was fun.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/8/" target="_blank">https://what-if.xkcd.com/8/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within weeks, Rhode Island is a graveyard of billions.</p>
<p>The survivors spread out across the face of the world and struggle to build a new civilization atop the pristine ruins of the old. Our species staggers on, but our population has been greatly reduced. Earth’s orbit is completely unaffected—it spins along exactly as it did before our species-wide jump.</p>
<p>But at least now we know.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;A careful reading of official Major League Baseball Rule 6.08(b) suggests that in this situation, the batter would be considered &quot;hit by pitch&quot;, and would be eligible to advance to first base.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... you mean &quot;what's left of the batter&quot; would be allowed a free advancement to what's left of first base.</p>
<p>Disappointingly he seems to have got the wrong citation for that. Rule 6.08(b) appears to be the Little League version. The normal equivalent is 5.05(b).</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I no very little about baseball, I just like rules.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I feel like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob" target="_blank">the manhole cover</a> should be pointed out. If people are further interested in this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Edit: the manhole cover thing came from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fastest-object-robert-brownlee-2016-2" target="_blank">another article</a> that proclaimed it that way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Especially if you could aim it at the moon, say. I'm sure there is actual science that could be done from hitting the moon with a large impactor in a pre-known location.</p>
