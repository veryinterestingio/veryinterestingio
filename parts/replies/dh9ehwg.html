If its composition were <em>entirely</em> hydrogen, it would be less massive and less dense than it is now. The core is estimated to be some ten to twenty times as massive as Earth—not an insignificant fraction of Jupiter's entire mass. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We suspect the existence of a rocky/icy core from more than just bulk density analysis, which is what you're describing here.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_multipole_moments" target="_blank">Higher gravitational moments</a> exert an effect on orbiting satellites by causing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsidal_precession" target="_blank">precession of perihelion</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession" target="_blank">regression of the nodes</a>. By watching how orbits around Jupiter evolve over time, we can derive these values.</p>
<p>Based on Voyager and Galileo data, we have pretty decent measurements of the J2 and J4 (quadrupole and octopole) gravitational moments. One of the goals of the Juno mission is to take really tight orbits of Jupiter to allow us to refine these down to perhaps the J20 moment, giving us a really good glimpse at just how large the core is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah Jupiter is only a bit over 300 times heavier than Earth, but more than 1300 times the Earth's volume. That makes Jupiter actually lighter than the Earth by proportion. But the Earth is a rock, Jupiter is (mostly by volume) a lump of gas. The stats do make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually this is one of the primary goals of the close flybys that the Juno spacecraft is currently engaged in.
As someone else notes, it it known from the orbits of moons that the density of the Jupiter is too high to just be hydrogen and helium but there is no proof whether this &quot;extra&quot; mass is all in a core or generally mixed throughout the body of the planet. At the distance all previous spacecraft have orbited (including Juno up until a few months ago) instruments have not had the ability to distinguish the two possibilities. It is hoped that by flying much closer to the planet it will be able to measure the gravitational fields (and also magnetic fields) in sufficient detail to answer this question.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Scroll to the bottom of my comment if you want a direct answer.</em></p>
<p>Firstly, not <em>all</em> liquid metals 'glow'. Metals like mercury and gallium are liquid at or near room temperature; the sodium-potassium and gallium-indium-tin (galinstan) alloy is also liquid at room temperature, and they all look literally like liquid silver. The latter is typically used in consumer 'liquid metal' thermal compounds like Coollaboratory Liquid Pro/Ultra, or Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut. </p>
<p>Your idea of molten metals 'glowing' is just due to their temperature. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Planck's Law</a> implies that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every physical body spontaneously and continuously emits electromagnetic radiation. Near thermodynamic equilibrium, the emitted radiation is nearly described by Planck's law. Because of its dependence on temperature, Planck radiation is said to be thermal radiation. The higher the temperature of a body the more radiation it emits at every wavelength. <strong><em>Planck radiation has a maximum intensity at a specific wavelength that depends on the temperature.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Wien's Displacement Law</a>, in turn, states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the black body radiation curve for different temperatures <em>peaks at a wavelength inversely proportional to the temperature.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: everything emits a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, regardless of its temperature, and the <em>higher</em> the temperature of the object (specifically a black body), the <em>shorter the <strong>peak</strong> wavelength</em> of the spectrum. </p>
<p>Typical metals when melted are hot (roughly 800 K to 3000+ K), so they glow in the visible, i.e. 400 – 700 nm wavelength (but peak in the infrared spectrum). The tungsten filament in an old incandescent glass light bulb (this one: ?) has a temperature of some 3500 K, so it glows distinctly orange-yellow. Anything above 500 °C begins to glow red (peak in the infrared). Our sun is about 6500 K at its surface, so it glows white. Blue giant stars output most of their light in the ultraviolet/X-ray spectrum, and so they shine distinctly blue (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Pleiades</a>), for instance. </p>
<p>To answer your question: I'm inclined to think that the metallic hydrogen in Jupiter <em>will</em> glow due to its temperature.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where will you put all that gas that has a higher mass than earth? Plus displacing that much of mass from Jupiter will have detrimental effects on orbits of all the &quot;stuff&quot; in the solar system. At least it would disturb the Astrid belt objects that would increase the frequency of them crashing into planets. At worse a planet might go out of orbit and can get ejected out of sollar system or can crash into another planet.</p></div>		</li>
