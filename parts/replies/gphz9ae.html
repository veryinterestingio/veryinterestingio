			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains A LOT. I am anemic and I take medication for adhd that makes me forget to drink water or eat. I have gone an entire day surviving off of one bite of a muffin, and less than half a bottle of water... however, the mere thought of eating a meal I prepared or bringing a spoon to my mouth caused the most repulsive and nauseating feeling. I try to eat anything in sight to prevent this because I’m also terrified of throwing up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you are taking medication for ADHD/ADD this is probably the reason why you feel so sick to eat. Being anemic probably doesn’t help but ADD/ADHD medication is known for making people not wanting to eat for 1-2 days. The thought of eating can almost make you throw up. You should talk to your doctor about ways to increase your appetite while taking this medication. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like fucking hell. I have many reasons why I don't want to be on ADD medication but I have an eating disorder that already causes that exact feeling (literally feeling like my throat blocks itself if I try to eat and feeling sick if I eat when I don't want to) and I think it would be even more dangerous to my mental health if I were to be on meds that induces that feeling. Now I'm fucking sad</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this occasionally too but I'm not on any medication. Sometimes I'll just be starving hungry so I'll make a meal and when I sit down to eat it I suddenly want to be sick and my appetite is gone completely</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d suggest eating a fibre and protein rich breakfast before taking anything else into your system. Something like scrambled eggs and beans. Will probably help you with concentration and energy as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve personally experienced this.
My whole life I worried start to feel sick if I waited too long to eat. I would also feel bad if I overate bagels, pizza, or sweet.</p>
<p>I went low-carb 2 years ago and that all changed. I can go nearly 24hrs without eating and I feel fine!</p></div>		</li>
