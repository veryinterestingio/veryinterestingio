			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would there be radioactive byproducts? The antimatter itself will be completely annihilated. If it doesn't generate any neutron flux then it won't activate any other materials either. Where would the radiation come from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that depends if the antimatter is antiprotons or positrons or both. Electron + positron makes two 511 keV gamma rays which would not activate stable nuclei under normal conditions. Proton + antiproton release two 930 MeV gamma rays which is more than enough  to split stable atoms.</p>
<p>Edit1: Thanks to those correcting me on the +p -p reaction.<br />
Edit2: It might be possible for intense heat and pressure of the explosion to cause some fission of near by elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gamma rays have energies high enough that they can correspond to the energy levels of the particles in the nucleus. Just like if a UV photon hits an atom and it can kick off an electron and ionize it, a gamma ray can hit a nucleus and excite it to the point that protons or neutrons can be ejected. If the result is an unstable nucleus, then you have a radioactive product.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although realistically there will always be reactants that get blown away too fast to fuel the explosion in either case,</p>

<p>How does that work with antimatter. Why wouldn't the antimatter just be completely obliterated with the matter around it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asking what color nukes really are is an interesting question. The bomber crew over Nagasaki <a href="http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Hiroshima/Nagasaki.shtml" target="_blank">reported a variety of colors</a> which was probably partly retina damage. Many other eyewitnesses just reported pure white. Is your visual system overloading and just registering white even really a color?</p>
<p>The inner parts of the fireball <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/phyopt/coltemp.html" target="_blank">really should be blue-white</a> no matter how hot it is, and the outer parts which are around the temperature where air deionizes really should be orange-white.</p></div>		</li>
