			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to mention this. </p>
<p>A person with a normal digestive system could probably create a diet of 'supplements' rather than food that would meet their nutritional needs. I don't think anyone has put together a system like that simply because it's such a poor replacement for proper food. </p>
<p>TPN, total parenteral nutrition, was invented to keep alive people who had no working digestive system. TPN uses two solutions, one water based, one fat based, to provide all of a person's nutritional needs (or at least it originally did, no idea about current practice). I encountered it in the late 70's where it was used with people who had had their bowel removed, I think it was due to really bad Crohn's disease. In the years since it's been used for critically ill people to good effect. </p></div>		</li>
