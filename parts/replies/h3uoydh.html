			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're going where I think you are with this, no, our body does not go into 'survival mode' of some sort and build extra muscle in prison. Prison inmates that get big do so because it's a whole hell of a lot easier to stick to a lifting routine where you hit the gym an hour a day when it's literally scheduled into a block of time for you with nothing else to do but chill in the yard instead. Go do that for a handful of years while eating enough food to grow and you'll look pretty good, it turns out. It's no different than how any person can do the same if they just start going to the gym consistently and eating right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, humans also have specific adaptations to make us less strong. Humans are built for endurance and heat regulation, rather than bursts of strength like gorillas. Humans are a relatively unique case where being buff was selected against, in favor of the weakness, for the sake of endurance. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas human muscle contains, on average, about 70% slow-twitch fibers and 30% fast-twitch fibers, chimpanzee muscle is about 33% slow-twitch fibers and 66% fast-twitch fibers. The chimp muscle, they learned, was about 1.35 times more powerful than the human one. When the researchers then looked at the muscle fiber breakdown in mammals such as mice, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, horses, lemurs, and macaques, they found that only two animals regularly had more slow-twitch fibers: a small, lethargic primate called the slow loris and humans. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/how-chimps-outmuscle-humans#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%20whereas,66%25%20fast%2Dtwitch%20fibers." target="_blank">quote source - sciencemag.org</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>False. We aren’t the best endurance runners in practice. However, we are the most intelligent endurance runners. Early humans were intelligent enough when hunting down a gazelle in the safari to carry containers of water so we can keep up the hunt until the gazelle inevitably would stumble to heat exhaustion due to dehydration.</p></div>		</li>
