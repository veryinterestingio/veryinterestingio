<p>These are average values, and also physiologically our body works, so that it can protect our bladder from any lasting damage. The absolute value would differ from person to person, but mostly, if you'd check the cystometrogram, it averages 400 ml in most cases for most people. Like say, a balloon actually bursts at 800ml capacity, but if you'd set your safety valve at 400ml you'd be better suited to protect it from accidental damage, than say when you set the safety at 799ml. </p>
<p>Also, like I said, there's the somatic innervation to the ext Urinary sphincter (via Onufs nucleus), so we gradually gain control over it, someone who is bladder trained, can hold up a lot more, but that doesn't reflect the normal physiological function.</p>
<p>Also, as an addendum, say someone suffers from retention of urine (where they can't evacuate their bladder), mostly due to neurological, prostate problems, if you were to catheterise them, they'd easily drain 600-800ml of urine at a go, which would bring them tremendous relief from the painful state they were in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I appreciate the response, and I understand the relief valve metaphor as I work in aviation as a mechanic. Makes total sense. I'm just surprised to see the numbers so low as there have been times where I have to pee on the road and easily fill a 500ml bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun story short, in 2009 I was diagnosed with a blockage of my bladder right at the discharge. It had been going on for years. Did an ultrasound where the tech measured my bladder at 1650 cc. He had me fo pee and them measured again. He said &quot;Well, you're down to 1600 cc, I'm going to go get the doctor.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Happens to the best of us, like you are finally tucked in your bed ready to go into a deep, peaceful slumber, and suddenly, you have this urge to pee.</p>
<p>Now, you have to take the toughest decision of your life, whether to get out of your bed, and brave the freezing temperatures, or stay comfortably tucked in, hoping that no wet accidents occur in the night!</p>
