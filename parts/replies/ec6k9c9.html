			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe these are called intrusive thoughts in the context of the question.  I could be mistaken, but high place phenomenon is an example of an intrusive thought.  As several people have suggested, it’s understood to be the opposite of dangerous and more of a primitive function of our brains.  They can linger though, and unwanted intrusive thoughts, if not understood to be harmless and natural, can cause a certain amount of distress. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Everyone has intrusive thoughts but people most people know that they won’t do these things and simply discard them and maybe even think they’re funny. People with anxiety, OCD, etc. have intrusive thoughts, like everyone else, but are scared they may actually do them and chastise themselves for even having such thoughts, sometimes it’s so bad that they take extreme actions to make sure they DON’T do whatever their thought is (this is why some people with OCD feel they have to, say, do everything in 3’s bc otherwise someone they love will die, or they will become a murderer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I feel weird answering the question &quot;have you recently had suicidal thoughts.&quot; And I'm thinking yeah, on occasion the thought of swerving into oncoming traffic pops into to my head and then goes away. I'm pretty sure that's normal and I dont think that is what they are asking about</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I have ocd and semi-regularly get violent intrusive thoughts. Until I received counselling, I had been under the impression that I was a psychopath and felt awful for it. It contributed to my depression, as I’m not a violent person — have never even been in a fight. For example if I was ever conscripted, there’s no way I could kill someone. Not ever. I have always known that if they gave me a gun and asked me to go shoot the opposing forces, I would just turn the gun on myself. </p>
<p>Violent intrusive thoughts are awful. Sometimes when I’m cooking in the kitchen, I get the sudden urge to pick up the knife I’m using to chop onions and rapidly stab myself over and over. It’s terrible and scary because the urge is so strong and feels so real that I’m concerned I may do it some day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That they are distressing in some sense is what brings them into the category of &quot;intrusive thoughts&quot; in the first place.  It is worth clarifying that that distress can be quite significant.  The experiences referred to as 'intrusive thoughts' could be patently idle and barely noticeable (were it not for the distaste they evoke), or they could be sudden, vivid imaginings, analogous in some ways to the experience of a real memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly the same thing.  But then you don't, and perhaps that helps your brain feel good about itself because you successfully didn't drink poison.  Jumping off a tall building, steering into a ditch, kissing a coworker suddenly that you're talking to, throwing your cellphone as far as you can into the middle of the street, pulling through a red light at an intersection, punching a stranger, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tall building thought is one I’ve had before.  This thread is super helpful. I thought something was wrong with me.   I never really knew how to process what was happening.    I consider myself a normal well adjusted human that is quite happy but every once in a while when atop a tall building my brain has had thoughts with vivid images of jumping off.  </p>
<p>As uncomfortable as the thoughts have been it’s good to know that this is common.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>TBH this is a <em>really</em> hard one to suppress sometimes, depending on the stranger</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I've noticed I get thoughts of violence against certain people over others (not just people I don't like, but random coworkers or social events). I wonder if there's some sort of subconscious primitive survival cue that's being given out that triggers this.</p></div>		</li>
