			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to build upon this a bit - comparing SARS-CoV-2 to most coronaviruses is a bit ineffective. It's better to zero in on the closest strains. The best match up would be SARS and MERS and both of those did cause brain issues as well - often times due to PTSD from the disease itself.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&quot;A new report suggests that lingering &quot;brain fog&quot; and other neurological symptoms after COVID -19 recovery may be due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an effect observed in past human coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and MERS.<br />
People who have recovered from COVID-19 sometimes experience lingering difficulties in concentration, as well as headaches, anxiety, fatigue or sleep disruptions. Patients may fear that the infection has permanently damaged their brains, but researchers say that’s not necessarily the case.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a perfectly valid point, thanks for adding this. I understood the first quote in my earlier comment to apply to coronaviruses in general, both common cold coronaviruses and more severe coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Even common cold coronaviruses can directly affect the brain (for example, see <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1509458" target="_blank">this</a>), but you’re 100% correct that this comparison is problematic for multiple reasons. COVID-19 is certainly not a typical common cold coronavirus. Here’s a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13854046.2020.1811894" target="_blank">link</a> to the PTSD study if anyone wants it. </p>
<p>Even though PTSD may cause some or all of these lingering symptoms in some people, it does appear that at least some of the subjective effects of COVID-19 infection are related to direct brain involvement in others. Some people with COVID-19 develop brain fog, low mood, fatigue, inability to smell, inability to taste, delirium, and/or other psychological symptoms even when symptoms elsewhere in the body are relatively mild (<a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.12255" target="_blank">source</a>). Not all people with these symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD after infection or hospitalization (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01283-z" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204879/#s0110title" target="_blank">quote</a> for more detail about coronaviruses affecting the brain: “HCoV infection is not always confined to the upper respiratory tract and can invade the central nervous system (CNS) under circumstances that are presently uncharacterized. [...] The detection of HCoV RNA in human brain samples clearly demonstrates that these respiratory pathogens are naturally neuroinvasive in humans and suggests that they may establish a persistent infection in the human CNS. [...] Apart from respiratory illnesses, they may also result in enteric and neurological diseases.” </p>
<p>But in any case, even though coronaviruses are able to invade the brain, this doesn’t necessarily mean that infection causes permanent brain damage. The brain has an immune system that is capable of responding to viruses, and there is often enormous capacity for recovery even in the case of damage. The brain can be really good at healing, even after viral infection. Many people have chickenpox/shingles virus (varicella zoster virus) or herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) in their nervous systems right now without even knowing it (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6070824/" target="_blank">source</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X20300743" target="_blank">source</a>). Viral infection of the nervous system doesn’t necessarily mean symptomatic damage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ineffective? It was what the OP asked, they didn't say MERS and SARS, they said coronaviruses.</p>
<p>Some notes on that &quot;new report&quot; from aclu. If you look at the actual publication, it turns out the be a literature study of people hospitalized for SARS or MERS, not COVID-19 (so much for &quot;new&quot;). So they are generalizing results. Which is probably justified, because as they themselves note, it is not specific to those diseases, but rather &quot;PTSD is known to occur in patient groups who undergo similar hospital courses, including ICU survivors, patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated, and those that experience delirium.&quot; </p>
<p>I say all of this because that bit you quoted might make it seem that this research was about all COVID-19 cases. It is not. It's about people with severe sickness that survived the ICU.
Most people suffering from long covid symptoms such as &quot;brain fog&quot;, fatigue etc. were never hospitalized and in a lot of cases only experienced mild symptoms. PTSD is very unlikely to play any role in all of those cases.</p></div>		</li>
