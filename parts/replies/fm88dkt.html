er that use a complete separate fusion stage which is ignited by the fission bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a middle ground, referred to as a boosted fission bomb, in which a small amount of fusion fuel (lithium mostly IIRC) produces extra neutrons which increases the amount of uranium that undergoes fission.  This is the bigger boom from a smaller bomb; thermonuclear bombs use the energy of the primary to initiate fusion in a secondary, and the addition of the secondary generally makes thermonuclear bombs larger than a boosted primary alone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Modern bombs use tritium and deuterium gas. The explosions from a boosted weapon can reach the size of a poorly-made thermonuclear bomb, iirc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.  I remember reading something a few months ago that they (at least used to) use lithium-6, because there was a test at one point where they had mistakenly used lithium-7 which releases more of the fusion fuel than expected and thus the yield was way more than they had calculated.  Maybe that was back in the early days, I'm not really sure what the timeline is on it.</p></div>		</li>
