			<div class="markdown"><p>You do this every time you boil water. The actual phase transition, turning liquid into gas, takes a lot of energy. This is not the same as just temperature change - and it's a huge amount of energy.</p>
<p>The energy needed to turn just-turned 100C water into 100C steam is actually way, way more than it takes to turn just-melted 0C water into 100C water.</p>
<p>In pure energy, starting with some ice at 0C:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add 334 kJ/kg to turn 0C ice into 0C water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add 419 kJ/kg to turn 0C water into 100C water.</p>
</li>
<li>Add 2260 kJ/kg to turn 100C water into 100C steam.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to put 5x as much energy into 100C water to turn it into steam as you needed to get it from just-thawed to the cusp of evaporation. This is why your pot can just simmer, all at 100C with only small parts of its liquid turning to gas at the time, rather than just suddenly all rushing into steam and your pan going dry instantly.</p></div>		</li>
