			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah somewhat similar.  A Big difference is that eukaryotic cells only have the enzyme telomerase in the early stages of life. Which means that the telomeres are getting shorter everytime the cell divides. At some point the telomeres are gone and the exonuclease will start to cut into the DNA strand. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same, telomeres control the senescence of a cell line and become shorter with each replication, polyadenylation is used to protect mRNA from degradation long enough for it to do its job</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Functionally, the two processes are pretty different. It’s a neat observation, though - we have two separate mechanisms that leverage a stretch of “protective” non-coding regulatory nucleotides. In both cases, once they’re lost, the coding sequence will become compromised and degraded - though by different mechanisms and to different extents.</p>
<p>Very different consequences in the case of telomeres. Your cells can usually crank out another RNA so long as it has the template around!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both hp determine lifespan, telomeres for chromosomal DNA, and polyAs for mRNA, but telomeres are far more complex, far larger and have more functions than just protection, they also portect from different things polyA tails protect from exonucleases, while telomeres protect from a range of DNA degrading processes (errors made by polymerases, exonucleases, oxidative damage)</p></div>		</li>
