			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really weird for me because I get a few ginger hairs in my beard,  I can track to my great great grandparents. I'm half Indian / British. British side everyone has dark brown hair. Indian side gives me that awesome hair in places you don't expect to find hair, that's super thick and black.   </p>
<p>So is it just a weird anomaly or do I have like, 1/10th of a gene or?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If brown eyes, possible hair follicles that just do their own thing.   I had an odd one on the side of my nose. Thick black hair, doesn't match anything else on my body but there is it (I keep plucking it, and it keeps coming back).</p>
<p>It's interesting to look at my nieces. I was the only one who married a blue/eyed blond (family descendants of Sweden). My brothers all married woman whose mom were Japan, Korea, India/China.  None of their kids have red hair. My niece (Korean/British) is a full redhead! Her parents were a bit shocked, but both had the recessive gene but didn't realize it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why my dad never grew out a beard.  His hair was black but his beard was mixed like a calico cat, it had black, brown, red, blonde, and white and it was that way his entire life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same thing. I think some of the white hairs might be due to age (nearly 30) but a few might be from a time I drunkenly fell over and smacked my chin on a railing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have exactly the same thing. I'm mostly Danish/Polish but have a small amount of English/Irish in me. I shave as often as possible because of how ridiculously confused my facial hair is. Everything else is dark brown...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting I'm English/Welsh/Scottish but I do have some Danish blood a few generations back. Wonder if that mix is particularly likely to cause rainbow beards.</p></div>		</li>
