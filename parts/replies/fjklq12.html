			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a subcategory or meditation but meditation includes a lot of other practices, from deep concentration to increased awareness or extremely complicated visualizations. Basically hypnosis is a kind of meditation that developed without much contact with the older forms and as hypnotists learned about more established styles they've modified their methods. For instance, many have patients sit up now, or they might use more traditional meditation in the same session.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have mentioned, hypnosis usually has a specific short term personal goal in mind. Meditators can have many goals but it's more common that meditation is done to change ones overall tendencies and ways of seeing the world, usually with enlightenment as a goal. Think &quot;I want to stop smoking&quot; vs &quot;If I increase my awareness I will be kinder and more enlightened.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well meditation is usually done without a goal in mind. To be more specific you have an overall goal/reason as to why you meditate in general. But meditating itself has no goal, you are just doing/being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deity meditation, but also “ground luminosity” meditation. It is a type of meditation where insight is gained through observing mind revealing itself to itself through complex visualization. If you’re interested in more, learn about the various bardos of experience as described by buddhists. The bardo of meditation experiences is varied and divided into other bardos, or slices of experience and state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation is correct from my experience. </p>
<p>I have been &quot;hypnotized&quot; several times by a therapist for anxiety. I'd describe it as a deeply relaxing guided meditation experience. </p>
<p>I never felt out of control, or lost awareness of myself or surroundings. </p>
<p>I'd describe the feeling similar to how you feel after getting a great massage but for your mind. Like when you're getting a massage, you feel very calm, it's very soothing. You are present &amp; really aware of your body but you know what's going on around you and zone out. Same feeling but done through words &amp; thoughts instead of touch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried hypnosis to stop smoking. It was exactly this, a deep and guided relaxation/meditation. I had three sessions with a hypnotherapist, and then spent about a week listening to the recording of our last session once a day. After my second in-person session I stopped smoking with no side effects (I was almost a pack per day smoker). That was in 2005 and I have not smoked since. !! It felt like magic. Wish I could say I still meditate regularly, but no...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, I haven't been doing it regularly either. Kinda realized I really should get back into it as well. It does feel like magic. Guess I'll be spending sometime this weekend tracking down the recordings since I'm so out of practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it seems very similar to meditation, except involves suggestibility to enhance the relaxation response which can help with some people. Though I prefer meditation itself for it's widespread cognitive benefits</p></div>		</li>
