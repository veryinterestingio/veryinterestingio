			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: it depends on the time of year and the direction the wind is blowing. </p>
<p>But we'd probably see massive loss of life and property within a 100 mile radius of Yellowstone, with decreasing but still severe ~500 miles +(?) Outside of that.  The long term effects of a caldera eruption include volcanic winter's (world wide global cooling) and disruptions in travel and food supply.  It wouldn't be a fun time and it's a reason a lot of volcanologist (myself included) want governments to have contingency plans and reserves for if something like this happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Secondary question: Is Yellowstone a danger site in terms of nuclear attacks? Would a detonation on par with the Tsar Bomba be enough to set off the caldera, and does that present a danger in terms of national defense that is greater than that of the danger of a city being targeted?</p></div>		</li>
