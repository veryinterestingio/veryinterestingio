			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but I think the question is more about the mechanism than the code held in our DNA. How does our body know it's of a sufficient size? Is there some sort of feedback when the body gets to a certain size that tells the growth hormones to stop? Or is it a timing thing where growth hormones run for a period of time and then stop?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the analogy. Hormones and vitamins/nutrients play a crucial role as well. Hormones are the DNA’s foremen telling your body to grow, where, and when. Vitamins/nutrients are the materials needed to actually build (you) the structure. People who are under nourished at crucial ages wind up shorter than they could have been. </p>
<p>FWIW, there are also other factors at play we don’t have a full understanding of at the moment like epigenetics which are how expressions of the same genes change in real time... kind of like nature vs nurture but significantly more complicated than a ELI5 answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP here: yeah, I had assumed it wouldn't be easy to explain, and I'm not dumb just never been all that versed in all things science.</p>
<p>I ask because I met someone the other day who was over 7ft tall, but both his parents are of normal height, so it made me think, &quot;What eventually told his body to stop, even though it grew larger than would have been expected&quot;... genetically I mean</p>
<p>Thanks guys, it created a good discussion</p></div>		</li>
