			<div class="markdown"><p>Floor heating is already outdated. Ceiling heating is better, because you can also use to cool your place:
Heat sources radiate heat, which means no matter where the heat comes from it'll reach everywhere. So if the heating is in the ceiling, it'll heat the floor and room like every other heating.
But hot air only rises up, so if you want to cool it, the cooling is most effective close to the ceiling...</p>
<p>Floor and ceiling heating works by pumping hot water through tubes embedded in the concrete in floor or ceiling.
The difference is that the ceiling is where all the hot air ends up, so if you pump cold water through the tubes it'll take away the heat. If you do the same in your floor it won't really work, because the coldest air is always on the floor and there is no way efficient way to get the hot air down to your floor... So we just put the tubes in the ceiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for GDF Suez and your 100 % renewable can come from coal or nuclear but they buy certificates from hydro, wind or solar energy producers to cover it. So yes, 100% of your energy is produced renewable somewhere, even if your actual energy is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just get the electricity from whichever power source is closest. If you pay for non- renewable but your neighbours have solar panels you get the solar power. If you pay for renewable but there's a coal power plant nearby you get the coal. </p>
<p>It's more about who you give your money to and what they do with it than anything else</p></div>		</li>
