			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda, maybe, but it's hardly one thing. </p>
<p>When we look straight ahead, you'd think you see the room as one image, but really, one part of your brain is reading the sign, another is monitoring the thing in your periphery that may be an angry face, another is ready to pounce on any movement... </p>
<p>You think you're seeing the room, but you're only seeing the few things your brain filters to your consciousness. So you're not seeing one image, you're seeing fractions of seconds of fractions of your view. </p>
<p>You walk out and someone asks you what colour the walls were. You can picture the room, but have no idea what colour they were. Even the sign you read was filtered for meaning, with with typos ignored. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about something else now. Our attention can only be on one thing at a time yes, that's just how consciousness works </p>
<p>It's different from our brains functions piecing together what we are actually able to perceive like depth perception, colour, edges etc which will create that end image </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but we're not conciously aware of that. We perceive it as a single image. So the question then becomes &quot;Does a spider perceive a single image?&quot; which is arguably exactly where we started.</p>
<p>Still an interesting side discussion though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't look forward on that room and think:</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm. That window is in my right eye's field of view. That mirror, my left eye. That radio is on both. I know there is a candle there, but I can't see it right now because of my blind spot&quot;. </p>
<p>You can figure most of that out if you really want to think about it, but for all intents and purposes, all you see is one image your brain pieces together on the spot with the things it thinks you should be aware of.</p>
<p>I really don't see the point of this kind of nitpicking on a simple question</p></div>		</li>
