			<div class="markdown"><p>Most paper produces acetic acid as it decays. Acetic acid has been found to be a mild antibacterial agent, so it’s likely it might help. It would make an interesting study to compare acid-free paper to regularly treated paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When pressing and preserving plants for botanical study, we use acid free linen rag paper in order to preserve the color and quality of the specimen as long as possible... so I don't think the acid contributes too much to the preservation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of decay microorganisms that don't require oxygen to work (and in fact some that <em>require</em> an anaerobic environment. It's unlikely that paper is acidic enough (even before considering the shift to acid-free paper) to have an impact on microbial growth, as many decay microorganisms generate acids as metabolic products anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, pressing the leaf helps dehydrate it and keeping it there prevents things like mechanical damage to the brittle leaf. As someone who had a yardwork business as a kid, leaves don't really decay that fast even in nature which makes sense because they're mostly cellulose anyway, and cellulose consuming bacteria are few and far between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious about this. Both the lack of oxygen in the environment and the acidic nature of the paper must play a role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the water and living cells is what keeps it soft, and the green is in the chloroplasts which die when they dry out. It's possible to preserve some colour, but not nearly all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends both on the plant and on the type of paper in the book. You do quite often get 'ghosts' of plants that were once preserved in old books and have left an acidic mark, but which are later removed. <a href="https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/s/djh908" target="_blank">Here's an example where the library has encapsulated the flower and preserved it in-situ</a>. You can see the acidic mark on the right.</p></div>		</li>
