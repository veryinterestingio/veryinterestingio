			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know much about MRIs, but wouldn’t they have to produce time-varying magnetic fields in order to gather any information? Even if they do only use a static magnetic field (which I find highly unlikely), the process of switching it on and switching it off would cause sharp spikes in dH/dt and therefore large voltage potentials in those moments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is produced by RF pulses, which (nearly) instantaneously changes the alignment of the spins (usually orthogonally). The quick recovery of everything back to B0 alignment (the constant magnetic field) is what gets collected and interpreted. There's some concern over the flips in the thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not always RF pulses.  MRIs also use other magnetic fields alongside the static magnetic field to cause hydrogen to flip to and from the transverse and longitudinal planes. These magnetic fields switch back and forth rapidly. These are called gradient echo sequences and they are more susceptible to peripheral nerve stimulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic field does not produce the signal read by the MRI, but rather establishes the conditions under which the signal can be produced. The magnet field is used to line up the spins of polar molecules (hydrogen atoms). A secondary radio pulse is emitted, knocking some of these molecules out of alignment. When the molecule whips back in-line with the magnetic field, it emits a secondary radio wave that is read by the MRI machine. There's a pretty good explanation of this <a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/science-education/science-topics/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri" target="_blank">here</a>. An alternating magnetic field is not needed or used.</p>
<p>They never switch the magnet off unless it's an emergency. The magnet in an MRI is made using a superconductor ring cooled by liquid helium. Once current is pumped into the ring and the ring is cooled the magnet will persist for a long long time. The only way to stop this is to let the helium boil-off, the ring heat up, and cease to be superconducting. This is called <a href="https://radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/patient-safety/mri/quench" target="_blank">quenching the magnet</a> and can often result in damage to the MRI.</p>
<p>I've been in a hospital while they've relocated a few MRI machines. They don't turn off the magnet for this. They clear all the folks and loose objects out of the path that was chosen by engineers so they stay way from anything ferrious that might  get attracted to the machines. I'd be nervous moving those machines around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this was a very good explanation. I’d be nervous moving them around too.</p>
<p>So even despite the magnetic field being static at all times, the magnetic field as seen by the patient’s brain would be increasing as the patient is moved further into the MRI initially, and would be decreasing as they are moved out of the MRI at the end. So this time-varying magnetic field (as seen by the patient’s brain) would produce a time-varying electric field and therefore voltage potential within the patient’s brain, the strength of which would be proportional to how quickly the patient is moved into/out of the MRI. So wouldn’t weird things happen in the patient’s brain as they are moved into and out of the MRI? I think that is the essence of this post</p></div>		</li>
