			<div class="markdown"><p>It also may be worth mentioning that impacts can cause these hotspots. At LPSC this year in Houston, there were some publishers exploring the relationship between impacts and these hotspots.... apparently an impact (if it’s suitably large) will cause compression of the crust, such that surrounding crust will naturally fill it, and will eventually cause rifting on the opposite side of the planet (as it fills in from both sides), providing passive upwelling creating a hotspot. This is strengthened by numerical modelling as shown at LPSC, but that’s always a bit touchy based on constraints. I am by no means an expert, I can just navigate the readings and follow along. This probably won’t be seen by many people because I’m pretty late, but it’s neat stuff!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t believe earth acts in the same manner.... I don’t know this for fact, but I in all my study, I have never heard impacts as a mechanism for rifting in the other side of the planet. Magma is definitely generated beneath the impact, as asteroids impact earth &lt;&lt;10km/s and almost instantly converts the crust beneath the impact to magma, down to about 2km. Mars may behave differently because it is 1/3rd the size of earth, and therefore I imagine it would require a much larger impact to affect the earth in the same manner. Keep in mind the earth also has an atmosphere which may also provide some resistance for impacts. </p>
<p>Again, I hope to someday be an expert in many Martian processes, but as of now my field is currently in phosphate dating within Martian meteorites. Cool stuff</p></div>		</li>

<p>For the record, Mt Everest is 8,848m above zero elevation (i.e. sea level). </p>
<p>Obviously Mars has no sea, so Olympus Mons' height is measured against the lowest point in Mars' atmosphere where liquid water is stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t believe so. There is a cliff face as tall as Everest on one side, but the terrain over there is quite rough and a rover probably wouldn’t be anywhere near that. The other sides are incredibly gradual as others have said. So gradual, in fact, that you could walk to the summit and never even realize you were going up hill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there's some evidence that Mars has a very limited plate tectonic system, basically a faultline running through Valles Marineris, shifting the north westward compared to the south side.  So just evidence for two partial plates in that case.  Probably not what caused this quake, but pretty interesting.</p>
