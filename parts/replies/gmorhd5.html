			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual physicist here: basically you would have no idea if entanglement was broken or not. Once one of the particles is in the black hole you can't access it, so all you can do is measure your own article's spin but at that point you are just measuring a spin, you cant play any games with entanglement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im pretty sure that would be impossible to test, but since entanglement doesn't facilitate the transfer of information, it might not break it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it wouldn't be useful for communication, but if entanglement holds and you collapse the wavefunction, you'd then know the quantum state of a particle beyond the event horizon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to what hawking radiation is. Sometimes a particle and it's anti-particle can spontaneously form. If they form in just the right place, one will get sucked into the black hole and the other will be able to escape.</p></div>		</li>
