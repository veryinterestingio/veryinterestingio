			<div class="markdown"><p>You can prepare a system the same and repeat experiments  many times. You can do bell tests. You can do .. Basically you're asking about the whole experimental basis of quantum theory which is 100 years of physics now and a bit much to list in a reddit comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that within a single test you cannot. By doing multiple repeated tests in different variations, though, you can build a statistical model of the behavior of particles in a quantum system and, it turns out, the results we get would be impossible if the particles had a defined state before they were measured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem</a> is the long answer.</p>
<p>if the needle is <em>really</em> pointing to <em>only</em> North and East <em>before</em> we look, that's called a &quot;local hidden variable theory&quot;, in that the needle's state-before-we-look is a &quot;hidden&quot; variable, but is <em>fixed</em> even before we look. But, weirdly enough, Bell's theorem is a mathematical proof of how such theories are <em>different</em> from theories where the needle indeed <em>must</em> vary away from the base states before we look, where there is no &quot;hidden&quot; base state but a truly varying non-base state instead before we collapse to the base state. And when we perform the experiments to test which category of theory describes the behavior of quantum particles, every such experiment to date has -- astonishingly -- categorically excluded the local hidden variable theories -- excluded the frameworks where the needle is secretly always stuck on a base state. It's impossible.</p>
<p>been too long for me to be familiar enough to give a short answer/decent analogy</p></div>		</li>
