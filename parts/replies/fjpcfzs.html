			<div class="markdown"><p>Now imagine how old CRT monitors work. </p>
<p>They literally shoot electrons from the back of the device, through a magnetic field that is used for aiming, onto the inside of the screen which is coated into RGB dots.  Those dots vibrate and give off radiation as color, which then travels through the air and into your eyes. </p>
<p>Some electrons &quot;escape&quot; the tube and hit objects in front of it, including your face and eyes. If a CRT is going bad, you can actually get a sunburn from sitting in front of one.</p></div>		</li>
