			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Hey, Vsauce! Michael here&quot; did a vid on that in his Mind Field show. I think it's the first episode of either season one or season two. I also can't quite remember the name of the experiment.</p>
<p>While writing this comment I decided to look up the name of that episode, it's called Isolation, Season 1, Episode 1. Short answer is that our brain can't function properly without a stimulus or stimuli, otherwise it itself will find something to do, something that might hurt you as was demonstrated in that episode in pain VS boredom experiment. Srsly, go watch all three seasons of Mind Field. It's free now, and will definitely be worth your time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha. I posted a Vsauce video in this thread before scrolling down (an irresponsible thing to do.) When I saw your comment I was like &quot;aw heck now I gotta go delete my comment.&quot; But then it turned out you were talking about a different video from the same creator. Howabout that.</p></div>		</li>
