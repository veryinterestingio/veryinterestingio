			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a class on teaching physics a while ago, and apparently electricity = water is a very, very bad model. For the life of me, I can't remember &quot;why&quot;, though. maybe it's the whole &quot;toaster oven in the bath tub&quot; danger... I am still using water and pipes to explain electricity</p>
<p>But since the question already talks about electrons, I kind of felt that using something as discreet as marbles worked better in this context</p></div>		</li>
