			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly there's art from the period where women were completely naked except for the feet bindings, giving a loose implication that their feet were considered more erotic than their genitalia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or that bound feet are actually repulsive to look at because the beauty of ‘lotus feet’ is in the thought of tiny doll-like feet. Revealing the reality of mangled toes and broken arches destroys that ideal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember writing a report on women in China in 8th grade, and finding a book about foot binding.  Somewhat NSFW, but <a href="https://pixfeeds.com/images/13/381220/1280-381220-625659872.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> is what the feet were made to look like.  This look was accomplished by making women bind their feet so tightly that the bones would develop differently.  Often the feet would bleed under the wrappings.  I read about this in 1989 or so, and it still is as fresh in my mind as the day I read about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or maybe they just thought they looked cuter that way. Like a naked woman with makeup, the goal isn't necessarily to be completely uncovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the cultures in question, girls’ feet are bound at a young age so their feet grow deformed to appear smaller and more dainty. Sometimes the bones will be broken to aid the process. So when unwrapped they will look very much deformed. I don’t think strippers in heels compares.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting how this hints at a possible unstable curve of clothing vs body sexualization, where in places that endorse additional covering to curb body sexualization it actually increases it in the society, which responds with more covering, reinforcing the problem.... Wallah, full body loose covering with only eye slits.  I wonder if they have bidets in common use in the middle east? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the rape is more prevalent in polygamist cultures due to stronger competition for mates. This is also why murder, violence, and crime are higher in an unequal society vs an egalitarian one. </p></div>		</li>
