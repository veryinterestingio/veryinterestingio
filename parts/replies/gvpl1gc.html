			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the FTC. Federal Trade Commission and it should be false advertising. The problem is there are so many lawyers that will argue things like... &quot;Advertising it like this is flushable. Neither the user nor the toilet get hurt by it.&quot; Now, the septic tank, or sanitation system down the line has to deal with it, but the immediate user and disposal method is &quot;safe&quot;. This is why there are so many laws that people complain about. Somebody tries to weasel around the existing ones to make an extra buck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also why there's so much argument between letter of the law and intent of the law. </p>
<p>And why forcing laws to clarify meanings defeats the latter.</p>
<p>To use a law I don't agree with but is a perfect example, canabis in the US is illegal to own seeds or the plant of, in some cases extract.</p>
<p>But by the letter of the law, products containing THC can be perfectly legal. So the production is highly illegal due to possession, but the product is legal <em>and</em> ownership of it is legal too. Despite being a controlled substance by intent/spirit of the anti-cannabis law, it appears to be perfectly legal in cases like that.</p>
<p>Your example is spot on too, any why these claims are highly dangerous to society in general, and why there's often argument of layman's understanding of statements vs literal statements. A layman would think it being flush-able means zero issues for sewage/septic in general. But it doesn't by the company's usage definition. They know it's not by layman's understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>with how many govt agencies we already have, and how many problems like this we have, do we really think adding another one will make a difference?</p>
<p>i'm not sure the exact solution here, but at the very least, these new duties should be given to agencies that already exist and have funding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t remember but several years back they (some entity I can’t recall; maybe the federal government?) banned use of bath salts in bath bombs because the salts would fuck up the pipes or sewage or something. While not harmful to people per se, it was damaging. Couldn’t those same things eventually be applied to wipes too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Key difference. Flushable wipes are clogging INDIVIDUAL homes. </p>
<p>Bath Salt are damaging PUBLIC sewage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Maybe some day the wipes will be banned, but currently the damage and repair cost fall on the individual rather than the government, thus I suspect action will take some time. (like a long time)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a story from yesterday.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that flushable wipes are perfectly safe to flush and don’t actually cause clogs. Baby wipes look pretty much identical, but aren’t flushable and do cause clogs. To avoid confusion, plumbers just say to not flush anything but toilet paper, because people will say that what they flushed was flushable, but really they flushed non-flushable wipes.</p>
<p>It’s similar to microwaves with popcorn settings. The bags always say to not use the popcorn setting, because a lot of microwaves don’t have a steam sensor and just use a timer, causing completely inconsistent popping. If your microwave does have a sensor, it’s actually recommended to use it, however the popcorn manufacturers assume you have no idea that some have sensors and some don’t, so they just say not to use it to cover their bases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue is that flushable wipes are flushable, in that they will leave your house just fine,  but they don't dissolve, and do cause issues further down the sewage system. Sewage treatment plants have to pull them out, and dispose of them separately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's false. Flushable wipes are not actually flushable. They don't biodegrade like TP and waste. When toilet paper gets wet it disintegrates. Obviously wet wipes don't dissolve when they get wet. They cause huge problems for sewer treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that yes, they do. Actual, flushable wipes do disintegrate into pulp in about the same time as high-quality toilet paper. It is that exact quality that makes them &quot;flushable&quot;. </p>
<p>The problem is that when flushable wipes came to market, people started assuming that all wipes were flushable. Or, they intended to buy flushable wipes and inadvertently bought (and flushed)  regular wipes.  </p>
<p>The blockages caused by flushed wipes are entirely due to the non-flushable variety. The best solution is to mandate that <strong>all</strong> wipes marketed for personal use should meet the same disintegration standards as toilet paper or the flushable variety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is definitely not 100% true. There might be (probably are) some flushable wipes that shouldn’t be flushed, but there are loads of ones that are 100% plant based, will easily biodegrade within days, and are completely fine to flush. Baby wipes are basically plastic and will (almost) never biodegrade though.</p></div>		</li>
