			<div class="markdown"><p>On the black body radiation graph, you can see that a 3000 kelvin emits less 1 µm wavelength photon (Infrared) than a 4000 or 5000 K do and barely any UVs. So in OP's example, the Object X would not only release more UV but also more IR (and other wavelength) than Object Y.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Umm...I may not have stressed enough just how little I understand science. There's a lot of information on that page, and it's pretty overwhelming to try and parse through. Could you (or someone) give a simple breakdown of what it all means? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>probably the simplest way to think about it is in terms of average.  Wavelength changes (becomes shorter) with higher energy. So, the hotter (more energetic) an object is, the shorter the average wavelength will be.  Everything else just shifts along with it, so you end up with a somewhat normal (but skewed) distribution of all energy.  A bit over-simplified but the essential idea is there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shorter wavelengths require more energy, and a hotter object has more energy to give.</p>
<p>At higher temperatures, subatomic particles move more quickly, and the photons they release also have a higher frequency. Frequency is the inverse of wavelength; a higher frequency means a shorter wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Ehcksit has given a good description of the why, but I thought you might like to know the rule, as well.</p>
<p>The wavelength of the peak intensity is given by Wien's displacement law, λ = b/T, where b is Wien's constant.</p>
<p>Edit: to satisfy your intuition, watch a hunk of metal warm up as it passes from dull red up through orange or yellow.</p></div>		</li>
