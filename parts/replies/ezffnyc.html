			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not easy to say. Roughly you can guess based on the angle from the horizon, with clouds closer to the horizon being further away. Look up how high certain types of clouds usually are, then do back of the napkin triangle math to figure how far away they are, anywhere from straight over head, to the distance to the horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As moist, unstable air rises, clouds often form at the altitude where temperature and dew point reach the same value. When lifted, unsaturated air cools at a rate of 5.4 °F per 1,000 feet and the dew point temperature decreases at a rate of 1 °F per 1,000 feet. This results in a convergence of temperature and dew point at a rate of 4.4 °F. Apply the convergence rate to the reported temperature and dew point to determine the height of the cloud base.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to use Arizona as a reference because I know distances here. Consider the view from Downtown Phoenix.</p>
<p>The top of a thunderstorm in Payson (~70 miles away) can be seen about 20 degrees above the horizon (90 is straight up). The top of a thunderstorm over the mountains just to the north of town (~40 miles away) is about 75 degrees above the horizon, though it’s possible I can’t see the top because other parts of the cloud are blocking it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in a relatively dark area at night. I can see flashes from thunderstorms over 100 miles away while I'm sitting under a starry clear sky.  When I see a storm in the distance I check the weather radar to see where the lightning is at.  This might only work on flat terrain in areas of powerful storms though. It's beautiful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shadow trick only works for very tiny clouds.  The question clearly implies they want to know how big clouds can get.  Obviously we know clouds can be a wide range of sizes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clouds are simply collections of relatively closely positioned water particles, so who’s to say where a cloud begins or ends? Or even that a cloud is a single entity? Does fog count? How far apart to particles have to be before one cloud becomes two?</p>
<p>It’s rather like asking how big a lake can get. Conceptually there seems like there’s a limit (at least given what we observe in nature), but there’s really no answer. </p>
<p>I mean, the majority of the planet Jupiter is one big cloud by many definitions.</p></div>		</li>
