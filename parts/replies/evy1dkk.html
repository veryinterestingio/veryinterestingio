<p>Grammatical genders are more akin to word classes: words in the same class will behave in similar ways</p>

<p>Yep. &quot;Feminine noun&quot; doesn't mean &quot;girly, flowery, pink noun that wears dresses and makeup&quot;; it means &quot;noun that uses the same grammatical forms that the word for <em>woman</em> does&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Albeit, there is (sparse) research suggesting that grammatical gender might influence how we think about the object in question. </p>
<p>The typical example is when spanish speakers and german speakers where asked to describe a key.</p>
<p>The spanish speakers, where key is a feminine word, more commonly used words like <em>small, Intricate, golden</em>.</p>
<p>German speakers, where key is masculine, more commonly used words like <em>jagged, heavy, hard</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Rifle&quot; can be translated to Portuguese as &quot;espingarda&quot; (feminine) or &quot;fusil&quot; (masculine). &quot;Storm&quot; can be translated as either &quot;tempestade&quot; (feminine) or &quot;temporal&quot; (masculine). &quot;Espada&quot; (sword) is feminine, but &quot;sabre&quot; (sabre, go figure) is masculine. &quot;Episódio&quot; (episode) is masculine, though &quot;temporada&quot; (season) is feminine. &quot;Coelho&quot; (rabbit) is masculine even though &quot;lebre&quot; (hare) is feminine.</p>
<p>There's really no rule about how we assign these things that's even vaguely related to some sort of assignment of gender roles to things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As classic examples from Spanish, la barba (beard) is feminine. El vestido (dress) is masculine. Mar (the sea) goes both ways. It seems to be masculine when it’s more objective, like the sea is over there, but feminine in more poetic expressions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some reason, explanations involving language are beyond me. I discovered this trying to learn a language through Duolingo and asking questions on the forum. I really do need it to be explained like I'm 5. I have no idea what this means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>such as declining and conjugating after similar rules, using similar adjectives when described in a sentence ... or take a specific determinate forms (i.e la vs le in french).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand the idea of classes and separating words into groups, but then the examples in the above sentence confused me. Can you give some more examples of what you mean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a big grammar lesson and I'm neither a linguist nor a teacher, but I'll try explaining the best I can. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conjugation and declination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some languages words take on different forms depending on the context. </p>
<p>as an example imagine the english word &quot;to go&quot;</p>
<p>depending on tense, &quot;go&quot; can appear as any of the following words:</p>
<p>&quot; Go, goes,  Gone, Going, Went&quot;</p>
<p>All of these words mean &quot;To go&quot;: but are used in different contexts. If you're ordering me to go somewhere,  you wouldn't use &quot;EgNotaEkkiReddit, please went to the store!&quot;. &quot;Go&quot; is how you order me to go somewhere, &quot;Went&quot; means I've already left the house. </p>
<p>Another example of conjuration is for the word &quot;leave&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave, left, leaving, leaves&quot;</p>
<p>English also does this with plurality. </p>
<p>&quot;Horse&quot; vs &quot;Horses&quot;. </p>
<p>Both words refer to the same animal, but one refers to <em>one</em> animal, and the other refers to <em>many</em> animals. You don't go &quot;one horse, many horse&quot;, you say &quot;one horse, many horses&quot;.</p>
<p>Conjucation is when verbs change.</p>
<p>Declination is when nouns and adjectives change. </p>
<p>Some languages have words that only change depending on <em>when</em> the thing is happening, other languages can change the word depending on <em>who</em> is using them, and <em>how many</em> things are being talked about, or <em>what</em> you're telling me about. </p>
<p>In gendered languages one of the things gender might affect is how the words change. So, all male words might end with &quot;er&quot; in plural, but all feminine words might end with &quot;i&quot;. So if we assume an imaginary version of english that is gendered we could imagine that &quot;horse&quot; is masculine and &quot;sheep&quot; feminine we would go</p>
<p>&quot;One horse, many horser&quot; and &quot;one sheep, many sheepi&quot;, </p>
<p>and that's going to be more often than not the case: you'd see waitressi, actressi, actorer, clocker, booki&quot; e.t.c. Of course there are exceptions, but in the broad strokes the groups follow similar rules. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using similar adjectives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already took an example, but I'll take another one from Icelandic.</p>
<p>&quot;Hann&quot; means &quot;He&quot;. &quot;Hún&quot; means she. &quot;Það&quot; means it. </p>
<p>I want to tell you about the man, woman, and child. All three things are cute. the icelandic word for &quot;cute&quot; is &quot;sætt&quot;. However, &quot;sætur&quot;(like all adjectives) changes depending on the gender of the thing it is describing. It declines.</p>
<p>&quot;Hann er sætur&quot; ( He is cute)</p>
<p>&quot;Hún er sæt&quot; (She is cute)</p>
<p>&quot;Það er sætt&quot; (It is cute)</p>
<p>Sætur, sæt, sætt all mean &quot;cute&quot;, but refer to specific genders. a man is &quot;sætur&quot;, but a baby is &quot;sætt&quot;. If a native speaker insists that something is &quot;Sæt&quot; that's a strong indication that speaker feels the noun to be feminine, because otherwise they'd use either of the two other words for cute things. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determinate forms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A determinate form of a word simply tells you if you're specing about a specific thing, or the concept of the thing. </p>
<p>the determinate form (I am speaking about a specific &quot;cow&quot;) in english is signified with the word &quot;The&quot;. The cow. </p>
<p>The indeterminate form (I am speaking about a random cow) in english is signified with the words &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot;. A cow. </p>
<p>In Icelandic if you are speaking about a specific thing you append &quot;nn&quot;, &quot;n&quot; or &quot;ð&quot; to the word, or &quot;inn, in, ið&quot; if the word doesn't end with a vowel. </p>
<p>&quot;Maður&quot; is a man, but &quot;maður<strong>inn</strong>&quot; is the man. </p>
<p>&quot;Kona&quot; is a woman, but &quot;Kona<strong>n</strong>&quot; is the woman.</p>
<p>&quot;Barn&quot; is a toddler, but &quot;Barn<strong>ið</strong>&quot; is the toddler. </p>
<p>You could imagine that if english was gendered you'd have f.i words like &quot;Waiter&quot; and &quot;Waitress&quot; being signified with &quot;The waiter&quot; and &quot;Tha waitress&quot;, or some other arbitrary system. </p>
<p>Do ask if you have questions, I'm all ears even if my examples aren't perfectly clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ummm.. Yes, I think I understand your examples, thanks for taking the time to explain :)  Soo.. there are classes in language. Those are some examples above. Conjugation, declination and determinate. I understand what those examples mean but I'm not sure I understand why that would mean gender happens. I'm thinking of gender being 2 classes.. 2 ways of changing. But why.. wow, I understand it so badly I don't even know what my question is. Sorry, the explanations of conjugation etc were clear enough, but I'm struggling to connect it to why gender came about. But I can't formulate what the struggle is, so it seems a lost cause! Thanks though :)</p></div>		</li>
