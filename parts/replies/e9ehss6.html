			<div class="markdown"><p>You covered pretty much everything.  I just had some more info since I'm studying this right now so it's all fresh in my mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Flesh Eating Bacteria&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. The more accurate name is &quot;necrotizing fasciitis&quot; which is a description of the symptom rather than any specific organism. It can be caused by any bacteria that can cause aggressive tissue death. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our bodies can't fight it because the people who are susceptible to these infections already have a poor immune system. i.e. the infection is a result of &quot;Host factors&quot; (impaired immunity in the human), &quot;virulence factors&quot; (how strong/dangerous the bacteria is, what traits it carries), &quot;environmental factors&quot; (poor wound care, not washing hands) and a whole lot of bad luck!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another useful term is &quot;opportunistic infection&quot;. We are all covered head to toe in bacteria at all times. It's mostly E. coli, Staph and other runners up like Salmonella and Clostridium species like C.  tetini (the cause of tetanus).</p>
<p>If you have a weakened immune system or get a cut deep enough that its not exposed to air (tetanus and strep are anaerorbic and don't grow well in air) one of these typically harmless skin bacteria will suddenly get a foothold.</p>
<p>Most of these bacteria have some degree of antibiotic resistance, so once you get the infection it might be really hard to get rid of, and the surrounding tissue will take a lot of damage before you get it under control. Once the necrotizing toxins you mentioned get into the cells and they are already dead. The black/green smelly condition of flesh eating disease and gas gangrene is already a lost cause and will have to be cut away from the healthy flesh in hopes that it doesn't spread. </p>
<p>Some of the most effective antibiotics are also the harshest, and would do as much damage to your body as it did to the infection. That's why antibiotics like Bacitracin are &quot;topical use only&quot; and come in triple antibiotic ointment. So if you get a cut, disinfect it somehow. Hydrogen Peroxide, Rubbing Alcohol, TAO all work. Pay special care if the cut is deep enough not to be exposed to the air (like stepping on a nail). If the wound gets worse over time and it's getting warmer, redder, more swollen or more painful go to the doctor to get it checked out as those are signs of an active infection. </p>
<p><strong>If you ever see red lines appearing on a path leading from a wound moving towards the heart (following the same route as veins), go to the ER! That is a sign of a blood infection and can be a severe emergency!</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had MRSA a few years back and I didn't even have a cut or wound that I knew of.  Friday night, red bump like an ingrown hair on my bicep, by Monday morning when I was finally able to go to the doctor I had a bump the size of a silver dollar and the red extended from elbow to armpit.  My entire upper arm was aching and hot to the touch.  Stuff doesn't mess around.  </p>
<p>Can it form without an active wound or did I have something I wasn't aware of?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (the SA of MRSA) is a really common bacteria to have living on your skin. It is the major cause of many minor skin infections like acne, ingrown hairs, boils and cysts and impetigo. </p>
<p>It might have, in fact, been a pimple or ingrown hair. </p>
<p>Most people are walking around right now with a few cases of minor Staph infection. Most of the time our body resolves it on its own. Every once in a while it colonizes and goes like your experience. The older or sicker you get, the greater the chances that it gets out of control. It's really just a manner of luck, and keeping an eye out for the signs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A runaway infection like necrotising fasciitis doesn't require someone to be immune-compromised or sick, it can attack perfectly healthy individuals. </p>
<p>The innate immune system is unable to defend against bacteria which possess the 'perfect storm' of pathogen- and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence_factor#Destructive_enzymes" target="_blank">virulence-factors</a>. What turns a happy healthy skin bacteria on your skin into a monster under your skin include enzymes that dissolve lipids, proteins, and especially DNA. This means that it's not slowed down by cells, or the gunk that your innate immune system spews out to slow down infections. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that most cases of necrotizing fasciitis may start up as a monomicrobial infection but by the time you have gangrene they usually become polymicrobial infections.</p></div>		</li>
