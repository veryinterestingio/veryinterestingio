			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree, but the idea that all bubbles must pop when the underlying asset goes belly up is still only an assumption.  We are assuming that rational investors won't pay for overvalued assets.  But they were always technically overvalued (since they were going to go out of business eventually as we now know), there was just a point at which rational actors could no longer ignore that the asset had less/no value.  </p>
<p>So you have to draw a line in the sand over what type of information will confirm that the asset's value has changed.  If I'm a financial genius who is laser focused on a particular asset and industry, maybe I recognize it is valueless early, and maybe for the causal investor it becomes valueless when WSJ says it's going under.  But we still are assuming that the line at which it loses value is when a significant number of people come to that realization. Most trades are placed by professionals who largely share a common view of what is market rational, and their view dictates when value is lost because their trades dictate the market price.  Their lemming nature put us in the bubble for the reason you describe.  But take Pomemon cards, who is the rational investor there?  People who really understand Charizard?  My point being that bubbles don't have to pop.  Ever.  Not if they are based on what we consider traditionally irrational behavior like faith, love in the stock qua the stock (trading cards), the lulz (GME), etc.  America doesn't pop maybe because of nationalistic American exceptionalism.  Who is to say that won't be true of Amazon someday when people come to believe the company is part of the fabric of their lives to the point that no amount of &quot;rational&quot; information about their ability to generate future revenue impacts the belief that their stock is valuable?  Works for gold and diamonds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, what, you're going to continue to buy pets.com at $11/share even when the company doesn't exist? What is it, a collectors' item?</p>

<p>No, we're assuming that even the dumbest, most gullible investor on the planet can figure out that a defaulted mortgage or a dissolved company isn't capable of backing up the putative value of a security.</p>
<p>Also, we're not talking about a single-player game, here. <strong>YOU</strong> don't need to come to the conclusion that an asset is overvalued in order for its value to disappear.</p>

<p>If a bubble never pops, then it wasn't actually bubble. By definition, if an asset holds its value, it's not overvalued. You don't have a bubble, you have a stable investment. For example, take California Real Estate. It's supremely expensive, and remain expensive, and will stay that way as long as the region's economy continues to draw talent there for high-paid tech work, and the weather remains beautiful.</p>
<p>Ultimately, value is necessarily subjective. Are beanie babies or baseball cards worth anything? I would argue &quot;no&quot;, but so long as there are people willing to pay significant money to own them, then they have value. The same goes, ironically, for many of the &quot;safe&quot; asset-classes which capital flees to when times are bad. Can you eat Gold? At day's end, a price is a wish until there's a willing buyer.</p></div>		</li>
