			<div class="markdown"><p>Peer reviewed, published articles and citations (when other people publish papers that cite your paper that is considered an indicator that your paper is valuable). University professor positions are very self directed. You typically have a set amount of time (~6 years) to prove your self and be granted tenure (guaranteed job for life). It depends on the institution, but there often isn't much guidance on how many publications  and citations it takes to be granted tenure, so the expectation is that you do as much as you possibly can and hope for the best.</p></div>		</li>
