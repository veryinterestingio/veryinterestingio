			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, an H bomb is actually a combination of the two. It's a fission bomb that triggers DT fusion which produces a large neutron yield to feed a bigger fission bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Though it looks more like a ball-point pen. Many thermonuclear bombs use multiple stages - it's called a Teller-Ulam configuration, after the two scientists who developed it.</p>
<p>Typically there's just a primary, spherical stage (basically a boosted-fission bomb) which emits X-rays to fuse a cylindrical secondary.  But I believe the Tsar bomb actually used 3 stages (with a duplicate of the secondary stage for the tertiary).  They also thankfully removed the uranium tamper of the last stage so the bomb only produced a humble 50MegaTon yield, rather than the ~100MT is was capable of.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> - here is a <a href="https://c8.alamy.com/comp/BH20BB/teller-ulam-two-stage-thermonuclear-bomb-design-BH20BB.jpg" target="_blank">nice diagram</a> of the configuration.</p></div>		</li>
