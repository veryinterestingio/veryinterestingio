<p>edit: Waking up in the middle of the night to pee on a regular basis, multiple times, is the first thing the doctors ask when you go in for a checkup once you start getting older. It could be sleep apnea, diabetes, prostate problems.. I'm just trying to help him out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is rubbish. Bladders are extraordinarily flexible, hence used to make everything from flotation devices to footballs.  That's why we call things that can expand with things inside them... bladders.</p>
<p>There is a MB episode where they really stretch a pig bladder to it's limits.</p>
<p>Hey - look at these inflexible cow bladders: <a href="https://youtu.be/_5V4YJSENF0" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/\_5V4YJSENF0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/\_5V4YJSENF0</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, I felt like that was the wrong choice of words as I wrote this, but I was tired and couldn't think of a better choice.    </p>
<p>Imagine the difference between an aluminum balloon and a rubber balloon.   With an aluminum balloon, it fills to max size and pretty quickly after that it'll rupture.   A rubber balloon can just be filled larger and larger until it's much thinner than it's &quot;intended size&quot; before finally bursting.    </p>
<p>Several organs in our body function more like the rubber balloon.  Our skin, stomach and colon are like this.  Years of overeating will also enlarge all of those.   However, your bladder will stay about 6&quot; (for humans) max capacity, throughout your whole life (thankfully).  This is 16-24 fl oz.   Emptied, it's about 2&quot;.    </p>
<p>Here's a medical case where a man basically had a &quot;blockage&quot; that prevented him from urinating until his bladder ruptured.  Binge drinking is also a cause.  However, spontaneous rupturing is pretty rare, regardless.   <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5849873/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5849873/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5849873/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: this is why you don't go 50+ hours without sleep. Clearly i had no idea what i was reading. LOL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks friend, I felt bad contradicting op but I was like hmm I don't remember hearing that I rememeber almost everyone organ being quite flexible in the cause of solid trauma it gives them room to move inside their respective cavities with their visceral and parietal layer making sure there isn't too much damage sustained. Plus other situations like pregnancy, over eating, etc.</p></div>		</li>
