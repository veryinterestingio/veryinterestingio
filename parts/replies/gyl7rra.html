			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweet: carbohydrate binding to your taste buds</p>
<p>Salty: positive ions (other than hydrogen) binding to your taste buds</p>
<p>Sour: positive hydrogen ions (i.e. acids) specifically binding to your taste buds</p>
<p>Bitter: negative ions (i.e. bases) binding to your taste buds</p>
<p>Umami: Amino acids binding to your taste buds</p>
<p>MSG = monosodium glutamate = one positive ion and one amino acid. Hence why it tastes salty and umami.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt may also have a modifying effect on some of those other flavors. Salt is believed to enhance perceived sweet and umami flavors while reducing perceived bitterness, though the mechanism is apparently still not clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without knowing anything about this at all, I would guess that the effect comes from the mixing of neural signals after each ligand binds separately to its respective receptor, rather than because salt ions are binding to sweet receptors or vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just looking for some clarification here since I'm curious. When you say negative &quot;ions (bases)&quot; do you mean hydroxls only? Cause like, a salt is an ionic bond with both negative and positive ions that go into dissolution in your mouth. So with the associations you've presented I'm left wondering why doesn't every salt crystal taste both salty and bitter? Unless the interpretation I gave about hydroxls is correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was oversimplifying, but no, it applies to bases other than OH groups. But Cl- is a very weak base, and also, it's not organic, so even though it's electron rich, it doesn't have a similar shape to the organic basic poisons that we evolved to taste as bitter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The xenophobia that sparked the MSG controversy originally is such a criminally frustrating issue, because it means that an amazing asset to cooking is shunned so much by ignorant masses. Every time I see a restaurant claiming to be &quot;MSG free&quot; I get a little sad. It's a great flavoring agent and I use it all the time in my cooking. Seems like magic every time you turn a rather dull broth delicious with a spoonful. And yet, I can't tell anyone about how great it is without getting shut down by people just perpetuating it being bad for you because that's what they've been told by others.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get mild stomach aches if I put <em>way</em> too much into whatever I'm eating, but I also get stomach aches by putting too much salt into my food, and humans have been eating salt for thousands of years. It just so happens that it's far easier to put too much MSG in than too much salt, because too much MSG doesn't taste anywhere near as terrible as too much salt...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well designed studies find no effect from eating reasonable amounts of MSG, even in people who claim to be MSG sensitive.   </p>
<p>which makes sense, as it's literally the sodium salt of glutamic acid, which itself is an amino acid. so both of the ions that make up MSG are always in your body and lots of various foods anyway.  </p>
<p>i feel like if they called it something like &quot;naturally-derived seaweed extract&quot; or something like that, people would be okay with it again (because it's present in seaweed -- was originally isolated from a seaweed broth).</p>
<p>EDIT
this paper describes a double masked placebo controlled experiment. They found that, even in people who call themselves sensitive to MSG, symptoms were not reported when the MSG was given with food - &quot;The results suggest that large doses of MSG given without food may elicit more symptoms than a placebo in individuals who believe that they react adversely to MSG. However, the frequency of the responses was low and the responses reported were inconsistent and were not reproducible. The responses were not observed when MSG was given with food.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People always claim they get headaches from it but I wonder if most of these claims are just due to over salted food and selective memory.  I've seen a number of times people who claimed they could never touch msg and found out later it was in their meal but had no issue with it.  </p>
<p>I use fish sauce, which has glutamate naturally in it, to add umami to things like stir frys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MSG was originally isolated from kombu seaweed, though its industrial source is wheat gluten. The umami flavor of cured skipjack tuna was traced to inosine monophosphate, and that of shiitake to guanosine monophosphate. Any combination of the three is synergistic.</p>
<p>As a taste, umami is different from salt. If you ever get the chance to taste a little MSG powder just dissolved in water, do it. It will be so much easier to recognize it from then on.</p>
<p>Chemically, all three umami compounds include a complicated carbon-based structure, quite different from the straightforward ions that make up NaCl.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MSG on its own is a weird experience. I've had to taste it to check that ingredients from different suppliers were comparable. For me it's like my nose says there's nothing aromatic but my brain says savory. And then I start to salivate like crazy. Good times</p></div>		</li>
