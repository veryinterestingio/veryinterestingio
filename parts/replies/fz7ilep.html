			<div class="markdown"><p>Cell differentiation starts very early when an embryo is developing.</p>
<p>A <strong>zygote</strong> forms at conception, consisting of just one cell. The zygote develops into an <strong>embryo</strong>, which is a multi-cellular organism. Cell specialization is vital for proper embryo development. The embryo needs cells to develop each of its vital organs, such as the brain, heart and skin.</p>
<p>Cells become specialized based on environmental cues. This is easier to explain with a picture, but I'll try my best.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the first cell, the zygote. In the zygote, little proteins called <strong>transcription factors</strong> are floating around. Transcription factors are responsible for activating specific genes.</p>
<p>So in the zygote, little clusters of transcription factors are grouped around the cell. When the zygote starts to divide into multiple cells, the different groups of transcription factors will be pulled into cells that form near them, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Let's say there is a group of transcription factors floating around inside the left side of the zygote. Then, the zygote splits in two, with one cell on the left and one on the right. The cell on the left will get the transcription factors, and the cell on the right won't have them.</p>
<p>As the embryo grows and cells keep dividing, each cell will end up with specific transcription factors within it. These transcription factors specialize the cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating.  But there seems to be an element of chance that says which sides of the cell form which clusters; depending on the particular choice of TF soup, that cell will become a heart or kidney etc. But all foetuses seem to develop the same way structurally in a very deterministic manner. How come?</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, genes, the protein-coding segments of DNA, only makes up about 2% of your DNA. The other 98% is called <strong>noncoding DNA</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When someone says we share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees or 50% of our DNA with bananas, is that referring to our genes or all of our DNA?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Banana claim is referring to our genes, and the Chimp claim is referring to our DNA. Both of those numbers though are inaccurate.</p>
<p>The popular claim that we share &quot;60% of our DNA with bananas&quot; is based off of a study where scientists compared the genes of a banana to human genes. About 41% of our genes have a recognizable counterpart in the banana genome. So if we have a gene that allows for cell growth, and a banana has a gene that allows for cell growth, they counted that as a match. They found that 41% of the genes in bananas have recognizable counterparts in humans.</p>
<p>This still may sound shocking, but it really isn't. These genes encode the basic functions that keep plants and animals alive, like consuming oxygen and cell growth.</p>
<p>Since genes only comprise 2% of our DNA, even though  we share around 50 percent of our genes with bananas, that turns out to be only about 1% of our DNA. And we pretty much share at least 1% of our DNA with all living things.</p>
<p>For the Chimpanzees, we share about 95% of our DNA. Remember that 98% of DNA is noncoding, and does things like tell our cells to transcribe this specific gene that starts here and ends there etc. And when you think about it, the 95% finding makes sense. We share all the same organs, body structure, etc. The 5% difference is important, but we are very similar to them.</p>
