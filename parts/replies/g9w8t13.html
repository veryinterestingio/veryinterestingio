			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do some hairs stop growing altogether with age (thinning eyebrows or head hair for example) while some starts growing where it never seemed to before? I'm referring to the peach fuzz type facial hair, hair on and in ears, much longer nose hairs, even peach fuzz around the eyebrows that seems transparent next to the thin darker eyebrow hair.
Also, why on earth won't my bikini area stop having razor burn when it was never a problem when I was younger? I use new blades and have changed products a few times. I'm a little younger than 40. I just want the sides kept tidy for goodness's sake. The razor burn almost looks worse than being untidy there. 🙄
Aging requires so much more grooming efforts all the way around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess?</p>
<p>Epigenetic damage.</p>
<p>Your DNA is protected by a “wrapper” called the Epigenome.</p>
<p>When your cells need to consult the blueprints in your nuclei, transfer RNA reaches into the nucleus to expand and read the proteins.</p>
<p>Then they snap back almost instantly in a way that makes our computers entirely baffled.</p>
<p>But not all genes can be read.</p>
<p>They’re covered.</p>
<p>So, if your Grandmother gave you the DNA for red hair, but it’s covered, you won’t express it.</p>
<p>As time goes by,  use of drugs, stress from diseases, radiation, etc, will damage the epigenome.</p>
<p>And then you might see genes expressed you don’t like.</p></div>		</li>
