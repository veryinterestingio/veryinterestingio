			<div class="markdown"><p>They're still hypothetical. Anyway, sterile neutrinos have issues being a contender, mainly due to there incredibly low mass. They just don't fit the bill right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Neutrinos have so little mass that they basically were used as 'massless' particles in conservation equations. Made those in the nuclear field laugh our asses off when it was detected they actually had mass but somehow everything still works the way it is supposed to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very likely, yes. Dark matter doesn't interact much with anything, so you have individual particles just flying through the galaxies. The most popular models have particles everywhere in the galaxy - some of them are flying through you right now. We have set up detectors looking for an occasional interaction of these particles with the detector material, but no luck so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we know so little about dark matter particles and their hypothetical interactions with real, detectable matter particles, how do we know that we can set up devices that would detect the interaction between DM particles and known, proven particles? Are we talking a detection of mass interaction, energy? I’m very curious on this part of this convo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if dark matter is all around us, how comes it does not affect gravity at our solar system scale, but does at the galactical level? Wouldn't this suggest dark matter is clumped away from the star systems?</p>
<p>Or can we sense distortions of gravity at the scale of our solar system explainable by dark matter?</p>
<p>EDIT: never mind, I just remembered the answer to a similar questions I had asked earlier: the total amount of dark matter within our solar system is likely small, on the order of a dwarf planet. Thus it does not affect gravity much at the scale of our system. However, the distances between star systems are so huge, that if dark matter is uniformely spread, there is plenty enough space in between star systems to account for it representing 85% of the mass of visible matter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All around us.  Imagine a very very very thin gas spread through the whole galaxy.  In any small volume of space, like the solar system, there is only the tiniest bit.  But since it's everywhere, it adds up.  Think of how insignificant the stars and planets are compared to all of the empty space between them.  Then multiply that by a whole galaxy.  There is a LOT of dark matter, it's just spread thin, unlike the normal matter that has clumped into stars and planets and stuff we can see.</p>
<p>And it's not just  undetectable by human senses, but undetectable by almost any technology we can build.  Imagine a particle like an electron, except it has no electric charge, no magnetic dipole, no color charge, etc.  It just doesn't interact with anything except gravity, unless you get *extremely* lucky and one happens to directly collide with another elementary particle.  And since atoms are mostly empty space, that almost never happens, they just pass right through.</p>
<p>The way we've tried looking for them so far is by building huge tanks of ultra pure liquids deep underground in mines, and loading them with sensors to detect the tiny flash of light that individual particle collisions can create.  Putting them underground lets the earth act as a filter, only things that can effortlessly pass through the earth will reach the tank and maybe, if you're lucky, one will occasionally collide with a particle within the tank.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be clear: this is how we look for neutrinos, but we don't necessarily know whether all of the dark matter is made of neutrinos.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The odds that our model of gravity is wrong in such a way that it can explain away all the observations that let us conclude dark matter exists? None.</p>
<p>Back in the 80s that was a reasonable conjecture, but today there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Observational_evidence" target="_blank">numerous independent lines of evidence for dark matter</a>, and there's no way another model of gravity could explain them all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>General relativity is known to be wrong at quantum scales. I don't know why you dismiss the notion that it is also wrong at multi-galactic scales so quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the universe is truly constant at these scales. Perhaps gravity just varies depending on position within the universe. </p>
<p>Of course there are a lot of epistemological issues which would arise from that, and there are probably refutations of this idea which already exist, but it’s interesting to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to add, that the current second-best theory to explain all this after dark matter is called modified newtonian dynamics, or &quot;MOND&quot;. It supposes that we are in fact wrong about gravity at galactic scales, and seeks to correct our theories without introducing new particles. It has a lot more problems than dark matter does when it comes to explaining all the related phenomena, but there was a study recently that gives it some support in explaining galactic rotation curves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For dark matter the odds are extremely low. The data just fits with &quot;extra mass&quot; really well. Better than scalar adjustments to gravity. There are also good reasons to be skeptical of the assumption, &quot;all the stuff that has mass is really bright&quot;. </p>
<p>So when you weigh the competing explanations of the galaxy rotation problem 1) &quot;the second most accurate scientific theory ever devised is wrong at large length scales in an extremely convenient way&quot; against 2) &quot;some stuff can be heavy and not glow&quot; it comes out real favorably for 2.</p>
<p>I don't know much about dark energy but the error bars on the related data look bigger, so that one is less clear. Though if you want to learn something, &quot;smart people that work on this for a living are usually right&quot;, is a good place to start.</p></div>		</li>
