<p>Osteopathy is an old physical manipulation therapy technique that is partly pseudoscientific. DO students receive all education and training of their MD colleagues in addition to this manipulative technique, however 99% of DOs never use it again and forget it after theyre tested on it. It’s something DO national leadership pushes so they can make $ by projecting this damaging “difference” between MD and DOs when really there is none.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's equivalent to an MD, and they recieve basically the same schooling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main difference between DOs and MDs comes down to the philosophy of care. DOs practice an osteopathic approach to care, while MDs practice an allopathic approach to care.</p>
<p>An allopathic approach focuses on contemporary, research-based medicine, and it often uses medications or surgery to treat and manage different conditions.</p>
<p>An osteopathic approach to care focuses on the whole body. DOs often focus on preventative care.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because pain is how the body tells you to stop what you're doing and get help. After figuring out what the problem is then pain is just an annoying thing that hurts. In certain situations it would be better to not numb the pain to keep track of any changes that might occur but if its from a stubbed toe or a cut then its better to wrap it up and not be miserable from the pain while its healing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, patients with severe diabetes mellitus (the more famous one associated with obesity) that’s not well controlled can result in loss of pain sensation. Patients often not realize how much damage can occur to parts of their body not readily observed such as the feet. So commonly patients have bad ulcers on their feet that could lead to having gangrene in the feet.</p></div>		</li>
