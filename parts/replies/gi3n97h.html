			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they're saying that the connections between arteries and veins prolific enough that most places you might &quot;cap off&quot; have one nearby</p>
<p>And in addition, I think they're saying blood <em>always</em> runs through the smaller arteries before getting to a vein. If there were many large connectors between veins and arteries, there wouldn't be enough pressure to push blood through the capillaries</p>
<p>(correct me if I'm wrong though. It's mostly my intuition on circuits, current, and resistance speaking I don't have a fluid dynamics degree)</p>
<p>Edit: I almost forgot - - veins have special valves in them that help transport blood back to the heart when you move your muscles. I read they help move the blood up against gravity so it doesn't pool. But it also makes senses if the blood has to lose pressure moving though capillaries and then back into a larger vein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ye that was my follow up question too. Like in the analogy, does water pool at the now capped pipe?</p></div>		</li>
