<p>The scalpers work both sides of the supply and demand ... buying (low) from folks coming to the game with extra ticket(s), selling (high) to people showing up to the game without a ticket. </p>
<p>Per the original question, I assume they build “breakage” into their business model (google it, in this case an average cost of goods (their unsold tickets) they must “eat”. </p>
<p>Even if the game is not sold out they might still get a premium for good seats (vs what the team is selling at face value at the stadium box office. ) hence generating enough revenue to cover the breakage and still make a profit. </p>
<p>Or does that “:-)” at the end mean you really didn’t need the ELI5 and I’ve just revealed myself to still be that same naive little boy?</p></div>		</li>
