There are studies suggesting that c sections disrupt microbiota exchange from the mother happening during birth. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07631-x" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07631-x</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In early vertebrates reproduction was primarily external fertilization in the water so I would think that a little contamination was preferable to altogether eating the sperms and eggs necessary for baby-makin’. And I suppose there mostly hasn’t been enough selective pressure to evolve away from that for the most part. </p></div>		</li>
