			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of weeks ago ago, there was a popular post about how we could battle climate change by planting something like a trillion new trees.  But it sounds like that even if that was possible, the reduction would be temporary until the trees reach old age?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. While carbon is released as trees die, the trees would not all die at once or decay at the same rate. A new self-sustaining forest, one which grows its own new trees through old fashioned natural processes as the old trees die, would offset this problem and take a certain amount of carbon out of the atmosphere for the life of the forest, not just for the life of individual trees, which could be millennia.</p>
<p>Edit to add: this is why reducing emissions is more important than carbon capture. That forest will take tons and tons of carbon out of the atmosphere and hold it, but after a while it'll mostly just hold it and not draw more carbon in. We need to store what's in the atmosphere now and also stop putting more in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Its also not temporary. As long as the forest stands the carbon is bound up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even at the cut of point of 50 years, you can cut the tree down and use the wood in things like  construction and furniture. Bassicly trapping the CO2, and if you plant a new tree for the one that was cut down, you can start the circle anew.</p></div>		</li>
