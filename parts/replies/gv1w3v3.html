			<div class="markdown"><p>the 48hr thing is from the 2016 CDC recommendations, they have 3 studies cited that honestly I am too lazy to find and read because I am on mobile at the moment, but if you're interested <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6504a1.htm" target="_blank">here's the link</a>, citations 267, 268, 270.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/family_planning/SPR-3/en/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiKs-fKr4rwAhV3JTQIHX30AekQFjAOegQIGBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zr0S6v17BerdvFf-ZRsU8" target="_blank">WHO</a> recommendation is also &lt;48hr, see pg52</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading the section you mentioned still seems in line with the top comment and against what was linked in the OP. </p>
<p>&quot;In studies examining the combined vaginal ring, three studies found that nondeliberate extension of the hormone-free interval for 24 to &lt;48 hours from the scheduled period did not increase the risk for pregnancy (267,268,270).&quot;</p>
<p><del>The hormone free interval is specific to menstruation/ ovulation. It seems like people are misinterpreting this to mean its okay if its out for 2 days at any time during the month.</del></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the PP/Cal recommendation/interpretation stems from figure 4 where the box reads &quot;delayed insertion of a current ring for &lt;48 hours since a ring should have been inserted&quot;.</p>
<p><del>tbh now I can't decide whether the &lt;48 hours is the CDCs actual recommendation or just poor wording on the figure.</del> in any case my <del>professional</del> <em>personal</em> opinion would be follow the manufacturer guidelines regardless, I wouldn't risk accidentally making a baby.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I've spent too much time thinking about this, but <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/family_planning/SPR-3/en/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiKs-fKr4rwAhV3JTQIHX30AekQFjAOegQIGBAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zr0S6v17BerdvFf-ZRsU8" target="_blank">here are the WHO</a> recs which are in line with the CDC's and PP/Cal rec. pg 52</p>
<p>personal opinion is still go with the 3hrs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do they define hormone free interval as menstruation or ovulation? It's not like the body stops hormone production during those times, or any time. It makes more sense as an interval free of hormonal birth control being used. That's how copper iuds and barrier methods are often referred to - &quot;hormone free&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring/how-do-i-use-nuvaring" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood</a> states that Nuvaring can be outside the vagina for 48 hours. </p>
<p>I would probably say the actual Nuvaring website is more accurate, but at the same time, I don’t think Planned Parenthood would broadcast false information. So if it really can only be out for &lt;3 hours, why does Planned Parenthood say it can be out for 48?</p>
<p>EDIT: Berkeley also states the same 48 hour rule as Planned Parenthood (see main post edit for reference)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Nuvaring is out for more than 3 hours at anytime (whether or not you put it back in/use a new one), you need to use back up protection for 1 week so the ring can build up efficacy. I think they mean the ring is still good to use, but it's not fully effective the second you put it back in after &gt;3 hours out.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you leave a NuvaRing out of your vagina for <strong>more than 2 days</strong> during the weeks you’re supposed to wear it, <strong>you won’t be protected from pregnancy</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>They specifically say as long as it’s been &lt;2 days (48 hours) you’re still protected from pregnancy. <a href="https://uhs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/nuvaring.pdf" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a> also states the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planned parenthood will go by current research rather than the manufacturer recommendations. In the past Plan B was 2 pills to be spaced out by 12 hours. When it was shown that both pills could be taken at once, PP recommended that I do that, despite Plan B still instructing the separate doses at the time. Eventually Plan B followed and now has a single pill.</p></div>		</li>
