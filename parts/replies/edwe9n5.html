			<div class="markdown"><p>The metal in the core is conductive, so electrons are able to move around easily. Organized movement of charge in some direction, i.e. an electric current, produces a magnetic field via Ampere's law (one of Maxwell's equations).</p>
<p>The reason the movement of the molten metal is organized to begin with has to do with convection. That is: the temperature near the core is very high, so the metal there heats up, becomes less dense, and rises (think of a hot air balloon).  Once it rises high enough, it gets close to the mantle (the region above Earth's core but below the crust), which is cooler. Some of the heat is transferred to the mantle, which cools off the molten metal and causes it to sink.</p>
<p>This process repeats over and over, creating columns of circulating metal. This organized motion of conductive material creates an electric current, and thus a magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This step is still poorly explored. Simply moving a conductor is not enough - you move both charge types in the same amount and don't produce a field. The conductive material moves through Earth's own magnetic field, leading to charge separation, and that again leads to a current and a magnetic field - which again drives currents elsewhere. The process keeps itself alive.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://physics.aps.org/story/v19/st3" target="_blank">molten sodium sphere</a> where scientists study that process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the molten metal particles are charged. So when the metal flows, it's like a giant electric current. An electric current induces a magnetic field, which in turn induces more currents. So it's essentially a giant electromagnet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its sort of like an electro magnet.  wrap a copper wire around a piece of iron and run a current through and it creates a magnetic field.  turn off the current and the field goes away.  </p>
<p>except in the the earth there is an iron core surrounded by a bunch of liquid metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True the inner core is thought to be solid and the outer core of the planet is molten, but I was using it as a general term for ELI5 not a technical differentiation between the various layers trying to explain that the inner core is over 5000 degrees but solid and is surrounded by a liquid layer gets rather confusing for ELI5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say a very long time, do you mean the transition, or 'until it does'? If the former, will north gradually move around, or will it all get weaker to nothing then build up opposite? The latter suggests we all die of radiation is why I'm curious :-)</p></div>		</li>
