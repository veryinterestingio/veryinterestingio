			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a division of it. An energy level is divided into a number of orbitals, depending upon the the energy level itself. &quot;One orbital&quot; is the physical space around an atomic nucleus that can contain a matched pair of electrons, and that physical space is described by and dependent on 3 of four properties of the electrons it contains (the fourth, &quot;spin&quot;, describes the matching behaviors of electrons). The first property is the energy level/ atomic shell, and the next two denote the orbital properties. The periodic table of elements is actually intentionally structured to be reflective of this, with each row matching to an energy level and each block matching an orbital shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Orbitals do not need to contain two electrons. They donâ€™t even need to contain any electrons.</p>
<p>You can have virtual states that are still valid eigenstates of a quantum Hamiltonian, yet contain no electrons. In the complete limit, there are infinitely many such states.</p></div>		</li>
