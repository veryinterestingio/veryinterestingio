			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely. There‚Äôs bits which are pre-programmed to grow into butterfly bits. They‚Äôre called ‚Äúimaginal discs‚Äù. They use the soup to fuel their growth. Apparently they‚Äôre part of the caterpillar even before it‚Äôs born (the first time‚Äîfrom its egg). </p>
<p>Other insects have these too. Barring any issues with faulty DNA, the disc will (almost) <em>always</em> turn into the body part it‚Äôs meant to be. You can, apparently, steal a disc from one larva, and culture it in the body of...y‚Äôknow what? I‚Äôm just gonna send you <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginal_disc" target="_blank">the Wikipedia article.</a> I‚Äôve read it before, but I doubt I can explain it better than people who know what they‚Äôre talking about. Give it a read, it‚Äôs neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. That's amazing. So the slimy goo somehow maintains the neuron connections for their brain, at least enough to retain some crude memories of learned behaviors. Wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. They don‚Äôt become 100% goo. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginal_disc" target="_blank">These</a> survive, and some of the nervous system survives as well. Or, according to one source, it gets broken down, but slowly, while new, adult nerves are being wired up; it‚Äôs sort of a Ship of Theseus scenario, assuming that‚Äôs what really happens. I guess the adult neurons copy over important information from the juvenile neurons? I dunno. It‚Äôs complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did too! It was on only a month or two ago, but when I search for it, the stories I'm finding are 7-10 years old. Odd, I wonder if it was just a replayed segment.</p>
