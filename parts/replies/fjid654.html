			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p>Your city only has so many cops (white blood cells). Really bad guys like HIV quietly kill the cops en masse until the other criminals (viruses, bacteria, fungi) can have free reign to loot and burn the city (your body). </p>
<p>Coronavirus, like other viruses and bacteria, can cause so much havoc that all the cops in the city are busy. The try tear gas (histamine, interleukins, etc.) to get em but that damages surrounding buildings (cells, tissues)! Now it’s easier for crooks to loot other parts of the city. Your city only has so much money (energy) to train cops in time.</p>
<p>Once your immune system can create the appropriate antibodies and kill infected cells, things get back to normal pretty fast. The main issue is if you’re unhealthy and your immune system can’t contain the spread or the other new infections as a result of strain. Still a LOT we don’t know about immunology.</p></div>		</li>
