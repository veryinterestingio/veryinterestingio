			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could help me with a perennial question my brain won't let go... when you talk about &quot;early days&quot;, &quot;evidence&quot; etc, can you give a little info on how atoms were studied back then? How were those scientists able to determine electron shell values? What sort of evidence points to that? I've asked a similar question in this sub before but am always looking to fill in the cracks of my knowledge. Appreciate any insight you can provide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question with a looong answer. Buckle up.</p>
<p>In the 1800's, people were really into gas phase chemistry because volumes and pressures were easy to measure. Dalton (a meteorologist) described the law of definite proportions: for example, to make water, you always need twice as much hydrogen gas as oxygen gas. Thus, water must be a combination of 2 H and 1 O instead of its own thing. This was supported by experiments that split water using electricity into (hey!) hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 ratio.</p>
<p>That law of definite proportions set up Mendeleev who based his table on the ratios of the different elements mixing with oxygen (look up his first table and check out the top row. It's classified like this: R2O, RO, R2O3...). That's the first hint of repeating trends in the table. Mendeleev used this to make some predictions about gaps in the table and a few years lated elements were isolated that fit right into the gaps, providing evidence that this is a good model.</p>
<p>Next up we turn to physics, where spectroscopy was getting underway. Basically, you can heat up a gas of a pure element and it will make a colour (e.g. neon lights). If you use a prism to spread out this light you get sharp lines instead of a rainbow, and the lines are specific to their elements. This was powerful because it can be used to determine what element you're looking at! You can also shine white light through a cold gas to get dark lines on a rainbow, and those were in the same place as the bright lines for those elements. Hence, elements can absorb or emit light but only at certain characteristic wavelengths. Fun fact, when they did this to the sun they saw lines corresponding to an element that hadn't been discovered on Earth yet. They called it helium (sun element).</p>
<p>Next up, someone invented the vacuum pump so someone else decided to run electricity through no gas at all to see what would happen. They got a weird beam of radiation that was categorized by Thompson as a stream of negatively charged particles (because it reacted to electric fields whereas light does not). The electron is discovered.</p>
<p>Okay, now we've got the basis for Max Planck. He's often called the father of quantum physics. He was working on making an equation to match the observed spectrum of hot objects. It looks like a lopsided bell curve and other physicists had been trying to use what they knew about physics and the electron and light to derive the formula for the curve. Planck went the other way: he used the curve, decided it looked like a probability distribution, and then threw statistical mechanics at it until he got the right equation. The math forced him to assume that light could only be created at specific energy levels based on frequency, and created a side equation that directly linked the frequency of light to the energy transition that created it. This side equation is the most important development for atomic theory.</p>
<p>Rutherford devised the gold foil experiment where he shot alpha particles (very small and positively charged) at a thin gold foil. Most of them went right through, some got deflected, but some bounced straight back. This was weird because Rutherford figured they would all just slow down through the foil, but instead he got ricochet action. It's like shooting a machine gun at a piece of paper and one in a million of the bullets bounce straight back at you. Rutherford had to conclude that the atom was mostly empty space but that there was a strong concentration of positive charge in the middle of it. That's the model of the atom that most people are familiar with.</p>
<p>Bohr was Rutherford's student and was trying to deal with an issue with Rutherford's model. If electrons orbit the nucleus, they would have to be constantly accelerating, but accelerating charges requires energy and so the electrons should just fall into the center. Bohr used spectral lines to describe a new model of the atom, where electrons are locked into specific energy levels, but they can jump around when excited and then jump back down. The jumps are always between the same energy levels so that's why we see the same lines for each element.</p>
<p>So that sets up spectroscopy and atomic theory. The subshells and orbitals were found by very carefully looking at the wavelengths of light given off by excited atoms and using Planck's equation to get an idea of the energies involved. These levels also perfectly matched the math being done by quantum physicists, so there's a good chance that the atom really does act like this.</p>
<p>Bonus content: check out the Balmer series of hydrogen and the Rydberg formula. They happened before Planck but they provided the mathematical basis for Bohr's model of the atom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't help but be a bit envious of these guys who still got to do random experiments with equipment you can keep into a lab and buy with pocket change and find out deep truths about the universe XD. Now we've run out of low hanging fruit, we keep smashing atoms into giant-ass multi-billion-dollars colliders and we keep getting the freakin' Standard Model out of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still so hard for me to fathom that they were able to derive all that from such macroscopic experiments. I mean, lights, gases, prisms, and gold foil. Throw in deriving equations from that and I still can't wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>How does one even go about building an alpha particle gun??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So.... wow. Thank you for this fantastic and in depth answer. I'm glad you didn't assume more than cursory knowledge of the subject- which I think I have but have realized over the years that my knowledge is not only wildly incomplete, but also that there are a lot of things even in works for the laymen that authors take for granted. I have a lot of material to check out, and thanks again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up the experiments of Dalton, Thompson, Rutherford, and Bohr and how they advanced the models of the atom. Understanding the way their experiments advanced our understanding of the atom is a great way to form a deep base understanding that will help you tackle more advanced models described above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you want a super early one, definitely check out the gold foil (gieger marsden) experiment.  This experiment  is done to prove that atoms have a charge at all.  This is done by shooting alpha particles into a sheet of gold foil, most of the particles go straight through, but some collide with the atoms of the gold and bounce off.  This proves that atoms have a nucleus where most of the mass is, and that the nucleus is positive (because similar charges repel).  Later, electron levels were discovered and soon diagrams were made such as the Bohr diagram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so then why is the first shell 2, the second shell 8, the third shell 8, etc etc?</p>
<p>Why isn't the first shell, say, 3 or 4?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a full p subshell can hold 6 electrons, and a full s subshell (the only one available to the first shell) can only hold 2 electrons. The higher subshells don't get used until they need less energy than a new orbital would need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways to answer that: the mathematical one (quantum mechanics), and the ontological (?) one (why this way and not some other way?) The mathematical answer lies in the wave equation, which will tell you that there is one way to arrange a sphere (the first subshell, which holds 2 electrons) in 3D space, but three ways to arrange a figure 8 shape (up/down, left/right, and forward/back). This makes a nice arrangement where the subshells don't overlap too much. Unfortunately, then you get into &quot;well why figure 8's?&quot; and so on.</p>
<p>Enter the second answer: it is this way because that's how we model the world. Atoms consistently behave as if the pattern is 2, 6, 10, 14... so that is the current truth. I'm afraid that this is one of those basic science questions that has no satisfying answer, kind of like &quot;why does energy bend spacetime?&quot;, where the answer is just &quot;it does.&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that’s he capacity that it holds, think of electron shells as boxes, and each box can only hold 2 electrons, one up and one down.  The fist shell is called s. The first level is called 1, therefore the very first classification of electrons are 1s.  Hydrogen has one electron, therefore is it 1s (1). Helium has 2 electrons, therefore the first electron level is filled making it 1s (2).  Level one can only hold an s, while level 2 can hold an s and a p. P shells have 3 boxes, therefore can hold 6 electrons (again 2 per box).  With this logic, beryllium  is 1s (2), 2s (2).  Because it has 4 electrons.  Oxygen therefore is 1s (2) 2s(2) 2p (4).  There are more classifications but this is the absolute basic of it. </p>
<p>TL;DR it is what is is because that’s just how it b</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I get that but that doesn't answer the question why is that the exact capacity? Why isn't the capacity 3 or 4 or any other arbitrary number?</p>
<p>I get that 2 is the max capacity. Why is 2 the exact capacity, what's magic about that amount?</p></div>		</li>
