			<div class="markdown"><p>Telescope mirrors used to be silvered. But nowadays silvered mirrors tarnish more quickly.</p>
<p>The process preferred today uses aluminum, with a very thin clear coat (silicon oxide) on top for extra protection. Those mirrors last quite a bit longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only front silvered mirrors are subject to that.</p>
<p>Mirrors silvered on the back can have a further polymer layer applied to the back to prevent corrosion.</p>
<p>Aluminium is just sooo much cheaper for mirrors than silver (or the actual metals used in the Renaissance).</p>
<p>So unless the miniscule blue tinge of Al mirrors is relevant, no need to use silver.</p>
<p>Silver is just muuuch easier to work with, can just dump a bottle of silver nitrate on a glass plane.</p></div>		</li>
