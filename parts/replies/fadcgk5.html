			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of those things that <em>really depends</em> on what you're interested in finding out. because it's such a wide-ranging topic.</p>
<p>It's been a side-interest of mine since I was a child and I've picked up a lot from many different sources. Library books to Sim City video games to maps and atlases and many others.</p>
<p>Are you interested in the <em>history</em> of the development of towns? Asian or European? American West? Colonial?</p>
<p>Or the structure and layout of modern towns?</p>
<p>The social and community aspects of towns?</p>
<p>The non-fiction section in your library is a great place to start. Just walk the isle and start pulling out books. I like reading about the histories of specific towns and cities.</p></div>		</li>
