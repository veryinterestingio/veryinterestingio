			<div class="markdown"><p>OK kind of a different response to this topic but I smoked cigarettes for 16 years and just kind of quit one day about 6 months ago. I felt the metal/blood like taste in my mouth for about a month after. Was that just my gums healing? That's what I always assumed it was at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In an otherwise healthy person with no other symptoms, there is no significant medical concern. Rest and decreased training intensity while developing cardiovascular fitness will decrease the likelihood of this happening again. However, if symptoms persist (or youâ€™ve ever coughed up blood or had other respiratory or cardiac concerns), consult your doctor to rule out other more serious causes.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
