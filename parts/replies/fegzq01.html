			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the charge of the Federal Reserve, a publicly monitored but privately operated consortium of financial leaders that are supposed to nudge the US economy through changing the number of dollar bills in circulation.  </p>
<p>Inflation represents a change in the value of a single unit of currency.  The value of a single unit of currency is a reflection of a simple ratio between the number of dollars in circulation and the number of goods being produced.  Imagine an island with coconuts as the only product.  </p>
<p>You have 10 dollar bills and 10 coconuts.  Each dollar can buy one coconut and each coconut is worth one dollar.  </p>
<p>10 more dollars get printed, so now we have 20 dollar bills and 10 coconuts.  Each dollar can buy half a coconut and each coconut is worth two dollars. </p>
<p>A new coconut stick gets invented allowing us to harvest more coconuts from the tallest trees.  Now there's 30 more coconuts in circulation.  We have 20 dollar bills and 40 coconuts.  Each dollar buys two coconuts and each coconut is worth fifty cents.</p>
<p>Going from situation 1 to situation 2, we have inflation.  Dollars become worth less because they can buy less.  Going from situation 2 to situation 3, we have deflation as dollars can buy more.</p>
<p>The job of the Fed is to try to estimate how many more coconuts we're going to have next year and try to change the number of dollar bills in circulation to make sure the worth of a dollar only goes down by 2%, but hopefully doesn't go up at all.  Whenever you hear the Fed is raising or lowering interest rates, they're either pushing more dollars out into the market to make some inflation or taking dollars out of the market to remove some inflation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Economy being fundamentally unstable isn't the half of it. It's ready for people to think of it as numbers on a paper, nice, clean, static. It's like a nice, simple river or sea, with early defined and observed currents.</p>
<p>In reality, it's more like a Jacuzzi: a bunch of chaotic and messy streams and influences create a bubbling mess that's always threatening to spill out everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deflation of prices for most common necessities should be reasonable as supplies and productivity increase, reducing the costs.  This would be beneficial for consumers since their main expenses would decrease, leaving them with more money to invest or improve their standard of living.  Inflation of prices for non-necessities like luxuries, defense supplies, and new things that need investment should also be reasonable, keeping the economy going and making progress on increasing the standard of living.</p>
<p>In practice, it doesn't work out that ideally.  Different items do have different price trends, but it tends to be luxuries and less-necessary items like consumer electronics that are deflating, while the basic necessities such as housing, food, health care, and education are increasing at well above the average inflation rate.  This is a bad long-term trend because it increases the necessary expenses of consumers disproportionately to their income, putting them in an ever more precarious position and decreasing the money that they have to invest or spend on non-necessities.</p>
<p>In either case, the overall balance could be 2% inflation, but the results are very different depending on where it happens and who benefits from it.  It's easy to overlook that in the short term when you're happy about your new cellphone or big screen TV, but it is catching up with us.</p></div>		</li>
