			<div class="markdown"><p>People test positive for TB because the test they do (in the US at least) is an antibody test.</p>
<p>Most people in this country haven't had the TB vaccine, so people in certain industries get an antibody test every year. If it's positive, there's a chance they have an active infection.</p>
<p>If someone has already recovered or received a vaccination, they'll test positive.</p>
<p>No idea why we don't vaccinate everyone for TB in this country. Expense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have learned in my pathogenic microbiology course this semester, the TB vaccine is attenuated, meaning that it has a small amount of live TB particles in it to trigger your body into mounting an immune response against the TB. The reason we don't give the vaccine here in the US is because there is such a low risk of becoming infected with TB that the risk of side effects from the vaccine actually outweighs the benefit of getting it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the most common test in the US is the Mantoux test (also known as a TB skin test). It realizes on a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in the skin when exposed to tuberculin (which is a bunch of purified proteins from TB). This is why it is positive for both people exposed and those vaccinated. In fact the blood test for TB is also not an antibody test, but rather what’s called an interferon gamma release assay. They actually mix whole blood with antigen and see if the white blood cells react. </p>
<p>Further the reason we don’t do TB vaccination in the US is primarily due to looking at risk/benefit. The rates of TB in the US are low enough to need widespread vaccination as testing of high risk individuals is just effective. The BCG vaccine is a live attenuated form of a related bacteria that is injected subdermally (as opposed to intramuscular like most vaccines, which is why it makes the scar). As such it has a higher risk profile with immunocompromised individuals. In addition it is not as effective as a true antibody vaccination. Only really benefits children and then will prevent about 2/10 cases and of the 8 it doesn’t prevent 4 will never have active disease so effectively preventing 6/10 active cases. That said there is actually an argument that if we did vaccinate in the US we could quickly eradicate it as a disease because isn’t very prevalent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a combination of reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li>TB is actually very rare in the US. Less than 10k infections a year. </li>
<li>The TB vaccine is <em>relatively</em> dangerous. It's not really that dangerous but it has higher rates of complications than most (all?) of the other vaccinations we get during childhood.</li>
<li>The types of people TB infects. The majority of that 10k are foreigners or immigrants. The rest tend to be members of vulnerable populations like the homeless and prisoners.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have heard that if you do the math it's a mistake not to vaccinate: the lives we'd save by eradicating it faster would outweigh the people who had serious complications from the vaccine. I have also heard people claim that racism/classism factor in to the equation. I don't know if either of those things are true or not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we have only seen a tiny tiny handful test positive twice.  the circumstances behind that could be for various reasons other than true reinfection.  perhaps they didnt have it the first time, perhaps they never recovered, perhaps they dont have it the 2nd time.  Tests arent perfect, and with everything going on right now, we arent exactly getting super reliable research.  Then theres unique factors, perhaps they have an autoimmune issue.  </p>
<p>At this point, there is no evidence that you dont get immunity, for at least a decent length of time spanning 1+ year.</p>
<p>Also, good chance that reinfection will be less severe.  The first time is always the worst, typically you retain partial immunity and become reinfected, renewing your immunity with a weaker illness experience. </p>
<p>At least, thats how things have been for other virus.</p>
<p>In any case, we expect to have a vaccine by the time this should come back around for a 2nd round.  Not all of the vaccines will pan out, but I havent read any scientific basis for thinking none will, or that a vaccine will not be possible.</p>
<p>if an illness could have a recurring, indefinite plaque on mankind, we'd likely be dead long long ago.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Depends what you mean by second round, but yes we do expect to have a vaccine in the relatively near future that should hopefully be the fix.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. For that to happen, a virus would have to be easy to spread, have a high morbidity rate, and also mutate quickly. Given that the dead are far less likely to spread the virus than the living, a quickly mutating virus is likely to trend over time towards not killing, as the strains that don't kill will proliferate further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, most (if not all) of the people that have had a second positive test that was unexpected were a reawakening of the virus that they already had, not a reinfection after recovery.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This virus just hasn’t been around that long yet. We just don’t know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the tests we have are anti body tests that will test positive once you had it and tests that test for the presence of certain molecules belonging to the virus. The later kind can't distinguish between life viruses and their non infectious remains that your body takes a while to get rid off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could disappear if we would just stop messing around.</p>
<p>Vaccination should be mandatory for anyone without a valid medical excuse. Mandatory and directly enforced by injecting people over their objections if necessary.</p>
<p>Everyone should get one for free. Countries that can't afford to do this should get subsidies so that they can. Countries that refuse to cooperate including the part about making this completely mandatory with direct enforcement should face trade sanctions.</p>
<p>If necessary we should vaccinate wildlife as well, with bait or through capture, vaccinate and release.</p>
<p>That way we could eradicate covid and a number of other infections.</p></div>		</li>
