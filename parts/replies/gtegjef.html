			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert but it's mainly because they don't breath under water. Same as human diving 100m without oxygen tank. When using tanks, the pressure must be taken care of while adjusting the intake (oxygen VS nitrogen). You cannot go too fast so your body adjust it or you'll get the bends and probably die. </p>
<p>Ps. I'm sure someone more knowledgeable can give a better answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bends is a time and pressure issues. First whales can get the bends. And so can free divers. Professional free divers are at risk. Your average person no. </p>
<p>And when diving with tanks for example. If I go straight down to 120 ft for example I can come back up without having to decompress.</p></div>		</li>
