			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned about this too! My sister has aphantasia while I might have hyperphantasia. I can't wait for this to be explored more. I find it so fascinating. I can't wait to see the correlations with how it affects people's interests and hobbies. For example, how do you do mental math? If I ask you 2 x 2, everyone knows it's 4 off the bat. If I ask you 28 x 56, what do you do to get the answer? It would take a minute for me, but the whole time I'm picturing numbers in my head to keep track of the calculation. If you give me a date, I put it in my mental calendar. When I think about the appointments I have in the upcoming week, I have to retrieve the calendar in my mind to recall what's coming up. The canvas in my head is like a panoramic abyss, and my weekly mental calendar always shows up on the right side of the &quot;abyss&quot;.. If I don't picture anything, I can say &quot;I have a meeting with John&quot;, but there's no way I'd be able to tell you the date, time, or place without picturing it in my mind.</p>
<p>I just don't see how anyone can do anything without imagining it in their head!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I consider myself pretty good at mental math, and I have to keep track of the numbers through normal thought. So for 28x56, I'd go &quot;Okay, 20x50 is 1000, then I have to add 20x6, so we're up to 1120, now 8x50 so we're up to 1520, and finally 8x6 so we get 1568.&quot; If I get sidetracked I have to start over, because my thoughts are what store the info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah! I am terrible at math and I wouldn't trust me with dates! I once showed up the airport a day early cuz I &quot;felt&quot; it was Friday rather than picturing the day of the week I was on. I work with connecting concepts, feelings and ideas. If I think of a table I &quot;feel&quot; all the possibilities of what a table is, if I have to give you details they'll come out of memory like &quot;I remember feeling the cold glass to the touch&quot; instead of rewinding the memory tape and see that it was glass a-la Sherlock Holmes.
Here's a question for you to think about: can you imagine other sensations? Sound, taste, hearing? It also varies person to person</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kind of sounds like the things that I just can't imagine doing without picturing it really just isn't possible for people with aphantasia? So then I wonder what people with Aphantasia can do that people with Hyperphantasia can't!</p>
<p>Sounds are even more imaginable for me. If I have to wait and awkward 3 minutes for something, I'll play a song in my head. I was on the track team and would do this for repetition workouts (something like running 6 400s in 75seconds with 5min rest in between). I'd &quot;listen&quot; to a song and try to push through the rep 'til the end of the song. That also helped me focus on something other than how tired and achy I was. I have a whole playlist of songs in my head that I use to gauge small durations of time.</p>
<p>I can imagine tastes, but not in a fun way like the others ðŸ˜…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, I did a test like this where they ask you to imagine a red star, and compare what image came into your mind with a series of pictures to find where you lie on the scale. I had the image in my mind, ready to compare, and scrolled down. Turns out, they were looking for a 5-point 2D star coloured red, whereas I had imagined an actual star from outer space, as in, a red giant.</p>
<p>Never did figure out where that lay on the scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you mentioned imagining a star I also immediately imagined a real star with solar flares.</p>
<p>Imagining a 5 point 2D star takes me a second to visualize because I have to consciously think about it having 5 points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait what do you mean exactly by &quot;close their eyes and see&quot;? Are you saying some people can almost physically see what they imagine? I mean I can imagine and visualize pretty well(right now I see myself in  crystal tower) but I don't actually see anything. I just see darkness. Are you saying some people can actually have a clear show of their imagination??</p></div>		</li>

<p>you don't have aphantasia. aphantasia is a condition that reddit seriously blows off proportion (not talking about the OP, just in general). people without it don't <em>literally</em> go around hallucinating all the time. they can just see/hear things <em>inside</em> their heads.</p>
<p>if I ask you to describe a loved one, do you picture them in your head, or do you just repeat stuff you know about them? like, &quot;they're tall and have black hair&quot;. if I tell you to think of a particular song, can you hear it (again, inside your head. it's not an auditory hallucination), or do you just remember the lyrics? if answered that you can see or hear it, then you don't have aphantasia.</p>
<p>e: I'm just going to leave this edit here, because I'm way to lazy to answer everyone in this currently 400+ comments thread. you <em>probably</em> don't have aphantasia. stop buying the idea the people can &quot;hallucinate&quot; shit whenever they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting.  I can hear a song internally when I imagine it but for me at least it isn't anywhere near as clear as the real thing.  It's quite vague if anything and the same goes for me imagining a loved ones face for example or their voice.  My dreams are far from vivid also.  I'd like to see an improvement to all this but is that even possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's no way for me to compare my own experiences with other people but, i always imagined this is how it is. either people really blow out of proportion the ability to 'see' or 'hear' things in their mind, or i am the one with aphantasia. if someone was able to just actually *hear* stuff at will people wouldn't be listening to music with their phones. I think the closest way to properly describe it is maybe as a 'muted voice', if that makes sense. there's no real sound i perceive, but i can *imagine* it. descriptions like &quot;I can see a book playing out like a movie&quot; give people entirely wrong ideas. I might be wrong, but I don't think the average person can hallucinate full color, vivid images at will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh okay, yeah based on how people talked I thought that people were avle to actually see things as if they were there, and I had aphantasia.</p>
<p>But nope I have great visualization. Right now I can see myself in a cave surrounded by slimes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right! For some, when reading a book they can see like a movie in their head. For me I can imagine feelings and ideas but no images per se. I do see images when I dream or under some altered states my imagination &quot;level&quot; can go up a couple points</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever tried closing your eyes and listening to an Audiobook? I wonder if not having to physically read a book would let your brain cook up more of movie-like experience. My wife is listening to the &quot;Movie in your mind&quot; version of the Mistborne series by Brandon Sanderson and loves it because they add a variety of unobtrusive sounds that really enhance the experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is how reading used to be for me. I'm currently getting back into it, so my mind feels kind of stale compared to before. I now realize I was indulgent when it came to experiencing what I was reading and would &quot;correct&quot; things as I read, which made me a slower reader. For example, if I had a picture in my head based on what was written and the author continued the description and it contradicted what was in my head, I'd basically edit the mental image until it matched the description.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't normally remember my dreams at all (I assume that's due to environmental factors), but when I do - I've kept dream journals before to make it consistent - they're, as far as I know, basically normal? </p>
<p>As soon as I wake up, though, all the visual information is compressed back into knowledge, which then sieves through into nothing. I can sometimes visualize immediately before/after sleep, while conscious, though I'm not sure if it's necessarily the exact same thing as waking hours visualization, which I can't do at all.</p></div>		</li>
