			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup for sure specific delivery is the issue and nanoparticles have a way to go here. But I just want to clear up that AAVs rarely insert into the genome of mammalian cells. They actually predominantly form very long lasting (years to decades) episomes in the nucleus separate from the cell’s DNA. That’s why they’re considered safe vectors for gene therapies in clinical trials. To insert DNA to any useful degree you’d need an integrating virus like a lentivirus or a system to incorporate the AAV cargo like Cas9 or other programmable nucleases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is only one way that people are working on getting mrna sequences into cells. There are others which don't use viruses. Electroporation and ultrasonic membrane disruption are two other ways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is actually very possible, and very much a part of recent medical research. There are PEG coated iron nanoparticles that can target specific damaged heart cells, and deliver a payload (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33159193/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33159193/</a>). They achieve this because the pH of infarcted cardiac tissue is lower compared with the pH of healthy cardiac tissue; iron-based nanoparticles were designed that can release their payload only under this low pH, and can be targeted to the heart using a combination of cardiac tissue markers (antibodies) and a magnet (to make sure that the particles stay at the heart when they reach it, and don't get flushed out of the body as fast).</p>
<p>It's not impossible (or indeed almost impossible) to do, its just at the forefront of research and only recently has great progress been made. It's very difficult, but definitely possible.</p>
<p>Obviously the idea of using mRNA is completely wrong, but there are plenty of payloads that can be considered, including the one described in the paper that I cited (anti-exosome antibodies, to increase the concentration of exosomes at the damaged heart tissue, which have been shown to be associated with better recovery).</p></div>		</li>
