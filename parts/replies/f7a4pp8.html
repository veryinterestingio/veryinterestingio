			<div class="markdown"><p>My old laptop stopped being able to tell how much battery it had so it was always reading it as 0% even when it was plugged in. Whenever I turned it on, it would hibernate within 15 seconds so I had to go into the settings and disable that function just so I could use the laptop at all.</p></div>		</li>
