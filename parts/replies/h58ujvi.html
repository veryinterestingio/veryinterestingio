			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hear that. Best of luck to you! Could you trace the skin cancer to any specific events in your past (such as a couple of really severe sunburns), or did it just show up with no apparent reason? I have low vitamin D, but I'm also kind of scared of exposing myself to sunlight too much and end up getting skin cancer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, no genetic markers, no specific risk factors/behaviours, just straight up bad luck.</p>
<p>Chances are you won’t get skin cancer (it’s not super common, and it’s visible and can be caught early, unlike many other cancers), but supplementing with Vitamin D is 100% recommended (by my dermatologist at least) is a good idea.</p></div>		</li>
