			<div class="markdown"><p>Just making sure I'm understanding Bao et al., because there are a <em>lot</em> of maps. Is <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/DLii2NZ" target="_blank">this one</a> showing rayleigh wave attenuation at a 40 sec interval a good one to evaluate how far earthquakes will reach as a whole? If so, does it show that earthquakes of the same mag will generally reach father on the east coast (except for the Chesapeake area for some reason), and less far on the west coast, especially in eastern WA? Or do I have it backwards?</p>
<p>If you know anything about why Washington and the Chesapeake are anomalous, I'm also interested in that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. You'll notice that the patterns (but not the magnitudes) of attenuation are similar for all of the periods they explore with generally lower attenuation on the east coast and higher attenuation on the west coast. Importantly though, what Bao et al are working on are attenuation patterns in the upper mantle, which is not as relevant for the attenuation of seismic waves in areas near an earthquake in the upper crust (though would be relevant for &quot;teleseismic events&quot;, but these don't produce shaking that we can experience typically, i.e., you need a seismometer to be aware of them). I linked to Bao et al, 2016 as a very general example of spatial variation in seismic attenuation, not necessarily a good reference in terms of relevance to the original question.</p>
<p>The patterns they observe in the upper mantle do generally correlate with similar behavior at the surface, i.e., wider felt earthquakes in the east vs west coast (e.g. <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/east-vs-west-coast-earthquakes" target="_blank">this page from the USGS</a>), which in part is related to the differences to the attenuation of seismic waves, but in the middle- to upper crust. As discussed on the USGS page, this behavior in the upper crust is largely a function of rock properties with rocks on the east coast being less deformed (or at least, less deformed recently) vs the west coast. Recent, brittle deformation (i.e., fracturing, faulting) imparts a lot of discontinuities which slow down seismic waves leading to faster / more efficient attenuation. So, a map of seismic attenuation of the upper crust, would be reasonably similar, at least in the very broad patterns.</p>
<p>The correspondence between the upper mantle and crust is likely not accidental. As Bao et al discuss in the introduction, lots of things (e.g. elevated temperatures, more water, etc) can increase attenuation. Many of these features in the upper mantle are likely linked to the long-term deformation history of these regions, i.e. the upper crust of the west is more deformed from protracted series of events which have also influenced the upper mantle properties. As for the Chesapeake bay and eastern Washington features, I'm not 100% sure what would be going on in the upper mantle in those locations to give you that extra attenuation, but they don't show up as well in the other periods that they look at (or at least the Chesapeake one doesn't).</p></div>		</li>
