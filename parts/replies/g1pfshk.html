			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not uncommon, especially with fathers. This seems to be changing as a father openly showing affection becoming the norm. The world is fucked up now and has always been fucked. There are still fathers out there that think telling your child, &quot;I love you&quot; is only for &quot;sissies&quot;.</p>
<p>As somebody else said, learn from your father's mistakes to become a better father yourself.</p>
<p>Edit: Or mother!</p>
<p>Edit2: I should have said parent rather than mother or father.</p>
<p>Edit3: Woke up randomly and thought about aunts, uncles, step parents, siblings, or any relative. Showing physical affection, and sometimes verbal, can come off as creepy because we all got our minds in the gutter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a friend that likes hugs? One of my best friends always hugs me when we meet up to hang out. We didn’t see each other for almost two months because of the pandemic, and the first time we met up after that, you bet we hugged the shit out of each other.</p>
<p>We still have to be careful about how many other people we touch or spend time around, but goddamn, it’s nice to be able to do that again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. If anyone is interested you should look up Harry Harlow’s studies on monkeys. They prevented baby monkeys from having cuddles and it had disastrous results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did a similar experiment with baby humans. Same disastrous results. </p>
<p>Gave the control group normal amounts of holding and cuddling and the experimental group no holding or cuddling. Both groups got other needs met, such as being cleaned and fed. They had to stop the experiment partway through because too many babies from the experimental group were dying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just behavior issues - all sorts of neurocognitive maturation is suspected to be influenced by early development touch. I remember 20yrs ago reading about rat studies shoeing this, and just two days ago i skimmed a Korean article about human fetal stimulation (petting the preggy belly) and temperament. Pretty much any mammal i can think of; I don't know so much about nonmammilians...</p></div>		</li>
