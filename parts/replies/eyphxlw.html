			<div class="markdown"><p>C++ remained unpopular for console game development until around the year 2000 (long after the NES - C++ for consoles really came into swing for the PlayStation 2). I know this since I was working at a major studio. However,  C had been used for a long while, with occasional machine code for performance critical routines or for some direct hardware access (at which point it's low level and non-portable enough that C isn't necessarily helping much). Even if C++ didn't have to be slower than C in theory, the additional functionality provided above C was sort of a bad combination of more resource intensive and easy to use. For some years, it was important that things that will use more memory or run more slowly are painful to do.. and some of the compilers themselves ran too slowly, used too much memory, and wrote too much to disk -- slowing development and pushing out project deadlines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds plausible. I'm not sure, since I didn't join until around 2000 - and saw all the new projects switching to C++, and the seasoned developers coming to grips with it. They already knew that it was necessary to avoid templates like the plague for the time being, since the GNU C++ compilers would otherwise end up generating GB's of crap during compilation and development would grind to a halt while compilation times grow to a couple hours (and I got to see one project in the building ignore the warning and end up with more or less this problem, and a rare missed deadline).. so someone must have tried it before and created those cautionary tales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most teams kept a few strict rules to avoid problems (i.e. slow runtime, too much memory use, slow compile times, and too much inscrutable complexity). No templates in our own code, ever.. and where standard libraries are used, the studio developed its own implementation which compiled faster with memory management better-suited to console development (and probably embedded/systems programming in general). It was basically C with classes.. and we made some use of virtual functions / polymorphism just because heavy use of pointers to functions (which would be the equivalent in C) made some people queasy. With modern C++ features, I see a lot of pushback in gamedev circles complaining about how for many of those features, the compile times are much slower - making those features worthless (far worse to use them in a project, on balance). It might tear the C++ community apart.</p></div>		</li>
