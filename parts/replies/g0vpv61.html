			<div class="markdown"><p>For context, fallout can travel hundreds of km and may be deposited hours-to-days after detonation.</p>
<p>Exposure was far from localized </p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/US_fallout_exposure.png" target="_blank">Per capita thyroid doses in the continental United States</a></p>
<p>It was also as much a problem to those who consumed contaminated produce as it was to those directly exposed</p>
<p>It is even spread across the entire globe through the stratosphere. The bio-sphere itself, every single organic being in the world, has a radioactive signature from nuclear testing. Traditional radiocarbon dating does not work for anything that was living after 1945.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure exactly. But there was a lot of desert, so it would be like sitting in your backyard and watching the cloud, and it seems far enough away, but actually, to be far enough away, you‚Äôre supposed to be able to hold your thumb out and if the mushroom cloud fits behind your thumb, then you‚Äôre ok, and the mushroom definitely did not fit behind their thumbs.</p></div>		</li>

(It's also why he has 1 eye closed.)</p>
<p>Edit: Well, this blew up! ^Sorry, ^I ^couldn't ^resist.
Also, thank you for the gold (and silver) kind strangers. </p>
<p>Reading the replies a few users have commented saying this is false, and it prompted me to do some digging. Apparently this &quot;fact&quot; is, unfortunately, likely a <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-vault-boy-thumb/" target="_blank">coincidence</a> that started here on reddit. Brian Fargo has <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BrianFargo/status/400277541295886337" target="_blank">commented</a> on it but, to my knowledge, neither Tramell Ray Isaac or Brian Menze, the artists, have weighed in.</p></div>		</li>
