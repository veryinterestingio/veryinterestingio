			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once told by a doctor that there is a &quot;threshold&quot; of melatonin, i.e. if you have more than enough melatonin, it &quot;saturates&quot; (quoted words are my own) and does not make any difference. Therefore, one does not need to worry about taking too much melatonin. Can someone please clarify?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats true as far as acute effects go, but something to watch out for is that if you're still over that threshold by wake-up time, you'll feel horribly tired in the morning and mess up your circadian rhythm. That threshold is as low as 1/3 of a mg. These 10mg melatonin pills, especially the time-release ones, really mess with people's mornings and hormonal rhythms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll attest to that. I (pre-COVID) travelled quite a bit, often between time zones. That made it exceedingly difficult to get a good night's sleep, even at home. I figured I'd start with 10mg and see what happened and I was a zombie for the first two hours every day. Switched to 5mg and started feeling much better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you Ide heard a bit about the smaller dose ones being better and felt like they have worked much better for me anecdotally and this is the most clear explanation I’ve seen, that it’s just lasting way too damn long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just speaking from personal experience, melatonin at too high doses gave me brain fog and headaches. Apparently this can happen to other people too. I didn't know for a long time that it was a side effect for me because I was taking it during a time when I was getting frequent migraines due to poor sleep hygiene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin gave me freaky ass nightmares. Absolutely fucking horrifying, vivid, you-think-you're-awake-but-fucked-up-shit-starts-happening, wendigos crawling out of the ceiling of your bedroom, etc. I didn't know what was going on until I made the mental connection between the melatonin and the onset of the nightmares, so I googled it. I had only been taking the recommended dosage, but that was enough to mess me up, apparently. Stopped the melatonin, and the nightmares stopped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, however the threshold is created by our Pineal Glands and barring any tumor or tissue damage (TBI), everyone creates enough melatonin and it is triggered, produced and released naturally at sufficient levels for everyone - it is not the cause of inability to sleep. </p>
<p>Melatonin can, however, be helpful for those who have jet lag, or those who work night shifts and don’t have environmental cues causing it to be released. But for the vast majority of us, <strong>effects of over the counter melatonin is placebo</strong> and this is backed by the research. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, I can confirm somewhat.  I have been using melatonin regularly for 20 years, the last 7 being an overnight shift worker.</p>
<p>I am confident in stating that anything above 3mg is doing absolutely nothing extra, and half that dose or less is more than enough to produce the effect.</p>
<p>I also agree that it's not at all a &quot;knockout&quot; drug and probably won't do much for real insomnia, but is really helpful for irregular sleeping patterns.</p>
<p>Combine that stuff with some benadryl though and it should work for milder insomnia.  (Benadryl turns down &quot;awakeness&quot; and melatonin turns up &quot;sleepiness&quot; in a way). Hardcore insomnia will need the big guns in the form of a script.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By &quot;it&quot; do you mean the linked study, or your assertion that melatonin has insignificant effects?  I'm not sure you really supported the latter.  You linked a study with n=10, and would need quite the difference in treatment groups to show significance.  There seem to be a wide array of outcomes from the several studies I quickly googled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin studies haven't found a consistent effect but there may be confounders that are unaccounted for. Speaking from personal experience, melatonin cured my insomnia permanently after lots of other &quot;proven&quot; medications basically did nothing at all. I suspect that some people's bodies don't take it up into the brain so supplementation doesn't work for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes its basically impossible for me to get adhd medication without running a several month gamut with a new doctor even though I was on them for a decade and prescribed it by more than one psychiatrist. Then I know people that don't seem to even have the issue that have a higher dose of it than I've ever been able to get and they sell them on the side and rarely take them, when I never would and just need them for my well being. Extremely frustrating.</p></div>		</li>
