			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 99% right hand dominant but I was a switch hitter back when I played baseball. I had better strength batting right handed but way better control left handed.</p>
<p>Same with kicking - I've played in adult recreational kickball leagues and it's always great standing dead center of the plate, parallel to the pitcher. Sometimes I'll whiff a kick on one side, then swap as the next one's pitched and hammer it to an open spot. Suck it, nerds</p></div>		</li>
