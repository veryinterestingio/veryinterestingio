			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain how getting spanked causes kids to avoid getting caught, but other punishments don’t? Seems like any punishment would lead to kids avoiding getting caught. And from what I’ve seen it probably depends more on the kid then the punishment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Spanking triggers the flight or fight response in the child.  Any good punishment is going to involve getting the child to think about their actions, how it negatively affected someone, and try to internalize that lesson by putting themselves in the shoes of the person they wronged.  But if the child's just been or knows they're about to be spanked/harmed, they're really not thinking about that part of the lesson and they aren't going to retain it.  They're too focused on the pain they're about to/have just endured. They're going to continue doing the action and they're just going to actively avoid getting caught.  </p>
<p>They don't internalize that their actions are wrong because they hurt other people, they internalize that getting caught is wrong because it leads to them getting hurt.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, I think I got away with roughly 80% of the bad things that I did. If you had an 80% success rate and you're only goal was to avoid getting spanked, minimizing that 20% seems pretty easy.  If instead, you have to deal with your conscience nagging on you constantly, you're more like a 0% success rate. And avoiding that nagging feeling is totally about not doing the behavior that causes it.</p></div>		</li>
