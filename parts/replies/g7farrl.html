			<div class="markdown"><p>All this <em>can</em> be true but usually they are just sending a signal to your modem that reboots it, which most of the time does nothing, but will get you off the phone because they 'did' something.</p>
<p>Most if the time it's a signal issue either inside or outside your home that needs to be addressed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isp support tries to avoid remote soft reboots, and have the customer physically unplug the power for a few seconds. One of the reasons is to allow capacitors to discharge.</p>
<p>Another reason is to confirm that nothing had been messed up in the documentation or at the node, and that the link we're looking at is the same as the link that goes down when the customer unplugs something.</p>
<p>Soft rebooting is a rookie mistake, along with not having your customer tell you which blinkenlights are lit and what colour they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh the blinkenlights.  Always fun to find your remote diagnostics disagree with the blinkenlights.</p>
<p>Even more fun when the modem manufacturer decides that blinkenlights are ugly so weâ€™re going to remove them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually you can just &quot;flip the port&quot;, which is to tell the physical interface the customer is connected to to shut down, and then back on again. You usually do this while the customers reboots their modem/router.</p>
<p>Most speed issues are caused by signal sync problems, and resyncing brings it back to where it should be. Sometimes it's a physical link issue, and a tech needs to change the physical port or line, or we send the customer a new modem/router</p>
<p>Soft rebooting a customers modem with remote is a thing we try to avoid, as it doesn't discharge the capacitors. This is among the reasons why we ask a customer to leave it unplugged for a few seconds.</p>
<p>It is also common to push a new modem/router config at the same time, but that hardly ever affects the speed, since that is determined by the interface in the isp-end equipment for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Moving the customer to a new ip subnet is an old dialup thing as far as i know, i guess some isps would still do this. As far as i've seen subnets are assigned to the isp-end equipment, and changing this would affect all the customers on the same switch/dslam because of routing table reasons.</p>
<p>The act of rebooting could give you a new ip in the same subnet as you had before though, but shouldn't affect your speed. If the link from your nearest node and outwards is saturated, it should be saturated for all the subnets on the node.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add my experience to this, If i ever torrented (or used a service that used torrent to distribute updates) my speed would bounce between 1/20th and 1/10th usual speed AFTER all torrent traffic has ceased and remain that way until reboot. My ping to 8.8.8.8 would end up 2000ms+ for all devices on the network. I'm convinced this was a software problem with the modem because when I replaced it the issue went away.  A reboot of the modem would instantly take me from 20kbps average back to full 300mbps.</p>
<p>In this case i'm guessing shitty software on the modem was to blame and a reboot fixed the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically what you are describing is a router that doesn't have the hardware/capacity for torrenting. It may be software and this used to be the case on early routers where kind coders would share their hacked configs online, but most likely it's a hardware limitation. I've had good success with D-Link gamer branded routers because I've never found a torrenting branded router</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could tolerate high numbers of large bandwidth parallel connections and multiple very high bandwidth connections, it was specifically the torrent protocol that would make it shit the bed. It wasn't a cheap home box  or provider subsidized modem either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so the reboot clears the ram and restarts the cpu etc. so it works until the hardware reaches full capacity again and chokes the connection</p></div>		</li>
