			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. I'm just adding that bodybuilders also dehydrate their body before a contest. This causes the skin to tighten up and show the muscles better. This actually increases risk of injury and reduces strength so strongmen are not doing that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an interview where he had the director schedule the specific day of his nude scene in Days of Future Past so that he could prepare his training schedule. Then during shooting the director tried to reschedule that day and Jackman resisted. Hard. I don't know if he had it put in his contract or what, but they shot the scene on the original day so that he could eat some food that tasted good that night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback on this; I’ve read a couple of interviews with actors who had these insane physiques in their movies. </p>
<p>They don’t actually walk around looking like that all year. When they’re filming they’re dehydrated and on a caloric deficit to keep their look. </p>
<p>Stallone was fainting in between scenes in Rocky IV (IIRC) because he was so dehydrated and undernourished to maintain his build.</p>
<p>Channing Tatum says it took months to get into shape for Magic Mike, and he was miserable the whole time.  </p>
<p>A certain amount of fat is biologically necessary. It’s not realistic to walk around with 2% body fat on a day-to-day basis.</p></div>		</li>
