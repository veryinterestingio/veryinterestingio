			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the function of the iris is to limit the amount of light passing through the lens of your eye to your retina. Darker colours absorb more light, so that means darker irises let less light into your eyes. </p>
<p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, as I very well may be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like science. Smells like science. I'd believe it, anyway.</p>
<p>Makes sense, I think. Maybe why ancestral Europeans have lighter eye colors as compared to Middle Eastern or African ancestry. Cloudier climates providing less light allowing evolution to develop lighter eye colors, maybe?</p>
<p>I'm completely bullshitting this theory. I have no clue if this is based on any factual information. Could be complete non-sense. I have done zero research.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, a bright color just reflects more light. Does not directly tell you about how much color gets through the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, there’s no clear evidence for the reason people are throwing out in this thread, that eye color protects your eyes from the sun. And it doesn’t really make sense anyway, since the glare off the snow would be a big issue in climates where people have blue eyes, so it would probably be better to have brown eyes there, too. </p>
<p>It’s more likely that skin color is useful for helping protect you from the sun, and the melanin that determines your skin color also determines your eye color. Evolution is full of things like that, where a certain trait may not have any evolutionary advantage on its own, but it may simply not be disadvantageous enough to die out, or be connected to another trait that does have an advantage </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically it helps to mitigate how intense the light is getting into your pupils. Think about a football player with the black paint under their eyes. It eliminates glare. Darker irises will absorb more light and make it a little less hard on your pupils.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation for the how, but no mention of the why. Melanin helps absorb UV rays, which can damage the lens (cataracts) and the retina (a possible cause of macular degeneration). Humans evolved in equatorial Africa with lots of bright sunlight, so dark eyes. As humans populated more northern latitudes with lower sun angles and fewer daylight hours, they needed less of the darker iris pigmentation for that protection. Lighter eye color may have been fixed in the gene pool because its exotic nature may have attracted more mates. A similar thing happened with skin pigmentation; populations in northern latitudes didn't need the dark color protection against UV damage, and lighter skin color helps absorb more sunlight needed for vitamin D production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Odd question, but im wondering how this relates to Weimaraner dogs. Puppies are always born with blue eyes and after a year or so they turn golden/Amber.</p>
<p>I wonder what the biological benefit of this would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caveat: I spent decades in eye research (retinopathies and macular degeneration) but I'm not an evolutionary biologist, so take this speculation with a grain of salt. Just like in humans, the iris cells that make melanin haven't ramped up melanin production when they are born (not much need for UV protection in the womb). After birth, light may trigger the genes for melanin production. The eyes look blue because they lack pigments that absorb the longer wavelengths and the scattered light that bounces off appears blue (Rayleigh scattering, similar phenomenon for why the sky looks blue). As the pups (and humans) age, more melanin is produced, darkening the iris.</p></div>		</li>
