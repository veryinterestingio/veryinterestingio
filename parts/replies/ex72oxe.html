			<div class="markdown"><p>My bad, forgot the ELI5 bit. So here goes: The temperature of something that hot will make it look a certain colour with a certain brightness. We have a chart that tells us what colour and brightness means that temperature. It's like when you say red-hot or white-hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take something black, put it at a lot of different temperatures, and find the brightness at each of those temperatures. Then, expand that pattern. </p>
<p>For more, look up something called “black body radiation.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That explanation would be &quot;explain like I'm five years into a college physics course&quot;.</p>
<p>You solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" target="_blank">Schroedinger's equation</a>, which is one of the fundamental equations of physics, under boundary conditions. Then, according to this equation, you'll find that photons will have wavelengths following a certain pattern, called a &quot;black body spectrum&quot;.</p>
<p>So, I guess a true ELI5 in this case would be: they did the math.</p></div>		</li>
