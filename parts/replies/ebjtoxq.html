			<div class="markdown"><p>In some countries, maybe. In the UK we use &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; to refer to the Labour and Conservative parties respectively, but in The House Of Commons, the party that is in government sits to the speaker's right, whilst the opposition sits to their left.</p>
<p>So right now, with the Conservatives in power, the Right does sit on the right; but should Labour win the next general election, the Right would sit on the left.</p>
<p>There was a cute story some years ago where a blind MP's guide dog took some persuading to switch to the other side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, we're used to it. Also we have more than two parties, but only two sides of the House. Some parties are quite centrist in their politics, making them hard to categorise, but &quot;in power&quot; or &quot;not&quot; is a clear dividing line.</p>
<p>The last general election didn't go well, leaving no party with a clear majority. The Conservatives currently rule in coalition with the DUP (a small Northern Irish party). They both sit to the right, whilst Labour (the main opposition party) sit to the left, accompanied by the Green Party, Liberal Democrats, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly facetious, but not always. For example, the UK now has some 650 members of parliament, but the chamber only has a little over 400 seats. So some of them stand.</p></div>		</li>
