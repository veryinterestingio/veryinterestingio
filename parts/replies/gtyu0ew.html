			<div class="markdown"><p>To make a comparison: visual impairment can be anything from a scratched cornea that can be healed, to nearsightedness which can be alleviated completely with glasses, to total blindness. Being neurodivergent is much the same. In both cases it is a very general category of issues that broadly speaking impair/affect the same thing - your eyes/sight versus your brain/mind - but they're not necessarily similar beyond that. Because of that some conditions can be alleviated more or less completely, while practically nothing can be done for others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I‚Äôve noticed this trend of people assuming ‚Äòneurodivergent‚Äô is equivalent to ‚Äòon the autism spectrum‚Äô, because the word has been used most visibly by autism and Aspergers activists. Which is all well and good, since it removes some of the stigma around phrases like ‚Äòmental illness‚Äô. </p>
<p>But the word still literally just means having a neurological makeup that differs from the majority ‚Äònorm‚Äô in a significant way, so plenty of completely unrelated things can go under it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a lot of people think either autism or adhd when they hear neurodivergent, but neurodivergency can include: autism, adhd, tourettes, epilepsy, dyslexia, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To extend this metaphor; blindness (or deafness) may be caused by a problem with the actual equipment - i.e. the eye - or a problem with the brain processing the input from that equipment. There may be surgeries available that fix one issue but not the other - similar to how there is medication that helps alleviate most ADHD traits, but not autistic ones</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have both conditions at the same time (the ADHD being much worse than the autism), and to me the way that they feel are very different. Autism feels more like stumbling over what I'm doing or saying while ADHD is more like forgetfulness and distraction and the like. My ADHD meds make the ADHD symptoms much more manageable but the autism still feels about the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you replied to, but...</p>
<p>My observation is that people who are not autistic seem to have an innate ability to be social, to engage in small talk.  I have to build complex decision trees, study interactions for rules I can apply, and basically convert social skill into a math problem.  </p>
<p>The way people react to me these days I feel I have been fairly successful, but I am still acutely aware of my mistakes and those mistakes are often not the faux pas of normal people.</p>
<p>Edit thank you for the award</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I have adhd. Often my thoughts are going really fast, so I talk fast and jumble my words. Like when you‚Äôre nervous in a presentation. Also I jump through topics and miss information then have to double back. It can be very disorganized. I have to make a conscious effort to collect my thoughts and speak slowly and clearly. In class I used to write down key words in order before raising my hand, or else I would just ramble terribly lol.
As far as stumbling over what I do? I take that as tasks are just harder. I can zone out while doing a task and slow to a snail pace, because I‚Äôm not focused on what I‚Äôm doing. Got reprimanded for that often at work.
Or, all I get distracted between steps in a task. For example I‚Äôm outside and decide to do yard work. I go inside to get my gloves but I see some dishes in the kitchen. So I wash the dishes and then sit down to check my phone. Then I go back outside and see the branches I wanted to trim. Oh yeah! So I go back inside to get my gloves. But my cat is meowing to be fed, then I get a glass of water because I‚Äôm thirsty, then somebody asks me a question, then I sit down at the piano to practice. Then I go back outside. Oh yeah, I want to trim those branches! So I go inside to get my gloves...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also got ADHD, what they mean by stumbling over what they do and say is think of doing dishes. For someone who doesn't have ADHD or any kind of mental issue, it's as simple as just doing the dishes, mindless task right? Someone with ADHD thinks about everything that goes into it, <em>everything</em>, walking to the dishwasher, opening it, taking out a dish and remembering where it goes while at the same time there's 100000 other things running through their mind at once, things they have to do later, something they forgot and the same 5 second loop of a song they heard a week ago. If you throw off that perfect balance of things, they shutdown and start to trip and stumble over words and actions, Something as basic as being asked to take trash out will completely throw off a person with ADHD and they won't feel right until they start all over again, should their brain decide to.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Imagine a Ferrari with the brakes of a tricycle, that's a brain with ADHD. Starts racing, but if you mess it up it won't stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it‚Äôs the autism means I fundamentally have trouble understanding other people and their motivations, understanding sarcasm, etc....like all that basic ‚Äúhuman shit‚Äù is a script I had to learn and read from religiously to not seem very odd. The ADHD just means I have ‚Äúmotivation paralysis‚Äù and can‚Äôt stay on one thing for long enough to finish it ever. Also I forget shit constantly too üòÇ.</p>
<p>To be clear though, people on the spectrum might have trouble ‚Äúgetting‚Äù other people....doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have empathy. I‚Äôve found people on the spectrum can sometimes be far, far more sensitive/perceptive to things even like minute facial expressions than your average dude/dudette. Just one guy‚Äôs experiences</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can treat some symptoms of autism although it may not treat autism itself (anxiety meds for social anxiety, ADHD is often comorbid), there are meds for impulsivity, mood, anger outbursts. Does it fix autism, no. But it can help alleviate or lessen symptoms.</p></div>		</li>
