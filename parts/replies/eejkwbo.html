			<div class="markdown"><p>Your wording is confusing. It wouldn't just feel like .17 years for the traveller. It would actually be .17 years.</p>
<p>People below are asking if they would need to eat 4 years of food during this time. No, only .17 years would pass in the space ship.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you help me understand the definition of 4 light years?  My understanding is that it means it takes light 4 years to travel that distance.  Help me understand how another object that needs 4 years to travel said distance at light speed would have occupants in it that beleive it is only .17 years, when in fact the object took 4 earth years to get to its destination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frankly, this idea terrifies me. Imagine we are at .999999 the speed of light. A ship sets off on a voyage that will take 10 years our time, and 7 months their time. In those 10 years we set another ship off that can travel at   .99999999 the speed of light, and they make the voyage in 4 months their time. Now consider if those two ships were to arrive at the same time only to find a colony already in the early stages, which would mean a break thru in technology back on the home planet. These volunteers just left everything for a chance at something new, when in reality they could have stayed with their families and friends for neigh on 20 years and still made it to the colony before that original ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Forever War but Joe Haldeman actually covers this exact topic. In a sci fi setting the main character is a soldier. Every time he is &quot;deployed&quot; due to relativity when he comes back it's been years or more and society changes each time. I think the final time he was deployed, they reached their destination only to find out their species had made peace like 2 years ago. </p>
<p>Haldeman was a Vietnam vet, and the book explores his viewpoint of how things were different when he came back from war. SPOILERS THAT I CAN RECALL but one of the times he came back, society had shifted to predominantly homosexual due to crazy over population and a cloning fad. One of his first fights he got hurt and lost an arm. He was pretty bummed thinking about his robot arm, but when he comes back it's been like 12 years and they can actually regrow limbs from stem cells in a few days. Each time was more jarring than before and it definitely weighed on the MC as he almost started hoping he'd come back to find a time he could actually fit in that society. </p></div>		</li>

Reading forever peace ATM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how much sci-fi you read, but the Ender's Game series toys with this idea of relativistic-speed space travel, somewhat. Not quite so much in Ender's Game, but more-so in the following novels. If you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would only happen at much slower velocities (like a ship at 0.1c being overtaken by a ship traveling at 0.2c)</p>
<p>If both ships are traveling at almost light speed then both would take around 10 years from the point of view of Earth and the destination planet (time only slows for the occupants of the ships) so your first ship would still arrive before the 2nd, and there would be no way for a 3rd ship to overtake them without FTL travel.</p></div>		</li>
