			<div class="markdown"><p>In my country, one province had a bunch of their student loan data on a USB key that got lost. I don't know the specifics but if I remember correctly, something like 18,000 people had their student loans vanish. </p>
<p>So maybe you don't become debt free from a criminal fluke but potentially an administrative error.</p>

<p>An external hard drive containing personal information, including the names, Social Insurance Numbers, birthdates and addresses of up to 583,000 students who applied for student loans between 2000 and 2006, disappeared.</p>

<p>That's like the opposite of hacking though. That's just janking shit out of a system and throwing it in a lake presummably :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's surprising how many &quot;hacks&quot; happen because of administration error/negligence. Far easier to steal data when you have access to an admin profile because the user has the same password for everything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suspect that's a decent analogy :)</p></div>		</li>
