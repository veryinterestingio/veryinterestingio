			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about research is that there's really a huge amount of very smart people who always though about everything. Whatever is doable has been tought of 30 years ago. Even e.g. quantum computing with the electron beam. Someone thought about it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a lot of stuff has been conceived but never done, so there's still plenty to do.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I have a coolest object, but I can tell you the weirdest. At some point we want to investigate the optical properties of planar chiral structures.  That is structures with a shape that looks a bit like a planar spiral. So we asked a collaborator to realise something... Of course making the structure a bit more regular would have helped to manufacture it. And so they made a bunch quarter micron sized golden tetragammadions. What's a tetragammadion you ask? I'll let you google that. We never published the work, even my colleagues were continuously freaked out by even getting a glimpse of those images.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay they sound like they would be really cool to see, at that size ðŸ˜‚ it does sound like you have a really cool job tbf. I have been looking at trying to build an electron microscope myself because the micro fascinates me so much ðŸ™‚</p></div>		</li>
