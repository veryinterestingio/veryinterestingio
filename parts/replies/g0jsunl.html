			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, having a lot of ram can be very helpful for certain data-heavy workloads: In a PC, the fastest memory is in the various caches on the CPU (L1 is fastest, L2 is slightly slower, etc.), the next fastest is the system RAM, and then the SSDs/HDDs are slower still. If you have enough RAM to put everything you’re working on in RAM, it will be much smoother and faster than if you don’t have enough RAM, and your system is constantly having to wait for data to load from SSD/HDD into RAM.</p>
<p>At the moment, it seems that the practical limit for single-socket workstations is around 2TB. Working with raw high-res video footage (4K &amp; 8K) is one potential use case where that much RAM could be very useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One interesting thing to note is that because the address space is so large, we don't have to limit ourselves to just the lower part. Modern operating systems randomize where in the address space (but <em>not</em> in physical memory) programs and data are loaded to enhance security. This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization" target="_blank">Address space layout randomization.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to this, this kind of &quot;virtual&quot; memory layout allows in some systems to use peripherals in your system (memory, graphics/dedicated hardware...) as simple internal memory, making it way easier to work with them.</p>
<p>This is used in some ARM systems with 32bits available, but usually only a few megabytes(10^6) of actual memory. The rest of the 4GB available is used to access to peripherals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can have 9999 towns (blocks of memory) with a 4 digit zip code (memory address). You can have 99999 with 5 digits, or 10 times more. That's why more bits = more supported memory.</p></div>		</li>
