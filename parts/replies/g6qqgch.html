			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the the main issue is that viruses aren't really &quot;alive&quot; (i.e., they can't reproduce on their own and have no metabolism). </p>
<p>Also, historically, there are very few treatments that work well against viral infections. Acyclovir (HSV), Gancyclovir (CMV, EBV), Cidofivir (CMV), Antiretrovirals (HIV), Ribavirin (Hepatitis B/C), Olsetamivir (Influenza) are viral treatments that come to mind. But there are loads of other viruses for which there are no medicinal treatments. And even when a medication is available, these treatments can work but they don't work as well as those available for other pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The only major problem is its a teratogen (i.e. causes birth defects), so you can't use it in pregnant women or women of childbearing age without adequate contraception.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't understand why, but it seems anti-parasitic + antibiotic is popular?  (HCQ + Azithromycin)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ivermectin recently had an in-vitro study that showed it reduced viral load by 93% in 24 hours and even more reduction at 48 hours. Of course, human trials for ivermectin are still being conducted but there is potential for this medication.</p></div>		</li>
