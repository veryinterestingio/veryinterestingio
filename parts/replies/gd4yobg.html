			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's intentional: Its futile to try to grab the remote to deal with it.  I suppose explosions are supposed to be loud, who knew?</p>
<p>By the time you grab the remote to lower the explosion volume, you are 1second too late, and then you can't hear the dialog, so then you turn it up again, then BOOM, oops need to turn it down but you were too slow, so you again lowered it 1 second after that explosion is over.... lather rinse repeat....</p>
<p>Just leave it at the correct dialog volume and realize that bombs and bullets are loud ... The sound mixer engineers must be hard of hearing: I'm looking at you, sound guy from 'U-571!!!'</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Sorry people next door trying to sleep, or roommates trying to be on a call, BOMBS AND BULLETS ARE LOUD. THE VOLUME IS CORRECT.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>That specific thing isn't really an issue in the sense of being some kind of mistake. By and large, it's their intent or artistic vision or whatever you want to call it. If you set the volume so that the dialogue is at a comfortable level for you, then when there's gunfire or a car crash what you hear really is how loud they wanted the gunfire or car crash to be.</p>

<p>This is generally NOT the case. There are exceptions of course. Famously Interstellar has an audio mix that is very heavy on score and effects, and the dialog is hard to hear in many scenes, and <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/christopher-nolan-interstellar-sound-mix/" target="_blank">Nolan came out and said it was intentional, to make the movie feel more &quot;real&quot; and intense</a>. But in general, they aren't trying to deafen you. They just don't know what your living room is like. </p>
<p>They mix for the max possible usage, which these days is getting pretty ridiculous. Theaters obviously vary too much to really talk about, but even at home, you might have a 9.2.4 system. Most movies are shipped with a 5.1 mix or a 7.1 mix these days, and to take advantage of those, you need not only the equipment, but the software tuning to tailor that equipment to your custom room. </p>
<p>Without any of that, you have hardware that's trying its best to down-sample very complex audio data into (statistially) 2 very very shitty speakers on the back or bottom of your TV. Is that TV mounted to the wall with open air above and below? Or is it sitting on a stand? Or maybe it's <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sierraimages/Images/Product/Large/9806.jpg" target="_blank">enclosed in a larger entertainment center</a>. Those are 3 very different audio environments that will severely alter the way the sound projects into the room. And even then, you might be sitting close to your screen, or far away. in a large room, or small. Carpet, or hard wood? etc. From there you diverge further into issues with perception. Do you live in a noisy house with distractions and no fear of being too loud? or do you live in a 700 foot apartment with neighbors behind every wall ready to pound on your door for bothering them? Your perception of what is too loud will change from viewing to viewing, person to person. </p>
<p>You imagine that there is much more effort going into the home-audience audio mix than there really is. It isn't a plot to deafen you, it's just that there generally isn't the budget, time, or talent required to make a bunch of custom mixes for a bunch of different audio setups, and so you get the main Theater mix and your crappy TV just does what it can with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do all these varied and random conditions explain that it is NEVER the dialog that is easy to hear? It is ALWAYS the music and sound effects that are uncomfortably/intolerably loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the frequency response of crappy TV speakers probably isn't super accurate but the mids aren't going to sound half as loud as evening else. They're not <em>that</em> bad.</p></div>		</li>
