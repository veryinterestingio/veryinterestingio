			<div class="markdown"><p>Because tetanus has a mortality rate of 20% for unvaccinated people, while salmonellosis kills only ~0.5%.</p>
<p>A significant chance of hearth problems, spasms, and death for stepping on a nail? I'll get vaccinated for that. Vaccinating against a few weeks of irritated bowels and diarrhoea if I eat a raw egg doesn't seem that worthwhile.</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to what I found on a CDC website, it's about 420 deaths per year out of 1.35 million. That's 0.03%</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what the other poster said about mortality rate, tetanus is transmitted directly from the bacteria to us, and we can't vaccinate the bacteria. The bacteria is common in soil and presents a risk whenever you get dirt inside, e.g., a cut.</p></div>		</li>
