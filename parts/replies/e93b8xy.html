			<div class="markdown"><p>From JR: I think avoiding articles like the examples you provided is a great start. If a headline claims &quot;This invention will change everything,&quot; or &quot;This miracle discovery will cure cancer,&quot; you should definitely be skeptical. We know that science is a slow process and that new findings have to be put in the context of the greater body of research that's out there. If you're reading a story about a single study and the reporter doesn't speak to anyone other than the study author themselves, that's a red flag. If the study was done in mice, but the story claims the findings prove something regarding humans, that's a red flag. A story should be transparent about who the subjects were, how large the sample size was, etc. If it's not, I'd suggest looking at how other outlets are covering the same story. For every clickbait article out there, you'll usually find some great debunking pieces that provide a more accurate picture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. Certainly some publications do better than others but there are many places where you can find interesting and accurate science writing.</p></div>		</li>
