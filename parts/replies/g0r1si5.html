			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a unilateral hearing loss plus substantial impairment of balance, so I visited an ENT doctor and he said that it could be viral or could be Menierre’s disease. Viral ear infections are apparently often caused by a couple of viruses which I have and have never fully cleared from my system (herpes simplex aka cold sores, and Epstein Barr aka mono). That combined with the fact that it’s never reoccurred makes the viral diagnosis more likely, because Menierre’s is usually degenerative. However the only way to diagnose for sure is at autopsy bc the inner ear really cannot be accessed ... so I guess I’ll never know for sure! Oh and hearing loss from exterior sources hits your high frequency first, because those hearing cells are closest to the outside. This is why a lot of old veterans can’t hear high pitches anymore. Mine is a reverse slope loss, starting at the lowest pitches ... meaning that the damage came from the inside working its way out. It’s crazy how little medical science can do for anything hearing related though. It’s basically, “sorry. You can buy a hearing aid out-of-pocket if you want. There are no medicines or procedures though, and insurance covers nothing.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have hearing aids though? My SO also has unilateral deafness like you and recently got his hearing aids way way later in his 30s. It's a special one (a CROS hearing aid) which essentially records the sound coming into your deaf ear and plays it over your hearing ear at a slightly altered pitch so your brain can distinguish the two sources. He can now use his hearing again to locate sounds (on top of, you know, actually being able to hear tiny soft sounds).</p>
<p>It's been quite a drastic positive change for him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure, and they don’t even know for positive that it was EBV. It’s just the fact that I have it - and herpes simplex - and both are known links to the type of hearing damage I suffered. I do for sure have lingering effects of EBV to this day though, 20+ years later. Ever since I was infected, I suffer a lovely combo of fatigue + sore throat + headache whenever I’m overtired or stressed. It’s like the mono comes right back whenever my cortisol spikes and my immune system is down. It’s also when the cold sores attack.</p>
<p>But I really cant complain too much, many other people have much worse issues to deal with! It’s just an example of what some common viruses can do to people - it’s not over and done, it’s a lifetime.</p></div>		</li>
