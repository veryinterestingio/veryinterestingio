			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I didn't know this. Any idea how much of the immunity is carried over year to year? Like I wonder if that person who gets the flu shot every year then skips one year would be 5% less likely to get it than someone who never gets the flu shot or more like 50%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a ton of different strains of the flu out there. The vaccine is always just for a few that experts think will be dominant in the coming season. That's a different combination each year. So you might be vaccinated for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strains Av2020, Bv2020, Ev2020</li>
<li>Strains Bv2019, Cv2019</li>
<li>Strains Fv2018</li>
</ul>
<p>So when you get infected with strain F in 2021 the body will still partly recognize it from it's vaccination in '18. It's not gonna be familiar with all the updates but it can start working immediately and figure out the details along the way.</p>
<p>Meanwhile if you get infected with strain D the body goes &quot;da fuq is this&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have thought that with so little people getting the flu this year, there'd be much less mutations to account for for next flu season. So little to no changes would have to be made for the vaccine. Is that not correct? And are mutations even the issue here or what normally tells you what the hot-strain of next year will be? Is it always the same few variants going around?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's not about mutations - what we call &quot;the flu&quot; is actually a bunch of different flu virus &quot;species&quot;. They just all have similar symptoms. What works against H1N1 might not work against H3N2, H5N8, etcetera.</p>
<p>Usually, doctors take samples from flu victims to predict which strains are spreading fastest, and the upcoming vaccines are made specifically to stop the fastest-spreading versions, the ones you're most likely to get. Unfortunately, we don't yet have a vaccine that would stop all the different varieties of flu, so doctors have to play this deadly guessing game every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People get A/H3N2 about every 5 years, A/H1N1 a little longer than that, and influenza B every 15-20 years. This happens becasue the virus mutates and peoples immune response wanes. Everyone's immune response is waning right now, or forgetting how to fight off influenza  because no one is getting it. Influenza will start circulating like it used to which means it is possible there could be some influenza seaons in the near future that could be quite severe despite the flu not mutating much.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask a potentially stupid question? Why can’t we make a vaccine that targets all the known flu strains? Like just immunization against all the strains even if they’re not in season. Is there any downside to that?</p>
<p>And as a follow up, are we not able to make a general vaccine against the virus? As in target a general part of the virus common to all strains. What is the biology limitations that is inhibiting us from doing this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. On phone now so have to be brief.  There are major effort to target parts of the virus that do not mutate much and are common in strain - it’s a universal vaccine but so far attempts have failed - last I heard is it’s still frig developed and  newer tech such had mRNA targets it might be feasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Universal flu vaccine is actually very close to being ready. Undoubtedly covid19 will set that back quite a bit. Both because every resource is focused on covid, and because the trials underway suddenly have to account for flu infections practically disappearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's like trying to make a key that will fit a constantly changing lock. It's possible a few small changes to the lock don't stop the key from working. There are certain tolerances built in to the system after all. </p>
<p>But the problem is the pins inside rearrange themselves and not in a predictable way. So every year it's taking apart the lock, seeing what changed, and making a new fitting key to match it.</p>
<p>We don't really have the technology to circumvent the lock (yet). Maybe a Virus Picking Scientist will come up with it some day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We do- now. There are universal vaccines in phase 2 and 3 trials. They typically take years of trials- and undoubtedly the lack of flu in the wild this year will cause those to take even longer.</p>
<p>I believe the new vaccines are based on the same mRNA tech that the moderna and pfizer covid vaccines are based on. It allows use to craft proteins to trigger an immune response that are present on all flu strains. The current method just uses inactivated virus and your body only recognizes the proteins that change every year (thanks evolution!).</p>
<p>Related fact- the flu virus has the bizarre property that has a similar effect as sexual reproduction: if a host is infected with two different strains you'll get a third with a mash up of their proteins.</p></div>		</li>
