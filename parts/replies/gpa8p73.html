			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great explanation thank you :). So the logical next question for me is, would you theoretically be able to cut away the structural scar tissue to give the hepatocytes a chance to grow back? Not minding that an operation like that would probably have a pretty high risk of complications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with chronic damage is that this kind of scar tissue is not really separated from the functioal parts, like on a skin scar that can actually be progressively &quot;cut away&quot; to allow for the skin to rebuild a better structure. In cirrhotic liver, scar fibers and functional cells are deeply mingled, at a cellular level. There is no practical way of separating them.</p>
<p>In principle, as someone already suggested, it could be possible to cut out a part of the liver and let it regrow in an healty way. Provided the patient is no longer exposed to alcohol or whatever was involved in the chronic damage in the first place (hepatitis B virus, for example). On a practical standpoint I see two main problems with this kind of strategy.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How much liver can be taken away without compromising liver function so much as to actualy finishing the patient? If the patient is already symptomatic (i.e. is already suffering from liver insufficiency), taking away a portion of it may be a portion too much. And if liver function is still not fully compromised, removing the cause of liver damage may be enough to make things stable even in the long run, so this surgery may be an unjustified risk.</p>
</li>
<li>Is the cirrhotic liver still able to grow in an healty way? Eccessive connective tissue is not just non-functional per se. New connective tissue, after being formed, &quot;shortens&quot; itself quite a bit, deforming surrounding healthy tissue. In cirrhotic liver,, these mingled connective fibers also squeeze, pull and push surrounding (almost) healty parts in ways that eventually interfere with blood flow. Irregular blood flow is also a cause of liver damage, expecially for the functional part, that needs much more oxigen and nutrients for its metabolism. So, the chronic damage suffered by the liver will eventually build up to a degree that actually impare liver regeneration itself. As far as I understand it, that's pretty much when one becomes symptomatic and is put on a transplant list.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe a specialist will show up and add to the discussion. As of now, I google &quot;liver self transplant&quot; and came up with nothing. Apparently it's not a thing: there is no actual sitution whan this kind of surgery makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
