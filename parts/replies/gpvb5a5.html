			<div class="markdown"><p>This tip extends to defrosting food from a freezer.  Best method is put food in a bowl with a tiny trickle of running water.  The trickle is just to keep the water moving around the food.  The actual temperature of the water doesn't matter very much.  So people go with cold to keep the defrosted thing still cold after thawed.</p>
<p>I used to submerge 3lb roasts and leave them, which would take like 4-5 hrs to defrost.  The trickling water in a bowl does in in 1.5 hrs.</p></div>		</li>
