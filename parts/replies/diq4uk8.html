			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, humans also have strange instincts sometimes. With the free will to think what we want, comes the ability to think about things kind of 'stupidly'. Like I remember when reading about Buddhism one of the things they talked about was how people make things overly complicated. Like you look at a dog or fish, and every never do things awkwardly. They get scared, but they don't overthink playing with other animals and become an awkward mess, unlike many humans. For whatever reason, people overthink things a lot. This makes some sense, because with our capabilities sometimes overthinking a problem ends up with s brilliant solution. It's basically impossible that a dog could come up with a genius solution to it's problem and then implement it. Another thing to consider is that putting humans in a small cage all day is torture, yet we do this to our pets when we travel together. They just handle it better, their instincts allow for that whereas a human will eventually begin to lose their minds relatively quickly. That's not to say that animals don't mind those conditions, they just are affected less negatively by them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Agreed. In my experience (was locked in cages for a while, look up SERE school if you're curious), some people are &quot;zen&quot; and refuse to overthink their situation, allowing the mind to wander beyond their current situation. I call it, &quot;going to my happy place.&quot; I endured a lot wih very ill effect by doing this. Some people got really fucked up mentally during this training, because they couldn't accept what was happening to them.</p>
<p>Interesting stuff, and spot on explanations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an animal discovers something &quot;genius&quot; without training or help, I bet it'll be discovered through a series of fortunate accidents as they paw or gnaw or pounce at it. They're thinking viscerally, not pondering abstractly. Their &quot;pondering&quot; face seems to me more of a &quot;relaxing on the beach&quot; face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuinely curious because I see this come up again and again.</p>
<p>Is there actually any evidence to support the idea we're some kind of super animal that feels and experiences differently to other mammals or do people just keep repeating this because it's what we want to believe? What is the fundamental difference in our biology that makes lesser animals incapable of experiencing true joy and emotion like us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not a question of better or worse emotions, just different.  It is kind of like languages.  A word like &quot;groovy&quot; is unique in English, there is no Japanese or French word that means quite the same thing.  There are words in those languages with similar meanings, and words in those language that are similarly unique to them.</p>
<p>On top of that, humans often interpret animal behaviors in human terms.  We think a dog is acting guilty when they have gotten into the garbage when really they are acting submissive because they detect we are mad at them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think humans have just different emotions and different reactions to stimuli than any other animal, which could give us a sense of superiority to some. </p>
<p>There are examples of human emotional traits that are not nearly seen as much in other animals. Altruism for example</p></div>		</li>
