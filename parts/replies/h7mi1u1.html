			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, VZV (the virus that causes chickenpox) lays dormant in the peripheral sensory ganglia (little clumps of neurons just outside the spinal cord). When it reactivates, it travels down the axons of these neurons to the skin. Thus, the rash you get from shingles only appears in the areas innervated by the ganglia from which it originated. This is why shingles appears in very characteristic patterns.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight clarification- it’s the fluid from open, uncovered blisters of a shingles rash that can transmit the virus. So it’s not the same type of contagious as a respiratory disease like covid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got shingles when I was 22. It was a little surprising but I quickly figured out how I got it. I was a bartender that regularly made martinies for en elderly regular. I would also handle and wash her dirty glasses. I learned after getting shingles that she also had it, so I think I got it from her dirty glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shingles is not contagious itself. You can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but you get shingles from your own dormant chickenpox virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't catch shingles, you catch chicken pox. Once you've endured chicken pox, the virus lays dormant in your system until you're unlucky and it reemerges as shingles. It's generally stress and/or a compromised immune system that allows it to pop up, which is why it's usually only older individuals who suffer from it. But high enough stress in a young person can cause it. I've had it twice and I'm only 30. So unless the elderly regular was causing you stress, she's completely innocent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shingles is a re-emergence of a virus that's already in your body and dormant. You don't catch it directly from other people like this. </p>
<p>Someone could get <em>chicken pox</em> from a person with shingles, but you'd have to come into contact with the pus from their shingles sore. I really hope your customer didn't rub her shingles sores on her bar glass...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Specifically, it stimulates a t-cell response, which otherwise declines with age, and which is necessary to provide protection against reactivated virus.</p>
