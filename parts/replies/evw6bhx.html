			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc not too long ago they changed that as well, to depend on natural derivatives or whatever the term was. mass being the last constant to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, a competing proposal at the time (which still seems more intuitively satisfying to me tbh) was to define mass in terms of Avogadro number. There will still be a relationship between the two but it’s flipped (instead of defining Avogadro number from mass).</p>
<p>The new definition of kilogram didn’t go that route though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s because they’re using the new definition as the basis for the kilogram. Just like how the speed of light is now defined as a specific number, so it serves as the basis for the meter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Originally we were stuck deriving a mole from the amount of substance we could measure, but now we just define mass as a constant number that we can accurately measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the mass part is in the atomic weight/molecular weight of whatever youre analyzing, usually given in grams / mol. the only purpose of mols is to convert the simple headcount of particles to a scale on which its more reasonable to do actual calculations with. Its basically the same thing as a farmer selling 24 dozen heads of cattle instead of 288 cattle, its just easier to express and do the math for &quot;24 dozen&quot;.</p>
<p>edit: multiplication hard</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that were the only reason though you might as well use a unit like zettaatoms (10^21 atoms) or something less arbitrary.  The entire reason to use this very specific number was to maintain the mass/mole relationship.  Now it's just an arbitrary value that is just *pretty close*.</p></div>		</li>
