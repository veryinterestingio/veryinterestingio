			<div class="markdown"><p>Mastering is closer to when you &quot;flatten&quot; all the data to a single file, versus being able to level each part of a song.    You would set each instruments/inputs indv level, then master say all four tracks to create say an MP3. I'm simplifying, but Mastering can mean so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mastering is done AFTER that. Mastering is done to a single stereo file. It's taking an essentially finished product and preparing the file for the different stages to come, whether it be streaming audio, video, CD, vinyl... they all need files slightly differently mastered.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mastering is simply the process of getting the nearly finished recordings ready to be distributed. &quot;leveling&quot; as the previous reply mentions, can be done during the mastering phase, but it's only a small portion of what is done during mastering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a professional level, mastering is like sorcery. You are basically fine tuning the song so that it sounds polished and clean. You are also trying to achieve consistency in overall “feel” of the album. So from song to song, the crispness, the balance, the presence and how it lands on your ears from different types and sizes of speakers. </p>
<p>It’s also the time that you adjust the individual sound elements so they don’t clash, sonically, and create too much activity in a certain sonic range. What I mean is, you have a sonic range in measured in hertz - imagine a decorative sand tube where you have different colors of sand stacked on top of each other. Bass is at the bottom, treble at the top. Each instrument and sound has its place in the stack. It’s own color, so to speak. </p>
<p>When the mastering professional stacks up all the frequencies, he might need to pull some away from a certain sound because the sound waves can be dissonant and clash with another. This is why, when you listen to an album like Blink 182 Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, despite the fact you have this driving hard rock, you can still hear every single element of the song - drums, guitar, bass, vocals - precisely and clearly in its own sonic “lane”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Thought I was imagining it years ago when I watched weekend morning cartoons. I'd get up at like 5am to watch and would have to dive towards the remote to lower the volume when a commercial came on so I wouldn't wake up the others in the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s because they literally turn the volume up in commercials. Some states have laws against it.  Most don’t.</p></div>		</li>
