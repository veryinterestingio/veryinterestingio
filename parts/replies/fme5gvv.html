			<div class="markdown"><p>As an engineer I never got this thought as it doesn’t seem possible. Electric vehicles are usually essentially fixed gear ratios. At any given power, you get the same power our, but because electric motors don’t differentiate torque and speed output, the way you go faster is to input more power and thus output more power.</p>
<p>In a video through Motortrend it was explained that an F150 should have ~3x torque in first gear than a Cybertruck, which makes sense because at highway speed you cannot have an electric vehicle use 3x power as a gas vehicle at highway speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you build the motor for a specific range. Now modern brushless motors without any permanent magnets suffer less from this, but the problem is still that you get problems with magnetic fields at high rpms. I don't remember the name of the phenomenon tough. Classic brushed DC motors is the most obvious example of this where you get a ridiculous amount of torque instantly but the efficiency drops pretty rapidly at higher rpm, that motor could definitely benefit from a gearbox for high speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not a choice, its a limitation.</p>
<p>however we can build them to put the torque where we want it but its a give and take system.</p>
<p>if you want low end torque then you can pull a house but good luck getting faster then the speed of smell.</p></div>		</li>
