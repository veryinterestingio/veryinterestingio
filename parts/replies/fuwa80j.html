			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and RSV can vary from mild cold to full on flu level with permanent damage</p>
<p>(The others can too, I'm just especially aware after my kid got put temporarily put back on a ventilator due to RSV, and I'm now asthmatic after the last time it came through our house due to the damage done by secondary pneumonia)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With any luck, there should be RSV vaccines ready in the next 5 years or so. It's a neat story; the NIH successfully determined the structure of the RSV spike protein a few years back. This let pharma companies figure out how to make a more efficacious vaccine. Good example of the importance of public spending in science, and how it translates to real advances in medicine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the antibodies you develop from influenza will likely be helpful in fighting off the same or antigenically similar influenza viruses in the future.  However, some will be antigenically different enough that those antibodies will not help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibodies are like little sticky keys that help recognize things that fit its groove. Having said that, biology is about relatives, not absolutes. A key that fits really well for one thing may fit less well for another thing but functionally will still aid in immunity.</p>
<p>And antibodies are only one portion of the entire immune system which employs other agents such as T cells to cull your infected cells.</p></div>		</li>
