<p>I am an RN and work in acute care settings in ON, Canada. </p>
<p>I appreciate you spreading awareness and educating the public and your fans. </p>
<p>As someone unfamiliar with your work and credentials I am curious about your education, experience and credentials relative to medicine. To be clear, I am not trying to be rude or snooty or anything of the sort. I am genuinely curious and making a judgment free inquiry.</p>
<p>You said &quot;I know a lot about viruses&quot; so as someone interested to learn as much as I can about information relevant to my day-to-day, I can't help ask, where the knowledge came from new friend?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does shampoo kill viruses in my hair like soap does on my skin? If not and I'm sick, should i use soap in my hair too? How long should a sick person wash their hair?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you kill viruses on clothes without bleach? Can vinegar kill viruses or only prevent mold?</p>
</li>
<li>Other than potentially staving off our collective doom from climate change a little longer, what other &quot;freak-o-nomics&quot; effects are you predicting/hoping will happen out of this Covid calamity? Myself, more cats being adopted, more interests/investments in forests/parks/public lands, more equity between health/education/income/gender disparities, more farm to table foods, some of the best cook books ever made, more multi-lingual people/people speaking more openly across language barriers, etc</li>

<li>Yes shampoo will work, it is a surfactant so it breaks up the oily outer layer of coronavirus particles same way soap does.  Yuck who wants to wash their hair w soap!  2. Bleach is effective.  I have no idea if vinegar is effective on coronavirus but I wouldn't trust it.  3. A hard practical look (non-ideological) at the inefficiencies, inequities, and bloated costs of our health system and PULLING TOGETHER AS A NATION TO FIX IT!</li>
