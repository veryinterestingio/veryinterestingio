<blockquote>
<p>In this large population-based study using data from the OpenSAFELY platform in England, we found people with HIV to be at more than twice the risk of COVID-19 death compared with people without HIV, after accounting for demographic characteristics and lifestyle-associated factors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But most people with HIV are under 60 and age is a much bigger risk factor for covid. So the vast majority of people with HIV who catch covid survive (&gt;99%)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>since there are 10,000 mutations of the virus, is there a reason why the UK one is given so much press? is there a greater functional/structural change with that particular mutation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not looked at their specific sequences but it has several of the mutations on the spike glycoprotein used for cell entry which is the reason. There is no proof but fear that it could be a problem for vaccines training immune system on the spike.</p>
<p>Also there is some fear it may be more infectious and spread faster. They are in the news now but they have been around a while. Both the UK and South African mutations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are testing for that right now. They got worried based on epidemiological data and that is not how new strains are determined.
This experienced virology professor goes over why he thinks the panic is premature at best and how new strains are determined: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC8ObD2W4Rk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC8ObD2W4Rk</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is unverified. There are 70% more infections than expected in a certain area. That doesn't mean the virus itself is more infectious until it's verified. It could be traced back to a person or group of particularly infectious cases at a major transportation hub, but this takes time to work out. The media has rushed the &quot;new strain&quot; narrative which is inaccurate.</p>
<p>There's an anti-UK political climate at the moment, and lots of world leaders are learning from this year's mistakes and exercising extreme caution. In reality, no one should have been traveling, but the decision to reduce it during a pandemic is based on a person or country's risk tolerance.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, we dont have the depth of data in the US for tracking. They have a central repository of genome sequencing, and have 100 times more data than the US Federal government. Not hyperbole, as the CDC has done fewer than 50 sequences that are being used to track cases, and the UK has over 5000. Not trying to be alarmist, but we could have a faster-spreading variant in the US and not know.</p></div>		</li>
