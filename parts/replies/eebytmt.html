<p>The ridge and occipital bud are more genetically dependent on which type of sapiens you're most closely related to regardless of your assigned biological sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren’t born with it.  The brow growth is dependent on the presence of androgens (i.e. testosterone) during puberty when the face is maturing.  It is very hard for anthropologists to tell if a pre-pubescent child’s skeleton is male or female from the skull alone.  The pelvis is a lot easier.</p>
<p>Someone born male, but that doesn’t produce enough testosterone (via accident, primary hypogonadism, or congenital issue), will not develop the male brow ridge.  Whereas someone born female but that does have enough testosterone during puberty (via exogenous administration) will develop it.</p></div>		</li>
