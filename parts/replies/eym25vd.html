			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pixel 3 (Not 3A) is Over a $1000 to buy outright. With carrier discounts it gets knocked down. They are still over $1000. If you like apple want a good camera and a big screen why wouldn’t you buy the XS Max for example. Just because you don’t need a $1200 doesn’t mean other people wouldn’t...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of things that you think is simply done by &quot;software&quot; actually requires tons of &quot;hardware&quot; implementation. Camera was an good example, but many other things like you wifi/3g/4g/5g speed, your quick charge, your fingerprint scanner (and it's speed), and many many other examples are controlled by the Qualcomm snapdragon inside your phone, which is not just a processor but actually a system on chip (SoC) with many expecialized hardware (many patented) inside it.
Long story short, sometime you have to pay for a whole high-end phone to get some top features.</p></div>		</li>
