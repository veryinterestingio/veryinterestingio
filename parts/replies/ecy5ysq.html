			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Someone elsewhere in this post has mentioned Polycythemia Vera which is a condition where the body overproduces blood cells due to a chronically activated JAK2/STAT5 that is normally activated by EPO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be correct.  There are a whole slew of disorders that cause increased production of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and sometimes all three.  The &quot;common&quot; ones resulting in increased red blood cells would be hemachromatosis and polycythemia vera. The word common being in quotes because things common in medicine are still usually quite rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea! The same reason teams will train in Denver! &quot;Thinner&quot; air means you make more EPO, meaning more red blood cells, meaning better oxygen transport. That helps your body work harder for longer. In bicycling they were just skipping the step where their own body made it, and just gave themselves exogenous EPO.</p></div>		</li>
