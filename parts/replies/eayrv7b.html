			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it was due to the fisheye/wide angle style lens on the camera, and the snow also messes with the auto focus so the operator probably had it set fairly near. Many new smart phones also have a wide angle lens for selfies and they tend to really distort things in the backdrop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weathermen make the best hype man, hands down. I went to high school with a kid that wanted to be a weatherman (I got rid of Facebook but I know he was studying meteorology last I saw). This kid chased tornadoes after school and had nothing but positivity to spread. I think it takes just that kind of enthusiasm to be a meteorologist. When's the last time you've watched the local weather and the person was in a pissy mood? Maybe like once in ten years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okie from St Louis, we've had some thunder snow as far East as here. It's so muffled, though. Maybe too many hills and trees. Still, unsettling.</p>
<p>I want to say it was the 90's blizzard where I first heard it.</p></div>		</li>
