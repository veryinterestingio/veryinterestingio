<p>For reference, this is what a pure, single note sounds like with no overtones or anything: <a href="https://youtu.be/xGXYFJmvIvk" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/xGXYFJmvIvk</a></p>
<p>This is something no one can sing and something no acoustic instrument can produce!</p>
<p>This is a single, sinusoidal (sine-wave) vibration. Real voices and instruments produce a large number of different frequencies that overlap and combine with each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tuning fork? I guess it technically does have overtones, but they're all tiny in magnitude compared to the primary frequency...so...not sure how that fits in.</p></div>		</li>
