			<div class="markdown"><p>As a caveat, while 99.999% of pharmaceuticals and OTC pills do not &quot;spoil&quot;, there  have been cases in the past where certain antibiotics degrade and cause very severe issues. The case I'm remembering is expired tetracycline causing Fanconi syndrome (Kidney is unable to excrete acids into urine, causing blood to be too acidic). I've read some research looking into the expiration of other antibiotics and what the affect is, but it seems like tetracycline is the only clear cut case.</p>
<p>In theory though if you follow your doctor's instructions, it shouldn't be a concern even with antibiotics. You are only supposed to be prescribed an exact quantity of antibiotics and you are supposed to take the full 1-3 week supply that was prescribed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe the expiration date is a function of marketing more than science. Well... marketing that's taking advantage of a law that says medication has to have an expiration date. </p>
<p>I'm largely operating from an article on drug expiration from <a href="https://harvard.edu" target="_blank">harvard.edu</a> where this is the paragraph I'm working from the most...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drug-expiration-dates-do-they-mean-anything" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drug-expiration-dates-do-they-mean-anything" target="_blank">https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drug-expiration-dates-do-they-mean-anything</a></a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of what is known about drug expiration dates comes from a study conducted by the Food and Drug Administration at the request of the military. With a large and expensive stockpile of drugs, the military faced tossing out and replacing its drugs every few years. What they found from the study is 90% of more than 100 drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter, were perfectly good to use even 15 years after the expiration date. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's true that &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; is a thing. It's also true that if my head hurts, I'm going to take that ibuprofen regardless of how long its been up there. </p>
<p>As I read through the comments, I'm amazed at how many expert sounding opinions are contrary to this article and others I've read.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An expiration date is a guarantee that a medication is safe to use and it has to be proven by a drug stability test. A common practice is to store test samples in higher temperature and humidity which speeds up potential decay, yet it still requires about a year of storage (mandated by law). At the end of the process when the samples' chemical composition (among other things) is checked one last time, the length of time that they were stored for (accounting for the more demanding conditions) is used to calculate expiration dates. Storing those samples is technically demanding, there's many of them for a <em>single</em> medication and you need to provide constant, monitored conditions for the whole time for all of them. Multiply that by the number of different kinds of pills a company makes. And don't forget that even once approved drugs need to be controlled as well.</p>
<p>TL;DR It's not practical/economically wise to test medications for extended periods of time, i.e. 5 years+, and these tests are needed to be able to prove the expiration date guarantees that the drug is safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not surprised this is the case. In medicine and other areas where consequences can mean life or death, tolerances will be set very tightly, usually 4-6 standard deviations before failure occurs. They probably factor in the worst storage conditions as well because they don't have control once it's out of their hands. If testing shows medicine working to 2 or 3 standard deviations at 2 years, then they might reduce it to 1 year of shelf life for tighter tolerance control.</p>
<p>This is assuming they do any shelf life testing at all. If not, then it's really an exercise in SWAGing, which makes the date close to meaningless. I have several maintenance medicines and have ignored the dates for this very reason. None of my blood tests have indicated lack of efficacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least one study has shown most medication is still good even after 15 years past its expiration date. From what I understand its more of: This is the date that the drug manufacturer is willing to guarantee that the drug will still be 100% effective by.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that is true for <em>most</em> drugs, some drugs (e.g. tetracycline) actually become toxic a few years after expiration. </p>
<p>Unfortunately it makes the message a bit muddied. I agree that 99% of drugs can still be used after they are expired (and the expiration dates are practically a scam to get you to throw away perfectly good drugs and buy more), however it's also not 100% safe to always do that.</p></div>		</li>
