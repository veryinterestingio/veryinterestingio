<p>The sub 1% of people that have severe gluten intolerance can easily disappear in that number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother is a chef and while training he had to deal with what he describes lovingly as &quot;The downright stupidest customer ever.&quot;</p>
<p>He's overlapping with the front of house manager for training when he gets called over by a customer.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, this needs to be sent back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely, I'll call a waiter. As he comes over what is the issue with your meal and how can we make it right for you today?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This dish is high in gluten and I specifically told the server not to bring the courses with gluten to me!&quot; (Upscale place so customers don't decide everything they order, but instead pick one of a few things multiple times)</p>
<p>At this point, my brother realizes she is upset at her plate. The plate contains duck (or some similar non-chicken piece of bird meat, probably not eagle)  and sauteed veggies over rice. He tells the server to take the plate in the back and leave it on the counter for him in a minute and to get the chef ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Mam, I'm going to go back to the chef and ask him what went wrong between you ordering gluten-free, and this dish making its way out to you.&quot; At this point in the story, he claims that her dining partner realized what was going to happen and started looking embarrassed and apologetic.</p>
<p>Brother goes to the back, the head chef is dying of laughter, nobody is working at all, and everyone is waiting to see this next moment.</p>
<p>So brother brings back out the same plate, the only change is utensils removed from when it went back into the kitchen. &quot;Mam, the chef has asked me to inform you that duck is gluten-free.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young man, I am fully aware that duck is gluten-free as are these vegetables. The issue I have is with the gluten content of the rice served with the dish!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mam, rice is gluten-free and this establishment is not in the habit of adding any ingredients to dishes not specifically called for in the menu.&quot;</p>
<p>The stunned look on her face is the look of someone who has the mental gears shift without a clutch and everything breaks. Her partner gets up and goes to the bathroom. He gets back while she's still just staring at her plate having looked up only if rice is gluten-free. The head chef comes out later to check on tables and apparently it was the hardest table visit of his life not to burst out laughing on the dining floor.</p>
<p>Everyone in the back was laughing all night, the front of house had to cycle out the host twice because they couldn't hold it together. And starting the next day they proudly put Gluten-Free next to the rice dishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allergies and odd but harmless conditions most likely result from the fact that people would have otherwise died in infancy are now growing up and having kids off their own, so we're seeing the results of breeding what &quot;pure nature&quot; would have offed. We're basically doing to ourselves what we did to the pug dog: keeping known bad issues in the gene pool and breeding them over and over.</p>
<p>I don't mean that to sound disparaging. People should get full autonomy over their reproductive choices, whether that's to have kids or not. Genetically speaking, the result of that is that unhealthy people will pass on those genes. Hence we're now seeing explosions of weird stuff that we didn't have much record of before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And in the past many people did not have access to a large variety of foods. For example, an 18h century Swedish peasant would never have tasted a peanut, so he wouldn't have known that he was allergic.</p></div>		</li>
