			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they should change sides every 1-2 hours if possible. I've had to wake clients/patients up to get them to roll or have them put a pillow under one side when sitting. Pressure sores are no joke... Stage 4 pressure sores are the things of nightmares.</p>
<p>Edit: I am warning you guys, stop Googling this, you'll give yourself literal nightmares.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rolling patients over every hour was a huge chunk of my duties as a 2nd shift CNA. If people knew I was doing it, they mostly got crabby AF. But a lot of people were knocked out on meds, so I got good at rolling them without waking them up. The trick is to lift up a bit with the sheet, and lay a pillow under their shoulders and hips. One hour later, switch it to the other side. Next hour they lay flat. Also put pillows under the lower legs so the heels don't touch the bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent the night in the sleep clinic at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. I could swear I got at most 1 hour sleep. I was so conscious of the guy in the other room observing me. Turns out, I got 6 hours sleep. I also learned that most of us wake, on average, 20 times a night. Those who are nervous about it wake up more tired than those who are less anxious and allow themselves to gently fall back to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me all the time... I’ll wake up sure I was up for so much of the night, then check my Fitbit and see I got 6-7 hours of sleep. But distinctly remember a number of the times I was awake and since waking up in bed looks pretty similar every time I think they just blurred together into continuous time in my brain. Even though they were for sure not. </p>
<p>Moral of the story is I have hella anxiety about sleep lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are hospital beds or mattresses made specifically for this purpose. They rotate the patient for you. I would imagine they are pretty pricey and it’s important to know how to do it correctly yourself, but it would definitely be nice to have.</p></div>		</li>
