			<div class="markdown"><p>One's face is exposed at all times.  Skin on your face is incredibly tough.  It heals very quickly.  It has high blood flow.  It's skin turn-over rate is very fast.</p>
<p>You could drag your face in gravel and it will heal up in a couple days.  A skinned knee takes well over a week to heal.</p>
<p>It's just how we're built.  When you use a fractional resurfacing laser, you run much higher energies on a face than you would use on a chest treatment for example.  Chests are thin and weak.</p>
<p>Story related: My brother broke my nose and took all the skin off the right side of my nose and part of my cheek with a stick when we were scrapping around.  Huge scab.  I looked like a monster. He hit me on a Thursday, by Sunday the scab came off and underneath was fresh skin.  Acne is a tradeoff for the durability.</p>
<p>I'm glad I wear glasses.  I could have lost an eye if I didn't. To be fair, my weapon was a shovel handle so we were evenly matched.  His stick broke when I blocked it and the end piece is what hit me.  He didn't mean to hit me in the face.  In the end it was funny.  There was so much blood that he ran away thinking that I was going to kill him.  I had to yell at him, &quot;I'm not going to hurt you, I need a rag to stop the blood.&quot;  It worked out fine.</p>
<p>TLDR; Faces have high blood flow, heal fast, and are super tough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are the areas most directly exposed to sunlight during foraging, hunting, and other daytime activities, and so need extra protection from the damaging effects of that exposure. Moisturization and oils that can absorb some of the uv spectrum are the evolved adaptations we've inherited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting little tid bit of info I got from my dermatologist years back. In my late teens early 20’s I had a bit of acne. Interestingly it wasn’t on my face, but back and shoulders more. I said I had pimples on my back and he informed me that getting acne in a hair follicle is common but it isn’t “acne”, it’s an infection of the hair follicle, so it’s proper name is hair folliculitis. For all intents and purposes it’s acne, but it’s got it’s own name.</p></div>		</li>
