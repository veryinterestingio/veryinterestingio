			<div class="markdown"><p>As for the Neo-Keynesian school being the only one &quot;taught&quot; is due to the theory having moved forward with all the modern models and historical trends taken into account, and the basic theory being taught in into classes in order to understand where the theory has moved. In academia if you theory doesn't move in 50 years its no longer a theory it is a Law and in the &quot;soft sciences&quot; those are almost impossible, especially in a field like economics that is so driven by human choices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like most economists whose area of expertise is not History of Economic Thought, my knowledge of the matter is very much second-hand and fragmentary. But from what I gathered, some people who have read Keynes (say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Leijonhufvud" target="_blank">Leijonhufvud</a>) argue that NK is not so much the descendant of the Keynesian thought as a travesty of it. That wouldn't matter so much given that NK pretty much &quot;won&quot; regardless, but that means that there are (at least) two different  answers to OP's question: what NK would say, and what those other people would claim Keynes meant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would kibble a bit with the whole idea of they won. There are still a good number of post-Keynesians and the literature is still fairly robust, but I would agree that most of the young hot shots are NKs through and through. The real juice these days though is in the MMT and we shall see shortly how that all shakes out cause the world has pretty much decided to run the experiment at least in the US and its direct allies. I dont know for a fact that the Reserve Currency can handle it, but I'm fairly certain it can, the true question is can the rest of the G7?</p></div>		</li>
