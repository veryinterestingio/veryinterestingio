			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely the best response, I’ve thought of a dopamine detox as sort of UN-training yourself from craving “toxic” stimulation and being satisfied with it. I am currently on a water fast, and my main reason and focus during it is to reset my mindset toward food and health. I’ve been in a cycle of having good intentions and then when I get stressed or have a long work day or a good workout “rewarding” myself with Tacos or buffalo wings in excess. The first two days it was really hard I kept thinking about how “good” some junk food would taste. I have to remind my brain over and over that instant gratification in this area feels good briefly but is not actually good. I would use the word detox loosely for what I’m implementing, as far as psychologically ridding my brain (via perpetual redirection and replacement) of the toxic views I have about food and rewarding myself, there are physical benefits to a water fast as well, including detoxifying organs and ketosis. To fast dopamine in the way I hear the phrase used most frequently could be better put as fasting whatever stimuli you have trained your brain to crave and receive as pleasurable and entertaining or rewarding, in order to reset the thinking that leads you to believe you feel best when on Facebook or when watching porn or eating fast food.. it’s more of a reset. I gave up social media, porn, energy drinks, smoking/drugs a year ago and I didn’t think I would be happy or satisfied without those things but it got overwhelming trying to constantly have or do all this stuff that wasn’t good for me.. so once I stopped these things, my mindset started to refresh and at this point I don’t miss these things and I like life even better without any of the slavery that comes from me being nagged by obsession or addiction to using things outside myself to feel better. I feel happy doing simple things without needing that overload anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good plan to reset your outlook on food, I found that eating functionally for gym gains where I stopped eating sugar made everything taste so much sweeter. That essentially kickstarted me getting into appreciating a way larger swathe of foods because I wasn't just going straight to chocolate or rich carbs. More water is always great :D</p>
<p>It's less a suppression of your want for instant stuff and more a technique to subvert your NEED to have them so much in the first place. Get that brain to be more self sufficient instead of relying on the next chicken wing/porn vid/bowl of weed, whatever your vice(s) is/are. Good for you though man, it's a great feeling to know things are actually better than they were</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s way better If this all had happened a year and a half ago I would likely be lying around chubby, wicked depressed, and drinking myself to sleep. Instead I’m working from home everyday, and “treating myself” by watching a bunch of good anime, and listening to some great classic audiobooks while I paint. Huge transformation. I’m even doing my hair and makeup... for myself...
Yeah, the self sufficient brain is definitely a keeper.. also, the way you word everything is better. Haha.</p></div>		</li>
