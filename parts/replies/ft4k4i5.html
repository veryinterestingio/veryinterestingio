			<div class="markdown"><p>Humanity as a whole started with a dark skin to combat the sun. The skin colour <strong>development</strong> is a Vitamin D issue. Inuits have darker skin even though they live in frozen Greenland because they get plenty of Vitamins D. European's deficiency of the Vitamin caused them to lose the melanin to absorb more sunlight and generate more Vitamin.</p>
<p>Fun fact. Vitamin D levels in black people are usually low enough to be considered deficient for white people, but since their bodies manage it much more efficiently, it's just normal for them.</p></div>		</li>
