			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually a great question that I’ve never thought about! Obviously there is a theoretical limit (you can’t fit an infinite number of of cells in your body), but whether there’s a practical limit is a question I don’t think anyone has asked, and which may not really be possible to answer.</p>
<p>Keep in mind we’ve got about 600 lymph nodes in the body, plus the spleen, the tonsils, and all the spots where lymphocytes could hide in other organs. Also it sounds dumb, but remember how tiny cells are—the normal amount of white blood cells in circulating blood is about 11 million per <em>milliltre</em>. So...capacity isn’t really an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know for sure but it looks there is actually a practical limit.</p>
<p>It has been found out that old people that have been heavily exposed to EBV virus - a very widespread virus that does nothing most of the times but that can lead to mononucleosis or even blood cancer in a minority of cases - are more susceptible to infectious diseases.</p>
<p>This could be caused by the fact that the constant stimulation of anti-EBV cells increases their population, while aging decreases the general immune cells population. Ultimately this leads to a slower response to other pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a theoretical issue, but probably not a practical one for humans. </p>
<p>Each time the immune system encounters an antigen, the T and B cells specific for that antigen first expand (double rapidly), and then contract (die off rapidly), leaving far more than the original number but fewer than the peak number. The final count of memory lymphocytes may be tens of thousands or millions of times higher than the starting count. </p>
<p>That’s not sustainable, considering that you’re exposed to millions of antigens throughout your life. Eventually, your blood and spleen and lymph nodes would be choked with lymphocytes. </p>
<p>But the immune system has a mechanism for roughly counting memory lymphocytes, and wants them to not get too numerous. So as new lymphocytes are added to the memory system, old memory lymphocytes are gradually weeded out. It’s not a clean last-in-first-out system but that’s roughly how it ends up working out. If you haven’t been exposed to an antigen for 50 years, you may well still have memory lymphocytes for it, but not nearly as many as you did 45 or 25 years ago. </p>
<p>This does have implications for the nature of immunity in elderly people, but many other factors also alter elderly immune systems, so it’s not the only thing to worry about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have watched a number of documentaries that have discussed the possibility that the recording of antibodies may be what some of the 'junk' dna that occupies much of the human genetic code may be for.</p>
<p>If correct, even in part, this may imply some upper limit, assuming the aspect that would transcode the sequences into our dna still functions. But, effectively, I don't imagine there is any kind of practical limit, given the size of the cells we're talking about.</p></div>		</li>
