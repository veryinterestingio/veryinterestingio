			<div class="markdown"><p>The exception is when you pierce the corporate veil.  That is you start treating the corporate money as your own money.  If you have the corporation spend its money on your personal expenses, if you give your mother a job where she doesn't actually do anything, if you borrow money from the till, if you drive a company car for personal reasons (and dont declare that as part of your income) then you lose the protections of a corporation.  This is actually pretty common in small companies that want the benefits of a corporation but dont understand properly the requriement to stay seperate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot speak for piercing the veil in U.S law, but I feel it appropriate to describe the nature of piercing or lifting the corporate veil for the sake of comprehensiveness to those who are interested.</p>
<p>Note that the following is within UK law, but the concepts are shared with other common law jurisdictions:</p>
<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The corporate veil, is the idea that a company has a &quot;separate legal personality&quot; to that of its owners/directors. Salomon v Salomon [1896] is the landmark case recognising this.</p>
</li>
<li>This is important, because it means that if you set up a company, and it runs up debts, the creditors of that company cannot chase after your for your money.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Is this a good thing?</strong></p>
<p>Historically, in economic terms: Yes. This encourages entrepreneurs to take greater risks which has led to innovation and economic success. The success of cities like New York and London can be partly attributed to the concept, these jurisdictions were among the first to develop a body of corporate law respecting corporate identity.</p>
<p><strong>Is it fair?</strong></p>
<p>It can quite simply be viewed as an exercise in risk shifting. The entrepreneur, and investors of a company know how much money they risk: whatever they put in, whilst creditors now have to deal with the fact that when they deal with a company, they cannot expect to go after the owner of the company if the company enters bankruptcy. </p>
<p><strong>3. But can't this be abused?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it can. A recent example is the landmark case of Prest v Petrodel. In short: There was a married couple. The man, throughout most of the marriage, kept his money not in his own bank accounts, but in the accounts of companies. These companies were technically not owned by him (iirc by his brother, some foreign shell companies, etc). So when the couple divorced, the wife couldn't claim after the money in those companies, since &quot;technically&quot;, he didn't owned those assets, those companies did.</p>
<p>This was a clear case of abuse because these weren't legitimate business, and as a director of these companies he basically used the money as his own.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Supreme Court decided that you could only &quot;pierce the veil&quot;, i.e view the assets of a company as synonymous to a director if that director had an existing obligation to not use his money in a certain way, and tried to avoid it by putting it in a company.</p>
<p>The relevant paragraph is reproduced below [Emphasis added]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>I conclude that there is a limited principle of English law which applies when a person is under an existing legal obligation or liability or subject to an existing legal restriction which he deliberately evades or whose enforcement he deliberately frustrates by interposing a company under his control</em>. The court may then <em>pierce the corporate veil for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of depriving the company or its controller of the advantage</em> that they would otherwise have obtained by the company's separate legal personality. <em>The principle is properly described as a limited one</em>, because in almost every case where the test is satisfied, the facts will in practice disclose a legal relationship between the company and its controller which will make it unnecessary to pierce the corporate veil. Like Munby J in Ben Hashem, I consider that if it is not necessary to pierce the corporate veil, it is not appropriate to do so, because on that footing there is no public policy imperative which justifies that course. I therefore disagree with the Court of Appeal in VTB Capital who suggested otherwise at para 79. For all of these reasons, the principle has been recognised far more often than it has been applied. But the recognition of a small residual category of cases where the abuse of the corporate veil to evade or frustrate the law can be addressed only by disregarding the legal personality of the company is, I believe, consistent with authority and with long-standing principles of legal policy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the court chose not to pierce the veil, because the husband put the money in the companies long before the couple got divorced, so there was no &quot;existing&quot; obligation to not hide his money away.</p>
<p>Of course, Lord Sumption being the absolute beast that he is, held that the properties in question were held in constructive trust for the husband, so he was owner of all the things that the companies bought. (This may sound confusing, but its an irrelevent point; included it for completeness)</p>
<p><strong>4. So what you're saying is... it can be abused?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It was decided for the sake of public policy and to preserve the intention of parliament with corporate law, that the law can be used to truly seperate your assets like that. However in most cases, they recognised that it won't really be an issue getting money back from directors if they were being fraudulent or negligent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>.. Wouldn't that mean that all that stuff was &quot;his&quot;, and thus subject to the divorce proceedings?</p>
<p>That is, the judge in question effectively said &quot;no, you're doing it wrong, <em>this</em> is how you should keep people from cheating with corporations&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at an insurance company that sold Commercial Vehicle insurance on higher-risk sub-prime risks - too risky for other companies to want to cover - their actuarial tables were not for high-risk vehicles or drivers.</p>
<p>We used to get business owners who would have the corporation pay their insurance on a 'company car'.  The business owners had multiple DUIs etc. so the insurance would be quite high.  Naturally the 'company car' was driven all the time, but had a logo on it so it's a 'commercial vehicle'.</p>
<p>And of course the company paid for the car and the insurance.  It was 'garaged' at the owner's house, but hey, it's a 'commercial' vehicle.</p>
<p>Having a DUI could add 30+% to the premium.  Plus, the company charged more anyway since it was the sub-prime market.  The next stop after us was Assigned Risk pool - highly undesirable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that last part, this is why it's a good idea for any size business to consider incorporating. Most business owners aren't mega rich, and shit happens. You could get nailed with a frivolous lawsuit, or get sick and are not be able to work, or maybe the business just doesn't take off. Having creditors come in and seize your personal assets, such as your home or savings, would be absolutely devastating to a small business owner. </p>
<p>The downside is you get double dipped on taxes. Corporate taxes on profits, then income taxes on whatever salary you pay yourself. So it may not be fiscally ideal if you're just freelancing. Ideally you want to pay yourself as little as possible to keep your personal tax burden to a minimum, then reinvest the rest of the profits left back into the business. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is wrong.  Your salary is not considered part of the companies profits since it is an expense of the company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most businesses don't need to incorporate in the US, creating an LLC is just fine for most and offers all the protections one might need to firewall their personal assets from any business liabilities.</p>
<p>Also, wages are generally a business deduction. You can also pass profits through to your personal return, so you don't get taxed twice. You <em>do</em> have to pay the self employment tax, so you pay the employer and employee  payroll taxes but that's not what you were talking about.</p>
<p>And paying yourself as little as possible is sort of a thing in some respects, but it's a bit misleading. If your business had a profit of $10,000,000 you wouldn't take that all as wages but you also wouldn't pay yourself $35,000. You can't just draw from the business to pay personal bills, so your wages need to be realistic for what you need. This isn't a scenario like Amazon where Jeff Bezos can pay himself $1 because he really gets paid in stock, so his income/wealth is dependent upon how well the company performs and his income stems from capital gains. Your average business can't operate like this.</p></div>		</li>
