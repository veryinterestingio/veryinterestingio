			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that orientation isn't incredibly important in terms of obstruction, in that gravitational lensing would ensure a similar view from any angle and the accretion disk wouldn't block our sight.  In fact, the apparent shape of the black hole (spherical) and its size helps to experimentally confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity (the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, even when space-time is curved like around a black hole).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the jet being pointed near us may help make it bright enough to distinguish information from noise, which may be even more crucial for the algorithmic approach than normal astronomic methods.  To get any data you need a galaxy that is both radio-loud (radio waves detectable from Earth) and radio-transparent (radio waves aren't blocked by interstellar media).  Messier 87 is both.  The third largest angular-size black hole at the center of galaxy NGC 1277 was large enough to view but was radio-quiet.</p>
<p>A more important feature of Messier 87 may be the period at which it brightened and dimmed.  That cycle lasts roughly a week for Messier 87, which allowed the team of astronomers 5 days to gather information.  Our galaxy on the other hand has a period of hours, which would require more algorithmic work to account for changes in the cycle.</p></div>		</li>
