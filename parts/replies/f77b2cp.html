			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why I didn't consider that a mutated roach doesn't pass down 100% of its genotypes. Didn't know that microbes could trade DNA, so thanks for that. I wish I could kill 99.9% of them. They're so small and can anywhere in the kitchen, so they can always reproduce. You're absolutely right to say that roach sex sucks. I saw it with my own eyes yesterday. A male and female were moving up the wall with their butts attached, so I saw them and brought out the candle and burned the to <em>death</em>. I also like burying them in wax. It's effective and it's impossible for the to escape once they're buried. I think I've become obsessed with killing them this way. I've noticed that I smile a lot when I spot a roach. They all really do deserve to die. I will gladly spray them. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you have &quot;german&quot; roaches that will eat and live on anything. I have seen them eating the bearing grease on a fridge motor. Best of luck. Btw they will live in your clothes and anywhere they can fit</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been recommending this stuff for years and haven't had one person come back and say it didn't work.  Here's my old reddit.poat about it explaining how well it works:
