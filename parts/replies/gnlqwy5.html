			<div class="markdown"><p>Up north there are plenty of homes using oil instead of gas, but electric is very rare (and expensive).</p>
<p>Heat pumps and resistive heat really are used mostly in places that don't get that cold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m converting my house from oil to gas later this year and am pretty happy to be getting off oil. Although many people in cold climates also have heat pumps. You just can’t solely rely on them since you need another heat source for really cold weather.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Converting from Oil to Gas is the right thing to do. I've done 3 conversions now including one where we needed to bring has in from the street.</p>
<p>It's cheaper, you don't have to worry about placing orders, no yearly maintenance, and you don't have a tank taking up space in your basement. Wins all around.</p>
<p>Make sure you empty your tank before the conversion though. They actually charge you for every gallon left in the tank when they take it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometime in the next year I'm getting propane installed in my house and am going to add a propane backup heat to my furnace. Right now its just heat pump and resistive backup. I just turned the heat pump off the other day when we looked to be staying under 10 degrees for the next couple weeks. Just an expensive noise maker at that point. Currently -25F out right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly know very little about heat pumps. They're not used up here and it must be because they aren't suitable in really cold environments.</p>
<p>Do you happen to know why?</p></div>		</li>
