			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the antelope pass the mirror test? I.e. do they recognize themselves in a mirror? (The test is usually done by painting something on their face and watching their reaction.)</p>
<p>I am fascinated by this because, reading the responses, it seems that many of the animals wouldnâ€™t. They would just be kicking animals out of the herd based on what they think <em>they</em> looked like.</p>
<p>Would albinos react similarly meanly to other albinos?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test#Animals_that_have_passed" target="_blank">It's more than that</a>: some dolphins, whales, primates, elephants, birds, ants (!), and fish. However, the mirror test doesn't necessarily mean that much: it might not imply self-awareness, and species that fail might be able to recognize themselves through other means, such as olfaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not all species out-right reject albino specimens, many will have trouble finding a receptive mate.</p>
<p>Apparently squirrels are more accepting though.
I was able to witness this first-hand on a middle school trip to D.C. in which my classmates and I spotted an albino squirrel frolicking along with normal pigmented squirrels at Arlington Cemetery.  </p>
<p>Once everyone was looking, we discovered that the male albino squirrel was actually chasing down a mate and appeared to be quite successful in his endeavor. </p>
<p>It really does vary a lot by species with prey vs. predator and herd/pack vs. solitary roles playing a big part.</p></div>		</li>
