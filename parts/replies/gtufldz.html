			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. A good example of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Sea" target="_blank">Salton Sea</a> which was an old lake bed which was artificially filled and managed to be sustained for a few decades. But with insufficient flow from natural sources, once artificial sources began to decrease, the lake began to shrink. Now, environmental projects are needed to contain the fallout of the ecological collapse that occurred as the lake dried up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural lakes are just low lying areas, so even when a lake does dry up, it can eventually be replenished by rainwater. There are other factors like climate change and droughts, but under normal circumstances even isolated lakes tend to keep pretty much the same level of water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if no water comes in, the lake eventually dries up</p>

<p>In interesting exception to this is the Dead Sea. Despite the Jordan River for all intents and purposes, because of damns and farming , has been cut off from replenishing it.  No other sources of water are currently replenishing it. The Dead Sea has evaporated greatly in the last few decades, but there's hope yet. Found this quote in this <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-middle-east-36477284" target="_blank">BBC article</a></p>
<p>&quot;The science of saltiness and saturation means that the Dead Sea will eventually reach a point of equilibrium where it will stop shrinking. In simple terms, the amount of water in the sea's briny cocktail and the amount of evaporated moisture in the air above it would reach a kind of balance.</p>
<p>And the Dead Sea has another trick up its sleeve too - it is prone to a certain level of evaporation for example but it's also hygroscopic, which means it is capable of absorbing water from the atmosphere around it. It's almost as though this endangered natural treasure has a kind of in-built safety mechanism.&quot;</p>
