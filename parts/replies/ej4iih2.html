			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is asking about other users specifically, though. If you're sitting in a library and your friend texts you about where they hid the body, it's incredibly unlikely that someone else connected to the same cell tower is able to sniff the air and read your text message.  </p>
<p>Verizon, however, is very likely to have a copy of that text, know you were in the library when you received it, and all kinds of other fun stuff.</p>
<p>So the real answer probably depends on who exactly OP is afraid of.</p></div>		</li>
