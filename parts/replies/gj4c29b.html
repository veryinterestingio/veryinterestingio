<p>A lot of vaccine hesitancy I've seen seems to stem from distrust of the government and large corporations, recognizing their putting of personal financial gain over the best interest of the people.  With this dynamic so strikingly clear in today's world, how can one trust that the vaccine was formulated and is being distributed in a way that supports the general public?</p>

<p>Great thought. People absolutely are distrustful of large faceless governments and corporations. That’s why you either need to give them a clear trustworthy face—like Fauci for example. Of course, not everyone believes in Fauci, and he is working for the federal government, so an alternative strategy is to make it more local. If your own doctor, or boss, or aldermen says to get the vaccine, I think that would have more weight. Leading by example also helps a lot. If there is a local community leader who gets the vaccine, it says a lot more than a faceless CDC recommendation.</p>
