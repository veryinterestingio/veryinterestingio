			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last point hits home with me. I work in a daycare and the one kid who is the absolute WORST to put down for naps sleeps in a rock n play at home ? needless to say she does not appreciate being put down in a still crib when she’s tired. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. That's a super common conflict between home and care... The child has been trained to use this one hypnotizing device to go down and hasn't built the skills necessary to put themselves to sleep. </p>
<p>I work in childcare as well and I can only recommend communicating with the family. Let them know that she's struggling at school and see if they can come up with any solutions, highlight the importance of consistency etc. Ultimately, it's their child and they have a right to continue putting her down like this... But I wonder if pointing out the differences between home and school might trigger a lightbulb moment for them.</p>
<p>Hang in there. Childcare is hard work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much! I do need to talk to them about it. I’m sure they’re willing to work with us, however their sleep is 100% more important than mine because I get to go home at night to a quiet house with no kids and they don’t. So I understand if they’re not ready to change things just yet. </p></div>		</li>
