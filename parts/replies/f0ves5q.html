			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so with the first bullet point, as the intensity of the light decreases, would this result in a gradual, or not so gradual, fading of the object that's reached the event horizon (from an onlookers perspective)?</p>
<p>I find the space-time event cone a useful concept to try and visualise these sorts of things. Is there a way you could explain why you wouldn't see everything speed up using this method? Only because it would help me understand it better. Or perhaps there's another way to visualise this particular concept that I've not been introduced to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a flashlight falling into the black hole rather than a human. As its time is slowed its battery will last longer than for your flashlight, but as it won't magically emit more energy (=light) with the same amount of power the only possible result would be that the light of the falling flashlight fades away with time slowing, still emitting the same amount of photons per charge but slower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that because light speed is a universal constant, the result of the above isn't fading, but instead redshift, as the light waves stretch. I know I'm probably wrong, but you know, question everything...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close to the event horizon the intensity is dropping exponentially. For a stellar mass black hole that means a timescale of less than a millisecond, and even for supermassive black holes we are only looking at hours.</p>

<p>You are falling in, the light is also falling in. There is not that much light that can catch up with you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard it said that for an especially massive black hole, you may not even notice that you’re passing the event horizon.  But surely at the point of passing over it, all directions around you would now point towards the singularity.  Wouldn’t that be incredibly obvious?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything in front of you will be black, because late can't escape from the singularity in that direction. But light from behind you can &quot;catch up&quot; to you, so the region of space behind you will still be visible. The closer to the singularity you get, the more space curves, and so the area in your cone of vision that has light will get smaller.</p>
<p>This is a continuous process. From outside the event horizon, the event horizon will look like a black circle while the rest of the universe provides light. As you get in closer, the circle gets larger. At the [Edit: photon sphere, at 1.5x the distance from the singularity as the event horizon] it should be exactly half of the sky, because light exactly to the side can orbit at this distance, and anything behind that still sends light to you. (Note then in practice, the dark region could look bigger than that, because light on the very border of the visible region would be redshifted to the point where you couldn't see it.) And as you continue in, the black hole consumes more and more of your vision, shrinking the region of visible space into a slowly smaller circle behind you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://sirxemic.github.io/Interstellar/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an idea of what it would look like to go into a black hole. The layout is based on interstellar, so go through the wormhole, then turn around to find the black hole. If you get up close to it then go into the black hole backwards you can see the rest of the universe shrink away as described. It can be a little tricky to get the angle right though what with the warping space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Light can only orbit at 1.5x the event horizon.  Below that, it spirals in.  The closer you get to the event horizon, the more &quot;up&quot; light has to be aimed to escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think for larger black holes you can cross the event horizon unharmed. After all the event horizon isn't an actual barrier as such, you can think of it as the black hole's shadow. For smaller black holes, the difference in gravity from your head to your feet at the event horizon is so great that you'd probably be spaghettified before fully crossing, but for larger black holes the gravity is relatively uniform as you pass the event horizon, so spaghettification wouldn't happen for a little while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But at the event horizon time dilation is so great that time stops (unless I'm misunderstanding how this works). If time stops at the event horizon then how does anything happen there? How does something fall through when time is frozen at that point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;black hole&quot; is just the radius at which anything moving at the speed of light cannot escape. The &quot;dense object&quot; is completely unknown physics. Mathematically by our current standard of understanding it's an infinitesimally small point of infinite density and zero volume aka &quot;a singularity&quot;. This violates all sorts of quantum physics though which is why people often say quantum mechanics and general relativity are incompatible when both applied to a black hole and shows a massive lack of understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PBS Space Time has an interesting video about how space and time switch roles inside the event horizon. The weirdest thing being in order for your clock to keep ticking you have to move towards the singularity. I don't really understand it entirely. But, strange things beyond light not being able to escape seem to happen at the event horizon. </p>
