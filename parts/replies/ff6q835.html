			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that this is the most correct answer.  People talking about thickness of skin or nerve endings in the hand and making crap up are just assuming that OP's presumption is correct.  There are many other parts of your body that you can stick in ice water without any significant bother - feet, knee caps, elbows, calves, forearms, etc.  When you think about those locations, the are all far away from the core, leading me to believe your premise is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes the most sense. My hands are always cold but the rest of me is fine, so even if I run my hands through even colder water, my body temperature doesn't seem to change. But if any other part of me gets cold water, my whole body is a shivering mess.</p></div>		</li>
