			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one virus 'species': <em>Rabies lyssavirus</em>. It itself has 7 genotypes. But, yes, there was a homologous recombination event centuries ago that led to it being able to bind to receptors in Carnivorans from bats. However, the receptors it binds to are fairly conserved and similar between groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC its because they fly. Flight takes alot of energy and pushes cellular energy production. This creates ATP and reactive oxygen. This oxygen can be good or bad and is used by the immune system to fight infections; It also causes oxidative stress and that damages DNA, but bats have a mutation that mitigates that and protects the DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While infection is possible the affinity for different subtypes of receptors vary by species and have different kinetics. Some subtypes of rabies more easily cross species.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5634495/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5634495/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothesis from the peanut gallery: as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3414554/" target="_blank">antibodies to rabies have been found in Peruvian indians</a> (a few of whom, it should be noted, have been vaccinated for rabies), perhaps the strain of rabies found in the vampire bats in that region might be less prone to infecting humans- yet are capable of inducing an antibody response, which may confer immunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In May of 2010, two communities (Truenococha and Santa Marta) reported to be at risk of vampire bat depredation were surveyed in the Province Datem del Marañón in the Loreto Department of Perú. Risk factors for bat exposure included age less than or equal to 25 years and owning animals that had been bitten by bats. Rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (rVNAs) were detected in 11% (7 of 63) of human sera tested. Rabies virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in the sera of three individuals, two of whom were also seropositive for rVNA. Rabies virus RNP IgM antibodies were detected in one respondent with no evidence of rVNA or RNP IgG antibodies. Because one respondent with positive rVNA results reported prior vaccination and 86% (six of seven) of rVNA-positive respondents reported being bitten by bats, these data suggest nonfatal exposure of persons to rabies virus, which is likely associated with vampire bat depredation.</p>
