			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies, but it can start as early as 50 yrs old.  There are meds that can be prescribed that help shrink the prostate, but some of the side effects are weird.  One is called &quot;retrograde ejaculation&quot; which means that while you come, the semen travels backwards into your body as opposed to shooting a load out of your cock.</p>
<p>I realize to some this may read as if I am trolling, but Google it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The guy below me said as early as 50, but 50 is more like the average age.  It can starts as early as mid 30s, more commonly mid 40s.  I'm almost 42 and I pre more often than I used to.  Doctor says it's not abnormal for my age.</p></div>		</li>
