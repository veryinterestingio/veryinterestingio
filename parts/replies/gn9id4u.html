			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemistry doesn't solve the energy density problem.  Yeah it's pedantic, but important because no, batteries are not going to get more powerful the way Rayon irons so much better than Nylon.  Or you could use corn or crude oil to produce transparent air-tight wrapping material.  Obviously Chemistry remains critical but no, it's not a new application for the same old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>We know how to turn normal fuel like oil, petrol, gas, alcohol etc into electricity: you put it in an engine and then set fire to it, then use the heat and pressure generated by the burning to move things like pistons or turbines around. This principle is how power stations and petrol generators etc work.</p>
<p>There is also a lesser known industrial process called the Fischer-Tropsch process that works in reverse: by putting energy in, liquid fuels chemically similar to gasoline/oil etc can be made from syngas. It requires a huge industrial chemical plant and input of lots of electricity.</p>
<p>So we can turn liquid fuel into electricity, and we can turn electricity back into liquid fuel. If we could miniaturize this process and do it purely chemically (rather than having to use a spinning turbine blade), there's a world where we can have very, very high energy density 'batteries' containing alcohol or similar flammable compounds.</p>
<p>Even if the process doesn't work both ways (i.e. the batteries aren't rechargable), just having very light batteries is huge for electric vehicles, and these batteries could be manufactured using renewable electricity sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to burn the fuel to get energy though. It would produce carbon-dioxide and water inside the battery even if this was possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Burn is the wrong word. Ideally, there wouldn't be too much heat made- same as a metal based battery. Burning a battery is not the same thing as discharging a battery.</p>
<p>You would get carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide and water inside the fuel cell as a waste product. If it was a rechargable fuel cell, when you recharged the battery, this would be transformed back into liquid fuel. </p>
<p>If it was a single use battery then this would be disposed of: but the net carbon released could be zero if the industrial process involved with making the battery was carbon negative e.g. biomass to alcohol, or some kind of fisher tropsch process powered by renewable electricity</p></div>		</li>
