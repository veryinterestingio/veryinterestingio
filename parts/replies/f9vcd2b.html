			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not a huge risk in most cases. Generally, the more powerful bullet with an identical diameter will not chamber in the lower powered firearm because the casing is too long. For example, I have a .380 auto which is identical in caliber to a 9mm, but the 9x19 is longer and will not fit in the chamber of my .380.  </p>
<p>Edit: The exceptions are typically 7.62 NATO vs .308 Winchester, 5.56 NATO vs .223 Remington, and .38 special vs .357 magnum. Either of any pair will chamber in the other’s firearm, but the power varies and it isn’t necessarily safe to fire one out of the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only one of these that I have direct experience with is the 5.56 vs. .223. Turns out, you should not fire 5.56 in your .223 unless you have a .223 Wilde. 5.56 actually has a slightly different necking on the round and will create a higher pressure in the chamber over a .223. This can cause your bolt to fail. (did this, on an old mini-14)</p>
<p>Almost all modern .223 rifles can fire 5.56 without issue, however if the firearm specifies &quot;.223 only&quot; don't shoot 5.56 out of it.</p>
<p>Edit. I guess that the pressure is actually due more to the load than the necking. But the necking works into the problem somehow.</p>
<p>second edit: it's Wylde not wilde.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nomenclature is actually pretty standard. Pretty much any ammunition you buy comes labeled with diameter (the caliber), length/chamber (designated, for example as x33 or by a name like Rem or Wylde), weight of the bullet (grain) and load (if applicable, like Express or Magnum). People just refer to the bullets by caliber as a shorthand, because with any amount of context you can tell which specific bullet someone is referring to. </p>
<p>And anyways, even if none of the nomenclature were standardized, it wouldn't matter. If the words on the gun don't match the words on the bullet, the bullet doesn't go in the gun. If someone is dumb enough to mess that up, standardized nomenclature isn't going to help them lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are standards, reloading manuals are filled with the correct measurements, amount of powder to use, etc. there are organizations that decide these things, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Arms_and_Ammunition_Manufacturers%27_Institute" target="_blank">SAAMI</a></p></div>		</li>
