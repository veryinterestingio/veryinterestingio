<p>Iâ€™m not even sure why Iâ€™m still subscribed to this sub. People just make up shit that sounds plausible if you donâ€™t really know much about a topic. Usually someone with expertise pops in and clears things up, but why do so many people just bullshit an answer? Whatâ€™s the point of that? The last thing we need is a cesspool if misinformation for people trying to learn things. Why donâ€™t people just let someone who knows the answer answer the questions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that must be it? Better than than intentionally misinforming people. I guess itâ€™s the Dunning-Kruger effect where people donâ€™t know they donâ€™t know. I feel like I know when I donâ€™t know something, and even if I think I know I double check! ðŸ˜„</p></div>		</li>

<p>Welcome to /r/explainlikeimfive </p>
<p>People come here to pretend to be smart by making ad hoc claims about every subject, regardless of how true it is. /r/science is the place to go for real questions to be answered.</p></div>		</li>
