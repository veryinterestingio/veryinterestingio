<p>social media and A/B testing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something I think about a lot because it boils down to what methodologies work best to understand effective messaging for vaccine uptake.</p>
<p>Actually, my main answer is a bit boring. Looking at the countries that have a high vaccine uptake is a good test in itself. Having a well-organised health system where immunisation services work well, is often the best health messaging to encourage people to take up vaccination. This is funding, resources, and having immunisation as a government priority. If all this doesn’t work well then people are confused or they don't trust in the government and the services provided by healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Quite specific public health messaging is often used, for example, to raise awareness about new vaccines or ones that are having a low uptake. It is a trickier methodological question to assess what health messages work in this scenario. These might be small scale studies in an experimental setting, sometimes online or inviting participants into a ‘lab’. There have been a number of social media and A/B testing studies via different social media platforms and online. The problem here is whether you can extrapolate what you learn from controlled testing to whole populations. Perhaps what is more useful is targeting a particular group you would like to influence and doing some testing on them (but if you already know they are a group that is not that keen on vaccination then they already may be very difficult to engage). Other messaging might be tried through large-scale public health campaigns based on evaluating what worked with previous campaigns or using what is known from related literature in public health communication, psychology, sociology, behavioural science etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have the medication market down to a science with commercials, so vaccines shouldn’t be any different, with those vocal minorities kept in check. But we don’t.</p>
<p>So comparing to countries that have better vaccines rates, in relation to messaging, sort of glosses over our issues in my opinion.</p>
<p>And my apologies if I’m sounding argumentative, I just feel like we’re not talking about the elephant in the room, Hollywood bad actors as well as how terrible the news has become, like how they shared Desiree Jennings story on repeat for weeks, but barely covered the fallout when she was shown to be making it all up intentionally or not.</p>
<p>Unless the government starts spending more money than the airtime those fake campaigns get, there really is no testing that will be effective sadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with vaccines isn't people being uneducated about how they work. The anti-vaxxers I've met will come up with all sorts of counter arguments but only because they won't say what their real motives are. What they actually want is for all children to get vaccinated except for their own. That way their kids are safe and don't need to get poked with needles.</p></div>		</li>
