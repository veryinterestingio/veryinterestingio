			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the thing to understand is that there is a big conceptual difference between “nothing” and “zero.” Between saying “I don’t own goats.” And saying “I own 0 goats.” People were obviously aware that if they had 4 goats and 4 goats died that they no longer had goats. But they would not express their lack of goats as a number that had mathematical properties.</p>
<p>For example: Do you have 7 groups of 0 goats? Or do you have 10 groups of 0 goats. Of maybe you have 0 groups of 7 goats? The idea that these things might not be total nonsense is not obvious.</p>
<p>What does it mean to sleep for 0 seconds? Doesn’t that just mean you didn’t sleep? Why would you say you slept for an amount of time when you didn’t sleep?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Three hours in and zero jokes about Wales.  Which TIL is not the same thing as no jokes about Wales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Greeks, at least Archimedes, used infinity and infinitesimals (numbers which are infinitely close to zero) which I would say also lack a physical representation before they started to use zero as a number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Archimedes' use of infinitesimals is vastly exaggerated. He used the method of exhaustion as an intuitive aid before he turned to what he considered to be a more rigorous proof. He (and other Greeks) thought infinity and infinitesimals were confused, loosey-goosey concepts. Modern (standard) analysis does the same, which is why it relies on the epsilon-delta definition of limits. Carl Boyer's History of Calculus has more information, if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true. Zero is in every day life the by far most useful number without an obvious physical representation, but I do not know enough about the history of mathematics to say why zero as a number was groundbreaking when it was new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also can't make algebra until you figure out zero is a number. Even today people make that mistake when making digital numerical representation. Look up 1st binary complement. </p></div>		</li>
