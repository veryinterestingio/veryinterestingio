			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;There's a big cottonwood branch in my parking lot. Maybe a couple...&quot;</p>
<p>Actually there's a row of 16 30&quot; dbh cottonwoods topped 20 years ago for safety's sake - now they're hollow and disintegrating but with just enough strength in the lower branches to catch all the upper ones as they lose support. </p>
<p>Wrote a pretty economical quote with five figures to take them away - but landlord just depends on her tenants car insurance to cover the damage. We won't touch it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We bailed out of a 7' bdh Griffin poplar that the customer wanted <em>a 30% crown reduction</em> on because all the topping cuts that were obviously made at the top of a bucket truck reach were hollow.  The tree was a good 30'  above that topping cut. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. All the pear orchards I saw in Japan were very carefully pruned not to go above five feet, the branch layer basically being a two dimensional circle outwards.<br />
I guess my question is, can you prevent that rot with enough care, or all those pear trees going to need to be replaced in a few years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's done with small pruning cuts next to branch forks that heal over - these trees were simply cut in half. About a twelve inch diameter cut. </p>
<p>Paints and coatings are no longer recommended - they don't stay sealed for long and don't really help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rot is hyperbole, it’s not an inherent consequence.</p>
<p>Any wounding of a tree exposed the wood to disease and pests. Tree limbs have a significant protective barrier at their joint that effectively prevents disease from spreading to the parent branch. However if you lop a branch you’re exposing a significant portion of vulnerable wood, and giving any potential diseases a great base to invade the rest of the tree.</p>
<p>Additionally, lopping tree limbs results in ‘epicormic’ growths, which are weakly attached and very fast growing branches that head straight up in an effort to replace the lost foliage.</p>
<p>These growths can eventually grow to be strongly attached, given time. However most people who have lopped a tree once will lop the epicormics too. Not a good idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine you could at least do something to help. When taking tree cuttings, you're supposed to clean the exposed ends with antiseptic. Maybe after cutting, treat with antiseptic then cover the cut with tree resin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My whole neighborhood (built about 15 years ago) is filled with cheap and/or ignorant homeowners who can't be bothered to take care of their trees. It's almost funny. The trees on the street side of the sidewalks street are managed by the City, so they're nicely pruned on a regular basis and are well on their way to becoming strong mature trees. But every single tree in someone's front yard is either a tangled mess of watersprouts and crossing/competing branches, or it has been topped (or some particularly unfortunate trees were topped and then became overgrown again...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there's a lot of those streets.  Developers tend to fill new neighborhoods with whatever is available, but usually sprouts are a sign of stress.  I live in a city that is a 4 on the plant hardiness and is typically dry.  Very often the problem of trees here is that people don't water them.</p></div>		</li>
