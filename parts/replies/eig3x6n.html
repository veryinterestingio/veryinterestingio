			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, this is what caused a series of Fujitsu hard drives to self destruct a decade or so ago.  One of the ICs had a defective plastic case and the chip corroded internally, rendering the drives useless. There was a recall (that I didn't know about until it was too late) and a family member lost a bunch of pictures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Back up your files people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Had all of my source code stored local and on an external SSD, changed OS, so one of my copies was out, plugged in the good ol external and everything was corrupt. Lost a good 6 WIP projects. Now use git and a droplet to store backups of anything I &quot;need&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too add onto this, even a rudimentary backup solution like cloud storage is waaaaaay better than nothing. Plus there are pretty generous free tiers so there's no reason not to.</p>
<p>I've lost 3 old HDDs within the past 3 weeks, but thankfully it's not an issue for me since I have all my stuff safely backed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flip side is that data recovery on SSDs is almost non existent, while data recovery on spinning drives is usually pretty reliable.</p></div>		</li>
