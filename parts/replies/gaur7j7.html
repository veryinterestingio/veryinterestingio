			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there’s a lot of truth to this. At first a song is a song, it’s just one big piece of excitement and emotion. It’s usually when I start to know the structure and the lyrics of a song, I get bored of it. So once I learn to play a song, it’s over for me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figure it's the same as when you keep saying the same word over and over until it loses it's meaning and you're all &quot;what <em>is</em> this word?!&quot;  But if you stop thinking about it, the word goes back to being what it normally is.</p>
<p>If you pay too much attention to <em>anything</em>, your brain gets into this &quot;over it&quot; mode and no longer wants to pay attention to that thing.  But if you give it a break and come back to it later, your brain will engage again.</p>
<p>I totally get what you (and OP) mean about getting bored of a song if I hear it too often, which is why I use randomized playlists (based on stars and last played date) to keep my music in flux every time I sync.  I find that as long as there are a few songs I haven't heard in a while in the mix, my brain doesn't get so easily bored of the ones I want to hear more frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this (in a non-musician way) recently with the song Blinding Lights.  I caught it on the radio and kept on wondering why it made me think of 80s songs.  I rationed my listening (because I will binge songs to death) to once or twice every few days - and on about the 10th go round I realized that the first bit of drums/cymbal before the melody kicks in is the same beat and sound as the beginning of Take On Me.</p>
<p>Now, with the mystery solved, I can still enjoy the song without feeling obsessed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's synthwave which was heavily used in the 80s. Stranger things capitalized on it to help set the mood of their show.</p>
<p>Check out Foreigner - Waiting for a girl. Pretty much the same high pitched lead synth fill</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes was used a lot, a whole lot, in the 80s - we used to call it &quot;the drum machine&quot; in high school (yes, I'm old).  It's just that Blinding Lights uses it at the same speed as Take On Me and that's what had my older brain going huh?</p>
<p>I'm not a professional musician, but I played flute in school for 6 years and dabbled in piano for a few years too, so I am usually good at catching beat, melody, and pitch in songs.  When the music industry started getting into sampling a  lot (early 2000's I think?), it used to drive me crazy trying to figure out what song the samples were taken from, lol.</p></div>		</li>
