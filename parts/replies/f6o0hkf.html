			<div class="markdown"><p>All I have to say here is the battery degradation is negligible. You will most likely replace your phone before your battery is actually that low on charge.</p>
<p>The bigger one that will kill your battery is leaving it dead at 0%. Don’t leave it dead for long periods at 0. If you’re using it everyday, leaving it at 100 charging is fine, only if you wanna store it long term you can make is 80 the store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like I have posted about charging, the same thing applies to discharge. When the phone says battery is at 10% is actually at something like 20%.</p>
<p>Most of the advice in this thread is only relevant if you are dealing with nicads or other older battery tech. The software on phones is designed to prevent the destruction of the battery on both ends.</p></div>		</li>
