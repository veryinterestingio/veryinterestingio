			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's pretty weird how I remembered everything except the 2 seconds before impact. Obviously my brain didn't shut down before it got hit but I don't remember the impact itself. I roll down the hill but didn't even know I did until I woke up at the bottom of it. I don't know how long I was out but was very peaceful and waking up wasn't on my agenda. I would say the rapid change of location of my brain from one part of my head to the other must have sent shockwaves through it it or something.</p></div>		</li>
