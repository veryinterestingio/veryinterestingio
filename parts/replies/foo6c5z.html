<p>When you squint, your eyelids cover partially your pupils. Your eyelids become like a pupil, they reduce the amount of light coming in.</p>
<p>The pupil itself stays the same size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't. Our peripheral vision is really bad. But our brains either ignores those details or fills them with what could be said &quot;best guess&quot;. Also we constantly look around so those guesses get better.</p>
<p>Btw fun trick you can all try. We all have binoculars built into our hands. Make tiniest hole with index finger and base of your thumb. Just small enough you can barely see through it. You can see small objects pretty clearly very far away.</p></div>		</li>
