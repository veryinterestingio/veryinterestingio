			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently, the Greenland Ice Sheet is shrinking due to two main processes: both an increase in surface melt and increased draining of ice through flowing glaciers at the edge. Our research showed that even if we would return to cooler years when there was less surface melt, glaciers now consistently drain more ice at the edge than can be gained through “healthy” years of surface snow accumulation. This means that the ice sheet will continue to lose mass every year (or about 99/100 years based on current estimates). While persistent mass loss is very likely, mitigating rates of atmospheric warming can really impact the rate of melt. More gradual melt is much easier to manage and plan for than unmitigated, rapid rates of change!</p>
