			<div class="markdown"><p>well, i was intending this to read in conjunction with the other responses with more detailed answers. that is to say, i wanted to portray both clefs and keys as different solutions to the same range problem, but didn‚Äôt really elaborate on what made string instruments choose the former and wind instruments the latter because the other responses already gave p clear explanations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is likely the main reason.</p>
<p>For anyone not following, when you read music on a piano, you have 2 &quot;clefs&quot;.  Bass clef and treble clef.</p>
<p>Bass is everything below and up to middle C, treble is everything above and sometimes including middle C.</p>
<p>If you are playing another instrument, you generally only get one clef.  This is for simplicity.  Since the instrument has a limited range, the &quot;inventor&quot; will choose the proper clef that the majority of the notes fall into and use the &quot;key&quot; to fine tune things, basically.</p>
<p>If you are playing say, trombone (key of C), you get a bass clef.  So middle C is hanging above the clef and has a single stroke to denote that it is &quot;middle C&quot;.  D would have a note sitting &quot;on&quot; that stroke&quot; and E would have 2 strokes, one thru the note and one below.  This convention carries on and on.  It also applies for notes &quot;below&quot; the chosen clef.</p>
<p>After a while, say 4-5 strokes above / below, it just gets confusing.  Instead of being able to instantly tell what you are seeing you have to start counting and that's just hard.</p>
<p>So if an instrument has a 'general range' of 12-15ish notes that 80% of what it plays will fit into, and the center of that range is a &quot;concert B4&quot;, it will likely be in the &quot;key of C&quot; and read music on the treble clef.</p>
<p>My specific knowledge stops at trombone, bit of trumpet and piano.  So I cannot really elaborate on Alto clef, sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like they should just write a number for the transposition instead of a set of strokes. I presume they note full octave transpositions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I may not have been clear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.allaboutmusictheory.com/musical-staff/learn-read-bass-clef-notes/" target="_blank">Take a look here</a></p>
<p>As you can see if you have an arpeggio from F3 to F4 it's quite simple to easily figure it out.  Same with C4 to A4, but if it's just a random F3 then an B4 then C3 (or whatever) it can be difficult to &quot;instantly&quot; read.  And if your music is all in the treble clef but hanging below constantly and you never get really in to the main part of the treble clef, guess what...  You are in the wrong key or wrong clef.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a neat trick when I played tuba in high school. A lot of what we played was rearranged music. It just so happened that the baritone sax and I frequently had similar tracks and thanks to a quirk of keys I could read her music and if I pretended it was bass clef in my key signature it all just worked.*</p>
<p>*A lot of my parts were written below the staff, because tuba. Hers were an on the staff, so it was easier for me to read someone else's music in a different key AND clef than my own.</p></div>		</li>
