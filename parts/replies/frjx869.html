			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems weird. If you don't change either the weight or the volume of a solution, you have not altered it's density, right?</p>
<p>Did your project control for different heights of water in the glass when measuring pitch changes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes we did track that and the change of height is too small to explain the pitch change
I was a bit inaccurate when saying only density, but the reason is still that the presence of microbubbles changes the speed of the sound inside the mixture
The effect is called &quot;allasonic effect&quot; or &quot;hot chocolate effect&quot; and is documented in scientific literature such as this</p>
<p>Frank S. Crawford, « The hot chocolate effect », American Journal of Physics, vol. 50, n 5,‎ may 1982, p. 398-404 (DOI 10.1119/1.13080).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to consider a liquids ability to act as a solvent. When you put salt into a cup of water, the water level doesn’t change when the salt is absorbed. Just like salt, air is absolute, but because of bouyancy exerts less downward force which isn’t mass, but...close enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question, how can the refraction of the water density affect the overall frequency rather than the relative speed through the medium? </p>
<p>I'm familiar with the refraction of sound through water as slowing down the speed rather than the frequency, so I'm trying to make sense of how the changes in density could affect the pitch but it eludes me.</p>
<p>I've got a background in sound engineering so no need to ELI5, go as detailed as you like and I'll try to keep up :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I have been re-reading stuff and I found that density is not appropriate, my bad. The main thing is that you introduce compressible bubbles into an incompressible medium, which dramatically reduces the speed of sound inside it.
I edited my comment with more info, check it out, and sorry for the lack of precision on my first answer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said that the exact same effect can be observed by pouring hot water from the tap in a glass. When I say pipes I refer to the pipes that carry the water from the heating system of your house to the tap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, maybe you want to replace this:
“...pouring hot water in a glass Inside the pipes,...”
with this:
“...pouring hot water in a glass. Inside the pipes,...”</p>
<p>because without that period you sentence makes zero sense</p></div>		</li>
