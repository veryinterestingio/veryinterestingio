			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup I am having this exact problem now.  To keep a long story short...Building near the beach Remodel, stucco tear down. Insurance job.  Houses were leaking bc of poor practice.  Solution: rebuild with super waterproof systems, overbuild the exterior.  Moisture condensing on the ceilings bc the house is now a submarine.  Moisture from beach air precipitates in, doesn't flow out quick enough.  Homeowners have dewy ceilings.  New clusterfuck</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This same sort of thing happened in the 70s and early 80s during what they called the energy crisis. A shit ton of old Turn of the century era houses, were built on piers, just about 2 or 3 feet of ground. With no insulation or anything.  people switched to gas heat from coal and in the 70s all fuel prices skyrocketed. So a lot of people added bricks between the pillars to keep the wind from blowing under the house as badly as it was. without adding and venting or vapor barrier. </p>
<p>Within ten to twenty years, thousands of houses that were sound for a century or more started rotting. The floors caving in and beams in crawlspace a rotting. I have a house that was built in 65 with fairly modern crawl space. Vapor barrier and good vents with a French drain around perimeter of foundation and the framing in crawl still looks brand new. </p>
<p>I have been remodeling old houses in Georgia for about 20 years and it still amazes me how intricate the balance of these elements is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These days we do soil analysis to see if there is potential for soil heave and detail damp-proofing or sub-floor ventilation accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should of been up in the northeast at that point, when spray foam contractors managed to destroy a lot of beautiful old homes. They would drill the stud bays from outside, and foam the wall cavities. Many of these homes had beautiful wooden siding cut from ancient trees. They had paint jobs that previously held up great for two decades, or more. The foam created a vapor barrier right behind the siding, moisture was trapped between the exterior paint layer and the foam. The siding rotted, the sheathing rotted, and repainting was sometimes failing in months. It helped created a mentality in the region that owning a painted house was a never ending horror show. Weatherizing similar homes by trying to caulk  and seal them to the point of being airtight, often had similar disastrous  impacts on the exterior paint,  and most people slapped vinyl siding over everything to hide the mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rented an older house someone had just bought as an investment. Seemed like it was kept nicely enough. But within a couple days it was clear it was impossible to keep the walls from getting covered in moisture ever single night - like morning dew on grass. I tried dessicant, cranking the heaters, wiping down walls and windows every morning and opening it up during the day, didn't matter. mold started growing on walls and wood furniture. Had to use cleaner on the bathroom ceiling weekly. couldn't handle.</p>
<p>Not sure what exactly the problem was or if the previous owner had just painted over black mold. But as unavoidable as it seemed I imagine the owner had some major refitting to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to fully seal the exterior and not the interior, and have an appropriate HVAC system would that solve the issue with moisture not being able to escape the walls? I imagine the issues are occurring more frequently with houses that are completely sealed on the exterior as well as the interior walls.</p>
<p>I'm seriously considering passive houses for the future and I'm not sure if that issue is prevalent or if it has been dealt with successfully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a vapor barrier on the outside wall you get condensation in the winter on the inside surface of that cold plastic. It is sheetrock, vapor barrier, insulation, siding, in that order. (insulation/energy comp)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to continue that answer: This varies by climate.</p>
<p>In colder climates, you have to worry about condensation from warm interior air hitting cold vapor barrier in winter.</p>
<p>In warmer climates, you have to worry about condensation from warm <em>exterior</em> air hitting cold vapor barrier in summer, because the interior is air conditioned.</p>
<p>So the plastic goes on one side of the insulation in cold climates, and on the opposite side in warm climates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What zone do you build in? If it's humid I imagine you are building in the south (though we get humid summers in the north too). If that is the case I believe you are putting your vapor barrier on the wrong side. If your wrb is not air tight then vapor will pass through your wall assembly and condense on the interior of the wall. </p>

<p>Also air leakage will cause more moisture movement than vapor diffusion ever will. Air tight homes are necessarily the culprit, since an airtight home can still be vapor permeable. In my region we I see more builders switching to &quot;smart&quot; vapor barriers that have a variable perm rating depending on the relative humidity to allow drying.</p></div>		</li>
