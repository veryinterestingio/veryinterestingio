			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for such a detailed explanation!</p>
<p>I'm currently watching blindspot and (in case you haven't watched it) the girl has her memory erased, but can still speak languages she used to know and has tons of fighting technique which sticked to her &quot;new&quot; self. She does have flashbacks of autobiographical memories (did I say that right?), - is that possible in real life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible. If you get amnesia, you don't just forget how to speak English, or whatever languages you know.  It's similar with music, and dancing, and other physical movements. They're stored in very different parts of the brain.  You know these things, but you may not know *why* you know them.</p>
<p>However, Blindspot is just fiction. Much like Dollhouse, or Total Recall, or other TV shows &amp; movies that deal with intentionally-induced amnesia.  It just makes for a handy plot device.  Typically people with actual amnesia have other serious issues.  You can't just be a super-spy who kicks ass and has no physical side-effects all day.  If your brain was that damaged that you can't remember who you are, usually other parts of the brain are fucked up too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool! Just artistic licence though. It's interesting to know that minus the flashbacks this could actually happen to someone.</p>
