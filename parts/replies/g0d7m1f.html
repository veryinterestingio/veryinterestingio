			<div class="markdown"><p>The two points aren’t mutually exclusive though. Demand will grow when the market expectation is that a companies cash flows will grow in the future. Does that mean that the market is always rational? No, of course not. And Tesla is probably in a bubble right now because a DCF couldn’t justify its insane valuation. However, both statements can simultaneously be true. The markets value of Tesla is forward-looking and positive and thus more people are willing to pay more to own a piece of the equity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and now have the capacity and demand to sell a ton of high profit margin Teslas.</p>

<p>Just to point out...  For every car that Tesla makes - Honda makes 60 (and Toyota makes more than 30).  </p>
<p>Tesla doesn't really have very much capacity (comparatively).</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's only going to be one OS maybe 2 for autonomous vehicles that dominates the market (just like the iOS and Android).</p>
<p>Tesla is the closest to the finish line and once they do, they will be the most valuable company in the world. Literally changes the world like how the iPhone did.</p>
<p>Imagine all cars in the US and most part of the world using Teslas OS for autonomous driving.</p></div>		</li>
