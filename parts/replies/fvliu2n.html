			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say this is the right answer. Inverse kinematics is a relatively new technique but allows games that use it to have character body parts actually touch things, such as climbing a ladder without just having a stock climb animation, or characters of differing sizes/heights shaking hands accurately. If the calculations go wrong somewhere, the results can look hilarious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No doubt. I thought it was super neat once I realized what the f this &quot;inverse kinematics setting&quot; was in the Unity engine while developing a game but I opted not to use it (and in the end opted not to even use the Unity engine).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Worked in games for 15 years. ELI5 version is characters are made up of points in 3D space in the “box” of the game, and the rendering engine loses the start and end points of where to draw or connect shapes. Also related to why you see characters in T pose in strange loading situations. T pose is generally the “starting point” where the animation engine knows where everything is on the character before assigning physics and animation commands</p></div>		</li>
