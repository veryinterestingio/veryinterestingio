			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a guy who accidentally inhaled the filter of his cigarette and thought he coughed it out as lost it. He had slight lung pain afterwards but thought it was just because of smoking until one day a few months later we were hanging out and having bongs and he choked hard, coughed up a weird loogey only to find it was the jet black, mucous covered filter that he had inhaled a few months earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done this.</p>
<p>I used to roll my own and I would hold the filter in my teeth while I rolled the cigarette.</p>
<p>One day someone made me laugh while I was doing it and I inhaled the filter.</p>
<p>I guess my filters were a bit chunkier than your friends though as I instantly couldn't breath. </p>
<p>Everyone just stared at me as I desperately gasped for air pounded myself on the chest trying to dislodge it. I guess no one really made the connection with choking on something as we weren't eating or drinking. </p>
<p>It must have flow about 10 feet when I eventually managed to shift it.</p>
<p>Was absolutely terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was choking on popcorn one time, literally could not breathe, went down on my hands and knees after gesturing wildly and pounding on my own chest. I shoved my hand as far as I could in my mouth and it opened my airway enough to shoot out. My boyfriend at the time just stared at me, didn't even ask if I was alright. I cried.</p>
<p>It's fascinating how many people don't know what choking looks like and I'm fairly sure it's how I'm going to die since I accidentally inhale my spit at least once a day.ðŸ˜…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, tobacco in my country is so fuckin expensive, most people use the absolute slimmest ones we can find. Ultra Super slims and slow burning papers.</p>
<p>I inhaled a few filters in my day but thankfully none made it to my lungs and would get stuck to my throat instead. If one had gone on there though I'm not sure I would have known about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on the above post about cilia; when you smoke, the cilia in your airway are inhibited, resulting in an increased risk of airway related complications (such as your friendâ€™s filter not being moved out of the airway faster). This is the physiological reason smokers (of any substance) have an increased risk of developing respiratory issues.</p></div>		</li>
