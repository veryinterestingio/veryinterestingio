			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it looks like the whole thing sucks.you go from nice and cosy in the dark with the soothing noises, to being painfully squished for hours to come out into a world that's cold, way too bright and loud, full of smells and sensations. No wonder the poor things scream so much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some babies even get broken bones during birth. I feel real bad for those guys. Although I can say, for healthy babies, there is a shit ton of hormones going on for mother and baby. The baby usually stop crying just as or shortly after being given to mama. My first didn't even cry. He cooed. Like wtf dude, did you notice what just happened to you?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't actually answer your question about what it feels like, and being ventilated with liquid might not feel the same as how babies go from not breathing to breathing, but it seemed relavent?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My second was born very quickly and was spitting up fluid for a couple of days after. Doc said it was because she spent so little time in the birth canal and didn't get most of it squeezed out, like you described. She was fine, we just had to watch out to make sure she didn't have too much trouble with getting it out, i.e. not turning blue when she was coughing and gagging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment is interesting but c-section babies don't get squeezed in the birth canal. Wouldn't they All have this problem?  Not saying you are wrong, but I  have never heard of this before. Guess I  will have to do some research.</p></div>		</li>

My husband and I had no idea about this with our first and we freaked out when our son sounded like he was choking and all this thick fluid was coming out of his mouth.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someday in a distant future mom here: I am so worried about this. There are SO many possibilities of a baby just randomly dying at night.. I can't even imagine sleeping in a different room than my baby until they are able to actually move by themselves.
How did you get over this fear? Does it just stop?</p></div>		</li>

So much anxiety, every time she'd make a sound at night you bet I was right there, checking to make sure she wasn't choking. I didn't sleep more than a few hours straight for months.</p></div>		</li>

She choked on it in the middle of the night on day 2 and I basically didn’t sleep the rest of that night. It was terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My second baby was a quick delivery but he was big, and the midwives got me to go super slow - I think it saved my bacon. I had never realised before that it helps squish fluid out too!</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are up to several hours, but after that the co2 is an issue. The current theory is adding a direct vascular tap to a vein to scrub the co2 directly</p></div>		</li>
