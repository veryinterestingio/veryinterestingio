			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've always been wondering about this. In a high Earth orbit where most of these materials are, assuming we're outside the atmosphere, what induces the drag? Is it random ice, rock, and dust particles, is it something else? Just really been stumped on this one.</p>
<p>Or better yet, are you still barely &quot;touching&quot; the atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the wrong way to think about atmosphere; there isn’t a circle you can draw and say “inside this circle is the atmosphere.”</p>
<p>Atmosphere is more like food dye in a bowl of water. Over time the dye spreads out, but if you’re looking at it shortly after the dye is dropped in you see areas where the dye is high concentrated and areas where there isn’t much dye at all. This is called a <em>gradient</em> which more or less means that the concentration varies across space.</p>
<p>Atmosphere is also a gradient, with higher concentrations closer to the earth and lower concentrations further away. There’s a lot less air at 40,000 mi up (high earth orbit), but there is still some. In fact, there is even low concentrations of atmosphere as far out as the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK. Makes a lot of sense. Always thought of it as a spherical encasing before this. Astonishing that traces have been detected on the moon though!</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's this one. Like the person you replied to said, there's no definite boundary where you're &quot;outside&quot; the atmosphere. It just becomes very very thin.</p></div>		</li>
