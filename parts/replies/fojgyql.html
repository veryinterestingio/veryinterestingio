			<div class="markdown"><p>Each FM broadcast channel can transmit its main analog audio. Plus: RDS, 2 different HD channels, traffic info (which some portable GPS devices use), and still have bandwidth for additional services. </p>
<p>When the FCC allocated the FM broadcast band/channels long ago, they never gave much though to what the future may bring.  We are out of frequencies now for the entire RF band. </p>
<p>Even worse was the analog TV spectrum!  3 separate “chunks” of the spectrum from for 83 TV channels. Each TV channel took slightly 4.5MHZ of bandwidth!  If you look at an old analog TV, the UHF dial went to channel 83. The FCC took TV channels 70-83 away from the TV broadcasters around 1980 and gave it to the analog cellular phones and business and police. That’s why current tv’s only go to channel 69. Around the same time, the FCC took away channels 13,14,15 in a few major cities like Chicago, LA, NYC and gave it to the police and business folks. </p>
<p>The FCC has been fixing their mistakes made long ago, and it’s not been an easy fix.</p></div>		</li>
