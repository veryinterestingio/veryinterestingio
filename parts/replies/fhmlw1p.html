			<div class="markdown"><p>Heroin is a hell of a drug. Plus, the user might have Hepatitus-C or AIDs. If you keep the needle, you can be arrested during a search for possession of illegal drug paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Its an odd combination of a total lack of concern for their own health, and &quot;some&quot; concern over others who might find the needle...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some drunks are completely aware that they are trashing their life.</p>
<p>Some of those same drunks will only get drunk with others, so they donâ€™t have to drink alone.</p>
<p>Some of those drunks will absolutely tell younger people to stay off the sauce because of how dangerous it is. They will do this, mean every word with every fiber in their being, and then go get plastered two hours later.</p>
<p>I was this person.</p>
<p>The idea of a junkie destroying needles to somehow protect others sounds weird, but I get it.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>leaves needles on the ground where others will step on them</li>
<li>marks them as unsafe so others won't try to use them</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only say from personal experience but the ones that actually care about safety collect their own needles (either the whole thing or remove the tip from the syringe and take it with them) the ones leaving behind needles, especially ones with the needle bent, are always the ones that are the biggest assholes and exactly the kind of person that delights at the fact that someone else has to clean up their biohazard mess. I have no doubt that the ones I deal with bend the needle specifically to make it more dangerous for clean up. They will even leave the orange cap right next to it like a taunt that they could have easily capped it but fuck whoever has to clean up their mess.</p></div>		</li>
