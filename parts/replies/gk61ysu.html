			<div class="markdown"><p>There are A LOT of very well established correlations to what type of sonar military vessels are using, and whale beaching. You have to understand that things like the Blue Whale are able to communicate almost halfway across the world with how intense their sounds are. This is how they all keep a tab on each other... </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the military also likes the idea of deep penetrating sonar... A few fires of these trapping a whale between them and the coast, has been shown to cause them to change directions. When they do long tests of this tech, it either confuses them or outright causes them to want to escape the sonar sound at any cost possible. Maybe it's maddening to them, who knows. </p>
<p>But the once quiet ocean is now very loud for whales, and military grade sonar is the loudest. And again, we have plenty of documented evidence of this. As such, now the US military is required to be deep at sea before testing certain sonar technology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can’t imagine how whales, which I assume have some really good hearing, deal with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That applies to specific whale species primarily however and even to the specific design of the sonar pulse used, with other whale species being well known to beach often and in large numbers well before the rise of military sonar. </p>
<p>Military grade sonar is also far from the loudest. That belongs to underwater explosions and subsurface mapping piston charges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People should keep in mind that it’s not especially common as well, it’s selection bias. Sea mammals navigates shores successfully all the fucking time, beaching is super rare.</p>
<p>Imagine if for some reason all motor vehicles were completely invisible to you except the ones that have crashed. It would be mind boggling why so many cars are swerving off road... their tires work, their brakes work, why are people just crashing their cars into thing?</p>
<p>^(regrettably I caught and fixed this typo:
Why are people just crashing their cars into thongs?)</p></div>		</li>
