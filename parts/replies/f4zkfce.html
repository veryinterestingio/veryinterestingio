			<div class="markdown"><p>The pupil is just a hole that can change size to admit more or less light. It does not focus light on its own. That is what the lens does. The lens sits behind the pupil and is curved so that light refracts (bends) as it passes through it.</p>
<p>The size of the pupil does have an effect on the focusing, however, in that it changes the &quot;depth of field&quot; which is the range of distances that are can be correctly focused at once. A pinhole camera is an extreme example of this where the aperture is so small that no lens is even needed, however the amount of light admitted is so small that this is usually not a practical approach. This is why both cameras and eyes have lenses.</p>
<p>Squinting has a couple of effects on vision. It can change the shape of the eye a little, which can help to correct focusing errors. It also further restricts the amount of light coming in which extends the depth of field.</p></div>		</li>
