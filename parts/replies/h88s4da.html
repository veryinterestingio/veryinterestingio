<p>viral particles will get caught in mucus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are there locations exposed that do not need to pass through a mucous membrane to infect? Eyes, olfactory, come to mind, though I'm not sure which locations are primarily exposed.</p>
<p>One of the primary symptoms I remember is a dry cough, so does mucus content go down as a result of the infection?</p>
<p>How does this flow differ from a vaccinated person? Let's say a vaccinated person is in a closed room with infected air for an extended duration, maybe like 9-5 office hours perhaps?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but it’s less likely. A respiratory infection is looking for a moist area with a thin and active membrane. This happens in your lungs where gas exchange takes place. It’s also why respiratory infections can’t go through your outer skin. The lungs also have macrophages secreted into the fluid lining since it’s so common for viruses to attack there.</p>
<p>A dry cough simply means that excess mucus production doesn’t happen to a large extent. Some viruses tend to cause a runny nose and large productions of mucus in the airway while others do not. It’s not so much this infection is lowering mucus production as it’s not necessarily raising it(though for some it will).  </p>
<p>A vaccinated person has antibodies (and B cells) that are primed to attack any infection that starts. For an unvaccinated person a sustained illness in your body has to do this from scratch which takes far longer. That allows the virus to replicate and enter new cells. Eventually the host will catch up and the immune system will attack the infection. In a vaccinated person that time is chopped off significantly and small infections are stopped before they get going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s evidence from animal studies that Covid vaccination induces protective antibodies and cells in the fluid that coats the lungs. </p>
<p>So, these could theoretically neutralise Covid at the first hurdle. We know from other diseases that similar findings is highly protective against the disease getting past your lung surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked a question here a while back about why, if the tissue damage during a viral infection is caused by the immune system, doesn't a vaccine cause the same amount of damage. My question was rejected because it &quot;wasn't based on scientific fact&quot; but your explanation about interferons was perfect. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
