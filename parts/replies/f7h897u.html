			<div class="markdown"><p>Physician here. I'll try to keep it short. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy aka broken heart syndrome is a transient cardiac event that's commonly triggered by intense emotional distress. The most widely accepted theory right now is the release of neurotransmitters belonging to the group catecholamines which act directly on the heart muscles to produce a temporary freezing/stunning effect and that leads to symptoms similar to a heart attack without the underlying pathology. Due to the stunning of the left ventricle, the blood builds up inside causing it to dilate and that makes it look like an octopus on imaging and hence the name. Most parameters remain within normal limits and can be ruled out by further evaluation and the condition itself being temporary, has excellent prognosis even without intervention.</p></div>		</li>
