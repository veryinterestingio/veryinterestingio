			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be added that quantum-mechanical methods (including but not limited to DFT) can give you bond distances as well (in addition to countless other properties, but I just wanted to note it's not solely for bond angles). These methods, especially DFT, have gotten quite good at predicting geometrical properties of molecules and extended systems. In fact, in many large structures where it's hard to get extremely high spatial resolution (e.g. enzymatic systems), DFT is often used to &quot;refine&quot; the experimentally determined structure to ensure that it is energetically realistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, totally.  It is quite a powerful tool. For example, I have used it to estimate packing distance and orientation between polymer chains.</p></div>		</li>
