			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, the big question is how does the transaction go through? </p>
<p>Ants don't generally have social security number, so access to organized banking sector is not an option. Therefore, you would obviously be dealing with hard currency. </p>
<p>However, ants, while good at forming unions, do not have the smarts to have good negotiation skills, so they get paid pennies on the dollar. </p>
<p>Now although ants are known to be able to carry weights 24x larger than their own, the coins are still too heavy, so this leads to the conclusion that you will be dealing with bit-coins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. Smoke is a nice-to-have but not really required.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not sure if someone with dark skin could get away with it.</p>
<p>And before someone gets triggered by that comment, large dark shapes are threatening to bees because natural honey thieves are usually in that category. Bears, skunks and raccoons to name a few.</p></div>		</li>
