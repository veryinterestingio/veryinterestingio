			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert but I would assume all bees are born male until fertilized. Clown fish do something similar.</p>
<p>All clownfish are male until they mate up and the dominant clown becomes female. In finding Nemo, dad would have turned female and gone to town on Nemo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is for most animals, but it doesn't have to bee (sorry). Female bees have all 32 chromosomes but drones just 16, without any recombination, just half of the queen's.</p>
<p>Edit: I found this double checking what I wrote! Seems interesting:</p>
<p>If there are two different alleles present, the bee will develop into a female, either a worker or a queen. If there is only one allele present, the bee will develop into a drone. There are two ways that only one allele may be present. The egg may be unfertilized, so that it only contains one allele, in which case it develops into a normal drone. But there is another way for only one allele to be present. That is if an egg is fertilized, but both mother and father happen to contribute the same sex allele. This fertilized egg will also develop into a drone. But this drone will be abnormal because it is diploid, it contains two sets of chromosomes and cannot function as a normal drone. These diploid drones are always destroyed by the workers, who eat them as soon as they hatch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also some species that are able to essentially clone themselves. Many lizards are able to lay eggs without a male around. There are some species that are all female and don't have any males at all, but in evolutionary history they don't usually last long due to the lack of gene mutations and able to adapt to a changing environment or a random event that would otherwise bottleneck a regular species. Then you have others which are able to lay eggs, but due to their chromosomes, they are only able to lay fertile males, all the others are infertile, so if a female becomes stranded alone on an island, she is essentially able to start a new population (but would have a lot of inbreeding until more immigrants arrive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a different system than what we are normally used to. The queen can decide whether she wants to fertilize an egg or not. If she does and lays it, it's a regular worker. If not, it's a drone. She mates once and carries the sperm with her for the rest of her life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was initially thought that there are some proteins in the royal jelly that changes the genetics of the bee feeding on it that turns it into the queen (epigenetic modification). However, there was a recent <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006946" target="_blank">study</a> that demonstrated that it may not be the protein components in the royal jelly that form the queen. They show that caste formation in honey bees may regulated by plant-derived small RNAs that are fed to workers that delay their development! It is really fascinating! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so all workers would develop to queen morphology in the absence of the plant-based rna?  Then what would the royal jelly do? Does a queen eat exclusively royal jelly to avoid the rna snippets?</p></div>		</li>
