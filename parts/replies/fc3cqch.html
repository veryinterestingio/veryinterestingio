			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're looking at ionic conductors, it only really matters what the net charge is of the ion.  For example silver iodide is the classic example of ionic conductors, and it's the positively charged silver ion that can readily diffuse in the alpha phase.  It's actually kind of cool, where the silver sublattice essentially melts at elevated temperatures and can flow through various sites within the BCC iodine lattice.  Fuel cells though typically rely on protons diffusing through the electrolyte to fully complete the circuit so you actually have charge balancing, so I wouldn't say it's uncommon even though fuel cells still use electrons through whatever circuit it's powering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broadly, proton batteries are much more unwieldy than electron batteries, because electrons can move freely through many metals and other materials we're familiar with, while protons, which are much bigger, need a liquid of some sort.</p>
<p>However electron batteries require materials that are financially and environmentally very costly to acquire, such as lithium, while proton batteries can run off water and some form of charcoal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it wouldn’t, a proton battery doesn’t uses protons in the same was as it does electrons.</p>
<p>It’s basically a solid state fuel cell in which hydrogen loses its electron to become a proton this is where your excess of electrons on the charged side of the battery comes from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They'd work too! I don't know of any attempts to use them in this way, though - probably because they can be fairly dangerous depending on how much energy they have.</p></div>		</li>
