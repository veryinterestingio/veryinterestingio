			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, yes, those are the some of features I was asking about. </p>
<p>The Tibesti uplift is now clear to me. There are smaller NE-SE striations across, for example, The <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eye+of+the+desert/@19.1769403,19.1709218,74458m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x1151a8b0e46d993d:0xe20bba655c9587c4!2sLake+Yoa!3b1!8m2!3d19.057621!4d20.5006901!3m4!1s0x115a9352d2500411:0xf85adcd00a388410!8m2!3d19.0930898!4d19.2490618" target="_blank">Eye of the Desert hiking area</a> which appears to be a much older outflow cone. The more I look at this, it is very complex interaction between underlying geology and weathering. </p>
<p>The wind map of the Saudi Peninsula exactly predicts (informs) the giant features there. </p>
<p>I now see the scope of my original question was hard to articulate. I was once smacked in the face with &quot;scale invariance&quot; when hiking on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lemmon" target="_blank">Mount Lemmon</a>. From a distance it stands like a monolithic sky-island but gets ever more complex as you twist your way into it. All that was for a feature only a fraction of the size of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emi_Koussi" target="_blank">Emi Koussi</a> which itself is an outcropping of the Tibesti range which is beside the larger feature that first caught my eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s plenty of those in the eastern Sahara too. Most of them have no names but they’re still very striking. Some are posited to be impact craters but since nobody’s really studied them it’s hard to say.</p>
<p>Definitely get what you mean about Lemmon! I spent a week living in the complex on that mountaintop a couple years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that it has anything to do with your original question, but tangentially related to weathering in the area is the reason why a desert is there in the first place: Earth-scale weather patterns called the Hadley Cell.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it's related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox" target="_blank">Coastline Paradox</a>, the fractal nature of some geological features - without broader context, you may be unable to tell from a (properly cropped and possibly tilt-shifted) photo if given geological feature is hundreds of meters in size, or centimeters, or anything in between. And if you find the one hundreds of meters in size and walk up close enough, you may find a very similar one as part of it, meters or less in size. </p>
<p>Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lemmon#/media/File:Mount_Lemmon_(35229949722\).jpg" target="_blank">this photo</a> from Mount Lemmon. Look at the outcropping to the right. Can you tell if the flat rock on top is small enough that someone could pick it up, or big enough to build a monastery on top of it? Or &quot;medium&quot;, capable of fitting a small group of people? If not for the road on the left providing a sense of scale, it would be a very difficult question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been to very remote parts of the interior of Mauritania and everywhere I went, there was almost no sand at all. It's all mostly flat soil with very small rocks strewn about. It's intensely desolate. Are you sure about your sand suggestion?</p>
<p>EDIT: After watching some videos, it appears there's a fuckload of sandy places. Very hard to describe how large that country is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth noting that there are some visible structures left by ancient glaciers in what’s now the Sahara too.  These are hundreds of millions of years old, so truly ancient, and from a time when the earth looked very different.</p>
<p>The discovery of these was one of the things that helped to greatly expand our understanding of past geologic and climate changes.</p>
