<p>There's one that was discovered recently (2016). There are a few other bacteria that can produce the enzyme capable of breaking down plastic, but it says this ones special because it eats that shit as it's main energy source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There probably where already microorganisms able to consume plastic way before humans even existed. </p>
<p>Plastic in the end is just mainly C and H in different shapes and proportions and maybe other elements like O, N... all organic chemistry in the end.</p>
<p>We really didn't invent plastic we just gave it shape and modified properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The specific chemicals used in modern plastic do not occur in nature. They were designed to be as resistant to degradation as possible, only breaking down physically over thousands of years. They were even designed to be resistant to chemical attack, which is how digestion is accomplished. It's really not comparable to natural polymers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The number of different bacteria that we donâ€™t have a record of probably outnumbers the ones that we do know about explicitly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Current estimates of how many distinct prokaryotes exist vary widely (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria#Classification_and_identification" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>, between 10^7 and 10^9 ), with fewer than 10,000 currently &quot;known&quot;.</p>
<p>So we're likely talking about several orders of magnitude more species that are unknown to science compared to what's known.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it makes sense, you could have a few different bacterial species that only live on one rock in one lake in one cave in the middle of nowhere.  Now multiply that by the earth.</p></div>		</li>
