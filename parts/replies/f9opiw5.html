			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating! What is the medulla, and what hair types contain It? And do you have any knowledge about why certain parts of the scalp might grey before others? For instance, the classic grey-at-the-temples look?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The medulla is present in very coarse hair types that are usually very dark, such as asian hair. It's like an additional inner core and makes it harder for lightener (hair bleach) to remove pigment from those hair types since there is another layer for the color / lightener to penetrate. Most people gray first in the front areas, and the nape is the last area to gray. There haven't been a lot of studies about why hair around the front tends to go gray faster though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correction! The melanocytes don't exactly die off but they stop producing pigment. I believe cells produce hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct and as we age our hair follicles get worse at getting rid of the peroxide, this combined with the melanocytes causes gray hair. The hydrogen peroxide is also why gray hair feels wiry and stiff, because it's almost like your hair is being bleached within the follicle.</p></div>		</li>
