			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm curious, are your variables in Cyrillic and your keywords in Latin?  Like</p>
<p>public Ингредиентный спам;</p>
<p>public Ингредиент яйцо;</p>
<p>public Рецепт завтрака = new Рецепт (спам, яйцо);</p>
<p>public int сервировки;</p>
<p>Or do you transliterate one or the other?  If you do both, do you have dual keyboards or macros or what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything in English, including comments. Modern development teams are distributed so it's crucial. Transliteration is not allowed to. I'd bet you find no difference between the code snipped make by Russian-speaking dev and English-speaking one, maybe due to some spelling errors of strange modal verbs usage in method names. And yes we do use a dual keyboard with Cyrillic letters and English as well. Something like this I'm using right now: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/f9PhKwf.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/f9PhKwf.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/f9PhKwf.jpg</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once working for a company that took over all PHP development for a another company, who previously had been working with a Russian team.<br />
We spent maybe 10 minutes looking through their old codebase, before deciding to just throw it all out and start from scratch.</p>
<p>All comments and function/variable names were in Russian...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have some code partially written in German in our company (luckily this is Austria, so we all speak it). There are more spelling mistakes in the German words than in the English ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, random question, but the Cyrillic part here, is it a standard keyboard layout? Specifically, with the inverted-L enter key?</p>
<p>If so, what is the name of this layout?</p></div>		</li>
