			<div class="markdown"><p>However, new generations of technology <em>do</em> make it easier to emulate the old hardware standards, since the newer hardware is more powerful and can eat the overhead of running the emulated code inside of the native code. This is why we've been able to get versions of, say Super Mario Bros. on every Nintendo console except the N64. Old NES games still print money and if a commercial NES emulator was available on the iPhone tomorrow people would buy the hell out of it.</p>
<p>Most of the emulation work for older consoles has been figured out by hobbyists, at least back to the PS1 generation. The two larger constraints for not getting backports, as I see them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Processor-specific stuff. The PS3's Cell processor, specificially, was notoriously difficult to build for and, consequently, re-build stuff for.</li>
<li>Intellectual Property restraints. Rights shift all over the place, and I'm guessing this is why, for instance, we're probably never seeing an X-Men Legends remaster. Who even has the rights? Activision? Fox? Raven?</li>
