			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s interesting. I get interesting chills/pleasurable sensations. Gives me goose bumps too I can see the hair on my arms stand up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get really passionate about certain music that makes me feel like this. It's really easy to forget that everyone doesn't have the same reactions to audio/visual input that I do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is just gamer nerd stuff, but if this song from Dragon Age: Inquisition doesn't give you goose bumps then you'll probably never experience it. Everytime I play this part of the game, my teenage daughter comes in the room and asks me to turn it up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Music at times gives me a physical reaction (goose bumps/tears without crying).</p>
<p>And while I lnow there is an emotional component some songs just outright make me cryl.  My daughter thinks it's annoying and weird.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't get enough of that strange, unexpected, fuzzy feeling I get listening to a tune. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I listen to a range of music types and I get strong emotional responses to different things so am same as you. I think for me a memory trigger is also associated with it. Just listening to Brian McKnight's most recent live performance album and his voice is just so incredible that combined with the memories it triggers, it gets a 30 something year old bearded man crying unexpected happy/sad tears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's incredibly sad that 50% of people don't feel this. This is the same thing as when some awesome happens in a movie right? If so does that mean if you don't get the chills in say for example, the surprise ending of The Usual Suspects, you'll never have your hairs stand on end in the &quot;Rain down&quot; section of Paranoid Android? </p></div>		</li>
