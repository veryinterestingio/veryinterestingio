			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess it is much like sleeping, as the reason one hemisphere stays in operating mode for the purpose of continuing to swim and breathe and perhaps keep a limited check on dangers, but I know of no research that has studied that for dolphins yet. As humans, we have our conscious and unconscious body actions that continue while we sleep and we do need a more full sleep for our brains and body recovery, or rather, the dolphins need to have more aware half sleep, so to speak, so stay alive as mammals living in a dangerous sea and a need to not drown as well as avoid attack. Perhaps other pod members help with that so they take turns sleeping and being on guard.</p></div>		</li>
