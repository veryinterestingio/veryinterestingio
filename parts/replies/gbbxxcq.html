			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are using the word &quot;series&quot; when you mean &quot;sequence.&quot; In math, a series is when things are added together. The number 0.9999.... can be written as the series from 1 to infinity of 9/10^n. Normally you would write that in sigma notation, but I don't know if you can do that with Reddit markup.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that this concept is hard to talk about is that defining and understanding what 0.999... really means requires the concept of a mathematical limit, which is a step into Calculus territory and definitely beyond ELI5.</p></div>		</li>
