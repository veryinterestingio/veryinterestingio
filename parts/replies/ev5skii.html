			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple different forms of &quot;polydactyly&quot; (extra fingers)</p>
<p>The type we are talking about is six fully functional fingers on each hand and is dominant, meaning it'll most likely be passed on to any kids.</p>
<p>Other types of polydactyly don't typically create fully functional fingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My son was born with 6 fingers on both hands but only the left one is fully functional. He’s only two but he definitely uses it to grip stuff. Should be interesting to see how he uses it in the future.  His “dangler” finger was fully formed just with no joint connecting it to the hand. Interestingly it didn’t grow at the same rate as the other one (it’s been removed now)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not that it isn’t desirable or isn’t beneficial, but for mutations to become predominant a bottleneck needs to occur where an individual possessing this trait is one of the founding members, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyl_cat" target="_blank">Ernest Hemingway’s cat</a> famously  had polydactyly, and now it’s descendants all prominently feature this trait. Also, how recent was this mutation, how many times has it occurred, etc are factors to consider in a genotypes spread in the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cat has this! I think she has 7 fingers (?) on one paw and eight on the other. We used to laugh about how mice and birds must be terrified of her because she could pick them up singlehandedly (literally - just wrap that paw around them and mess with them mobster style. We live on a farm so it’s her job to protect the cherry trees and grain from the little guys). One day we were eating dinner outside and she was around so we threw her a piece of chicken or something and she actually did pick it up with one paw and eat it out of it! Maybe that’s an evolutionary advantage?</p>
<p>Oh, and her name is Count Rugan, for those who enjoy the Princess Bride.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cat had the normal amount of fingers and he'd use his paws to pick up his food out of his bowl one piece at a time and bring it to his mouth to eat. I don't know if he did this whenever he felt too lazy to bend down or what.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For evolution to occur the trait would have to be either selected for or selected against, or an environmental occurrence would need to alter the ratio within a population. For example, [Ginger hair arising due to genetic drift]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair</a>), that’s a recessive trait but due to it’s ability to capitalize on less sunlight and produce more vitamin D, it was selected for, compared to say, attached or detached earlobes, which don’t appear to offer a benefit one way or the other, and their spread is therefore a little more random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.  Somehow we have done a horrible job of explaining basic evolutionary concepts to most people who are not evolutionary biologists (of which i am not). That said, it gets really difficult when it turns out that lots of stuff we were all taught isn't actually correct (e.g. Lamarck's second law was not as crazy as taught or that the Central Dogma is not inviolate). In any case, &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is catchy but has only every applied to the most excruciating of evolutionary bottlenecks. As a genetics professor once said &quot;death is the most highly evolved trait in life&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lamarck was close but confused causation and correlation; in either genetics or evolutionary biology we were told of a study wherein mice’s tales were <a href="https://www.discoveryworld.us/science/the-failure-of-the-great-mutation-experiment/" target="_blank">amputated for generations specifically to tests his theory,</a> if it had been correct the mice’s tails would have been expected to shorten due to acquisition of traits.
As far as survival of the fittest, human perception has colored what we believe to be fit. As long as an individual has reproduced it has done its genetic duty, and whatever occurs after is largely immaterial, thus why Huntington’s disease, cancer’s occurring later in life, Alzheimer’s, etc. aren’t strongly selected against, as they’re after child bearing/ rearing years. It’s complicated due to the uniqueness of human multi generational care-taking’s effect on fitness... anyway, it doesn’t help when a hefty chunk of the population refuses to accept scientific theories, or conflates theory with speculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counting in base 12 is known as the dozenal system as opposed to the decimal system. There are people which propose that we should be using the dozenal system because 12 divides into more numbers than 10. </p>
<p>Numberphile did an excellent video on exactly <a href="https://youtu.be/U6xJfP7-HCc" target="_blank">this</a> topic. </p>
<p>Also sidenote, you can still count in 12s on your hands even with 5 fingers. Each finger on your hand is split into three segments so you can count to 12 on each hand.</p></div>		</li>
