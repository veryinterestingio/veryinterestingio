			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently is not known exactly how the algorithm works. This is intented to avoid people gaming with the system to artificially inflate the search results. They still try though, it's called Search Engine Optimization and there's tons of money to be had in that field.</p>
<p>Google used to have an algorithm called PageRank that using some matrix math and such calculated which pages where more relevant according to how many pages linked to them. So people started creating pages that had many many links to the pages they wanted to get better rankings and as such appear first on search results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although it is not known exactly what the algorithm is, marketing companies such as the one I work for have spent many many man hours distilling it down to it's key components.  So we know how it works in terms of the factors that contribute to good/high-positioned search results, just not the actual programming or code itself.</p>
<p>Of the factors I will mention, there is weighted scoring that goes into each of these which actually changes based on a combination of dynamically changing/adjusting criteria which changes based on the scoring itself...basically, the scores even get scores!  This in order to better prioritize the criteria according to what is/is not relevant to  a given search.</p>
<p>Some major factors that contribute to a site being shown higher or lower in the results:</p>
<p>One of the first and most obvious factors of course is the relevance to your search.  This is matching system of tag words, key words, alternate spellings, alternate meanings, various combinations of the aofrementioned, etc.  Basically, how well does a given site's targeted/intended content (as it relates to your search) match the words you use in your query?</p>
<p>Site integrity.  Let's say that there is a site (Site X) that has a really good search score...in other words, whatever word matching happens, this site scores very high and is assessed to be &quot;extremely relevant&quot; to your search...however, the site is poorly maintained or has a history of going down, or is just unreliable in some other way...OR have others who have searched something similar found the information useful (How long are they on the site before they navigate away, for example).  Well, if Site X scores well on the search words, but is maintained poorly or is assessed to not be a reliable source of information for this particular search, it will get a low score in the &quot;site integrity&quot; area, and may not show as high in the search results as another site with better integrity, but perhaps a slightly lower word matching score.
(This is actually broken up into a few different broader categories, but just trying to keep things simple)</p>
<p>And then of course there is your own browsing history, settings that effect things like privacy or desirability to show adult content, your location, your region, culture, or social norms for the area you're in, etc.  All of this is taken into account, given scores, aggregated together, re scored based on score weights, prioritization, and a variety of other qualitative factors, and it all happens in less than a second!</p>
<p>Fun stuff!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Alternatively, if you use Chrome, you can do the following:</p>
<p>Exclude sites from your search engine:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Basics tab, click Advanced. </li>
<li>Under <strong>Sites to Search</strong> to expand the <strong>Sites to exclude</strong> section. </li>
<li>Click Add under <strong>Sites to exclude</strong>. </li>
<li>Enter the URL you want to exclude and select whether you want to include any pages that match or only that specific page.</li>
