			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s a bit of a false premise. Plenty of healthy things are immediately gratifying and habit forming. Exercise makes you feel good, not just in a year from now. Hydration and food make you feel good. Sleep makes you feel good. Social bonding makes you feel good. People are engaging in good stuff all the time but we take it for granted in a conversation like this, where the only “habits” we recognize are the bad ones. I have a habit of falling asleep around midnight and waking up at 7:30. It makes me feel good. It’s habitual. But it’s not a problem so I never think about it.</p></div>		</li>
