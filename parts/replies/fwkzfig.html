			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooo we’re practically enjoying the sweet taste of bee spit (do bees have saliva?) and flower nectar.
Also, what do bees do with the honey then?
Most importantly, WHY WASNT THIS EXPLAINED IN THE BEE MOVIE?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like bee vomit but yeah.  They eat it eventually.  Pollen provides fat and protein while honey provides carbohydrates.</p>
<p>In terms of how it's made, enzymes mix with nectar in their stomach and alter it, then they throw up the nectar/enzyme mix into the little cavities in the honeycomb, then they leave it to evaporate water so it wont go bad long term, then when its dry enough, they cap the cell off with wax for storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bee movie is an abomination.  Factually it’s so far from reality. And wtf is with the human/bee relationship?!?</p>
<p>Somethings that still bother me:
Most of the bees in the hive are female. Only a small fraction are male. The male bees do nothing but eat and mate. After mating once, the male bee will die. All males are kicked out of the hive for winter to preserve food, aka honey.</p>
<p>Bee keepers do NOT use nicotine in their smoke to make it addictive, as implied by that movie. Wtf.
Most bee keepers will do everything in their power to keep their bees happy and healthy. We love our bees.  Most hobby bee keepers don’t even collect honey.
The smoke is to calm the bees so they can be checked will fewer casualties.</p>
<p>This ends my unnecessary rant.</p>
<p>Edit:
My first rant and my first gold! It’s a good day. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And isn’t nicotine the basis for pesticides as it is highly toxic to insects? If that’s what the movie says, that makes zero sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean we're like, stealing their food? I mean, how efficient are bees? Do they make 'just enough' food to feed their young and themselves? Or are they like some kinda hyper producing manufacturing plant that can't turn off, and so they end up making way more honey than they'll ever consume..? (Allowing us to simply take their hard worked for food without them really noticing, or something..)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beekeeper checking in - honey provides carbohydrates, bee bread ( pollen + nectar + enzymes) is their source of protein/vitamins/minerals/amino acids. </p>
<p>Also bees do not eat much, if any, pollen directly. They eat bee bread (see above)</p></div>		</li>
