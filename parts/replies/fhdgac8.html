			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  </p>
<p>It is important that you draw a distinction between:</p>
<ul>
<li>the specific heat capacity of a substance: the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a certain mass by a certain amount</li>
<li>the specific latent heat of fusion: the amount of energy required for a substance to change between the solid and liquid phase <em>once it has already reached its melting point</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the temperature of a solid substance has increased enough to reach its melting point, its temperature will stop changing, and all energy input will be used to overcome electrostatic forces and bring about the phase change to liquid.  Once the phase change is complete, further heating will continue to raise the temperature.</p>
<p>You may find a graph like <a href="https://hi-static.z-dn.net/files/d7f/646709543c7a4f808413bfe8d354e3b3.png" target="_blank">this</a> helpful to visualise the way the temperature of the substance will change throughout this process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that's the enthalpy diagram then (since the enthalpy change is discontinuous at phase transitions). Just adding that there are different kinds of energy that one may show which are continuous, e.g. Gibbs energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that explanation showed that it required <em>less</em> energy to go from the melting point to liquid for iron than water, so I'm not sure how that part specifically is the key answer to OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that goes back to the black body radiation topic, though, from the original response. I went through the same gymnastics wondering why the numbers were so similar in absolute energy but forgot about the details of energy loss. If you take a iron ball and you hit it with a blowtorch, heating it up, one thing to remember is the air round it is <em>really freaking cold in comparison.</em> </p>
<p>Maintaining temperature against simple thermal transport is also a contributor.  Temperature change rate is proportional to the energy difference. THerefore the thermal decay and additional losses are very high which makes maintaining the high temperature very different. The difference between boiling water and ice is 100 degrees. the difference between the hot iron ball and hte surrounding air is 1700 degrees. This is a big difference and the hot ball in air will lose energy at a substantially higher rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have another point to add. Iron is about 8.6x more dense than ice so while your math is correct per gram many use the eyes and see a volume. So when adding density to the equation to equal “amount” iron requires almost a 10x the energy per volume</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metallic bonds are very strong, and in chemical bonds strong correlates to short. This means that they end up with their atoms more closely packed together than nonmetals. Another factor is that many common metals are relatively heavy elements due to having more protons and neutrons in their nucleus, whereas the most common nonmetals (carbon, silicon, sulfur) are relatively light elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things I'd like to point out, although they ultimately don't detract from the answer. First, the heat capacity of solids tends to zero as T approaches 0, so the energy required to bring the solid to its melting point is an overestimate. Second, the <em>molar</em> enthalpy of fusion of iron is actually <em>higher</em> than that of water: 13.81 kJ/mol compared to 6.01 kJ/mol. Again, I would like to emphasise that neither of these points undermine the basic premise of this answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes on the molarity point. A gram of iron is 1/55th of a Mol, so 13800/55 is ~250, which is where I got that fusion total.</p>
<p>Also that's awesome and I didn't know that about solids and very low temperatures though it makes perfect sense. I presume it works under the same principle as superconductivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a consequence of the Nernst theorem, which postulates that deltaS for any process goes to zero as T goes to zero.</p>
<p>Since Cv = T (dS/dT) at constant V, and Cp = T (dS/dT) at constant P (via Maxwell relation), the heat capacities must go to zero as T goes to 0.</p>
<p>This can also be used to show that various other properties go to zero, e.g. the adiabatic and isothermal compressibilities which can be expressed as ratios of Cp and Cv, so the compressibilities must go to zero as T goes to zero. Furthermore, via series expansion, it can be shown that the compressibilities must also become equal to each other as T goes to zero.</p>
<p>For the heat capacities of perfect crystals, you can look at the Einstein and Debye models. Both models capture suggest Cv in the high T limit goes to 3Nkb, but the Debye model captures that Cv is proportional to T^3 for many materials as T goes to 0.</p>
<p>Also, in general, heat capacities are not constant with temperature anyway. It’s not really accurate to use one heat capacity from 0 to 273, or 273 to 1800. But it’s okay for an example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are quantum mechanical effects, but superconductivity involves electrons behaving weirdly, whereas heat capacity involves crystal lattices behaving weirdly. In solids, the primary contribution to heat capacity comes from lattice vibrations; more properly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon" target="_blank">phonon</a> excitations. At high temperatures, nearly all phonon modes are thermally accessible, so the heat capacity tends to the classical limit of 3Nk. At low temperatures, there is insufficient energy available to excite higher energy phonon modes, so the heat capacity drops. And of course, at absolute zero the heat capacity goes to zero due to the third law of thermodynamics (see derivation <a href="http://casey.brown.edu/chemistry/misspelled-researh/crp/Edu/Documents/00_Chem201/4_third_law/4-third_law-frames.htm" target="_blank">here</a>).</p></div>		</li>
