			<div class="markdown"><p>Mountains are geologically active and relatively &quot;new&quot;. Indeed if you compare the Rocky Mts with the much much older Blue Ridge you will have a clearer representation of how water reforms landscapes. </p>
<p>The violence and immense forces that raise mountains disrupt typical water systems.</p>
<p>But even ancient water can still show traces. There is at least one river in the Blue Ridge that flow the &quot;wrong&quot; way. It is a relic of previous water systems that survived the most recent mountain building. I think one is the (ironically named) New River. And perhaps another is the Little Tennessee River. They flow North and West cutting across the bulk of mountains and generally away from their closest ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am no expert on the matter, but from a purely logical perspective I think you may have confounded something in your fifth paragraph (why would the well have to be deeper closer to the stream?)</p>
<p>Interesting explanation otherwise, thanks :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it can happen but from many engineering projects Iâ€™ve done the closer to a stream/River/waterbody you get the higher the groundwater table is. It really just depends on what the soil makeup is near the stream. If your clay or rock layer is really low, you might have a lower than expected water level when you dig in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he's trying to say, or so think I at least, is that the water table is at a higher elevation the closer you are to a body of water, hence making the well deeper</p></div>		</li>
