			<div class="markdown"><p>It was originally named something along the lines of &quot;7.62 three lines infantry cartridge&quot; in Russian when it was created 130+ years ago, but was renamed 7.62x54R by CIP, which designates it as &quot;rimmed&quot;, meaning the end of the case sticks out in a ring instead of having a groove in it like more common ammo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the &quot;3 line&quot; designation the line can be thought of as &quot;1/10 of an inch&quot; so 3 line meant 3/10 inches, or .30 caliber. So it wouldn't have been 7.62 3 line rifle, just the 3 line rifle</p></div>		</li>
