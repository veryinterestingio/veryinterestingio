			<div class="markdown"><p>Germany and some other European Countries operate on a hybrid model by requiring companies over a certain size to have significant employee board representation but not aware of any strictly worker cooperative economies. The one challenge is getting cooperatives started in modern industries usually requires some level of up front cost either from banks, capitalists, or the government so it is a more complex form of economy to scale. Government investment boards or highly regulated capital alongside banks maybe a way forward for such an economy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a full list of socialist countries (current and former).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_socialist_states#Current_socialist_states" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_socialist\_states#Current\_socialist\_states" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_socialist\_states#Current\_socialist\_states</a></a></p>
<p>P.S. Note that there are no Scandinavian countries on that list.  A lot of delusional advocates of socialism on reddit are trying to claim them, but Nordic countries are, and always were free market economies - capitalist countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even most of these countries aren’t really socialist. For instance, I believe I read recently that 60% of China’s economy is now individual owned (ie capitalist). They used to be socialist and have essentially transformed to totalitarian capitalism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The USSR was socialist, everything was owned by the government. But it was also an authoritarian dictatorship. And we have to remember to keep those two ideas separate. Officially, India and Portugal are also socialist. And democratic. I don’t know how functionally socialist they truly are, but they have made the attempt and are my go to examples when every anyone tries to say that all socialism is bad. </p>
<p>Truth is that for the overwhelming majority of us, it does not matter what our economic system is. We work for wages and have no capital to invest. We engage in commerce, and that is about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it’s worth clarifying that the common usage definition of the term has wandered a bit over the past decade in the US.  We’ve gotten in the habit of using the “socialist” label for any institution or organization that doesn’t operate primarily to generate profit for its owners.</p>
<p>So our post office system collects money and provides services, but its driving mechanism isn’t profit for owners (it’s publicly owned)... instead the driving mechanism is ensuring service is provided to everyone.   Same for the police, Medicare, social security, libraries, public schools.  These are all “socialist institutions”, even though we don’t have a socialist economy.  </p>
<p>Weirdly, firefighting used to be for profit, and I gather it still is some places.  Some prisons are socialist, and others are for profit (with varying conditions).  And if we ever take steps away from our profit-focused health industry, that would be “socialized medicine”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a socialist economy the means of production are owned by the people, either as small groups (worker-owned shops) or as the state (government owned business).</p>

<p>is that any different from a &quot;communist&quot; economy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Socialism and capitalism are about who owns the means of production. In both systems, you buy and pay for specific goods based on your own personal needs. </p>
<p>Communism isn't about the means of production, it's about ownership of goods. In a communist economy, goods are distributed as needed (typically the &quot;How?&quot; part of that is the problem). For obvious reasons, this means the government would have to own the means of production as well, otherwise there would be no incentive to produce goods.</p>
<p>Honestly I would say there's more in common between socialism and capitalism than communism and either of those systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, one way that might help (not technically correct but might help) to think of this is that in Communism the state owns everything. In socialism the state owns things that are less appropriate for a profit motive (police, fire, military, education, roads, healthcare, some housing). In Capitalism at the far end of the scale private hands hold everything and the state owns nothing. In truth there are almost no examples of any &quot;pure&quot; system. Communism works greats when you are in a tiny community of people on a paradise island with no fear of weather, hunger, shelter, etc. Capitalism works great when you're Warren Buffett or the Koch brothers. But for most of us, most of the time, a blended economy works best.</p></div>		</li>
