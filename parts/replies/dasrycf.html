			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't watched TV in a long time, but back when I did I remember they used to show a lot of sweat. Like, that's why you wanted a HD TV - because you could see so much more sweat.</p>
<p>Do they still do that or have they found other ways of indicating &quot;look at the detail! than sweaty sportsball players?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About a few decades ago (in the UK) during one of the televised charity events called Children in Need, they had a segment called &quot;Smell-O-Vision&quot; that allowed people to scratch off segments of a card to smell the different smells that famous TV stars were smelling on the TV. I remember it was a crap experience because the second you scratched off one segment, the smell pretty much merged into any other segment that you scratched off. It really doesn't work well. I wasn't too disappointed as I knew I had paid something to charity and it was my first foray into smelling something simultaneously being shown on the TV.</p>
<p>History of Smell-O-Vision <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smell-O-Vision" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smell-O-Vision</a> </p>
<p>Wiki bit on the Children in Need segment:
In 1995, the BBC's Children in Need brought scratch and sniff smell-o-vision to the masses. Through the Saturday evening family show Noel's House Party, viewers could experience various odors to complement their television experience.[23] A similar event called &quot;Smelly Telly&quot; for Cartoon Network's Cow and Chicken animated series involved scratch and sniff cards as well, lasting from April 26 to 30, 1999.[24]</p></div>		</li>
