			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! Just wanted to add that the same thing happened with the asteroids in the asteroid belt (between Mars and Jupiter). The first asteroid discovered was Ceres in 1801, and initially was classified as a planet. Then Pallas was discovered in 1802. Then Juno (in 1804) and then Vesta (in 1807). Those were all classified as planets. Then came a hiatus until 1845 when Astraea was found. And then several more. By 1860 the number of known asteroid rose to almost 60 of them, and they kept popping up as instruments got better and photographic techniques were introduced. So at some point it was decided that these all objects since they are all small objects sharing similar orbits are a class of their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Previous to this there was no actual hard criteria for calling something a planet. It was declared arbitrarily not derived from any kind of well defined parameters.  </p>
<p>The last time I saw an estimate, if Pluto had been allowed to remain classified as a planet we would have had to add somewhere between 100 and 300 potential planets to the stack eventually.  </p>
<p>It's a bit frustrating seeing people consider this a 'downgrade' Pluto is no 'less' than it was before in any way, it's just classified in a different branch of a new tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, A bit more about this. The IAU agreed upon a definition for extra-solar planets in 2004. The requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objects with true mass below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium that orbit stars or stellar remnants are planets (importantly, regardless of formation pathway). The minimum mass required for an extrasolar planet is the same as used for the Solar system.</li>
<li>Substellar objects with masses above the limit for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are brown dwarfs, regardless of formation pathway.</li>
<li>Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not planets but are called sub-brown dwarfs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some serious disputes in this description. The first and most obvious is that the lower limit is not very rigorous. However, since we have limited data about very small objects this is not much of a battleground for debate. A more serious problem is that the planet definition is regardless of formation pathway! This all revolves around brown dwarfs and how they are considered a unique object just because they burn deuterium. In fact if you were to plot planets radius as a function of mass the relationship remains linear right up until you reach red dwarf stars. That is, there is no discernible difference between a plant or a brown dwarf. What makes this worse is that we have observations which suggest that brown dwarfs can form using planetary formation pathways (core accretion and gravitational instability) but also from stellar formation pathways (fragmentation and collapse of a molecular cloud). From what I can gather, the brown dwarf community (as in the actual experts within the IAU) are not quite sure on how to define these objects. Some might be planets some might be substars (failed stars).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next inconsistency is in the free-floating objects category. Despite what the IAU has decided, everyone as far as I can tell has called them what they are, planets. Just they add the tag that they are free-floating (pop-science world uses rogue planet) to define that it is an unbound planet. So this is the first example of the IAU being slow on the uptake of what the experts think!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2006 when the whole Pluto debate came about. The IAU decided to vote on the issue. However, they took the vote at the end of a week long meeting at a time many people had left and gone home. Less than half the members ended up voting. What is more, not all those asked to vote were even experts in planets (there were black hole experts, stellar experts, galaxy experts, and so on). Of course the above posters definition is what won out. It is unfortunate that Steven Soters proposal in a 2006 paper he wrote specifically to put forward a clearer definition of planet (and published before the meeting) was not taken up. If one looks at the modern literature and compares what exoplanet experts think to the IAU definition and Soters, Soters is in far better agreement with current observations and theory. Crucially what Soter includes is formation pathway. His definition also includes age of the system as a consideration. This is important as in young systems objects can still undergo considerable evolution of both orbit and mass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is another fun thing swept under the rug about the 2006 definition. When calculating if Neptune has cleared out its orbit the masses of resonant objects that cross Neptunes path are not included as they are deemed to not be able to collide with Neptune. I am not overly sure if this is required to keep Neptune a planet under this definition or not, but it is interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this changes the fact that Pluto would likely have lost its status of being a planet by pretty much every proposed definition. The point is, the IAU definition is not as strict as people tend to think. For one, it has some serious flaws which are at odds with up to date science (and actually were at the time also) and secondly, the exoplanet community largely ignores the definition and uses their own unwritten definition (which is more aligned with Steven Soters).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't Earth have a trojan asteroid (follows the same orbit but leads/lags by 60 degrees)? From what I understand, this is a stable configuration and Earth will never clear that body from it's orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lagrangian bodies does not count as they rely on the mass of the dominant celestial object to stay in orbit.</p>
<p>Actually the term is &quot;dominant gravitational body in their orbit&quot;, which the Earth is, and Pluto is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cleared out the neighbourhood is a poorly understood phrase. One way to determine if an object has cleared its neighbourhood is to take the ratio of the objects mass to the mass of everything else &quot;in its neighbourhood&quot;. So it is not really considered as a comparison between two objects, it is a comparison between one object in comparison to everything else in a similar orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One other thing is the word planet, from Greek for wandering star, was never well defined. When a new planet was discovered it was rather obvious that it was or wasn't a planet. The governing body of astronomy had a vote on whether Pluto should be a planet or not, and sort of retrofit the definition to be as specific as possible with the results. There was a short time where Sol had a 12ish planet system because they included Pluto, Ceres and one other as planets before they decided to add criteria 3 and knock Pluto off.</p></div>		</li>
