			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a detailed response!! thank you for the time put in to respond. It’s moments like this that I wish I had even the smallest grasp on a second language. I’m intrigued about guessing the word that fits the context, is this something that happens in your head instantly or does it take several moments to find ‘the right piece’? For native English speakers, mandarin/Cantonese has always been declared as some of the hardest languages to learn but I have also read that it’s conversely very simple grammar wise, far more than English</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to learn for sure. Mainly because so many words sound the same and you just gotta learn to differentiate them. There's no alphabet system so you just gotta memorise thousands of individual characters. I read somewhere that the regular person knows 5000 characters and literature people knows up to 15k? It just boggled my mind how many characters there are. </p>
<p>I grew up in North America and had a lot of tutoring classes as a kid to learn Chinese. It's a lot of effort and while my speech is fluent, my vocabulary level is around elementary school level in China. I can't read and write at an advanced level (eg. Watching TV drama is fine but I have trouble reading the newspaper.)</p>
<p>Words in context for me is immediate, but I think this is because I'm completely fluent.
I also studied Japanese and Korean, but not fluent, and it takes longer to understand because I'm translating words to English in my head, breaking down the grammar etc. I don't do that for Chinese. Context is also extremely important for normal understanding anyway because Chinese have so many words that sound the same but are not the same word. You understand the whole sentence instead of thinking of individual words. Without context, you probably won't understand the individual words only based on sound anyway. When I read and there's words I don't know, I can still guess the meaning of the sentence usually. </p>
<p>For grammar, think it's just because of the completely different structure of the grammar, not that it's easy or hard vs English. It's not structured where you need to put Verb/Noun/Adjective in specific order, almost any order will be understandable. Maybe because its not as strict as English structure, it's easier to learn? I'm not sure since I was exposed to both Mandarin and English from birth so the structure is learnt from listening to others talk and already in my head, and I didn't have to learn it based on rules. </p>
<p>I also tried learning French and Latin (elective classes in university)... and I found them extremely difficult for me. I gave up after trying for a couple years, just can't remember words and grammar like I used to as a kid. I think it's just easier to learn languages as a kid, and so much more difficult to learn as an adult.</p></div>		</li>
