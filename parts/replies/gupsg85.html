			<div class="markdown"><p>I would amend the last statement to say &quot;lungs stay open due to a combination of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation#Mechanism" target="_blank">negative pressure driven by the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm in a closed thoracic space</a> and aided by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_alveolus#Type_II_cells" target="_blank">surfactants</a> produced by the alveoli&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: your muscles that make you suck in air, being in a chest without more holes than normal (just your mouth and nose), along with lung goop, allow you to breathe air, unlike these fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fine : we have a thing called a diaphragm. It‚Äôs between your chest and tummy. Imagine a drain plunger - the cup is your diaphragm point in up, the plunger stick pointing down are muscles (ELI5 so I‚Äôm simplifying). When it pulls it creates ‚Äúnegative pressure‚Äù .. makes your lungs stretch so they have to pull in air. But your lungs  aren‚Äôt directly attached to your chest - that would create friction and break points. Instead they slide big ,small, big,  small, thanks to a layer of lube between the lung and the chest wall which we call a surfactant ( like dishwashing soap , or how a suction cap, or Willy the wall walker, works). When it fails you get a condition known as pneumothorax which gets air pressure between the lung and the wall and that ain‚Äôt good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also known as &quot;lungs stay open because there is less air inside them than right outside them when you inspire, forcing air to enter the lungs, and that is helped by a special liquid that keeps the internal surfaces of the tiny pockets from ever touching each other&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
