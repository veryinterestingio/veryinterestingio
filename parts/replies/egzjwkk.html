<p>Accurate vocal impressions are pretty rare from scarily gifted people. Those that are that good get hired to dub dead actors for film restorations. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like doing an impression doesn't imply that you sound indistinguishable from the real deal, but rather that your voice is easily recognizable as being the person your impersonating.</p>
<p>If I were to do an Obama impression, you'd definitely be able to tell I'm doing an Obama impression, but you wouldn't think I was <em>actually</em> Obama.</p>
<p>People who are able to perfectly replicate voices, imo, fall into a different category than people who do impressions.</p></div>		</li>
