<p>Is there somewhere you could recommend learning this at a more fundamental level, or am I just too dumb to get my head around it?</p>
<p>I will not be offended by either answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Learning is a ladder. What is your level? Do you know basic (non-relativistic, single particle) quantum mechanics? Do you understand special relativity?</p>
<p>I can give you an answer if you specify these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much for the response, but I too feel in a similar position. I'm finishing A-Level physics now (i think that's the end of senior high in the USA, but idk), so the only quantum physics we've done is, like you mention, non-relativistic, single particle stuff (photoelectric effect, x-ray attenuation etc.). Have also done quite a bit of my own reading on special relativity, but haven't really gotten the opportunity to apply it in practice/examination anywhere as we don't cover it in the A-levels. I had a feeling QFT would throw me way out of my depth, but you are right, learning is a ladder. Can you give me any resources to help me get started, even if not necessarily in a direction towards QFT, but just deepening understanding of quantum physics as a whole would be good :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like one too. Got  PhD in computational chemistry yet you answer is difficult to get.... (not blaming you, blaming myself 100%).</p>
<p>Do you have something that vulgarize what you explained?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>My interest in physics amounts to having read an occasional science book here and there, normally of the pop-sci variety, such as The Quantum Universe by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw. It's been a while since I read it though. I could grasp most of that book, but it seemed like it was just touching the surface of the subject. It certainly didn't prepare me in any way for your answer, for instance.</p>
<p>I am swamped with work at the moment, but when this pandemic blows over, I expect I will have some free time to investigate some of those books.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'The Road to Reality' by Roger Penrose is an excellent primer for these topics, and is written with people of vastly different levels of technical knowledge in mind. If you have an interest in this sort of thing I cannot recommend it enough.</p>
<p>Edit: The reason I mention this book specifically is because you asked about fundamentals. Penrose will show you how the simple concept of a &quot;set&quot; alone establishes all natural numbers, and build on very simple and intuitive concepts like these all the way to explanations of the mathematics behind quantum fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, two different ways to look at this, both of which are incomprehensible?</p>
<p>I could make a list of the incomprehensible terms but it might be easier to list the words I know.</p>
<p>Is the idea that a photon travel from point A to B through all possible paths connected to the path integral picture or am I as far from &quot;getting it&quot; as I fear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea of the path integral is basically that if you want to calculate the probability that a photon starting at A at time t0 is measured at B at time t1, you sum the amplitude over all possible paths. One way I've seen this explained is with reference to the double-slit experiment . There, to calculate the probability that a particle will be detected at a certain point on a screen, you add together the amplitude for it to go through hole 1 and the amplitude for it to go through hole 2. Because there is a complex phase associated with these amplitudes, when you sum them up sometimes they cancel out and you get interference patterns. Now, say you add a third hole. Well, then you have three different paths to add together. But say you add a second screen, and this also has three holes. Well, now there are 9 different paths for you to add up. Now say you keep adding screens, and you keep putting more and more holes in those screens. Eventually, you add so many screens they fill the entire space between the particle source and the detector. But you also add so many holes that the screens are <em>all hole</em>. This is obviously equivalent to not having any screens at all -- just a particle moving in free space. But, from our intuition of adding up all of the paths the particle could take, it now seems that to calculate the probability of detecting the particle at a certain point, we need to sum over an infinite number of possible paths through space (through an infinite number of now imaginary holes in now imaginary screens). This sum is a path integral.</p>
<p>When you get to fields it's a little thicker, because you aren't just concerned about a single particle, but rather an entire field configuration. It might be easier to think about in a lower dimensional case -- like a 1D scalar field. Here, we have a line where each point on the line takes a scalar value -- just a number. A given field configuration is just a way of assigning each point along the line a number. You can think of the line as being like a string, and the different field configuration are different shapes the string can have. Now, let the string jiggle about to evolve it in time.  To get the probability of finding a certain field configuration at time t1 given that you knew the configuration at t0, you sum over all possible different string jiggles it could have taken to get into the final configuration.</p>
<p>I hope that gives a sense of the intuition behind the idea without dumbing it down <em>too</em> much. If you want to learn more about this stuff, though, you really have to start from basics and slowly build your way up, so it's a slow process. Doing field integrals is usually something you only attempt after you have already been studying physics for at least four years or so. Richard Feynmann has a good book on path integrals if you are interested in that in particular, and it's readable if you have a couple of years of undergraduate-level physics under your belt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the book QED (The Strange Theory of Light and Matter)? That's the book that explained a photon's path in terms of summing across all possible paths. (I like to think of it as akin to how a Taylor Series expansion works but, again, that may be a totally invalid analogy)</p>
<p>In any case, was that a &quot;Yes&quot; or a &quot;No&quot; to my question? KISS</p></div>		</li>
