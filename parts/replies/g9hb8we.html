			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for the sake of clarity and accuracy, relics in the area have been dated to 200BCE, but nobody is sure when it was actually carved. A number of theories posit that it is post-Colombian. It's definitely old, but 2000 years is iffy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, that brings me back down to earth a bit.<br />
Was in a absolute awe that the candelabra is so well preserved given it seems to just be channels dug out of the sand with the surrounding sand being fairly loose.<br />
I get that a lot of these glyphs have survived as long as they have due to minimal erosion, but 2,200 years seemed like an excessively long time to stay that crisp on a sandy slope.<br />
2,200 years is a looong time to go without some kind of freak flash flood, earthquake jostling, or major windstorm.</p></div>		</li>

I probably should have paid more attention on the boat tour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vandalism on something in a place that inhospitable and at that size, that scale, has little reward when something that will cause more disruption and affect more people more quickly will cause a bigger problem elsewhere.</p>
<p>Vandals are typically young and don't have the funds required for travel or to be sufficiently prepared for something that extensive.</p>
<p>Any wildlife there might be dangerous, like the cat depicted, which might be a lynx or jaguar.</p>
<p>Large things like that can be monitored from a distance and a vandal would be caught and removed (depending on laws regarding those lines in Peru, the removal could take multiple methods)</p>
<p>Did I mention that they'd have to lug a lot of water and food to spend the effort required to make much of a change?</p>
<p>Just some ideas—</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's actually called Candelabro (candlestick), which makes a lot more sense, because <em>candelabra</em> doesn't exist in Spanish. It's not your fault though, English websites tend to call it that way from what I've just seen, which is odd, because all the Spanish ones I've seen call it Candelabro. Some English speaking person must have made that mistake and nobody bothered to check, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tour was in English, and it’s perfectly fine to describe something on a predominantly English website, in English.</p>
<p>It’s like the Spanish calling London Londres. Perfectly okay.</p></div>		</li>
