			<div class="markdown"><p>But since antibody tests are quick and cheap, this begs the question if they did antibody count monitoring in the trials. If they did, they should be able to e.g. say &quot;50% of the patients that got vaccinated and still got COVID developed low antibpdy counts in response to the vaccine&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the time the studys were run I don't think they had proven antibody tests were a correlated biomarker of immunity. I'm sure the collected blood samples during the testing though they can probably back analyze this. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/health/covid-vaccine-blood-test.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/health/covid-vaccine-blood-test.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes, you are right. But it becomes tricky at where you define the cut off. There are too few events in the trial to treat the antibody titre as a continuous variable.</p>
<p>Plus what would you do with that information? Besides telling them they are more at risk, would you vaccinate again? Would that work? That would need a second trial including only people with low antibody levels that haven’t caught Covid yet.</p>
<p>Also, mass vaccination campaigns are labour intensive enough as it is. If we had to arrange blow tests 8 weeks after the shots and somehow find enough labs to test the whole country and then find enough people to follow up on the results? It’s not doable for the whole population. </p>
<p>What your are suggesting has been done before, for hepatitis B for example, but we are still a ways off from that point.</p></div>		</li>
