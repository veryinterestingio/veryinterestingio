<p>Things can happen differently depending on the reader/player choice. But it doesn't matter that the pages are out of order, because every time you need to move forward in the story, it says go to page X.</p></div>		</li>

If you want to listen to a specific song on vinyl, you pick up the stylus and move it there, you don’t have to listen to the whole album. </p></div>		</li>

So if you go to section of Fallout 4, the DVD player knows to grab music form the music section, textures from the texture section, then it loads it into memory and is available for the game to display.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may ask, you say the system knows the locations of the files on the disk, does the system scan the disk first and map out the different files and their locations in some kind of temporary file, or does it seek the file everytime ?</p>
<p>Also, since the files are more or less hazardly spread on the disk and the eye reader is on a little back and forth mechanism, how does it keep up at seeking files 100% of the time ? Wouldn't it be overwhelmed ?
(And is part of the game optimization to spread the data on the disk in to be read in most effective way ? Like how -when games had multiple disks- they had to manage which data goes to which disk depending on the progression the player had)</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a table of files and their locations. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. As long as there is just one request for a file at a time it will happily zip back and forth from one file to the next. Parallel reads can absolutely kill performance. You can try it yourself by starting two copy jobs of different files from the same optical disc. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And is part of the game optimization to spread the data on the disk in to be read in most effective way ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you try to put the data on the disc in a way that minimizes head movement. In some instances the same file might even be on the disc multiple times if there is enough space and it is needed in many places of the game. This is mostly useful for linear games. For nonlinear games you need a good  algorithm to preload data that will be needed to RAM. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Since you've mentioned it, I'm curious since obviously simultaneous copy jobs crawl - Is the time required to perform two copies at once equal to the time it would take to do them separately?  Or is simultaneous slower than one after another? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Assuming you're on Windows Something that won't prove much.  It dies in a ditch on fire if you try that with any types of disk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This leaves out a pretty critical component... RAM and Processor caches... which collect and buffer the data from the disk before being read by the processor.</p>
<p>In other words
CDs (and Hard Disk Drives/Solid State Drives) are long term storage (slow speed, big storage, relatively cheap)</p>
<p>RAM( Random Access Memory) on the other hand is temporary storage that's smaller but way faster. Processor caches are similar. These mediums buffer or store the data until the processor is read to... well process or read in or write out the data.</p>
<p>RAM is critical because it allows segments of the CD to be accessed much more quickly than you could otherwise... and it's critical for facilitating storing the massive amounts of data seen in open world games.</p></div>		</li>
