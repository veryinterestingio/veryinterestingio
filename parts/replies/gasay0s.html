			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually do. They’re just not ossified.
Also the original answer didn’t explain the “why”, only gave a”because” (30% more efficient...). The answer an anatomist or kinesthesiologist would give.
If an evolutionary biologist is around I’d love to hear their take.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: They have knee caps just not ossified yet. Do they not do their job as fulcrum as well though ?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need knee caps to walk. It's just that having kneecaps make it more efficient for your leg muscle aka quadriceps to extend your legs. You can move fine without kneecaps but your leg muscles will have to work harder.</p></div>		</li>
