			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with more rotational speed is the the forces generated would require a much stronger base and gearbox. Those would be so expensive they it wouldn't be cost effective. The speed is intentionally kept slow or these windmills would destroy themselves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Err, not quite. Higher speed would require lower mass (smaller blades) so the forces wouldn't actually get any higher. If anything, you'd end up with fewer forces generated.</p>
<p>Gearboxes on wind turbines are already the failure point because of off-axis forces caused by the size of the blades. Smaller blades would actually preserve the gearbox longer--but it'd be better to keep bigger blades and just get rid of the gearbox entirely, bypassing the problem.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, think of it this way. If you have a big, slow gear, you can use that to turn a smaller gear faster. So what keeps us from just making everything much faster and thus more powerful? Because it's really determined by torque. The bigger gear exchanges rotational velocity for more torque, and the smaller one has less torque but a higher velocity. So really, the energy you can get out of the overall system is determined by how much torque you can produce on the blades. </p></div>		</li>
