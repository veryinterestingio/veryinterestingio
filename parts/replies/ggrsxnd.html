<p>This means that the motor neurons are not being stimulated, so they arenâ€™t sending these signals to the brain.</p>

<p>This part of the explanation is incorrect. Motor neurons carry signal to the muscles to contract them. During REM atonia, they are not active, leading to temporary paralysis. I.e. when you dream during REM sleep, you don't physically move your body because the motor neurons don't trigger the muscles. Some sleep disorders involve loss of this paralysis:</p>

<p>Sensory neurons are responsible for carrying signals from periphery to the brain. Sensitivity of these neurons may be going down in sleep (meaning that you'll need stronger stimuli for them to register when you're sleeping), but I haven't looked up the literature on that to tell you for certain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Strong enough signals can override the brains sleep-centric-shutdown-state. Something was significantly irritating your nose</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first REM stage lasts around 10-15 minutes with each one after that extending, the last one can be an hour long. I get what you mean, there would be a lot of time in between these rem stages. Maybe after the first REM stage your nerves continue to be switched off or at least working at a lower rate. Seems like a smart bit of evolution so you aren't always waking up to sneeze.</p></div>		</li>
