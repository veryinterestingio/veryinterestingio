			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Sort of.  The military healthcare, which is not really insurance but close enough, does pay for your vasectomy.   However in the USA  military system also covers your family so they have a motivation to prevent kore pregnancies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: This is also why we haven't been able to figure out male birth control. First and foremost, the process of stopping sperm production in a temporary way is difficult. Secondly, the side effects are always a trade off. With hormonal birth control, there are a ton of negative things that can happen. For most people, these are not life threatning but are very annoying (weight gain, acne, depression). Us lady folks put up with it because the alternative is pregnancy and mild weight gain is not worse than carrying an unwanted pregnancy. From a strictly medicial stand point, pregnancy is dangerous, so the side effects of birth control are worth it as they are necessary to prevent something significantly worse.</p>
<p>With men, there is nothing significantly worse to prevent. Therefore, even if a male birth control pill has the exact same side effects as the female version, it is medically unacceptable because there is no risk to the male if he stops taking it. Again, from a strictly medical stand point, the desire to independently control when/how you reproduce is not relevant. Even with female birth control, the main point is not preventing a baby but preventing a pregnancy. For male birth control to be approved, it would have to have virtually no side effects, and this is not super realistic. </p>
<p>Think of it this way: Cancer will kill you, so it is okay that chemo has such bad side effects. It would not be okay for, say, headache medicine to have these same side effects because having a headache will not kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also female birth control is mimicking a hormonal state that already exists which prevents pregnancy.</p>
<p>At no point do males stop producing sperm whicheans there's no &quot;sterile&quot; state we can replicate like in women.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point about the side effects and severity risk/benefit ratio. Although if you suffer from migraines, you might feel like it's going to kill you.</p>
<p>Also, migraine medicines do sometimes have hella terrible side effects to them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of for sure. I'm biased because I've only ever had tension headaches that go away if I take a nap, so I was thinking along the lines of Advil. But yeah, from how people have described migraines, I feel very lucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is slightly more expensive for women in their twenties than for men of the same age range specifically because of pregnancy related costs. Insurance slowly becomes more expensive for men as they get older. This applies to individuals who are paying for their insurance themselves and not part of an employer group plan which will have all participants paying the same rate.</p></div>		</li>
