<p>Why did they pick 21 days? They had to start somewhere, they were in a hurry to get the vaccine approved and 21 days was about the shortest period that was worth trying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They picked 21 days for a good reason. 21 days is typically the shortest time that you make immune memory, so the shortest time that a booster makes sense. The biggest issue with the longer time between shots is the lower efficacy of a single dose compared to 2 doses. However, 1 dose is still better than 0 doses</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OPs question is in relation to the efficacy of 1 dose beyond the manufacturer’s recommendation to have the second dose.  So, for example, in Canada many of the provinces are deciding to delay the second dose for up to 4 months.</p>
<p>Do we have any data on the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine 4 months after the 1st dose?  We don’t.  The closest information I’ve seen is that for some vulnerable groups the single dose begins to lose efficacy after 5 weeks.  I’d love to see more data on this, and if you have any then by all means share, but so far I just see everyone talking out of their hats:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what source are you using to get this number? I've seen it a lot and it is the number that is being presented by my government. However, it doesn't seen consistent with the results of the Israel study from a few weeks back. </p>
<p>My understanding is that this number is mainly based on the post-hoc analysis of the first 28 days of the Pfizer trial, but that doesn't seem very meaningful, especially given that there has now been enough time to get a better assessment of the efficacy.</p>
<p>My government also released a similar number based on early results from their own vaccination campaign. However, when the number was released, the entire cohort of people vaccinated was made up almost from healthcare professionals and a small group of people in retirement homes. I can't help but there are a massive number of confounders there.</p>
<p>- retirement home people are essentially limited to contact with caretakers in the facility (family is not allowed to visit as far as I know, except in very specific circumstances)</p>
<p>- HCPs may have increased occupational COVID exposure, but they Are also far more likely to follow social distancing recommendations appropriately and to avoid sites of potential exposure, they are better trained than the general public in hand hygiene, and they have better access to more PPE, especially during working hours</p>
<p>The Israel study presented efficacy of closer to 50% depending on the population being looked at based on 600,000 vaccinated participants and 600,000 controls in a prospective observational study. is there stronger evidence to support 80% efficacy after 2 weeks?</p></div>		</li>
