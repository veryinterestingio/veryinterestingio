			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhhhh I get it but still if you wanted to make a decision you still could end up losing if only 34% vote against if no one sides with you. </p>
<p>I'm talking in a case of absolutely no cha 've of anyone contesting you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could but that isn't the point. A lot of shareholders don't know they are shareholders, since shares trade so quickly. Lots of people own only one share. Others just can't be arsed. Lots of institutional investors are deeply nepotistic and weak at corporate governance and won't rock the boat.</p>
<p>It is a fallacy to think there are real people sitting round a table, it is representatives of edge funds and banks, at best, all of whom wish above all for stability. </p>
<p>In reality, there is basically no such thing as corporate governance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh nice, I got an email for a proxy vote request and learned about it through google. I canâ€™t remember which company  but the board was recently replaced I think?? Or maybe they wanted a member replaced. It was very interesting to see a group of lawyers(?) or whoever was asking for such a thing and hearing their explanation at the time, and learning of the concept.</p></div>		</li>
