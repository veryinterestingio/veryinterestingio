			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I was severely overweight for no apparent reason for two years before I discovered I had Cushings. Had to have surgery to have the tumor removed about 12 years ago. I was taking growth hormone up until last year because I didn’t really feel it was doing anything for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you monitoring your igf levels? You definitely don't want too low of growth hormone either. The difference can be very subtle which is why monitoring is so important. </p>
<p>But yeah it's FUCKING expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>growth hormone secretagogues exist that make you release more growth hormone, and they have undergone clinical trials, but to my knowledge they haven't been marketed. however growth hormone itself has been approved to treat short stature (effectively cutting out the middle man that is the pituitary). </p>
<p>in fact, based on the evidence from the secretagogue trials, growth hormone is probably better for treating short stature than secretagogues because gh deficient people may not be able to release much more gh than they already do, even with the help of medication. so instead, they simply give people the growth hormone that their body is not producing.</p></div>		</li>
