<p>Pretty sure it was the White Album.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be thinking of the modern mix and remaster that George Martin's son Giles did on Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 2018 I believe. I haven't heard of any major revamps to the mixes on the White Album but I could have easily missed it lol. He actually did go back to the original stems and mixed them as if it were a modern mix rather than the more stark hard panning that was common practice in 1967 for stereo records. Sounded amazing in my opinion, although I do still like the old style mixes as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the Let It Be...Naked version that came out like 15 years ago. More of a reproduction/remix than just a remaster, as lots of parts were stripped out compared to the original release.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think that albums like Dark Side of the Moon will keep being remastered in decades to come, using mastering techniques that haven't been invented yet? Or have we reached the point where it sounds as good as it's ever going to be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it will keep being remastered but kinda like wine there will be “vintage” remasters from certain years that are more popular. I don’t think we’ll ever reach the point where it can’t be improved, like how I thought things couldn’t get better visually and then 4K came along. Whether there will be any perceivable improvements at listener level on the re-remasters is another question, but I think tech and mastering techniques will always be moving forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it's not gonna improve that much from now on because mastering is basically applying processing to a whole mix (not necessary true of course) so we're &quot;stuck&quot; with the original mix (in this case quite old in a different era) who will sound in a specific way no matter what we can throw at him. I guess they'll do other remaster in the future but it will end up in what you prefer rather than necessary better (imo).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say, but it is likely as our speaker, amp, and preamp technologies improve. I suppose we're also looking at the possibility of quantum computing taking off soon which would likely change how we store data and might affect how we store and playback music as well.</p></div>		</li>
