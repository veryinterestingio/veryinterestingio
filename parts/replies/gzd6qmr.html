			<div class="markdown"><p>lol, dude, getting commissary is a pretty common thing. It is expensive and a total money grab by for-profit companies but still, people get it.</p>
<p>And you mean nutraloaf? No, not everyone is eating that. They use that if they hate you or if you do something weird with the food. They put me in solitary and gave me it one time because they hated me.</p></div>		</li>

And you could eat other inmates leftover nutraloaf, skinny guys would just by throwing their leftover loaf in the trash otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
