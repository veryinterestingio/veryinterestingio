			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate a little...</p>
<p>The sun, stars, and moon generally only help to determine your latitude. Since the earth is always spinning, identifying location east/west can't be done very well with those methods.</p>
<p>Maritime clocks allowed them to determine how many degrees longitude they've traveled from a reference location. If your clock says 12 at high noon when you leave port, and now your clock says 1 at high noon, you know you've traveled 1/24 of earth's rotation to the west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Developing a clock that works on boats (you can’t bring the ol’ pendulum clock on a rocking ship) for long periods of time was basically the nuclear fusion of its day.  Governments and trading companies had offered huge prizes and dedicated significant resources to anyone who could figure it out.</p>
<p>The winner eventually earned a massive payout from the British government, worth several million dollars today - but the work had taken him decades.</p></div>		</li>

The winner was John Harrison. There was lots of drama involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did not just guess their longitude.</p>
<p>Dead reckoning ( I know I am going this fast in this direction for this long) and some understanding of the sea currents give you an educated guess.</p>
<p>So you put a circle 20 miles wide on the map and you can say quite confidently you are in that circle. </p>
<p>Then the way Celestial navigation worked you could draw lines of position ( which are curves really) on the map and you know you are on that line in that circle.</p>
<p>With an accurate clock you can make many lines of position and the interest , or likely small triangle you make, at the intersection is you location. But that takes multiple sightings (sextant reading) at a precise time.</p>
<p>You can know the time rather precisely at noon sunset and sunrise if you know the date and latititude.</p>
<p>If it is cloudy for a couple days that circle you draw on the map gets larger and larger until you can take a reading of the sky and it shrinks back down again.</p>
<p>All this can be done with tools as simple as a cross staff, pencil, paper, and nautical almanac.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still need to dead recon when taking sights. An accurate clock is to do calculations. You don't need to dead recon when taking sights of multiple celestial bodies at once but you need to for the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And charts were marked at known locations - that is, land or rock formations or mouths of rivers, etc.  With some idea of the direction they were traveling and the speed they were traveling, they had a good idea of where they were.  Mostly.  </p>
<p>Latitude was not too difficult to calculate.  Longitude was something else.  In many cases, ships would, as much as possible, travel a latitude line.</p>
<p>Larger ships would carry a Master who was an expert at navigation and took sighting using a sextant and had his own set of charts that were updated regularly.</p>
<p>Some Pacific Islanders were able to navigate based on waves.  But this was an unusual and phenomenal  ability that few people could do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hokule'a is the star Arcturus and when you are at \~19 degrees north, it is directly overhead at Midnight -- since Hawaii is sort of 19.5 - 20.5 degrees N, they could sail north from wherever -- that's easy enough -- and then once Arcturus / Hokule'a is overhead at midnight, just start heading east.    </p>
