			<div class="markdown"><p>That is mostly only around Frankfort, Bardstown, and other whiskey producing areas, as stated above the barns in most of the state are black because they are tobacco curing barns.</p>
<p>The paint color of whiskey aging barns isn’t really because of the fungus, most of them are painted how they are in order to influence how the whiskey ages. Thermal cycling causes whiskey to age faster, so some barns are black so they heat up more during the day to age the whiskey more quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can personally vouch for this.  My father moved to a farm near Bardstown, and there was a tobacco-curing barn on the property.  All the racks are still there, as well as an old stove that really heats the barn well in the winter.</p>
<p>Dad doesn't grow tobacco, though, so he repainted the barn red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most rickhouses aren’t painted black, though. Heaven hill is mostly white, Willett has silver metal cladding, Buffalo Trace has all sorts of colors, Four roses is sort of silvery. 1792 has all black rickhouses, and Makers Mark has several black ones IIRC.</p></div>		</li>
