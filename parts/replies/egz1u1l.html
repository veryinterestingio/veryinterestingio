<p>Actors have a very limited ability to change their anatomy, but they can control these cues and that is probably a large part of their ability to imitate. </p>

<p>An actor's mannerisms, inflection, and accent can do wonders for an impression of other people, even if their timbre isn't exactly right. See John Mulaney doing Bill Clinton, or Matt Damon doing Matthew McConaughey. They may not sound just like them, but their &quot;act&quot; is so good that we're instantly reminded of the person anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The study we did had people listen to two screams that were either from the same person or from 2 different people and asked them, is this the same screamer or different screamers? The screams came from people the listeners had not met before, and the responses were accurate more often than not. </p>
<p>This doesn’t quite reach the level of individual recognition (the ability to hear a scream or other sound and recognize who it is) - instead we call it “individual discrimination.” It’s thought to be kind of a cognitive prerequisite to individual recognition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine it's along the lines of playing a voice clip of &quot;person A, B, C,&quot; etc, then playing screams of each person and the subject has to label which scream belongs to which person?? I don't know, I could be way off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I was thinking it was that you hadn't heard the voice, but could attach the scream to the person based off of looks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question, we record naturally occurring screams from monkeys living in a social group. They scream when they get in fights with each other. The screams function to recruit family members into the fight, it’s kind of like a way of saying, “come get my back!”</p></div>		</li>
