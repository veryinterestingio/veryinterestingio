<p>Wait, am I understanding it correctly that neutrinos can &quot;feel&quot; the medium they're traveling in without &quot;psysically&quot; interacting with it (i.e. colliding/scattering - being destroyed, as you say)?! That's super interesting and odd! Is it an interaction with some crazy quantum field?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less, yes. This process is somewhat akin to how light changes speed And refracts in glass or other transparent materials. In the language of Feynman diagrams, neutrinos will exchange virtual Z bosons with the electrons and quarks/nuclear matter in the medium, with a small probability, but enough to change the dynamics of the particle. To the neutrino, it looks like a kind of self-interaction (if you ignore the medium), similar to how the Higgs field creates self-interactions which generate mass in the Standard model. (You sometimes hear this described as the Higgs field being a kind of “molasses” that slows down particles.) Anyway, the result is that the physical particles have different mixtures of the three flavor states, with different masses, and that results in a different oscillation frequency.</p>
<p>I wrote a paper on this once for a graduate seminar, but that was a while ago and I’m not in the field, but my recollection is that one of the main difficulties with understanding was around determining when to treat the neutrinos as flavor states (mixtures of the mass states) and when to treat them as mass states (mixtures of the flavor states), and when you could treat the wave packets as traveling at the speed of light or not. It’s kind of basic quantum mechanics, but there are lots of opportunities to make simple mistakes. So if it’s kind of confusing — we’ll that’s probably my fault for not being totally clear!</p></div>		</li>
