The genetic variety can therefore be used to theorize population crashes. The human species has had a bottleneck in the past as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of talk about a human bottleneck, but more recent investigation indicates that it didn’t happen and that the various ‘bottlenecks’ are actually a misinterpretation of a different thing, the serial founder effect.</p>
<p>In essence this is when the population <em>increases</em> quickly from a small number of individuals without any initial reduction in population size. </p>
<p>I’m about to head out for fieldwork, but I’ll link some papers once I’m back at a computer.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Here are some references (debunking of the Toba Hypothesis is included as that's the most commonly quoted source for the supposed bottleneck):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: The bottleneck effect comes from the small population size eliminating a lot of different alleles--mutation does not impact this.</p>
<p>Rather, genetic drift (including mutation as an enabling factor) is way more powerful in smaller populations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on this to say that even if you have a genetically viable breeding population, you would still need to address the root cause of the near-extinction. In the vast majority of cases we've seen before, that's either been overharvesting or loss-degradation of habitat, sometimes a combination of both. The establishment of preserves/sanctuaries and/or regulation of hunting/harvest can go a long way towards achieving these goals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, let's say we have 1000 Dogs.  Of those 1000 dogs there's an even distribution of big dogs, small dogs, long hair, short hair, snub nose, long snout, etc.</p>
<p>Now we incinerate 950 dogs (THE HORROR!) and take the remaining 50, and of those 50 most of them happen to be short hair, snub nose, small dogs and NONE of them have long hair (just by happenstance).  If we use just those 50 dogs, and breed them back to a population of 1000 again, we no longer have the same distribution of genetic traits than the original 1000 dogs.  As such we've genetically drifted the species of &quot;Dog&quot; to a different gene pool.  That's genetic drift.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the loss or fixation of genes due to luck. let's say you have a 50/50 chance of heads or tails on tossing a coin, you toss it 3 times, all tails one would think the coin has only tails, toss it 500 times and you will have something close to 250/250 tails/heads.</p>
<p>Genetic drift is quite like that, you have a chance of 50/50 to pass a gene form (called allele) to the next generation. With few individuals it's quite likely that only one of the two genes is transmited, just because of luck. Now with more individuals it's more likely to keep that 50/50 ratio.</p>
<p>Note that this is repeated each generation, and luck could eliminate a gene form completely from a big population if given the time.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say there's 10 rhinos hanging out under a tree.  One rhino out of this group has longer eyelashes, due to a unique gene in its DNA.  A branch falls from the tree, smacking the rhino in the head and killing it.  The gene for longer eyelashes is no longer present in this population, due to random chance.  Genetic drift is the change in the makeup of genes in a population due to chance, and is a process of evolution like mutation or natural selection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure i've somewhen rode that the &quot;basic&quot; genetic variance within a population also plays a huge role in determining that number. Humans were somewhen reduced to a couple hundred or thousand individuals already, so if we would need to face this scenario again the minimum number of required people is higher than what it would be for most animal species that usually have a much wider variation of genes. Which is also the reason you don't get incest problems as fast when breeding animals or plants than humans do get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that may be true, the jury is still out on how many humans would be needed in order to safely repopulate the species.</p>
<p>There are a lot of thought experiments on this subject, with the concept of a sci-fi &quot;Space Ark&quot;, where we try to figure out the minimum number of humans required to put em on a space barge to find Earth II and populate a brand new planet with humans.  That number varies greatly depending on the sci-fi calculations of manning and crewing the Space Vessel, but the smallest figure I can find is 98.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you could probably repopulate with a single pair, but you would need something like 50 generations of strictly controlled gene pairing/coupling(including a LOT of inter- and intra- generational incest) and hope for enough random mutation to even it out.</p></div>		</li>
