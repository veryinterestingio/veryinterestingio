			<div class="markdown"><p>Rome didn't <em>officially</em> tolerate Christianity until Constantine, and some Emperors like Nero were vehemently against it.</p>
<p>However, it was popular among the Legions because unlike the Mystery cults that were popular at the time, it was basically free and offered anyone who believed salvation in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Scholars still debate whether Constantine was a true believer or a pragmatist or somewhere in between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it was probably was trendy/worldly as well.  Ovid writes in Ars Armatoria (around 2 CE), about learning a bit of Judaism to seem cosmopolitan to women.  Kind of like how saying you were a white person who said you were a Zen Buddhist in the 80's signified you were a worldly person. I would imagine a Roman in 100 CE saying he was a Christian might have had similar effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that Judaism had both a worldly/Eastern mystique and a very long history. Judaism was tolerated and even somewhat admired in the Roman empire despite the monotheistic exclusivity thing (most religions at the time were not seen as mutually exclusive and many people joined multiple religious traditions). </p>
<p>Christianity on the other hand was new and had a much harsher take on its exclusivity. I think it was seen more like the Scientology of it's day - a new, many would say calculated and fabricated, cult that claimed exclusive spiritual truth which denounced other faiths as false and demonic. So it received little toleration and was seen as dangerous.</p>
<p>TLDR Judaism was kind of like Buddhism on the West today, Christianity was like Scientology in the West today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but with understanding of how these things work we don’t really need a supernatural explanation any more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just want to point something out. In terms of religion, it's not actually too much to a stretch in faith to say that God does use something explainable by science to work to His advantage. This should really be no problem if He is the creator of everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, of course not. Like I said, faith isn’t going anywhere and it’s not that a deity or deities <em>can’t</em> fit into modern life and world views - those ideas just aren’t as necessary to prop them up any more now that we have working theories on how and why things work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also point out that at least among the educated class, by the end of Roman polytheism, belief in the gods was less about seeking a supernatural explanation for things (the old myths were mostly seen as allegories for the way the gods worked their will on Earth) and more about identifying a source for both reality itself and human virtue. In fact this goes all the way back to Plato and the forms.</p>
<p>Christianity adopted these ideas and simply changed the names of the gods, and then certain modern sects started to ignore all the philosophy and start taking their myths literally again, resulting in obvious pushback from educated people and a resurgence in atheism.</p></div>		</li>
