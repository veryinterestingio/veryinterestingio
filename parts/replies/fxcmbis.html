			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re super correct!</p>
<p>Edit: actually, are you?  I’m pretty sure the volumetric measure is for a single cycle, 4 strokes just cycle twice per ignition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am, actually. The valves are only open for one of the two cycles, when closed during the compression and expansion strokes the piston is not pumping air. (Using the term &quot;air&quot; loosely here, of course.) You move one displacement's worth of air through the cylinder every two rotations of the crank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Air isn't a great medium to explain this with due to the fact it is compressible. In fact, throw forced induction (turbocharged or supercharged) into the mix and it completely screws with that. </p>
<p>Displacement is the amount of volume the pistons displace when they move. It is calculated by taking the cylinder bore (it's diameter), calculating its area and then multiplying it by the stroke (the maximum distance the piston travels) and then of course multiplying it by the number of cylinders.</p></div>		</li>
