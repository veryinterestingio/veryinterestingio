			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes some of the early research suggests that travel will change, both from the consumer perspective as well as the industry. We know from research that consumers fall along a continuum from risk adverse to risk accepting. Those who are more are risk adverse are more likely to avoid travel. This percentage of the population could potentially increase with this event. In addition, on the supply side, we might start to see tourism businesses adopt more technology to monitor body temperature or health as a way of keeping people safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm very interested to see what long term changes will come from this. Increased ability to WFH? Use of mask and gloves being more common (outside of Asia)?  Will our children learn to be clean freaks or germaphobes?</p></div>		</li>
