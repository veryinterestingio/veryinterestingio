			<div class="markdown"><p>Martin County in Florida seems to be the maximum northern extent, the coral density and species types above this area aren’t really conducive to the spread of the disease (I hope).</p>
<p>There have been suspected cases as far south as Aruba and Curaçao, these islands are only a few miles from the coast of Venezuela.</p>
