<p>Dogs will run themselves to death because they don’t want to show weakness. Or not stop to drink water instead of chasing the ball more. As will many other animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar with cats. It's often really difficult to tell if they're unwell until it's pretty late, because they feel the need to pretend everything is normal until they just can't anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. I've always figured dogs will swim to exhaustion and not stop to drink water because they're being instinctual more than anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually had this issue with my dog, though not to death. She loves to play fetch and I hadn’t been paying attention to how long we played one day. It had been like an hour of almost non stop fetch. She ended up throwing up later that day, I assume heat exhaustion. After that I don’t play more than 15-20 minutes at a time.</p></div>		</li>
