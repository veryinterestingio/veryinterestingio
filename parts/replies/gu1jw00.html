			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the situation.  On the road? Yeah, the big Mac is faster. Sitting on your couch wanting a burger? If you factor in the drive and waiting time,  it might take you about 5 more minutes to just make it yourself as long as you have everything on hand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This right here is the big deal for many people. Specifically the ground beef - you have to have it on hand and use it within a relatively short period of time, or freeze it which makes the prep <em>way</em> longer than the time involved in going out to that fast food place.</p>
<p>It's not an ingredient of impulse, unless you're already using it multiple times a week as a matter of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you can just pick your cell phone, open Skip The Dishes/Door dash or the likes and order a Big Mac while you watch one more episode of that tv show. After eating, throw everything in the garbage and you have no dirty dishes.</p>
<p>That's what it makes it faster / easier</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m not gonna lie I don’t know many people who just happen to have “everything on hand” to make a burger all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, McDonalds is closer to me than a grocery store. So getting everything on hand takes longer than just driving 3 minutes to McDonald’s. And I can just walk to two other fast food restaurants. Fast food is much quicker than cooking for myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saturated fat is just fat from the beef, nothing crazy there. You'll get a similar amount if you cook a burger in butter</p>
<p>The salt though is pretty bad</p></div>		</li>
