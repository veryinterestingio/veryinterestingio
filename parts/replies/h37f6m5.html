			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a human travel fast enough to burn up upon reentry into the atmosphere if they freefall from space?</p>
<p>Edit: added clarity</p>
<p>Edit 2: here’s the answer for people wondering (thank you those who replied) to burn up on atmospheric entry, you need to already be traveling at large speeds in space (this is achieved because there is no air or air particles in space to impede you).  When you hit the atmosphere at these speeds is when you burn up. It’s a simple answer but it makes sense.</p>
<p>Edit3: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But will you still burn up if you “hit” the edge of the atmosphere at zero velocity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. The burning is caused by adequate friction between you and the atmosphere. Think about it like lighting a match. You need to strike the match quickly to ignite, you can’t just slowly, softly drag it across the rough paper. The friction creates heat, which combusts.</p>
<p>Edit4: I’ll try to make this the last edit lol. So I goofed, things burn in re-entry due to air <em>compression</em> not air friction. Same idea still applies; slow speed = no combustion, high speed = combustion. <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/28/" target="_blank">Here’s</a> a good explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason stuff burns up when entering our atmosphere is because it's already moving really fast in space. There is no air in space therefore nothing stopping it from going astronomically fast. Once it enters the atmosphere it hits air and meets that resistance but at those extreme speeds, causing it to burn up. So unless a human is propelled through space at these speeds before entering our atmosphere, they would not burn up. Satellites use their remaining fuel to reach these speeds at the end of their life span so they burn up intentionally.</p>
<p>Edit: comment about satellites is slightly off. They are already orbiting fast enough to burn up, the fuel is just used to push them out of orbit and into the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the reason things are going so fast in space is that if they were not, they would fall to earth.  Being in orbit doesn't mean you're far enough away from Earth to have escaped the gravity;  it means that you're moving horizontally fast enough that it counters the speed that you're falling towards Earth.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But say you could be placed 20,000 miles above earth at an exact point with no movement relative to earth so not with a rocket putting you in orbit just magically.  If you start falling wouldn’t you continue to accelerate until you hit the atmosphere potentially going fast enough to burn up?</p></div>		</li>

<p>if they freefall from space?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boundary to space is actually not well defined. The atmosphere gradually gets thinner before a mostly arbitrary cutoff says &quot;this is space.&quot;</p>
<p>But it would depend on certain conditions. Felix Baumgartner did the highest freefall, and was technically at the borders of space. The difference between his jump point and another mile up was mostly a matter of technical difficulty in reaching it on a stable platform.</p>
<p>His freefall actually saw him slow down as he reached thicker atmosphere with a lower terminal velocity. Other conditions would be his orientation in freefall. Bellyflop vs head first sort of thing. Even the material of his suit and it's friction would impact things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>His record was beaten two years later and neither were anywhere near the borders of space, either by the US definition or the FAI one.</p></div>		</li>
