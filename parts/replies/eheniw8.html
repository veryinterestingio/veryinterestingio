			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically sand is used for this purpose because salt has a large negative environmental impact (States and the EPA actually limit the allowed salt run off from private property, and it's possible to be fined for over salting private roads, the fortune 500 I work for had to complete a reduction and mitigation program to avoid state fines a few winters ago).</p>
<p>Where I live, plows will be deployed with salt or sand depending on temperature and wind chill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, I was curious about the run off from salt when I first moved to a cold place. I was thinking that can't be good for the ground nearby and it's all running off into a fresh water river eventually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention with a good sand and salt mix, the friction caused by the tires grinding the sands grains into each other also helps produce some localized heat, making the salt work better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an ugly bag of mostly (salt)water, I always assumed that this is why outdoor temperatures start to be more painful than cold at about that temperature.  At 32F, the air is making my salt water-filled cells cold, but at 15F it's actually starting to freeze them.  Ignoring keratinized layers, of course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Around 10 F, sodium chloride salt stops working.  We saw this in Boston a few weeks ago when we had a snow storm, then sleet and freezing rain before the temps dropped into the single digits.  Salt did nothing at those temps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, while NaCl can work it has many limitations. In places that get snow and cold every year, road crews have a variety of salts at their disposal.</p>
<p>The common spreads do indeed have a lot of sodium chloride, but also tend to have sodium ferrocyanide and ferric ferrocyanide mixed in them.  Those are the yellow or blue you see in bags of commercial ice melt.  How much is in the mix varies by conditions.</p>
<p>Magnesium chloride is a good one, both when temperatures are near freezing and when temperatures are deeply cold. It can diluted into and be spread as an inexpensive brine when temperatures dip slightly below freezing, which confuses people and encourages conspiracy theorists who ask &quot;Why are they spraying hot water on the roads right before a freeze?!&quot;  The water becomes hot because they added the salts, which both warms the roads and provides a thin layer of the salt to help keep the road clear. It can be spread as somewhat costly crystals for very cold conditions, and it gets hot as it dissolves which further helps with the melt. </p>
<p>At even colder temperatures, calcium chloride and potassium chloride blends can be used. They have a bigger price tag, but it gets paid for roads that must be kept clear. </p>
<p>Get even colder, where the daytime high won't clear -20'F or -30'C, most places give up on trying to melt the stuff.  Of course, if you live in those places you've also probably got snowmobiles for your winter travels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the pressure from the weight of cars driving over lowers the melting point, in exactly the same way driving can melt ice on your wind shield because the force of air on your windshield is an increased pressure </p>
<p>The lumps of rock in the grit make it more difficult for the water to refreeze</p>
<p>Water is a fascinating substance with its triple point located where it is, it’s all very temperature specific around that triple point once you get a bit lower ice is what you are getting </p></div>		</li>
