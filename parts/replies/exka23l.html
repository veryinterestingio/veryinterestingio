<p>to illustrate the impact, if we built a metal ring with a circumference 30km larger than that of the equator, it's diameter would be ~9km more than that of the earth.</p>
<p>that ring would float about 4.5kms above everyone's head.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, no.  It would need stationkeeping/attitude control thrusters to keep it &quot;orbiting&quot;. </p>
<p>You need a sphere to cancel out the effects of gravity from an object inside.<br />
A ring doesn't have enough mass to cancel out the increased force exerted on one side as it gets closer to the object(our planet in this case).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've all been standardised now, many are based off of eachother, whoth the second being the main one. Here they are:</p>
<p>Second- as you mentioned. Time it takes for a set number of oscillations between hyperfine levels of the Caesium-133 ground state.</p>
<p>Meter- the fixed numerical value of c in m/s, where the second is defined previously.</p>
<p>kilogram- the fixed numerical value of plancks constant expressed in kg*m^2/s, where meters and seconds are previously defined</p>
<p>Ampere- the fixed numerical value of the fundamental electric charge, e, when expressed in A*s, where the second is previously defined.</p>
<p>Kelvin- the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant, k, when expressed in kg<em>m^2</em>s^-2*K^-1, where kg, m and s are previously defined.</p>
<p>Mole- defined by avogadros number N_A (which was originally calculated from the amount of atoms in 12g of Carbon-12 iirc)</p>
<p>Candela- the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of 540e12Hz light, k_cd, expressed as 683 in cd<em>sr</em>kg^-1<em>m^-2</em>s^3 where m, s and kg are all previously defined.</p>
<p>So aside from the Mole, they are all based on that definition of the second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so i don‘t have any clue about that science-stuff but wouldn’t it be impossible to have a fixed time measurement of a second? Since time is relative? So wouldn’t a second be measured otherwise, like really close to the sun (or a black Hole) for instance?
Or do we just agree that’s how the measurement is in a special point of space (like Boston or you know, anywhere on earth)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Kilogram was the last remaining SI base unit defined by a physical prototype.  It was redefined this past may (2019), along with the ampere, kelvin, and mole, by setting exact numerical values for the Planck constant, the elementary electric charge, the Boltzmann constant, and the Avogadro constant, respectively.  The second, meter, and candela, were already defined by physical constants, and were subject to correction to their definitions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The unfinished one is the kilogram, but they're working on having that measured with some big ball of silicon atoms via a laser, and having mass be based on that. I read something about it a little while ago, but it currently escapes me and I'm on mobile.</p>
<p>EDIT: I was wrong about what they were trying to redefine. It wasn't the kilogram, it was Avogadro's number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats already fixed tho. And the silicon sphere was for Avogadro's constant and using that to fix the KG. Like its all documentet on several wikipedia pages if one trusts that source of information.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was one idea, but not the one they ended up going with.  The kilogram was redefined this past May (2019) as &quot;by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant <em>h</em> to be 6.62607015×10^(−34) when expressed in the unit J⋅s, which is equal to kg⋅m^(2)⋅s^(−1), where the metre and the second are defined in terms of <em>c</em> and Δ<em>ν</em>Cs.&quot;  No silicon atoms needed.</p></div>		</li>
