			<div class="markdown"><p>The initial practice was started by a renowned doctor who said it was the best method to producing great doctors like him because thats what he did. What he failed to mention and what residency fails to compensate for in modern times...the dude was a HUGE cokehead, literally he stayed up that long because he was constantly on a cocaine fueled bender. Still we subject new MD's to this insane, dangerous practice (without the aid of copious amounts of coke) and still act like it's the only way to produce good doctors, it's crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't want to admit the problems of scale the medical system has in America. Honestly, one thing I never hear people talking about is that 1) only so many people are cut out to be doctors; 2) of those people, only so many will be interested in becoming doctors and have the means to do so; 3) of those people, only so many will become doctors. Finally, of those doctors, only so many will submit to the crazy shit we're discussing in this thread--why would you work like this if you could work in a practice over a hospital?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, in a way, what you're saying is... We don't have enough doctors because we don't have enough doctors.</p>
<p>If we had enough doctors, the things we're talking about in this thread wouldn't exist. Which means &quot;being cut out to be a doctor&quot; would mean something completely different than what it means right now. Which means that we could then have more doctors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hope work times for us are regulated. In my country, they abuse the &quot;for the greater cause&quot; clause in our contracts. We work more than 90 hours a week, and pay us like crap, then wonder why doctors burn out or leave.</p></div>		</li>
