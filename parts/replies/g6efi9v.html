<p>Which is to say, EU countries <em>will</em> not investigate their citizens at the request of foreign countries, nor <em>will</em> they extradite their citizens</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it would be fairer to say &quot;may&quot; in both cases here.</p>
<p>No country (EU or otherwise) has to extradite its own citizens or investigate them.</p>
<p>However, many countries (EU or otherwise) <em>will</em> extradite their own citizens and will investigate their citizens if information comes to them from a foreign country.</p>
<p>The UK does both all the time.</p></div>		</li>
