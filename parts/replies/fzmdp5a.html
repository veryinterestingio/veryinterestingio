			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that tigers in the wild were doing remarkably well. Just last few days, I recall reading an article about India practically doubling their wild tiger numbers from about 1,400 to about 2,700 or 2,800 in the last dozen years. Seems very successful. Are those numbers nuanced or in some way not to be trusted ?</p></div>		</li>
