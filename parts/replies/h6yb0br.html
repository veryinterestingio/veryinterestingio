			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, spaceflight has some effect on microorganisms. It has been shown that some (pathogenic) microorganisms increase their virulence under spaceflight conditions, others microbes under study did not reveal any changed behavior. I feel, much more research is needed here to answer this in more detail. Notably, our own studies on the International Space Station showed that the microbial community does not differ much from ground environments (it was a mixture of bathroom/living room microorganisms) - and also their virulence and resistances were not significantly different (except for dealing with metal surfaces).  For the human microbiome: yes, shifts were observed in astronauts, but usually these changes bounced back within a certain time after return to Earth. This has something to do with the increased stress level, different eating behavior or reduced immune activity. But for now we only have insights into a few astronaut microbiomes, and much more work is needed, for sure.</p></div>		</li>
