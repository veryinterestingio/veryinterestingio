			<div class="markdown"><p>This confuses me because I know things fall at the same rate in a vacuum e.g. Bowling ball and feather.. But does not each object have its own gravity it exerts anyway, however miniscule? So therefore if you could somehow drop, say, the entire planet Jupiter and a feather in a vaccum, would they still fall at same rate or would Jupiter land first? As it has a larger gravity and is &quot;pulling&quot; on the ground &quot;Earth&quot; e.g exerting more gravity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Objects subject to the same gravitational field accelerate equally. So, yes, if you separately dropped Jupiter from 10 m above the surface of the Earth and you dropped a bowling ball from 10 m above the surface of the earth, Jupiter and the Earth would collide more rapidly, but that's because while the gravitational field imposed by the Earth on Jupiter would be the same as the gravitational field imposed by the Earth on the bowling ball, the reverse is not true. The rate at which the distance between the two objects shrinks is the sum of both of those motions - the bowling ball, or Jupiter, accelerating towards Earth and Earth accelerating towards the bowling ball or Jupiter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. My description assumes you can ignore the gravity of the falling object itself. When one mass is waaay bigger than the other (e.g. feather falling towards the Earth) this is totally valid, but if we're &quot;dropping&quot; Jupiter towards the earth then we cannot treat it the same way, because jupiter's gravity is even bigger than earth's! Both planets are warping spacetime, and Jupiter + Earth would indeed collide sooner than feather + Earth.</p>
<p>In most settings, the differences between GR and Newtonian gravity are miniscule, and it's MUCH easier to think in terms of gravitational forces to solve problems. But when things are super massive and/or moving really fast, the differences get larger, and GR is needed. </p>
<p>This is most extreme when you're talking about black holes. Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO" target="_blank">LIGO</a> we are now able to detect 'gravitational waves' from the collisions of black holes. But it turns out that calculating the motion of these mergers as they spiral into each other is extremely difficult because we cannot treat them independently, like the feather falling to earth, we need to model how spacetime is warped by both of them as they move. There's a kind of feedback, where each black hole is moving through space that it itself is helping to warp (this feedback is due to Einstein's gravity being what experts call &quot;non-linear&quot;). Only with supercomputers are we able to simulate these mergers. Pretty insane stuff! Turns out falling is a lot more complicated than it seems :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah okay! That's super interesting. So when dropping say, an elephant and a feather in a vaccuum, the elephant exerts more gravitational pull on the Earth than the feather? Thus falls quicker than the feather due to them &quot;pulling&quot; one another? But of course that is imperceptible to any measurements or human eye because the difference in gravity and effects would be so tiny that essentially it's not worth discussing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So gravity is not a force?</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question30.html" target="_blank">NASA website</a>, it’s described s as a force. But then the theory of relativity says it’s not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the user says</p>
<p><em>So in the framework of General Relativity, objects (and light too btw) in a gravitational field fall not because of a 'force' between them, but because space and time themselves are warped in the presence of matter.</em></p>
<p>In the less accurate but still useful newtonian framework it is a force</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think abstractly and imagne yourself in a cart, rolling down a space-time hill, the hill iself is not the force accelerating you, neither is it the thing that caused the hill accellerating you, but instead it is the abstract spacial geometry and the passing of time, so I myself would hessitate to call gravity a force in any case. Though clearly we have many tools and ways to calculate it very acurately, so the explanation is maybe a lesser detail</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A minor point, but &quot;relativity&quot; is a bunch of different theories, that describe how physics works in different reference frames. The kind we learn in school (and use in everyday life) is Galilean or Newtonian Relativity and was understood hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>To answer your question, the theory of <em>general</em> relativity (Einstein's &quot;this is how gravity works&quot; theory) doesn't view gravity as a force in the Newtonian sense. But that is just one way of looking at it; it is also fine to look at it as a force.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the preferred term for these sorts of things now is &quot;interaction;&quot; rather than talking about the 4 fundamental forces, we talk about 4 fundamental interactions, as that is a broader term and doesn't limit us to the Newtonian idea of forces (the weak interaction, in particular, doesn't really work as a traditional force).</p></div>		</li>
