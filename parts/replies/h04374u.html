			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this in ELI5, when you work your muscles really hard, or even over time if you dont, there is a build-up of gunk around the muscle fibres, sometimes from working out or just from being alive, and when you massage/roll the muscles especially, it brings super warm blood to the area to help flush out all the gunk. This is why it's so good to stretch after a workout, because everything is warmed up and there's a lot of blood pumping to clear the gunk as you loosen the muscles.</p>
<p>To expand on this in a less ELI5 fashion:  yes, stretching and rolling tell your brain to release tension from the tendons, in particular. The Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are the tiny little sensors in the tendons that hold the spindles of muscle fibres to a specific tension. By massaging/stretching the muscles and the tendons, the GTOs are the messenger to the brain to tell it to relax. But there is also cellular congestion around the fibres, which is build-up from working out (all the inflammation from the micro-tears and lactic acid) but also just from all your cells doing their thing, which is usually what a &quot;knot&quot; in the muscle is. The goal is to warm this area up to be able to squish the congestion out. When you see someone getting a massage, for example, and they're getting &quot;chopped&quot; (looks like they're getting beaten), it's actually to bring blood to the area by tricking it into an inflammatory response. This blood comes from the spleen, deep in body, which is why it gets so red and hot. The muscle fibres, then, are more pliable from the warmth and extra fluid and more relaxed, at this point, from the GTOs sending the signals and you can press out the congestion from between the muscle fibres, muscle groups and the muscle and fascia much more easily. This is also best followed by some lymphatic drainage to help the body actually get rid of the congestion, rather than it settling back into the fibres. More massage related than stretching or rolling even, I suppose.</p>
<p>There's another mechanism called reciprocal inhibition, which is that, when these signals from the GTOs are going to the brain, the brain can't differentiate whether the signal is coming from the left or right side so in return, it sends signals to both sides of the body to relax. So while you're massaging or stretching one side, the other (to a lesser degree) is relaxing with it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well explained! But isn't reciprocal inhibition about agonist/antagonist contract/relax? Like flex your elbow, the biceps contracts while the triceps relaxes.</p>
<p>Or as that all the same reflex?</p></div>		</li>
