			<div class="markdown"><p>The earlier you get AED and attach to identify a shockable rhythm and shock, the more likely someone's chances of survival. But lacking an AED, just compressions, deep and at the right speed, I can't do more than \~2 minutes which is usually when we switch out in any case. I've heard of people doing compressions for huge lengths of time (like 20 min+ I've heard colleagues say) I always wonder on how much stamina they have, and if the compressions were good after a while!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: low probability of survival, every class I’ve taken has stressed that if you’re at the point of doing chest compressions, the patient is already dead. Your goal is to keep the blood flowing long enough for the professionals to get there and try to make them not-dead anymore. </p>
<p>If they’re non responsive and they have no pulse, you’re not trying to keep them alive. They’re dead. You’re just trying to keep their cells alive as long as possible to help the doctors and EMTs that have a chance to fix it. </p>
<p>So seriously, chest compressions. Don’t feel comfortable giving rescue breaths? Fine, the chest compressions will still help. Don’t know how to use an AED? Chest compressions will still help more than letting them stay dead. Worried you’re gonna break their ribs? Doesn’t matter, they’re already dead, broken ribs won’t make them more dead, but they might make them less dead. </p>
<p>And if the patient still dies, it isn’t your fault. You did everything you could. As long as you can say that, you have no reason to lose sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for saying this. The idea of hurting someone w/ severe physical trauma more has made me fearful of having to use CPR irl. I will remember that I can't hurt a dead person, and maybe I can make them less dead until real help arrives. Thank you...I needed to hear this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m glad I could help! It’s honestly kind of morbid to consider, but I’m glad that it helped! “You can’t hurt a dead person more than they already are” is a good way to put it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AEDs are too expensive to have one at home or in a vehicle. Is this something that can eventually be purchased and carried?</p>
<p>Or are there any programs for people who want to get one?</p>
<p>I responded to a motorcycle accident where I think one of the passengers may have survived had an AED been there, and of course there was not one. They survived critical but later passed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're looking at about $1,000 each for one. </p>
<p>A bit pricey to expect an individual to have one, but pretty much every public place/office building/etc. Should be buying one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be a legal requirement in my opinion. Public buildings should be required to have one externally accessible as well - even if it’s in a box with a keypad lock and dispatch have to give you the code.</p>
<p>What’s $1,000 compared to saving a life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd make the purchase myself if it was, say, $300.</p>
<p>And it was <em>probably</em> too far from a building to have retrieved anything like that. CPR started within two minutes of impact and fire rescue arrived within another five but...</p></div>		</li>
