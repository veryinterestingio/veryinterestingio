<p>That's basically what's going on. Every x number of milliseconds (determined by your CPU's clock speed) it registers what the voltage is. It'd be like every second you touch the wire and write down whether you're shocked or not shocked. It happens thousands of times a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, so 1 gigahertz is equal to 1,000,000,000 hertz. 1 hertz is for lack of better terms, 1 second. So the internal clock of a cpu can run upwards of 4ghz without absurd amounts of cooling. </p>
<p>This means the cpu is checking for &quot;1's and 0's&quot; 4 billion times a second. And it's doing this to millions and millions (even billions) of transistors. Each transistor can be in 1 of 2 states (1 or 0) </p>
<p>It's just astounding to me how complex, yet inherently simple a cpu is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but to be thorough, gigahertz is &quot;billions (giga) per second (Hertz)&quot;. So to OPs point, it's not just thousands of times per second, but billions of times per second.</p>
<p>Internet speeds of 20 Mbps, for example, has a read time of &quot;20 million (mega) per second&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>USB 3.0 is specified for 5gbps of throughput, which is equivalent to 5,000,000,000 times per second. The exact speed varies between connection types, standards, serial/parallel etc</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd like to add that's a theoretical maximum that will never be achieved in real life. (Because of the actual connection speed which depends on the sending and receiving party, switching between sending/receiving and even the physical limitation of cables and connectors.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is timing involved. The whole system marches to the beat of a clock. When the clock ticks, whatever the value of the signal is (1 or 0), that's what the value is, no matter if the previous value was 1 or 0.</p>
<p>As for speed, a common household 1 Gbps Ethernet connection is doing this at a rate of 1 billion times per second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Modern Ethernet uses 5-level Pam. On each twisted pair it’s sending sequences of values from 1-5. This makes better use of the bandwidth. Also, the wires are treated more like radio channels than like wires that can be on or off. Also carrier is used not a shared clock. Ethernet uses frequency to sync timing and amplitude to determine values, like AM radio. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, a human voice over a telephone line (when talking landline) doesn't have to use this method at all.</p>
<p>Instead your speech vibrates something, which as it vibrates alters the amount of electricity (not in zeros and ones, but rather as a precise copy of the sound impacting it) and then at the other end that electricity turns back into vibrations that are the same sound.</p>
<p>No need to turn into 1s and 0s at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s as magic as speaking is. Your brain sends an electric signal to your mouth and vocal cords and they read that signal and move accordingly. </p>
<p>Speaking into a phone is the reverse. The sounds vibrate the phone and those vibrations are turned into a signal that other phones can “read”, and they’ll reproduce the sound on the other end. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's see if I can get this to make sense, at least from the phone to the analog to digital conversion.</p>
<p>When you speak into the microphone, you're causing vibration in the air, which vibrates the microphone. There are coils in the microphone, and magnets. Those magnets and coils move past each other, and what happens when you move a magnet past coiled wire? Electric current. Since the coil is vibrating, the current is alternating. The frequency of that AC changes depending on your voice.</p>
<p>At the other end, an identical current is produced, and driven through a coil in a backwards microphone - or of you prefer, a speaker - and the device vibrates the same way the microphone did originally, and you get sound.</p>
<p>This is of course leaving out the huge middle detail where the signal is translated into 1 and 0. Most likely, the output signal isn't AC at all, but DC switched on and off quickly, because transistors. </p>
<p>Ever listen to something large and electrical, like a transformer or a large motor starting up? The him you hear is the vibration of the metal parts in the transformer or whatever vibrating back and forth in tune with the line frequency, which in the US is about 60 hz. So that big electrical gadget is acting like a speaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don’t get is how a small coil moving inside a small magnet can replicate <em>very</em> specific, personal sounds. This will be very inaccurate, but sure, I can see how a 14k hertz mixed with a 21.3k and a 34.466k or whatever hertz can make an “S” sounds out of a speaker, but how can it make MY “S” sound, and not sound like my neighbor, or a horse, or a robot or something. The coil has a limited amount of travel in the magnet, but it has the ability to transfer that information so specifically to a speaker to make the sound come out almost exactly how I said it. It’s wild. </p></div>		</li>
