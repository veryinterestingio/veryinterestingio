			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really strange example. Because I know I would have answered &quot;blue ball&quot; there, at nearly any age. Good explanation though, so thanks.</p>
<p>Not OP of course and I'm familiar with UG, but that example seems extra-grammatical to me.</p>
<p>Can you give an example or two for</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people thinking about how the would respond basically internalize the question as &quot;Which ball is near<strong>est</strong> to the box,&quot; which is a more logical question for an adult to hear. But children take the question at face value (<em>near</em> the box), and almost never answer the blue ball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Linguist here, I have a great example for that but it’s a bit more complex than the examples in the post you’re replying to. </p>
<p>All language has hierarchical structure, this is about one of the most well supported hypotheses that exists in the domain of linguistics, so I won’t go into justifying it here but instead will just assume it. </p>
<p>Suppose you’re learning your first language, specifically you’re learning to form questions out of sentences with auxiliary verbs, for example “he will run” as a question is “will he run?”  In almost all examples you could learn a rule that says “move the first auxiliary verb to the front of the sentence” and this would be correct. However you could also learn “move the <em>highest</em> auxiliary verb to the front” and this would also be correct. It turns out that kids seem predisposed to learning hierarchical rules rather than linear ones. They know that language is arranged hierarchically and don’t make mistakes that evidence the incorrect use of a linear rule, even when all of the data they’ve seen is consistent with a linear rule. </p>
<p>So forming something like “the boy that can jump will run” as a question, they will never say “Can the boy that jump will run,” even though almost all real questions they encounter will support the possible linear rule “move the first auxiliary to the front.”  The hierarchical rule “move the highest auxiliary to the front” will be the default for this data (in the sentence I provided “will” is hierarchically above “can” even though “can” is linearly first).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, cool little side-thought: it took mathematicians an incredibly long time to introduce the &quot;betweenness&quot; relation of objects in geometry, which eventually settled the debate about whether Euclid's axiom was necessary for geometry. </p>
<p>This is evidently due to the fact that such notions seem so natural or intuitive to the human mind, as you've described. (Similarly it took an embarrassingly long time for them to define the &quot;limit&quot; logically, with the common epsilon-delta defn.)</p></div>		</li>
