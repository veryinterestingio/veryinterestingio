			<div class="markdown"><p>it is inertia! there’s a structure in the inner ear called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolith" target="_blank">otolith</a> which is basically a layer of jelly with heavy crystals on top. when your head accelerates the inertia acting on the relatively heavy crystals causes the jelly to tilt and activate sensory neurons!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely the acceleration, not the change of inertia. If we could sense inertia changes, we'd also be able to notice our mass decreasing with no change in speed.</p>
<p>Whoops! Guess who was thinking about momentum!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inertia is mass * acceleration.</p>
<p>Inertia changes due to either a change in mass or acceleration.</p>
<p>It's more accurate to say this is a change in acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog does this too on the way home. He sleeps pretty much 90% of the ride (since it’s mostly highway)  and as soon as we get near the location (city) he wakes up. I’m assuming he can sense the decrease in speed and knows that were most likely approaching the location.</p></div>		</li>
