			<div class="markdown"><p>You should look. Look often, at different times of year. If you have a local university, call up the biology department and ask them if they have public lab space, a grad student or professor that would show you what’s under the scope, and maybe help you identify some things. </p>
<p>I’ve done it for locals and would again in a heartbeat. It’s too much fun to turn people on to what’s going on in their backyards! What they’ll have that you won’t have access too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fume hoods and isolation units to do things cleanly and safely </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>400x-1000x+ microscopes with much, much better optics and cameras (we have about 10 microscopes and four or five cameras that fit a viewing tube)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fluorescence and other lighting options</p>
</li>
<li>reagents for staining, fixing, and preserving slides, which is how you really get the good images of the little stuff!</li>

<p>One of my favorite memories from grade school was in the 7th grade, when students and faculty from a local university took us to a pond, took a sample of the water, and helped us to prepare slides to view under a microscope. Still to this day I can remember what I saw. The water was <em>so</em> full of life!</p></div>		</li>

<p>the greatest diversity will be in the top 4-20cm of soil, where aeration and compaction should be ideal and organic matter is higher. </p>

<p>Wonder which would be better - an O horizon (which is less &quot;soil&quot; and more &quot;organic debris on top of the soil&quot;), or the A horizon (the topmost layer of what most people would actually call &quot;soil&quot;) you describe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really, really depends on local characteristics...soil composition, hysteresis effects, disturbance, etc. Soils vary remarkably in composition, species richness, and structure sometimes within the same “field.” One fun thing to do is to take samples from cultivated fields at different spots. You’ll find significant differences in microbial communities based purely on “minor” environmental factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>slope</li>
<li>aspect </li>
<li>what type of seeding</li>
<li>what type of crops</li>
<li>history of rotation</li>
</ul>
<p>So, even in a 1 hectare plot of Barley, you can find enormous variety of microclimates and soil conditions, even when trying to make everything “ecologically flat” by tilling, weeding, chemically fertilizing, and spraying pesticides. </p>
<p>But, to answer your specific question, I would expect (and generalize) to find most diversity at that place where humus meets soil (O layer), since this is where macro and micro organisms are actively turning organic detritus into “topsoil.” So O-A is going to be very rich in macros, micros, and general diversity. A-B transition is also pretty active, mostly due to root-associated bacteria, fungi, and <em>x</em>-todes. You start to lose diversity and abundance rapidly in the B soil layer, as mineralization goes up and organic matter goes down, relatively speaking. </p>
<p>But yeah, as a plant-fungal-animal guy, in most places I work dig down to that O-A transition for the most interesting communities. For reference, I mostly work in subalpine farming/ranching areas outside of the tropics. Rain forests (temperate or tropical) tend to have super-exaggerated transitions, “layer depths,” and some interesting structural features which make diversity gradients very “stretched out” vertically. </p>
<p>In a temperate forest, though...you can often gently scrape away the leaf litter down to that O-A transition and find...whole universes of organisms just doing their thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like some of those &quot;minor&quot; environmental factors would be interesting to map and use to compare to sample results. Might find species x, y, and z like a near-zero slope, while a, b, and c prefer a steeper slope with a north or south aspect.</p>
<p>Bet you'd love the area I'm in - near the Blue Ridge mountains. Not technically in the temperate rainforest zone, but close enough. Where I am personally is classified as a dry or dry-mesic calcareous forest, I think. (The calcareous certainly makes sense, with the limestone/dolostone bedrock! On the other hand, &quot;dry&quot; (or even dry-mesic) doesn't seem a very good descriptor of a place with an average rainfall over 50 inches, to me. Maybe it's more about how well-drained the soil is (though that seems to vary wildly).)</p>
<p>I'm in the Earth sciences (GIS, if the mapping interest didn't tip it), so we mostly focused on the structure of the soils themselves than the biology within them, but even then this place is a treasure trove (and as you say, the divisions tend to be pretty exaggerated - good for showing the divisions to students). Some areas with wonderfully thick soils, some places where the bedrock is practically exposed. Some places where it's a bright red ultisol, others with a rich histosol, and I'd bet the spruce-fir (mostly spruce now since the balsam woolly adelgid killed the (mature) fraser firs) forests in the upper elevations make something like a podzol - it's noted the elevation makes them more boreal, like one might find in <em>Canada</em>.</p>
<p>Hell, I live in a suburban area, but I'd bet our soil is better than most any suburbanite's. We let our leaf litter and other organic detritus lie, with the most disturbance being it getting shredded by mowing in some places (while in others, we don't even <em>walk</em> on it). Grass? Feh. If it grows, it grows. More common is probably clover (nitrogen fixation! Bee feeding!), and there's even one area that's more fern-y than anything else (no idea why). The environmental science professor in my dad wouldn't have it any other way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just look at the different habitats and what grows in them on the planet surface. </p>
<p>Soil found near a cave frequented by bats would have completely different composition than soil found in your backyard. </p>
<p>They found a cave in North America that is off-limits to the public but apparently the organisms inside evolved from living in a natural acidic environment.</p></div>		</li>
