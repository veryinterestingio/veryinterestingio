			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, depends what is rotting it, some microbes produce toxins that will kill you, others that are just stanky.  </p>
<p>Theres a lot of rotten food people eat, stanky cheese, those nasty rotten sharks they eat in Iceland, Japanese have stanky fish they bury in a box for years.  The trick to all these nasty rotten foods is to make sure they get rotten from the right stuff.  Ones that will not produce toxins.  That's why they bury the stanky fish so the wrong microbes can't get to them, and when making cheese you deliberately add the right microbes then wrap them up so they are protected, if the rind splits the cheese is usually ruined cos the wrong stuff gets in and ruins it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria by themselves are just cells and are edible, just consider yogurt for example.  If you could somehow ensure your hunk of meat had no toxin or foul taste or disease producing bacteria it should still be safe if half rotted.... but I suspect the texture wouldn't be great</p></div>		</li>
