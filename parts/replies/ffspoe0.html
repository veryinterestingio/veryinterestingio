			<div class="markdown"><p>Heâ€™s right. When you use really hot water, and chemicals, and finally, sanitation liquids, it makes it go quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's 75% correct. There's 2 kinds of sanitizing methods: heat or chemical. Using heat you need to reach 160F at the plate level or most people use chlorine sanitizer as their chemical. This is for mechanical ware washing.</p>
<p>You do not combine the two, if your water is too hot the chemical may be evaporated and be ineffective. I'm too lazy to type a lot on mobile but could type many paragraphs on just this subject.</p>
