<p>Basically I need to dilute honey 1:3 with water to allow the yeast to survive, and turn the sugars into alcohol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. 2 weeks for the main fermentation. Adding flavors and letting it clear or mellow out is what takes so long. Come to r/mead.</p>
<p>If you're good with your nutrients, it may only be a week.</p></div>		</li>

Been wanting to try that out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Various yeasts work just fine. Even bread yeast. They have different flavor profiles and alcohol tolerances, so it can really change the results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently a month into my first batch. One was made with Ale yeast, which is very sweet, and the 2nd is champagne yeast which is nice and dry (and more alcoholic)</p></div>		</li>
