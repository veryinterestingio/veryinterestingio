			<div class="markdown"><p>1) You should imagine it as the weather balloon expanding, the total content of the universe, i.e. the mass/energy stays the same, it is the space in between that grows larger.
The balloon idea is actually the archetypical example. Imagine you've drawn dots on a very big balloon, and you blow it up, then all the dots seem to expand from each other. But the dots themselves stay the same size, nor does the amount of dots change. Using the inside of the balloon one can think of the atoms floating in it. This example is particularly apt because the universe too is (probably) topologically flat like the inside of the balloon</p>
<p>2) Forces remain unchanged because as before the volume the particles or the planets themselves occupy stay the same. However as the speed at which the universe expands speeds up so does the pull apart force. At one point this force will be greater than for example gravity, at this point particles cannot be held together by Gravity and planets and the such will be &quot;ripped apart&quot; by the pull apart force. However at the point this happens most objects such as planets will already have long disappeared.</p>
<p>3) I don't really understand your last question. But lets say time would indeed change. Then as there is no force keeping time &quot;together&quot; this change would be uniform, thus unnoticeable/unnobservable, thus for all intents and purposes non-existent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well i meant that as the expansion increases would time stretch out and start getting longer (slower?) In comparison to the past when the volume of universe was more condensed. I get the whole relativity aspect of it i think.... so that as the time stretches with space a minute is a minute regardless as its locked in with space. But that kinda messes with how i think of time, and now that I've been reading more of this thread im kindA just trying to piece together all these different aspects of the universe. It kind of illustrates the qualitative/quantificative nature of how we measure and observe the physical universe and the subjective means we use to observe physics. I really appreciate how you explained the balloon analogy it kinda helped me grasp the complexity of how all of these different subjects interact. Although i feel like the more i understand about how it all works the more c confused i am about how exaxtly the sum of the parts fits together. Lol im gonna have to put some hours in this weekend going over this thread and referring to wikipedia back  and forth.  Anyways tho thanks for sharing your brain with me lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, don't worry about not understanding it; cosmology is a very novel field and progress in it is mostly the last 100 years. A lot of highly educated physics professors did not believe/grasp the concept of relative time and absolute light speed and we have some of the greatest to thank for discovering it (Einstein, Planck, Friedmann, Hubble, and many more).</p>
<p>Well my answer to your third question was a bit paradoxical because I do not know the <em>exact</em> answer, but my paradoxical answer is: Assume yes, time was &quot;faster&quot; in the past, but as we have no way to observe this (as the amount of things happening in a minute stays the same), time was not faster.</p>
<p>I think you may not necessarily grasp what time is relative means; every observer will observe &quot;normal time&quot; for itself. And a minute will pass by as a minute. However, an outside observer will observe a different passage of time for something <em>outside</em> his frame of reference, but it's own minute will stay a minute. </p>
<p>No one will ever observe his <em>own time</em> speeding up or slowing down, they will only ever measure a <em>different time</em> from speeding up or slowing down.</p>
<p>Now pulling this back to the expansion of the universe, let's say it does &quot;affect&quot; time, then we would only be able to measure it for a universe bigger or smaller than ours. As this is only the case in the future or the past. And the future or the past do not &quot;exist&quot; (for observational purposes), thus this change of time cannot be observed. If it cannot be observed, then physically it does not exist.</p></div>		</li>
