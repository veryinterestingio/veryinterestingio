			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats why i dont like &quot;xx can do yy&quot; terms.
You can say that even if the probability is 0.01%.
That being said im just gonna state that neutrinos can  also pass a 1000 light year thick lead wall without hitting anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, matter is made of way, way, <em>WAY</em> more empty space than actual stuff - about a hundred thousand times more in the least cases. The thing that usually causes particles <em>not</em> to fly through solid objects is being deflected by the electric and magnetic fields created by the actual stuff. Neutrinos simply don't react to those - hence the name neutrino, as in neutral - so they can fly unimpeded through matter until their luck runs out and they fly through exactly the wrong spot and hit the solid bits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this point, we are getting into semantics but there are no &quot;solid bits&quot;.</p>
<p>Everything is force interactions through one of the fundamental forces or obeying quantum laws like the Pauli Exclusion Principle. We sometimes talk about the size of the atoms or nuclei but those are the just the ranges of their forces. </p>
<p>Neutrinos interact only through the weak nuclear force - so the range of the weak force would limit where the interaction can occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its fucking crazy to think about how much empty space in in an atom. like i studied psych in college (so not technically liberal arts, i consider it stem. but not the kind of stem education people typically think of) but i took a lot of physics and chem in high school, and i just remember that blowing my mind when i was first taught it. its still difficult for me to comprehend that solid objects are mostly empty space. i understand it but the information just like does not compute when i try to actually think about it. like solid objects just seem so....solid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you know how your hand can’t pass through a clear window without breaking it, but light can? Now imagine that the clarity of the glass isn’t 100% perfect; a foggy window. Now imagine you have 2 perfectly dark rooms separated by this window and a flashlight on one side. Some light can get through, but not all of it.</p>
<p>Now put more windows in a row between the rooms. Less light can get through, but some will still get there.</p>
<p>Now make them out of lead and instead of light, the flashlights shoots neutrinos. About half will still be seen even if the stack of windows is 1 light year thick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For something even more mind blowing check for videos or pictures of the Super Kamiokande neutrino observatory deep inside a Japanese mine. They put it so deep because pretty much nothing else other than neutrinos will reach there - the neutrinos can easily reach there even from the other side of the earth.</p>
<p>The US is now building something even bigger in the Dakotas called DUNE - Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment</p></div>		</li>
