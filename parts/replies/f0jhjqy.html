<p>When you lower the difficulty it will not look as far ahead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this raises a whole other question.. how does it look ahead when it doesnt even know what you're going to do to counter it's move?</p>
<p>e:thanks for all your replies.. this is something i've always wondered about but didn't find an opportunity to ask. and they say social media makes you dumb..pfft</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say a computer has 100 legal moves. It looks at those.  Then it looks at 100 legal moves you can make for each of its 100 moves. That's 10,000 scenarios to consider. How long does it take a computer to do 10,000 calculations? Like .0003 seconds? Easy.</p>
<p>Even when there are millions of possible scenarios, the engine can calculate them very quickly. It's not until it starts calculating several moves in advance that it slows down, because the number of permutations reaches into the billions and beyond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the math and, assuming the cores do nothing but generating these 10,000 scenarios and can do one per cycle, a CPU clocked at 4 GHz would calculate those scenarios in exactly 0.0000025 seconds.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, the AI machines that play chess automatically are gated in difficulty by limiting the amount of time they have to think about their moves; otherwise, they will continually play &quot;perfect&quot; moves because the computer will see the best moves over multiple outcomes and consistently score those above others.</p></div>		</li>
