<p>Nope. Very different, actually.</p>
<p>Imagine you are in a VR of the Milky Way and the solar system is small enough that you can hold it in front of you. We have shrunk down the entire galaxy to the same size that Earth is in reality and you are out there walking around like <a href="https://i.redd.it/cc33snc68ea71.jpg" target="_blank">Jack Horkheimer</a>.</p>
<p>Orient yourself with the galactic center is to your exact left, the galactic plane is the ground you are standing on.</p>
<p>The solar system, out to the orbit of Neptune, is the size of a CD/DVD (12cm). The orbit of Jupiter is the hole in the center of the CD/DVD (21mm).</p>
<p>The solar system &quot;north&quot; is horizontal, pointed at you, tilted up 30 degrees. It's close to the angle you would hold a book or paper to read; as you look down at this CD-sized &quot;paper&quot; the microscopic planets orbit the microscopic sun in a counter-clockwise direction. The Earth is actually so small that it can not be viewed using visible light. The relative motion of the whole Solar System's orbit in the galaxy is horizontally towards you at a rate of 8mm per month.</p>
<p>Voyager 1 is 26cm from the center of the CD, in the 8 o'clock direction (behind and left) and up 28 degrees.</p>
<p>Proxima Centauri, the nearest star, is in the 10:30 direction (front left), and is 540 meters (⅓ mile) away. It has two confirmed planets orbiting it; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b" target="_blank">one the size of Earth in the habitable zone</a>.</p>
<p>In about a million years, the star Gliese 710 will pass within about 21 meters. I don't know where it will be at the close approach, but right now it is at about 8 o'clock (behind left).</p>
<p>At this scale, light travels 35cm per day. The galactic core is 3,500 km (~2170mi) to the left; this is the same distance as NY to Las Vegas, or London to Cairo. The galactic disc extends about 60 km above and below us and outward (right) another 3000 km.</p>
<p>The Andromeda Galaxy is at the 5 o'clock direction (behind right), and is roughly the distance of the Moon: 320,000km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two planes are unrelated. Planetary systems are randomly orientated to within our ability to measure. Radio observations of protoplanetary disks provide evidence of this. Furthermore, the probability of observing exoplanet transits (as measured by TESS) does not show a dependence on the galactic longitude, which is compelling evidence for random planetary disk alignment. (With the caveat that TESS is mostly sensitive to very short period planets which are themselves frequently misaligned with their star’s spin and possibilities their birth disk.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Greater mass influences lessor mass. The more mass that begins moving in a disk, the more more smaller mass will follow. Eventually goes from a trickle to a torrent. Over a few billions of years it will settle into a pattern (even over light years) and will return to the disk structure even if disrupted by something incredibly massive like a dwarf galaxy passing through it (which has happened to the Milky Way many, many times).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The person you replied to is correct that collisions (friction) is needed to dynamically cool a system into a disk-like shape. </p>
<p>Your answer begs the question: You can’t get masses orbiting in a disk unless something has already made them orbit in a disk. Indeed, dark matter is (probably mostly) collisionless, and so our galaxy’s DM halo is like a fat sphere: it’s spherical because the initial angular momentum of the system was nearly 0, but it is elongated due to the pull of the baryonic matter disk, which <em>does</em> experience collisions. </p>
<p>Good luck ever getting a flat disk of DM though. It’s basically impossible since it can’t dynamically cool through collisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I love when someone says &quot;begs the question&quot; and uses it correctly.  </p>
<p>I think it's worth noting that stars almost never collide, which is probably what Ultralord was thinking about. All the gasses of early galaxies collide all the time before most stars even start to form, and that's when things mostly flatten out.</p></div>		</li>
