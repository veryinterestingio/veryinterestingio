			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in case you are interested. No matter what the scramble is, no configuration requires more then 20 moves to solve.  A Rubik's cube is always 20 or less moves away from perfect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea by a computer, humans don't solve them in 20 moves, they solve them by following a series of steps, and memorizing sets of moves. It is a lot more than 20 moves, but top competitors still solve a 3x3 in well under 10 seconds on average. Check out r/cubers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My youngest son (12 years old) recently got into solving Rubik's cubes. He can solve a 2x2 cube by memory in under a minute. He's now working his way up to a 3x3 cube. Not bad for under a month's work.</p></div>		</li>
