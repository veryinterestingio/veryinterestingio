<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: For people wondering how we know this? They have been taking measurements from North Korean defectors. In all categories (Adult male, adult female, young boys and young girls) North koreans were shorter on average.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit2: Someone replied below that North korean has a predisposition to be taller (From some old survey). This means that the effect is even worse than observed since they were meant to be taller and now they are shorter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a good review article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stulp, Gert, and Louise Barrett. &quot;<a href="https://www.gertstulp.com/pdf/2016_Stulp&amp;Barrett_BR_Height.pdf" target="_blank">Evolutionary perspectives on human height variation.</a>&quot; Biological Reviews 91.1 (2016): 206-234.</li>
</ul>
<p>The article has many counter-examples against nutrition being the primary factor. Figure 1 shows a map of female height and several African countries are shown to have heights similar to first world countries.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human height is a highly variable trait, both within and between populations, has a high heritability, and
influences the manner in which people behave and are treated in society. Although we know much about
human height, this information has rarely been brought together in a comprehensive, systematic fashion.
Here, we present a synthetic review of the literature on human height from an explicit evolutionary perspective,
addressing its phylogenetic history, development, and environmental and genetic influences on growth and
stature. In addition to presenting evidence to suggest the past action of natural selection on human height,
we also assess the evidence that natural and sexual selection continues to act on height in contemporary
populations. Although there is clear evidence to suggest that selection acts on height, mainly through
life-history processes but perhaps also directly, it is also apparent that methodological factors reduce the
confidence with which such inferences can be drawn, and there remain surprising gaps in our knowledge.
The inability to draw firm conclusions about the adaptiveness of such a highly visible and easily measured trait
suggests we should show an appropriate degree of caution when dealing with other human traits in evolutionary
perspective.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Differences in height between populations with similar levels of nutrition are likely down to genetic factors that were established within that population over the course of hundreds of generations, dating back to when populations were much smaller than they are today and population-level genetics had any easier time shifting in one direction or another over time.</p>
<p>Any change within a single population over a short period of time is much more likely today to be a result of environmental factors because the mechanisms of evolution don’t work quickly enough on a population the size of humanity’s to account for population level changes.</p>
<p>That’s for changes in the same population over short time spans, though. Differences in average height between different populations may be down to genetic differences, nutritional differences or both.</p></div>		</li>
