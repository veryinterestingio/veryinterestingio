			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'll give it a go haha. This will be looooooooooong, so brace yourself.</p>
<p>Based on what country you live in, your government likely takes a small portion of your pay each month in some form of pension. I am Canadian, so I'll be using our country's systems to explain.</p>
<p>We have the CPP (Canada Pension Plan) which exists as a pseudo-investment bank for every working citizen in the country. The CPP has two major forms of income: returns on invested funds, and contributions from Canadians. They take all the contributions each working person in the country gives them (5.45% of pensionable earnings right now, deducted from each paycheque), and pay senior citizens their pensions from that amount, investing the remainder in various securities that will hopefully grow in value over time.</p>
<p>The thing is, while you contribute to the CPP today in hopes of collecting your weekly pension from them when you retire, there is an entire group of seniors alive today that did that for their entire working lives, and are hoping to collect now.</p>
<p>The CPP adjusts its finances to anticipate future generations of retirees to make sure there is enough money for everyone to be able to receive their payments. With the current large workforce and small group of retirees, the percentage coming off of Canadian paycheques each month can stay small - that 5.45% of 1,000,000 people's salaries of $50,000 is about $2.725B (1,000,000 people x $50,000 annual salary x 0.0545 CPP contribution). Now we need to distribute that $2.725B to every senior citizen. $2,725,000,000 / 100,000 pension collectors = $27,250 per senior citizen per year. The CPP administers the payout of this pension to each senior citizen.</p>
<p>Let's look back at Japan.</p>
<p>With a similar pension scheme in place, Japan is experiencing a decline in their workforce, as more and more people age. They are also experiencing a lengthening life expectancy. This means that there are fewer people paying the 5.45% towards their CPP equivalent, and there are more seniors on the other end of the equation looking to collect, after 40 years paying into the system.</p>
<p>With only 100,000 people paying into the system earning $50,000 and paying 5.45%, the total contributions only come out to $272.5M. Divide that by our higher population of 1,000,000 senior citizens and each pension collector is only left with $272.5 per year.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan sees these projections, and understands that the investments their pension fund has cannot address such a massive shortfall. In response, they'll need to create new policy to expand the pension contributions, or somehow otherwise address the shortfall by some other macroeconomic policy.</p>
<p>The current workforce in Japan winds up paying much, much more during their working lives to subsidize the lifestyles of the senior citizens, and thus the workforce can't spend as much money on things they want to consume, such as vacations, their own savings and investments, and better lifestyles.</p>
<p>Please note that I yada yada'd a grand majority of how these institutions work, if you're a graduate economics student please don't murder me haha.</p></div>		</li>
