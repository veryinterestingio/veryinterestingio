			<div class="markdown"><p>this can work, but if he plans on making book reading a long term hobby, i would not do this. Itâ€™s kind of a bad habit when it comes to reading and really lowers the speed of reading. If you read every word out loud in his head, he can only read as fast as he can say the words out loud. If he were to practice his focus and concentration, then start how to read by looking at the words and absorbing the meaning instead of hearing each word in his head, he will become a much faster reader, and a much more knowledge absorbing reader.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus one for meditation. I even recommend it for people who have had no luck at all with it, because like real focus proper meditation comes with time and practice.</p>
<p>Tbh I myself still struggle to sit for longer than 5 minutes. But those 5 minutes get more an more tranquil and refreshing the more I practice it. The mental techniques I find in those sits help me with concentrating on boring tasks, keeping my cool in traffic, and not responding sarcastically when a customer asks for something free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the side effects of having dyslexia, at least for me, is I having great comprehension and retention of what I read because I have to fucking pay attention the whole God damn time otherwise I'm skipping whole fucking sentences, reading backwards or generally making a mess of it. Same reason why comic sans is actually great for reading comprehension because it makes everything so difficult to read it forces the reader to pay attention.</p></div>		</li>
