			<div class="markdown"><p>Earlier this month my younger brother was out feeding his goats when he slipped on some ice and fell on a piece of wire. It punctured his arm just above his left elbow. He immediately lost all feeling in his pinky finger and the one next to it, but still had full use. Besides a tetnus shot, the doc said there wasn't much to do for it, but since he still had full use they said it would likely regain feeling. Took over a week but it did completely come back, and not even a scar to show for it</p>
<p>Edit: It <em>did</em> comeback, autocorrect put didn't lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ya, I've had nerve damage in my arms/hands that have mostly healed.  Though they get tingly.  But the spinal cord just has so many nerves in it that doing damage to it is like nuking a city.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, darn autocorrect lol. Yeah, a nerve to the hand is much less severe than the spine. I've got a couple bad discs and when they pinch it's absolutely crippling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual answer is a) we don’t know b) spinal cord is not just nerve fibers like in your hand, which are not “alive”. The spine is more like your brain. It’s living tissue. Wires can grow back sometimes from the still living cells they stick out from . but if you kill the cells in the spinal cord they are gone forever. There are nerve fibers in the spine and they do try to grow across the break but they don’t make it. One idea is that the gaps is too big and there is too much swelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A phlebotomist severed a nerve in my arm during a routine blood draw. I knew something was wrong because a lightning bolt of pain shot down my arm then it felt numb. Specifically my thumb and index finger. They said it was no big deal and acted like I was just scared of the needle (I wasn’t). The next morning at Starbucks, the barista handed me my coffee and my thumb didn’t move. This resulted in me dropping the coffee. I went to the hospital and a neuro exam showed that I did indeed have nerve damage. That was 13 years ago and part of my left forearm still feels numb but I did regain feeling in my fingers. It wasn’t fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I have nerve damage from a cut on my arm and white noise is a good way to put it. It’s sort of constant pins and needles like when your arm goes to sleep after laying on it weird. It’s very sensitive to pressure with sharp pains, but at the same time also has a numb sensation. I’ve had it nearly 6 years now and it hasn’t gotten any better</p></div>		</li>
