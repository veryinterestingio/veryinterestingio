			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be more of a legal question, but what happens if say a sleeping dragon wakes up and decides he wants to burn down 1000 $500k homes one day but the insurance company only has the money for the one house? Isn't it essentially gambling from the insurance company's side that people won't need to use their product?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies and used to cover widespread insurable events - think Superstorm Sandy for example.</p>
<p>Also, the insurance company will also likely choose to insure only so many houses around the dragon's lair to prevent these kind of huge losses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, insurance companies aren’t allowed to declare bankruptcy. Each state has an insurance guarantee association, funded by a tax on the insurers operating in that state, that will cover claims against an insolvent insurer. There’s usually a cap on payouts and basic eligibility requirements, but it’s a critical backstop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where reinsurance comes in… where the insurance company is insured by a bigger company, to  cover the risk of huge disasters and mitigate their risk.</p>
<p>Likewise, insurance companies have money reserves for these types of scenarios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its statistics not gambling, in the same way the casino isn't gambling on you not winning the jackpot, they know the odds and it will work out as expected.  Individual events are random but over large groups they're pretty constant.</p>
<p>Reinsurance helps to make the pool even larger by insuring insurance companies around the country.  Their mega pool makes results very consistent.  If one region gets cooked by the dragon then another probably missed their annual BBQ and it evens out.</p>
<p>If you only insure 10,000 houses then you only have a 73% chance that only 7-13 houses will burn down in a year, that means a over a quarter of the time you're off by more than 30%, you either or you're short, that's not good.  A single big dragon strike makes up a significant quantity of your funds.</p>
<p>If you insure 100,000 houses then the chances of 70-130 houses burning down is 99.5%, so you're only off by over 30% 0.5% of the time.  That's a lot more predictable.  The chances of being off by even 15% (85-115 houses) are down to about 14% so if you reliably take in a 15% profit margin you'll only come up short once a decade.</p>
<p>The reinsurance company is effectively insuring 100,000,000 houses, their numbers are very very consistent over time.</p>
<p>Your dragon is probably best represented by a hurricane that comes in and wrecks say Connecticut.  Its super rare for Connecticut so its not factored into the local insurance, but Florida or Texas or North Carolina didn't get hammered by that hurricane so the reinsurance company is still just paying out for a single region it just happens to be a different one than normal.</p>
<p>The bigger the risk pool the less variation, the less variation the more faith can be placed in the math (provided the underlying stats are accurate and aren't quickly changing)</p></div>		</li>

<p>catastrophic loss</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That has interesting consequences. Don't get insurance if the worst case is not catastrophic. As an example NASA typically doesn't get insurance for its missions, even if they cost over a billion dollars. It won't ruin NASA to lose one of these missions, and insurance would make them more expensive on average.</p></div>		</li>
