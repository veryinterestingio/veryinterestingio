			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always curious if all webs cost the same to make. Black widow seem to make brittle webs where orb weavers have this elastic quality so it seems like hinting costs and materials might be different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm going to piggyback on this and ask if all silk is the same. As you say, some make thin or thick, some make brittle or elastic.</p>
<p>Is it all the same stuff, or are they very different materials?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of webs consists of several types of silk, tho they are probably made from the same basic material. But they make strands for support and sticky ones to catch the prey for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they are! The have silk glands in their abdomen near their bum that are full of proteins, and they produce silk that gets released through these little structures called spinnerets. Cute, right? </p>
<p>Webs are built out of silk, but there are a lot of other purposes for silk: they can use them for protective covering if they are in a hole, use them to wrap their prey, use them for a drag line for safety when jumping, make a cocoon like structure for their eggs (females only), or make a web to put their sperm on (males only).</p>
<p>Also, not all spiders make webs. Some are just opportunistic hunters that wander around trying to catch prey. Some just make a lasso out of their silk and catch prey that way. Another uses a net that they drop on their prey from above.</p>
<p>Please share these tidbits the next time someone you know tries to drag spiders! :P</p></div>		</li>
