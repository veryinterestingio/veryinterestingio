			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a recent thread about a new NFL end zone camera being used that was 4k (a Sony A7 variant, so prosumer level). Many commented on how crazy sharp it looked, but the irony is that the digital broadcast tops out at either 720p or 1080i. The sharpness was likely due to a combination of the sensor and short depth of field, which enhanced the players in the foreground in contrast to the blurred background.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% the lens played a major factor! lenses are usually just as if not more expensive than the camera body itâ€™s attached to, for good reason</p></div>		</li>
