			<div class="markdown"><p>You know the Komodo dragon in London zoo did this. They didn’t know Komodo dragons could do it, so they did a bunch of genetic tests to see if it was like leftover from years ago when she was last with a male, or if they male in the neighbouring enclosure somehow got into her area. But the genetic tests revealed she had provided both sets of DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So <strong>in some cases,</strong> it's still sexual reproduction. The mother is providing two sets of DNA, but they're recombining in a way that makes it a form of sexual reproduction, so some limited genetic variation is being introduced that makes the offspring not just a carbon-copy of the mother. However, both sides of the sexual reproduction come from the same organism, so that variation is less pronounced.</p>
<p>In most cases I can find, it's asexual, though. The daughter offspring are probably clones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cloning is when the offspring have all of the mother’s chromosomes, and so will be genetically identical to the mother. In, Parthenogenesis  the offspring receive between 1/2 and all of the mother’s chromosomes, so it is possible for parthenogenesis to produce clones. When not all of the chromosomes are passed on, some genes will have only one allele, and this will be expressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A clone would be an exact genetic copy of its parent. Parthanogenic offspring do not  create clones. The most stark contrast version of parthenogenesis that I've learned about will result in an organism that is diploid, but completely homozygous at every locus. I know this mechanism of parthanogenesis occurs in some species like the Komodo dragon. Most models I can see of parthenogenesis involve some degree of recombination, but that ultimately means that an offspring produced from parthenogenesis will be somewhere between an exact clone of its mother (extremely unlikely) to an organism that is completely homozygous at every locus in the genome, which is unlikely depending on the species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do these species decide when it’s time for pregnancy? Do they actively decide “yknow, conditions are pretty good right now, it’d be a good time to make some clones” or is it just a random occurrence like they wake up one day and they’re just like “shit, I think impregnated myself again.”?</p>
<p>My first thought would be it’d just be a seasonal thing that happens every spring or whenever, but some of these species in captivity go years without giving birth then appear to randomly do so for seemingly no reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't they later discover it was because the female shark was able to carry a male shark's sperm without using it until she was ready to? I know there's a few species that do that, basically holding onto the sperm in a separate chamber (not sure if that's what it actually is considered) to be used later for fertilization of their eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding genetic diversity is advantageous to the species as a whole because it increases the likelihood of some individuals surviving if the environment changes, and the only way to get that is through random mutation or sexual reproduction. Parthenogenic offspring are all clones of their mother, so having the occasional male in there to mix things up is an overall benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not quite true. Parthenogenesis is often a form of self-sexual reproduction, rather than asexual. It's still producing sexually reproduced offspring, so there's still recombination and crossing-over to provide limited variation. Not all, mind: parthenogenesis isn't a single thing, it's a name given to a trend not a process. In many cases it's totally asexual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also why would there be only one variant, for a total of two &quot;genders&quot;? I imagine they would have produced several variants by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, <strong>there is no species</strong> (like at all) that doesn't have a way to exchange genetic material for reproduction. Even single celled organisms will regularly &quot;kiss&quot;, swap some chromosomes, and split up, effectively becoming a new genetically distinct organism.</p>
<p>The reason for this, is that if your species can <strong>only</strong> produce clones, you become unable to filter out bad mutations. Every clone is still going to build up random mutations, and after enough generations, all lineages would hit genetic dead ends. As such, even parthenogenetic species still need males every now and then to facilitate the flow of genes within a population.</p></div>		</li>
