<p>Endurance: No other animal on earth can run as far a human. World champion race horses have to rest for days to recover from a single race. Humans can routinely run marathons, 42km, with training. There are several cultures that still exist that use endurance chases to corral prey animals into traps or kill zones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand on the endurance point, the thing main thing that gives humans this edge is our ability to sweat. Sweating is specific to mammals, but humans have the most sweat glands by a long shot.</p>
<p>You might think that sweating can't be that big of a deal, but it is major. When running for long distances, we need to expel our excess heat. All other Mammals do this by primarily panting (yes, some of them sweat a little too, but it sucks compared to human sweat), but you can't do that while still running. Sweating works while running, heck, it works better if you continue to move through the air.</p>
<p>Panting works by putting heat into your breath and breathing it out, but you can't put much heat into gas. Liquid on the other hand, can put a shitload more heat into, so our sweating is far more efficient than panting.</p>
<p>Compared to animals, we're like Jason Voorhees, slower but constantly pursuing, all while they get more and more tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans also have other evolutionary advancements that help with running.  </p>
<p>One is the Nucca tendon located at the base of our skull, it allows us to control our head and keep it steady while moving quickly.  It is not unique to humans in the animal kingdom but only animals that are good at running have it and we are the only primates with them.</p>
<p>The second is our butts.  Namely, our Gluteus Maximus.  If you look at our glorious rumps and compare them to other primates, theirs tend to sort of just fall off, where ours (especially in athletic people) are well developed.  This enables us to go farther and faster using less energy.  Perfect for endurance running.</p>
<p>Human physiology is also incredibly tough.  Besides our ability to control our body temperature and rate of breathing exceedingly well, our bodies are capable of recovering from fairly incredible trauma as well, and our ability to handle impact shock is nearly unsurpassed in the animal kingdom.  We say tough as a horse a lot, but they’re actually quite fragile in comparison to a healthy human.</p>
<p>You couple all that with even rudimentary planning/communication/technology alongside practiced tracking skill and knowledge of the terrain/area and you got a recipe for the Terminator of the animal kingdom.  Even looking at the fossil record will point to the massive decline of mega fauna species once human species moved onto the area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to direct energy efficiency, bipedal locomotion allows for great advantages in cooling, particularly on the Savannah.</p>
<p>Reduced skin exposed to the sun
Increased skin exposed to wind
Freeing up front limbs (hands!) allows us to carry and drink water, which aids in that sweating.</p>
<p>Add in the ability to see over grasses and shrubs to follow your prey while avoiding predators.  (Persistence hunting doesn’t work if you lose your quarry.)</p>
<p>But I’m going to add a new element that greatly increased our hunting ability: empathy.  Our ability to put ourself in the mindset of another allows us to do many things: learn from other animals what hunting techniques work (and what plants may be safe to eat!)  Track animals by logically going through what they would have done once you were out of sight.  Also, figure out what makes you look less like prey to the bigger predators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be tricky to work this out. Do you include the ability to plan ahead and pack a bunch of extra water? In that case, do you include the ability to plan ahead build a bicycle? Build a society that can build airplanes? In that case nothing can beat us. However, in defense of camels, some interesting quotes: </p>
<p><a href="https://publicism.info/science/run/11.html" target="_blank">https://publicism.info/science/run/11.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, Yiannis Kouros, a Greek now living in Australia and possibly the greatest human ultradistance specialist of all time, has run 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) in 10.4 days, averaging 153.4 kilometers a day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one famous raid in March 1932, Captain LeCocq and his méharistes covered 770 kilometers in eight days while pursuing the emir of Adrar, who had killed some of their men. In 1911, Captain Charlet and his camel corps tracked the Tuaregs, who had been illegally trading in slaves, for more than <strong>7,000</strong> kilometers. After such long, ultramarathon exploits, the military camels typically needed six to eight months to rest, and badly overworked camels require a year’s rest to recover fully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably humans couldn't continuously pursue for 7,000 km without using really meta tricks like building mechanical devices or setting up a pony-express type thing.</p></div>		</li>
