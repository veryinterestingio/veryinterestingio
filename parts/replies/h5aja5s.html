<p>I don't really understand the pic linked. Is it a closed loop? The picture is also 2D so maybe the nerve goes up one side and down the other and we just can't tell because of the sideways profile?</p>
<p>Interesting fact nonetheless. Thanks for sharing!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Platypus have five male-specific chromosomes (Y chromosomes) and five chromosomes present in one copy in males and two copies in females (X chromosomes). These ten chromosomes form a multivalent chain at male meiosis, adopting an alternating pattern to segregate into XXXXX-bearing and YYYYY-bearing sperm. Which, if any, of these sex chromosomes bears one or more sex-determining genes remains unknown. <strong>The largest X chromosome, with homology to the human X chromosome, lies at one end of the chain, and a chromosome with homology to the bird Z chromosome lies near the other end. This suggests an evolutionary link between mammal and bird sex chromosome systems, which were previously thought to have evolved independently.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>So good luck with that, science.</strong></p>

<p>wow, this really threw me off</p>
