			<div class="markdown"><p>When i returned to work I was shocked when the test they did for us was a swab inside our nose (not in the sinus like I seen everyone else do) and we did it our self. The guy collecting the sample said &quot;stick this in your nose til you feel discomfort and swirl it around for 10 seconds.&quot; I was like uh ok, doesn't take much for me to be uncomfortable.</p></div>		</li>
