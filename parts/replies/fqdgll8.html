			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think terraforming Mars on a planetary scale is likely to happen. It could be a different story if we were dealing with a planet that was already close to being &quot;colonizable&quot;. But Mars is really not. The terraforming process itself would take centuries (and untold amounts of dedicated funds poured towards that one distant goal over generations) to achieve properly. As the timescales over which terraforming Mars would occur are timescales over which vast new technological leaps would likely occur, my guess is that we will be able to bio-engineer a &quot;Homo sapiens martens&quot; capable of living on Mars close to how Mars is today, and/or we will somehow achieve interstellar travel and could reach Earth-like planets that are &quot;ready to move-in&quot;.</p>
<p>What will likely happen, however - and all this is just my opinion -, are places on Mars that are partially terraformed. We could imagine a domed area in which a limited community could live. That's something I think we could see this century.</p></div>		</li>
