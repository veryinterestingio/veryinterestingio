			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually when animals with exoskeletons expand, the space between the &quot;plates&quot; expand. The hard exoskeleton can not expand except for very quickly after molting when it is soft. </p>
<p>Looking up pictures termite queens or honeypot ants you can see what I mean but the space between the plates</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the first time I have ever seen the phrase &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot; in use outside of vernacular Japanese.</p>
<p>Honestly I thought this was some <em>wasei eigo</em> (made up, supposedly English-like words used in Japanese) in place of &quot;obesity&quot;.</p>
<p>Is that an actual thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common phrase used in medicine. For example, when we say &quot;this patient has metabolic syndrome&quot; it usually means that he has dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension or obesity but it is a general term and is not indicative of diagnosis of specific diseases. It usually is used to warn other physician that this patient has higher risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke and in general is in &quot;poor&quot; health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that you mention it, it sounds pretty wasei - which is a bit surprising to me, I'd have expected it to be a kanji compound or something - I thought most medical terms were, in Japanese. (代謝症候群 is apparently what it is in traditional Chinese.)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Right? It's a very strange compound, if it is in fact a compound noun.</p>
<p>it doesn't make sense unless it is one though, because &quot;metabolic <em>what</em> syndrome&quot;?</p>
<p>Is that even syntactically possible?</p>
<p>metabolic <em>something</em> + <em>something</em> syndrome = metabolic {omitted, omitted} syndrome?</p>
<p>Like I would get &quot;metabolic distress and lethargy syndrome&quot;, kind of... but there's a hole there (at best).</p></div>		</li>
