			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that particularly odd seeing as how neurology and psychiatry have vastly different residencies. Your average psychiatry grad will have no idea how to function in a neurocritical care ICU but a neurology grad won't have an issue with it outside of some advanced critical care stuff.</p>
<p>Similarly, I doubt a neurology grad could manage an acutely psychotic patient and then try to figure out whether it's new onset schizophrenia or untreated bipolar type I</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do some time in residency under the other specialty in the first year. Yep, neurology residents are on call and working the inpatient psyc unit alongside psyc residents and psyc residents are “neuro residents” for 2 months inpatient managing stroke patients etc and 2 months as neurology consultants seeing everything a neurology resident would see. It’s required to be eligible for each board certification exam. At that stage, everyone is equally ignorant.</p></div>		</li>
