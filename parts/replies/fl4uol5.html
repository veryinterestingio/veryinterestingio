<p>Can you be more... <em>specific</em>? I know pig and chickens are part of the picture (in chicken affecting more the intestinal apparatus than the respiratory one, I've heard?). Which other animals? Why is the jump to human is so frequent? In which sense it's more their virus then human's, if it jumps back and forth like that?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></div>		</li>
