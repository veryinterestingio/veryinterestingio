			<div class="markdown"><p>As a microbiologist that worked on covid, I can confirm this is pretty accurate.</p>
<p>In our case, it goes from your nose, through the submitting facility, to a courier (if it's not an internal lab), though accession (40 mins due to all the paperwork) to preparation where samples are aliquoted (I got 30 samples done in about 45 mins), to extraction  (90 samples per hour prep, then 45 minute in the machine), to a clean room where extracted samples are prepped further for pcr (mastermix, plate maps, etc. Another 30-60 mins), then 1 hr for pcr.</p>
<p>Pcr processes from receiving: ~4-5 hours</p>
<p>Then it's got to go to QA to ensure the data is read correctly, the submitting facility didn't mess up the paperwork (happens so much!!) Then it gets released to the submitting facility. I have no idea how long they take to release the results. </p>
<p>In short, it takes so long because:
1) we are backlogged
2) we are short staffed
3) it's difficult to get reagents, tips, tubes, etc since the entire world is ordering all these things now. Sometimes we cant get reagents for our machine that extracts 96 samples at once, so we switch to a different machine but it can only do 13 samples at a time, needing to do 7 runs to make up for that loss.  </p>
<p>Oh yeah, and we get ~1000 samples a day which is small-ish</p>
<p>Edit: typo in samples processed per run. Fix 98 to 96.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much of your process is automated? I feel like that would be pretty tedious to prep and plate 1000 samples per day by a limited staff.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your hard work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! I'd say it's almost 50/50. Accession, prep, and half of the extraction is strictly manual. Actually extraction is automatic. Creating mastermix, pipetting to appropriate wells, etc is manual, qPRC automatic.</p>
<p>To put it into perspective, one day we didn't get our shipments of reagents and had to manually extract as many samples as possible. Each person could do ~22 samples at a time, taking approximately 2 hours. This was extraction only. Its taxing being in a BSC inside a BSL3 for that long so we are very grateful for what is automated!</p></div>		</li>

<p>It depends on the lab. Some labs don't have any automation, while others have partal automation. I don't think it's possible to fully automate the protocol (yet).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh, the thermal cycling takes an hour, but the whole testing process takes longer than that. We need time to extract the samples and add probes/other solutions to actually make something happen in the hour that we thermal cycle it. I'd say upon sample receipt until we get that amplification data, it might be 2-3 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, sorry.  I meant to include that as an extra hour in the overhead time, but went down the rabbit hole of QA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, I used to work for a company called TwistDx who are now defunct (their parent company was acquired so their IP was taken) but it was based on isothermal amplification by using a recombinant polymerase mix (they termed it RPA). Using their proprietary mix and the right primers, you can get a readout with 20-30mins and they even made machines with cartridges so it can be done by a nurse at a local doctors' surgery.<br />
This tech has been around for 15-20 years but at the time no one thought it was handy to have quick diagnosis with 20-30 mins without the need of a thermal cycler...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add onto this. I work for a medical courier company. Public health issues usually get picked up within two hours and brought back to the lab within an hour. Your sample would come in with multiple others and the volume really depends on your area and cases. It takes time to sort through and then time to test. Then the results need to be sent back and a lot of time’s they like to send a written letter for documentation on your part. So, say you go in at 8am and that’s when the clinic opens. Expect a pickup (these days) within 2-3 hours. Depending on where you took the sample determines time of arrival but let’s say you live in the same area, with other clinic pickups it may take another 2-3 hours for the lab to process. The lab puts out various results and they get sorted. The results are then put online or emailed or sent by mail or faxed to your doctor who then calls you. So 24 hrs is almost a miracle in the eyes of everyone behind the scenes, really. This was the best case scenario I might add. Some people get in and tested before closing but luckily we have night staff for labs and your results will be ready by morning. Always remember, there’s a bunch of little elves working behind the scenes to put your health first and foremost.</p></div>		</li>
