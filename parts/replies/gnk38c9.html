			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. Just wanted to add that the &quot;after&quot; recordings are often added even in live-action movies for rewrites. This is (hopefully) not easy to notice but sometimes it is--the Artemis Fowl movie likely had a major rewrite, for example, where new voice lines were kind of inserted combined with smart edits so as to change the script without needing major reshoots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always found it painfully obvious in episodes of Arrested Development.  I think that the scripts were so convoluted that, by the time they got to the editing stage, whole running jokes or plot lines would have to get cut.  But it was still necessary to dub in some lines to cover up the gaps and move the story/scene to where it needed to get to.  So they'd use a take from a two-shot with someone's back to the camera and have the actor facing away dub in the necessary lines.  But it would be obvious when you noticed that the actor's jaw line, just barely visible in the shot, didn't move to match the spoken words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you want to see horrible ADR, used for what appears to be every line of dialogue in a movie, seek out <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Governor-Gabbi-Gabrielle-Niebauer/dp/B079NJ3SQ9/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=governor+gabbi&amp;qid=1613440787&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Gov Gabbi.</a>  The full movie used to be available on AMZN; it seems to have been scrubbed from most of the internet at this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they did do a full rewrite and rerelease of season four if that's what you're referring to.  They completely changed scene order and redid the narration.  Was it noticeable in the first three seasons?</p></div>		</li>
