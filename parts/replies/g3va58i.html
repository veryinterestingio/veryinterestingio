			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on shape or size, red birthmarks may just be how your blood vessels formed. A red birthmark may just be that your superficial or skin deep blood vessels formed in that way. If you have had the same birthmark for years or since birth, it's very likely that it's not a big deal. But it's also a good idea to talk with a dermatologist to make sure. Especially if it just appeared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies have been done on trauma in and out of the womb and birthmarks. There does seem to be some correlation but nothing conclusive. Given the amount of variables it's too hard to say for certain. And given the fact that birthmarks are not life-threatening, there's not going to be much funding for it, therefore it'll be awhile before anyone actually will have a definite answer.</p>
<p>I highly doubt anyone would actively argue against you if that was your hypothesis. But no real data fully supports it. Weird thing is that the birthmark could disappear over time.</p></div>		</li>
