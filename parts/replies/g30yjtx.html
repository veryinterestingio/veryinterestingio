For comparison, on Earth, pressure goes up ~0.1 MPa per 10 m of depth. That means you would need to be about 100 km deep for that to occur (~60 miles). This is nearly 10x deeper than the deepest ocean, or more than 3x the thickness of the Earth's crust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to remember one of the moons of an outer planet where it's thought there's an ice shell on the surface, then a deep ocean, then another ice shell, then another ocean, then the crust. I know it's not Europa or Enceladus, but it's one of those icy moons.</p>
<p>For reference, Europa is expected to have a surface of somewhere between 10-100 km of ice with a 60-150 km deep salty ocean underneath.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait what??</p>
<p>STP is ~100 KPa and 0C... water turns to ice at STP. At 1 GPa water turns to ice at around 30C...</p>
<p>If you meant the highest pressure where water is ice at 0C you meant about 630 MPa.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They meant the lowest pressure where water could still be liquid at 0C, at least that's what I interpreted. I think you got it, and agree, but wanted more precision, perhaps differently.</p>
<p>Of course, there's always a relevant xkcd.

<p>If you want to be pedantic, we're talking sea water which is salty, depressing the freezing point at regular pressures and who knows what at GPa. If you want to be really pedantic, even pure water doesn't freeze at STP and ice doesn't melt at STP because energy is released/required (respectively) by those processes, so the temperature must move beyond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bad, the image I had linked had temperatures in Kelvin, and I was looking at Point C which made me conflate 300 K with 0 °C in my head. Was trying to say at 1 GPa you can get ice at room temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you crank the pressure high enough water will eventually reach a solid form at room temperature. This won't be your ordinary ice, but some more exotic version, but solid.</p>
<p>According to the phase diagram from Wikipedia this should happen at around 10k-100k atmospheres. So at a depth of 100km to 1000km, which you won't find on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your pressure vs depth is going to depend on the local gravity, too, so on some other planet, 10k to 100k atm might be a different range of depths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were you looking at the phase diagram of <em>water</em>? Water is unique, the liquid is more dense, so adding pressure actually lowers its freezing temperature. For clarification, freezing temp and melting temp are the same thing (liquid to solid vs solid to liquid). </p>
<p>Wikipedia article for <em>Water</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most substances, the volume increases when melting occurs, so the melting temperature increases with pressure. However, because ice is less dense than water, the melting temperature decreases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deep ocean water actually stays at 0-3 degrees Celsius partly to stay as dense as possible.</p></div>		</li>
