			<div class="markdown"><p>An intro: Israel was the first country that legally allowed research to be conducted on Marijuana in 2016. The Min. Ag declared cannabis a legal crop. This allowed people to legally conduct research on the crop. I work at the Volcani Center, which is the research center of the min. ag., which is akin to the USDA. When cannabis became a legal crop, the question was where to start, I was the first scientist allowed to grow the plant for research. I had to decide where to start studying. When I became licensed to work on cannabis, I had about 25 years of experience in research and cultivation. I spent a week reading and researching scientific databases looking for scientific papers. I was surprised to see that there were no scientific papers on the subject. At the beginning when I was starting my research I was relegated to blogs for my base.</p>
<p>This paper is going to be published soon. Flushing will change the profile of secondary metabolites. We have done some intense testing on this, we have been doing research on different varieties, we have seen that there is 0 effect on chemical compositions of the secondary metabolite. This may be a bit surprising. When we switch from a normal fertilizing solution, to flushing, which is switching to just water, we reduce the concentration in the soil around the roots, which induces an uptake of water into the plant, and therefore changes water relations in the plant. From this, the buds may even feel firmer, and may change the growth of the bud, and changing tissue strength and size. </p>
<p>UV light: Light quality and intensity have a large effect on plant development and on the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites such as  cannabinoid, flavonoids, terpenes. It is reasonable to expect that changes in light quality will affect the amount of  cannabinoid  and flavonoids. There is scientific literature that suggests that this is the case in other plants, but not in other plants. There is a project that we are doing which studies this subject. We are writing several manuscripts to describe these effects. We are studying the effects of light intensity and light spectrum on the production of cannabinoids . UV lighting can induce stress and damage on the plant, stress conditions on the plant such as these induce secondary metabolites. A short pulse of UV light on the plant, can stress the plant and change the secondary metabolism, and can potentially specific cannabinoid concentrations. There are initial studies that are showing that short term stress on the plant that demonstrate this. In the cannabis industry people believe that other stressors will also have a similar effect. Wounding the stem, leaves, exposing the plants to periods of darkness, all these mild stressors will have an effect on the secondary metabolism of the plant. We are seeing  in current studies in my lab, that mechanical and chemical stressors affect secondary metabolites in the plant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are very concerned about residual pesticides in the cannabis product. Therefore much research is being done in my lab to evaluate natural botanical compounds as pesticides and insecticides, such as terpenes. Terpenes, which are found in oranges and cannabis itself, are being sprayed on the plants, and we are reviewing its pesticide  and insecticidal effects. We are also checking conventional pesticides and insecticides. We are trying to ensure that no toxic chemicals remain after harvest. We are looking to see that these pesticides do not harm the cannabinoids in the plant. Currently we are finding that the natural botanical treatments have not affected cannabinoid concentrations.</p></div>		</li>
