			<div class="markdown"><p>Came to comments to see if anyone mentioned aphantasia.  I grew up thinking a &quot;mental image&quot; was a figure of speech.  I sort of describe it now to folks as if I have the image in my mind recorded on film, but the room is perfectly dark.  All the information is there without any of the visual component.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always hated when I would be in a room guided to picture something. The instructor says, “Can everyone see it?” And I peek and everyone is nodding. I thought I just lacked a skill or something, but it turns out I’m just built different and others are too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve described it as a minimised window of a computer that I’m drawing on - I usually start with a vague idea of what I ‘know’ and add details to it, and I can ‘save’ that to pull back up later. It’s so weird cause I am a visual person and have great creative skills. I can ‘hear’ my voice in my head and play music though and I have no musical skills haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good metaphor. I can hold the image for like a second before it blurs and disappears, I like to say it's like a strobe light going off once. You can see an image for a brief moment and then after that you have a general memory of where things are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  I was about to respond &quot;you can what now?!&quot;</p>
<p>I literally thought until just now that the phrase &quot;picture something in your head&quot; was just an idiom.  But if other people can actually conjure an image with the same level of clarity that I can for auditory information (like getting a song stuck in my head), I definitely can't do that.</p></div>		</li>

Only a few short years ago I discovered not everyone has an inner dialogue either!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I have aphantasia but I definitely don't visualize things in my head, it's more like I conceptualize it. I can have an idea what something will look like but I don't &quot;see&quot; it so much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sounds like aphantasia.  It seems to be a spectrum, with some of us on the far end seeing absolutely nothing.  I can conceptualize stuff too, but I don't see it.  When I close my eyes, the only thing I see is black, or light through my eyelids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t exactly “see” an imagined image. I’m not sure how that works but it’s processed differently in my brain somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I can almost kind of picture things when my eyes are open, but the harder I try, the more the image fades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Conceptualize&quot; is a great way to put it. I don't imagine visuals and I don't think in monologue, my mind is just concepts moving around in nonspatial space :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too! Like I know what a castle is, and I know what they look like, but I can’t see the image itself in my head. It’s more of an idea or a feeling.</p></div>		</li>
