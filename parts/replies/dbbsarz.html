			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a sleep scientist who studies sleep. EEG is not the only measure by which we classify sleep. Normally we take long blocks of sleep recordings and break them into small epochs. Each epoch is analyzed to determine the state. The state is determined by both EEG (brain activity) and EMG (muscle activity). This is because wakefulness has high muscle activity and high frequency low amplitude (mixed frequency) EEG (brain waves), whereas NREM sleep is slow, high amplitude low frequency waves (slow waves). REM sleep is similar to wakefulness, especially in humans, when looking at EEG activity. What actually helps us determine that is the muscle activity. During REM sleep (the sleep that i study) muscles are completely paralyzed. Well skeletal muscles are paralyzed. What is interesting is that there are periodic twitches (watch your dog or cat next time they sleep) that break through this paralysis. At any rate, these activity monitors cannot really tell when one is in REM sleep. It just cannot because it does not accurately measure these criteria. It may gave you some indication of the time you slept and is guessing based on the lack of movement (assuming paralysis) to determine rem sleep. But it would never be as accurate as actual EEG and EMG recordings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question: are there any disorders where you dream every night (and remember them) and never feel rested? I've been to several doctors and psychologists, they say there isn't. I dream every single night and I always remember 3-4 of them. Once I counted 8! I've had an EEG and an MRI that showed everything was normal. </p>
<p>I never feel like I'm actually sleeping, just watching movies all night. I wouldn't classify them as nightmares all the time but they're bizarre and vivid. Not Dali bizarre, just wtf bizarre. Last night's dream was being stuck on a Spanish galleon with an ex. </p>
<p>As soon as I put my head down I go into a dream. I know this because I'll nap for an hour and recall at least 1- 2 dreams. </p>
<p>The only time I don't remember my dreams and actually feel rested is being drunk or taking a benzo. Neither of which I would ever do regularly because of the dependency factor. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: are there disorders that cause you to dream and remember them too much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You remember dreams when you wake up out of REM so if you're remembering them multiple times a night then you're waking up each time. If you're concerned you're Narcoleptic (REM invading wake) have a sleep study done. An EEG during the day would be useless if you're not sleeping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is getting more and more common. You never feel rested from sleep. I have it. I just woke up and feel no different than I did right before bed. </p>
<p>It's a syndrome, which means it's a collection of symptoms that they do not know the cause of yet. In the past few months however, they've found that I have something called &quot;Silent Reflux&quot; which is a disease where you reflux the contents of your stomach into your esophagus all day/night. I'm taking massive amounts of medications to fight the acid, so the contents aren't acidic anymore. But there's still pepsin, bile, things like that. All of which cause irritation. I'm even aspirating this stuff up into my sinuses which leads to symptoms indistinguishable from an allergy attack. I'm scheduled for surgery next month to make mechanical changes to my stomach/esophagus that will stop the reflux. The hope is, that the irritation is hurting the restfulness of my sleep, and therefor repairing the reflux will also improve my sleep. Time will tell.</p>
<p>But there are many other things that could cause Chronic Fatigue. You should talk to your doctor about it. Even if they don't find any other cause that they can treat, they can refer you to a shrink. Many people have success with stimulants normally used to treat depression and anxiety, suggesting that mental health plays an important role in the disease. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to smoke weed. Not a lot of a weed, but I would smoke at least a little every day or every other day. During that time, I <em>never</em> remembered dreaming. Not that I didn't remember my dreams, but that I had no recollection of ever dreaming. </p>
<p>Whenever I stopped smoking for a period of time I would suddenly be inundated with dreams. It feels like I don't get any sleep because I'm constantly dreaming, and my dreams wake me up in the middle of the night. I absolutely hate it. As soon as I start smoking again they go away. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm getting older now and having some respiratory issues. That combined with my professional life, I really can't smoke anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a long time ago something about quality sleep coming in roughly 90 minute blocks. I believe I came across this when reading about alternative sleep cycles like the ubermensch or whatever. The kind where you sleep 4 hours every 7 hours or whatever, those kinds of weird ones. </p>
<p>The source I remember said that obviously there's one big &quot;power down&quot; stage, but then we kind of cycle into deep, restful sleep through a 90 minute cycle. So the goal was to wake up at the end of one of those cycles, otherwise you were breaking a REM stage and you'd feel like shit.</p>
<p>What say you, Doctor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep cycles are roughly on average 90min. However this is an average and we deviate from the mean on an individual basis. So simple calculations on 90min does not exactly do it justice. Why is this an issue? Bc like you said, interruptions during rem sleep is not fun. Waking up during a rem sleep period feels awful. It's what we sleep scientists refer to as sleep inertia. Set a gentle slowly increasing volume alarm, movement detector or slow light increasing alarm.</p>
<p>As for alternate sleep cycles. Don't bother with them. Read the literature if you want but the general consensus is that they do not provide the same sleep quality as getting a good night's rest in one solid block. Provided you have good sleep hygiene. Going to bed on time, no caffeine before bed or strong light prior to bed, and provided you do not do anything in bed other than sleeping and fucking. Stop watching movies and gaming in bed bros</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We'll see much more SWS (slow wave sleep/&quot;deep sleep&quot;) when a person is intoxicated. As the alcohol wears off, you move back up in stages and you're not going to have a good time. Ever notice when you're drunk and go to bed you sleep really well for a few hours and then wake up, usually from apnea, and can't go back to sleep? Yeah that's from the alcohol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Playing Devil's Advocate here... wouldn't the main reason they don't want to be considered a medical device be because there are a lot more hoops to jump through and liability associated with that label? </p>
<p>If they have peer reviewed papers validating their claims, wouldn't that be pretty good evidence that they are useful?</p>
<p>I don't have strong feelings on the matter but Reddit was all up in arms earlier about the DEA not considering CBD to have any medical use when it clearly does so I'm of the opinion it's maybe one of those &quot;do we really trust the people handing out certifications anyway&quot; situations. </p>
<p>Again, I just think some skepticism is healthy. I like to hear all sides of a story before I put too much thought into it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The devices' measuring methods do not include EEGing which is a minimum requirement for analyzing sleep. Scientists would call bullshit at this point already. &quot;Medical device&quot; means a fuck ton of lengthy regulations. IANAL - I cringe every time I have to read EMEA or FDA regs. Producers in the medical sector are actually law firms with a drug department. You can start to sell your device in time for xmas ... 2021. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed you're right - and scientific accuracy, from a business point of view, is just one of these &quot;hoops&quot;. </p>
<p>I completely agree with you also that the FDA (or the DEA, or any other red-tape heavy organization publicly funded and operating according to the Peter's Principle) are completely inefficient in promoting scientific progress through their &quot;certification&quot; policies.  They are the absolute WORST possible example of what a nanny-state can do. Crony capitalists big pharma love them - because they protect their monopoly by preventing small/new players to come up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will say this: sleep cycle was good with their alarm. From what I read there's a very strong correlation between amount of movement and stage of sleep (more movement = more likely partially awake or very light sleep). Their 30min window alarm that goes off when you start shifting is awesome. I was wayyy less groggy when waking up from the first day of using it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to mention this as well. Sleep Cycle is actually mind blowingly good and you can set the window to 15 min cuz sometimes waking up 29 minutes earlier than my alarm is a bit annoying.</p>
<p>Overall such a good app, haven't had a friend for whom it didn't work</p></div>		</li>

<p>Been using it for years.    If I wake up when it tells me,  which is usually earlier than I want to get up.  I wake up happy.    If I say fuck it,  disable SC,  and wait for my back up alarm to go off I'm groggy as can be </p></div>		</li>
