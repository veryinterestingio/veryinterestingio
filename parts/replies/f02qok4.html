			<div class="markdown"><p>this was me until about 2 months ago. i'd get comfortable, then wake up racked with back pain. or shoulder pain. depending on the position i fell asleep in.</p>
<p>then i started taking cbd pills before bed and i haven't had pain problems since. didn't go in to it thinking &quot;i'll take these to sleep better&quot; but thought it could help soothe some aches and pains. </p>
<p>getting great, pain free sleep is just a bonus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it's great that you're now pain free, you're not problem free. Pain not being present is not a sign that everything is okay. Sounds like your bed is not the right one for you, or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh, for sure. but i'm married and my wife love the bed so i'm stuck with it until she decides it's not good enough anymore.</p>
<p>haven't given up on the idea of there being a back alignment problem or whatever but cbd helps me get restful, fulfilling sleep instead of tossing and turning every half hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bear in mind that sedation is the opposite of sleep. People often think being sedated is the same as sleep or helps sleep, it's the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but he's taking cbd - which hasn't been found to have sedative properties. In fact, it seems it may reduce the sedative properties of thc.</p></div>		</li>
