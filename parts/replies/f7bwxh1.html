<p>I bank with Wells Fargo, and once paid someone with a check that they didn't deposit immediately. When they did the withdrawal came up as processing on a Wednesday and I got an insufficient funds notice. Like always I transfered just enough money so I wouldn't get the fee for it. The next day I got another insufficient fee notice so I logged in and saw it was because I got charged the fee anyways. I also noticed that the check that was processing Wednesday now showed that it had precessed and posted on Tuesday. Well on Tuesday I didn't have enough to cover that so of course I recieved my fee. I went in to the bank and they gave me some money back for the fee and said it's my responsibility to know that the check was out there and to have enough in the bank to cover any checks that I had written. While I do agree I should have enough money in there, I don't agree that they should be allow to process a check and then post it for a prior date to intentionally cause an fee. Is this what you are talking about with &quot;check reordering&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The other shitty thing they do is cash or process the largest checks or transactions first and go down in numeric order from there all in hopes to generate NSF fees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been through this with other Banks that have since been bought by bigger Banks due to this practice.</p>
<p>I would date checks and make transactions that I know will post the same night my direct deposit would post. Sure enough, bigger transactions (even out of order of the transaction) would post and trickle down to the lowest. Then the DD would post and hundreds more dollars would be gone then expected, just to insufficient funds fees.</p>
<p>6x$35.00 = $210.00 due to this</p>
<p>Yeah, not good money management to play this game, and I don't do this anymore. But the banks stacked it in their favor and I rarely if ever got any of the NSF returned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I complained about this once and I was told that they do this because larger checks are very often house or vehicle payments, and people get very upset if the bank pays all the little checks first and then returns the house or vehicle payment to the lender as unpaid due to insufficient funds. I don't know if this is just a convenient excuse or not, but I can easily imagine such complaints being made.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had 300 dollars in my account<br />
Went to walmart and got groceries (50 dollars)<br />
Went to mcdonalds and got some food (8 dollars)<br />
Went to school and paid a fee for 20 bucks<br />
Went to an ATM and got 20 in cash out for something  </p>
<p>Then my roommates cached three rent checks that they had saved up for 400 dollars total.<br />
I got hit with 1 35 dollar overdraft charge for the third rent check that put me over, then 1 for walmart, one for mcdonalds, 1 for the school, and one for the ATM fee, so 150 dollars in fees.   </p>
<p>And of course my account was in the negative until my next pay check which was 20 dollars a day, until my roommates let me borrow some money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>NACHA is extremely annoying but I worked on a team that was able to create a tool to quickly validate and find line numbers for NACHA file errors. That project made me want to never deal with NACHA again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Join a credit union. They are non-profit and not ran by shareholders but instead volunteer board of directors and are considered &quot;member owned&quot;. In my experience they tend to be more honest and less money hungry. I liked my local credit union so much I started working there and have met a long time career goal of breaking into IT work. Do some googling for good rated credit unions in your area then go in and talk with them. They will answer any questions you have and go over the requirements for becoming a member. If you have any more questions I'd be happy to answer them here as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money sent through the ACH still takes time to go through.  There are (quite intentional) delays as described in the grandparent post to allow for verification.</p>
<p>Some banks and many credit unions will credit your account when the ACH transaction is still pending, but it comes with a risk. If the transaction fails for any reason it will be backed out, and you will have spent money that isn't there.</p>
<p>It is most obvious for office paydays, there are some people who have access to their direct deposit one or two days before the scheduled payday. Generally the payment has not fully cleared the ACH, but the financial institution shows the money in your account while it is still in a pending state.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The credit union near me charges just as many fees and is equally as scummy as the big banks. I just went with an online-only bank. Haven't had any issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While credit unions on average are better than big banks there are real limitations. I loved my small local credit union as a student in Maine with the headquarters about a half mile from my apartment. I loved them a lot less when I moved to upstate NY and they charged an ATM withdrawal fee at a CU24 ATM listed as within their network, or when I wanted to transfer money from my French bank account at the end of study abroad and discovered they weren’t set up to accept international transfers (didn’t even have a SWIFT code). Credit unions are a great solution for many people, but you should assess your own financial situation and figure out what the best match for your needs might be. For me that’s currently a small local bank in my area with a free checking account, for my younger sister currently in grad school moving between a few places fairly frequently, it’s a major national bank with operations both at school and home, for my parents it’s the same credit union they’ve been at since the early 00s.</p></div>		</li>
