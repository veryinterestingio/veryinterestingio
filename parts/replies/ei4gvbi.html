			<div class="markdown"><p>A curious sidenote on the subject of whats innate to humans. </p>
<p>The french (anti)psychiatrist Fernand Deligny, who among many other things worked with autistic children for many years, suggests that the human equivalent of spiders webbuilding, or beaver's dam building, in many cases gets overridden by, or is in conflict with, conscious, intentional thought. IN other words: we humans like to think ourselves in control, and so we struggle with the innate.</p>
<p>He suggest, though, that if we are to talk about any innate activity, it would the construction and participation in social networks. Not as in facebook, ofc, but as in webs of social relations to other people. The innate in humans is this act of entering into relationships with others; instead of building webs of threads, like the spider, we build webs of social bonds. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, since it is our mind that we use to study ourselves, we pretend to separate ourselves from us, which is impossible to do completely. </p>
<p>It's also distasteful to many to think we don't have free will in every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>But, there's nothing as cozy or welcoming as a campfire and friends. </p>
<p>There are studies from Iceland that demonstrate a correlation between famines in one generation and obesity in a downstream generation, especially for the offspring of women that experienced famine during pregnancy. The grandchildren will tend towards obesity. There is some evidence that the epigenome adapts during the famine and is passed down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just a guess but It probably depends on the individual at that point. I'd say most would be happy with a bed and just be whatever about it. </p>
<p>One might be happy with somewhere comfortable like that one might want to make their own then might decide after that to use whatever is most comfortable if given both after filling that instinctive role and rationalization comes into play. One might insist on using something they built themselves. Because they are fairly intelligent I'd say those are the results you would get I have no idea about the ratio you would see in practice though. Seems very human which means I'm probably right considering its monkeys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example of language being hardwired in humans is the creation of creole languages by the children in a community (usually slaves) which crudely communicates with a pidgeon language.</p>
<p>To minimise the risk of revolt they used to have slaves who spoke different languages so they couldn't communicate effectively. These adult slaves create a pidgeon language which contains mostly nouns and almost no grammer. (Hold something up and everyone agrees on a noise) Their kids take that foundation and create a complete language around it with grammar and verbs and everything.</p></div>		</li>
