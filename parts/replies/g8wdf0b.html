			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually super interesting. Moving towards or away from an object affects how you view that object in time. If you were able to see a planet billions of light years away while you moving towards at a significant percentage of the speed of light, you could actually be looking at that planet hundreds of years in the future compared to your reference frame. This seems to imply that past, present and future may simply be an illusion. Here is a 10min clip from an old PBS doc where they talk about this. </p>

<p>If we were to go on the opposite side of things and looked at Earth through a telescope millions of light years away, and they were able to zoom in or magnify it some how, the light they would see is light from when dinosaurs ruled the planet. They would never know there was a civilization here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you somehow managed to move faster than light, you'd move forwards in time.</p>
<p>Imagine if you take off from Earth at that speed and go to a far away planet. You're faster than light, you land there but the light of your rocket taking off from Earth hasn't reached that planet yet, even though you already have. </p>
<p>You'd watch yourself get closer and closer to you, then actual you would jump out of that rocket and walk to the spot where you'd be standing, and then &quot;you&quot; would merge with you. Light would catch up with you if you stood still for a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you broke my brain. So, assuming everything is happening at once, is that a real &quot;you&quot; that you are seeing? Or just the light you gave off? If it's you, wouldn't you see yourself standing there waiting for yourself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It requires infinite energy to move any object with mass the speed of light. You'd need a way to reduce your mass to zero...which for all we know is impossible.</p>
<p>That said, you'd obviously never reach the planet if you could travel the speed of light. If space were not expanding, traveling the speed of light would appear that the universe would contract to a single point. I'm not sure what you would observe with space expanding, but my guess is that such space wouldn't appear to contract as much (for space expanding &lt; c). With space expanding = c, it'd probably look normal to you, and space expanding &gt; c you probably wouldn't even be able to observe those planets due to photons speeding away from you. But idk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the human is very much equipped to understand this.. because the human invented it.</p>
<p>Time is a unit of measurement we created. We could have connected the second to anything but we first connected it to the what we saw, the sun. The day. Then the fraction of a day and the fraction of that fraction.</p>
<p>We decided to anchor the &quot;second&quot; onto &quot;<em>&quot;the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom&quot; (at a temperature of 0 K). This length of a second was selected to correspond exactly to the length of the ephemeris second previously defined.</em>&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second#%22Atomic%22_second" target="_blank">wiki</a>)</p>
<p>We use this invention as an observationly built base or origin for building our mathematical world and understanding relationships in it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am not sure why so many of you think &quot;Time and Space&quot; are the same. I think you are confusing the <em>mathematical models</em> that use a specific grouping of the concepts time and space to reveal more insights about the world. But Time and Space are different entities physically... in that neither technically exists outside of our imagination or lack of understanding.</p>
<p>But the notion of &quot;space&quot; not existing is a different topic, one that is illuminated as you look smaller and smaller inbetween the gaps of reality, where first we saw these magical things called &quot;germs&quot; which were affecting us and not &quot;the spirits of space&quot;. Then we look smaller and see the molecules the germs are made of.. then the atoms those molecules are made of.. and so on.</p>
<p>I think a lot of you don't understand this topic and are projecting that lack of knowledge onto the answer to the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about understanding what a second is. It's about the human brain did not evolve to be capable understanding the time scales and distance scales involved with cosmology.  Very, very few people even have a solid comprehension on how big the solar system is, none-the-less how big the entire universe is or how small a Planck distance is. The human brain can not comprehend how long 100,000 years or 1,000,000 years or 1e-12 second is. </p>
<p>And calling space and time the same is not the definition of &quot;same&quot; you are using. It is a statement that time and position are inseparably linked in a 4 dimensional space. It is impossible to accurately describe a system without position and time. One can not exist without the other, unless our entire mathematical model of the universe, including special and general relativity, is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't it take you 60 years to get to your destination. Since you are traveling at light speed for 60 years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the point. It will take you 60 years from every frame of reference except your own in which the travel will be instantaneous. You won't age at all while everyone on Earth and at your destination will age 60 years. This shit is wild.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't true. The only reference frame where it takes you 60 years is the Earth's one. Any other observer moving at an arbitrary rate relative to you could see you make the journey in an arbitrary amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soo...if we would (in theory) ever achieve lightspeed travel with humans on board the problem of &quot;this galaxy is a million light years away, we need to build a mobile space station that thousands of generations can live on and those will reach it someday&quot; would solve itself? Since the people starting from earth wouldn't age and they would reach the planet while earth might not even exist anymore? Is that how that &quot;could&quot; work if lightspeed as achievable? :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time (and space) is relative and the experience of time for different observers may be different. One of the premises of the theory of special relativity is that when observing an object that is moving relative to you, the time on that object will appear to run slower.</p>
<p>For a stationary observer it may appear to take 60 years to get to the destination, but for the observer on the spaceship (who thinks they’re in fact stationary and the universe is moving around them) their perception of the length of space they travel through will contract and moving at the speed of light means that physically the distance they have to travel has been contracted enough to be 0 and they get to their destination instantly in their frame of reference.</p></div>		</li>
