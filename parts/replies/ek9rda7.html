<p>Cats have oil on their fur that gets converted into vitamin D if they sunbathe. They lick their fur to get it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Also not to shoot down your solid source but we should probably restrict the results to the tested race of dairy cows. Things might look different for e.g. Highland cattle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vet student here, coincidentally just learned about vitamin D pathways and usage in our animal species this week. I could probably look up a specific research paper if you wanted it, but I can at least tell you that our vet science textbooks all agree currently that cats and dogs can't utilize UV light for vitamin D production and require it in their diets, while domestic ruminants and horses are able to make their own. I'm sure there could be breed differences in the level of production based on areas of the world each breed was developed in, but we don't have any reason to believe right now that any breeds of cow are unable to produce vitamin D (and with the amount/depth of nutrition research done in dairy cattle especially, and more so the focus on calcium required for milk production, it can be fairly assumed that our other breeds utilize UV light all the same since we haven't found anything to the contrary). </p></div>		</li>
