			<div class="markdown"><p>Does being more fit while taking something like MDMA result in a lower resting(average) heart rate than that of someone who is unfit?</p>
<p>In other words, would a fit person be more tolerant of the effects of an increased heart rate or blood pressure than an unfit person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fit person would fair better for most things. It's one of the advantages of being fitter than average. Your immune system is boosted by your better circulation, your body metabolizes toxins more efficiently, your hormones are less likely to be unbalanced. Basically, being fit means you like a very well maintained car. Taking drugs can be equated to a road trip. You're less likely to have a serious issue from taking a road trip in a well maintained car than in one that hasn't been driven for half a decade nor maintained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good analogy about being fit and the car/road trip. In general, being in good shape makes you better at dealing with pretty much all stressors. Surgery, illness, etc. </p>
<p>Of course, there is always the wild card of genetics. Some people smoke like it's an olympic sport and never get cancer and sometimes healthy people die of heart attacks. Overall though, being in good shape is a huge advantage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the car analogy I would equate it more to drag racing your daily driving car. The car wasn't built for that type of immediate strain but is more likely to not have a major issue if its been properly maintained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s kind of two questions here, but in general someone that’s physically fit/healthy is less likely to experience complications from taking MDMA, or most drugs for that matter (excluding allergies etc.).</p>
<p>In terms of resting heart rate being lower in the case of someone being fit, the answer is kind of yes but that’s also true regardless of what drugs you’re on. Measuring your resting heart rate is a good way to benchmark progress in your individual fitness journey but it’s not necessarily the best measure of fitness compared to others. V02 max is considered a better measure of cardiovascular fitness by many, but it’s not worth getting into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always thought uppers were like putting nitrous on a car. On a strong engine or a sports car it can probably take a little nitrous just fine. Too much and even a strong engine will fail. But even a little nitrous on a engine no way capable of handling it, and you are toast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice analogy, seems to be a lot of comparisons to cars in this thread.</p>
<p>Even the most well-tuned sports car will break down with too much nitrous and not enough maintenance.</p></div>		</li>
