			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only just a theory that has less credibility the more we find that preference for spice actually varies across individual animals much like it does for humans. For a while it was thought pretty much anything that wasn't human wouldn't like spiciness so they never really tested it with many animals. Now that they are trying it out with other animals, they're finding it's more of a personal preference in species that have receptors that Capsaicin binds to and not actually an evolved trait to avoid them. For example you could have say 10 rats and 2-4 of them would probably actually prefer spicy food over regular food if presented with both. There are even species of mammals that never ate spicy food that switched over to exclusively eating spicy peppers after they were introduced to their habitats in Asia from the Americas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean they don't really have to be that vivid to catch attention from potential eaters.</p>
<p>They can just be any color other than green and they will probably stick out enough from the vegetation to be seen</p>
<p>some wild fruit also seem to be red, which is very attention catching</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will just say I have a bone to pick with your use of the word &quot;learn&quot; regarding aposematic coloring. If you eat a bright red frog and die, that is not &quot;learning&quot;. Rather my understanding is those animals have ingrained (instinctual/epigenetic) behaviors based on previous animals kicking the bucket when they croaked after eating that oh-so-yummy looking neon green toad. Correct me if I'm wrong!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct.  Let's start with 100 predators.  I'm going to make up some statistics here to make a point.</p>
<p>If 90% of predators are &quot;normal and the same&quot;, 5% may be born with physical anomalies that are detrimental, and the other 5% may be born with anomolies that are beneficial.</p>
<p>For better or worse, most of the predators will continue along, while statistically the detrimental anomolies will die off (this could be physical or mental anomolies).
The beneficial anomalies will end up mixing into the gene pool and be it faster reflexes, brighter plumage, stealthier plumage, what-have you, and start to become the new normal.  Recreate this loop for millenia where the bottom percentile die off and we get to what we have today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus some predators will attempt to eat a frog/toad/caterpillar/whatever displaying aposematic coloration then spit it out when they discover it is quite distasteful. This also aids in the learning process, and they'll likely avoid prey with that type of coloration in the future.</p></div>		</li>
