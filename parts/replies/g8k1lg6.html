<p>After a c-section I now have no feeling between my belly button and my pubic bone and a heat pad does nothing for me.</p>
<p>I completely believe the ‘interfered signals’ theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sucks, I'm sorry heat doesn't help you anymore. If it's any use to you my doc prescribed slow release Diclofenac (sp?) to me and suggested I start taking one every 12 hours from the day before my period is due. It helps enormously. It's the difference between lying in a dark room with a wheat bag and an electric blanket and just carrying on at work, albeit slightly more grumpy than usual!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point, I was also thinking it would improve circulation to the uterine muscle. Off topic slightly but I wonder if relieving endometrial hypoxia a little might actually inhibit the regrowth later?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess no because regrowth/ischemia are regulated by hormones, but can we get a nurse or doctor in here?! This is interesting.</p></div>		</li>
