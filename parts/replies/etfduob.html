			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I usually enjoy my job but a few months ago when I had to work 12 to 18 hour days for a month or so during a special project, I caught myself contemplating what it would be like to just end it all; but then I reminded myself that &quot;This too, shall pass&quot; and all I need is sleep. After a few weeks of normal hours, my mood returned to normal as well.</p></div>		</li>
