			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another effect too - hot fluids rise, and the opening to the flask is at the top. This is much more apparent if you open and close the thermal flask occasionally (to drink out of) and let hot air out.</p>
<p>This is the same reason why chest freezers are more efficient than ones that open from the side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like putting your hand over coffee is more of an example of convective heat transfer (hot air from above liquid surface rising).</p>
<p>Radiative heat transfer is typically much less and isn't easily &quot;felt&quot; when considering most everyday heat transfer situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The heat transfer goes as a constant * T\^4 in absolute temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid confusing others, the equation is actually </p>
<blockquote>
<p>q = k[(Th)⁴ - (Tc)⁴]</p>
<p>Where q is the heat transfer rate, k is a constant that includes the stefan-boltzman constant, the surface area of the object, and the emissivity factor (because objects are not perfect black bodies), Th is the hot obeject temperature and Tc is the ambient temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while the radiation rate does indeed depend on the absolute temperature, it also depends on the temperature of the environment into which the object is radiating.</p>
<p>An import thing to note is that for most instances involving objects at everyday average temperatures (not excessively hot) radiation is actually the least important effect to consider because of how small the Stefan boltzman constant is (5.67*10^(-8) W/m²K⁴). In a thermos, however, it becomes the main form of transfer because they are designed specifically to minimize conduction and convection.</p></div>		</li>
