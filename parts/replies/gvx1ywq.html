			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. Usually it was someone close to me. I’d go to text or call and that person would contact me at that moment. I have a couple off-the-wall theories for this, but none of them make any scientific sense. One is just being empathic, the other is that your phone emits frequencies that you may subconsciously be tuned into when someone calls. They’re both crazy theories, but I’m still waiting on a reasonable one!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha,  I've always wondered the same thing! Like is my phone doing some kinda dog whistle thing I can hear,  but actually can't? Or like another absurd theory I'd have is that my brain is awake,  and has already heard the phone ring,  but hasn't told my ears yet? But like you said,  yeah,  nothing that's really that reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s possible that the signal coming into your phone to make it ring appears a few seconds before it actually rings, so maybe some part of you is subtly sensitive to that</p></div>		</li>
