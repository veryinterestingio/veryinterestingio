			<div class="markdown"><p>As an add on: The law you were originally referring to is an extension of Boyles law: P1*V1/T1 = P2*V2/T2 </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This states that pressure by volume over temperature for a given body of gas is constant. However, it only exists for ideal gases (which don't exist, but some gases come fairly close), and only applies within reasonable pressure ranges. If the gas get so pressurised it starts to liquify, the law is a long way from being valid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ideal gas is really not whimsical as people make it to be, most gases are like within 5% of the ideal gas at room temperature and pressure. It's a perfectly fine approximation for most intents and purposes. The actual problem with OP's argument is that this law only applies to adiabatic compression. When you compress a gas, it will start to radiate heat away and become cooler, so it is not adiabatic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, but I have a follow-on question: what exactly <em>is</em> temperature?  I know that the more an object is heated, the more its atoms will vibrate, but is that vibration itself temperature, or merely an expression or side effect of the temperature?  </p>
<p>Now, what happens to the vibration of atoms inside of a black hole?  Near infinite density, do they continue to vibrate like before?  If not (i.e. they stop vibrating) what does this mean in terms of their &quot;temperature&quot;? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>what exactly is temperature? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various definitions can be useful depending on your context. For example temperature in thermal physics is the partial derivative of internal energy with respect to the change in entropy (i.e. it is a measure of how much the internal energy goes up if you increase the entropy).</p>
<p>You have touched on my personal favourite definition of temperature which is the statistical mechanics definition. This is where temperature is a measure of the average energy of the distribution of particles (in the frame of reference where the average velocity is 0).</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't want to speculate on what temperature means inside the event horizon. Theoretically, (unless we are missing some kind of pressure beyond neutron degeneracy pressure) there is no pressure force great enough to stop a black hole &quot;core&quot; from compressing to a singularity. I don't think any of our definitions of temperature work well when we are considering an infinitely dense point. </p>
<p>We could talk about the limit as you approach the singularity where each change in distance between you and the singularity has a corresponding increase in energy. If your infalling matter is collisional, at least part of this energy will be redistributed from bulk kinetic motion to random kinetic motion, i.e. heat. Since each change in dr will be a larger and larger change in dE (since g will be increasing to infinity as r approaches 0) then we can speculate that the change in dE approaches infinity and thus the temperature also approaches infinity. Perhaps that answers your curiosity? If not sorry, best I could do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it that anything ever does reach the singularity? Why is it even possible for a singularity to occur? Wouldn’t it take an infinite amount of time for an object which fell into a black hole to reach the singularity in the center?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on my very amateur understanding, doesn't time slow down as gravity increases? On that basis, wouldn't it be the case that from our perspective the infinitely dense singularity never actually happens as time slows for the particles involved until it stops just before the actual point where the singularity would form? On that basis, would there be more &quot;wiggle room&quot; for particles to have energy?</p>
<p>I'm afraid I'm having trouble grasping the idea of an infinitely dense point, and why an infinitely dense point wouldn't have infinite gravity if more density=more gravity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several ways to define temperature.  A simple but very useful one is to relate it to the vibrational energy/translational energy in a simple material.</p>
<p>More abstractly it can be thought of as how quickly a body will transfer energy spontaneously.</p>
<p>A formal definition is 1/T = dq/ds which is related to energy transfer and entropy.  I don't have an intuitive description here though...</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, that's not true. Temperature only tells us if two bodies are in equilibrium if they happen to be in thermal contact. The question &quot;how fast the energy is transferred&quot; depends on many other factors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat is a side effect of that vibration. One atom bumps into another atom and transfers some of its energy to it. That energy is observed on a macro level as heat.</p></div>		</li>
