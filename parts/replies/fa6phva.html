			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong</p>
<p>The Doppler shift is not what causes us to not see the light (since some non-visible ultra-violets get shifted into visible anyway). It's the fact that there is a finite size to the <strong>observable</strong> universe, because light has only had 14 billion years to reach us. We can't (and never will due to expansion), see stars beyond that distance.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field" target="_blank">Hubble ultra deep field</a> is an image containing stars right on the edge of the observable universe and was taken in visible frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we were theoretically able to draw an infinite number of rays from earth's center point in every possible direction, what percentage of those rays would pass though a light source before before reaching the edge of the observable universe? (assuming no travel time at this moment in our universe's life). That's the question being asked here, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. Thanks for the succinct summary. I bet based on brightness / average energy output of the known universe and known brightness of individual galaxies this question should be calculable as a percentage.</p></div>		</li>
