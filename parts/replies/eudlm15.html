			<div class="markdown"><p>The FDS version was released after the cartridge version.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The primary goal of FDS was to decrease game cost, not to have more memory. But those discs have more memory than the basic 32+8 KiB cartridge, 112K per side and a game can span on several sides, even on several discs.</p>
<p>With rewritable discs it's basically 1980's digital download.</p></div>		</li>
