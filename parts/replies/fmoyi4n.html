			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not specific to the Sun, it's just a property of fusion. Essentially, to fuse two nuclei, you need to overcome a particular input energy barrier. Without that threshold of energy, the nuclei simply cannot get close enough, and fusion cannot happen. Unless, due to quantum tunneling, the fuzziness in their position allows them to jump over that energy barrier. It's very unlikely for any given interaction, but when you've got an enormous number of interactions happening, it becomes statistically relevant. You essentially get slightly more fusion output than you'd expect; some small fraction of it is easier to achieve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact, the power output per unit volume of the sun is hilariously low -- even just considering the core where the actual fusion takes place, it's like the equivalent of a couple of lightbulbs per cubic meter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing that particular input barrier is relative to the atoms you're attempting to fuse (because of number of electrons?)? Can you fuse any given a sufficient energy input then I take it? So if you had unlimited energy, would it be theoretically possible to create any atom you wanted by smashing them together into different shapes?</p></div>		</li>
