			<div class="markdown"><p>They are also killed at the end of the summer if they're still hanging around.  None of them overwinter.</p>
<p>Cool fact - </p>
<p>Drones are produced from unfertilized eggs, so they only carry the genes of the queen, and they only have a single copy of their genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Their genitals explode with a 'pop' that is audible to human ears. Males who don't mate are chucked out or killed by their hive when winter comes as they serve no purpose other than to mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they die in the process of mating, if they are lucky enough to mate. However, if winter is getting close, the female bees will kick the remaining males out of the hive, letting them starve to death. Because the males don't work, and they eat up more honey than the females.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s been a lot of confusing info (to me) in this whole thread but something about the way you put it makes me think I “get it”.</p>
<p>So the drones whole purpose is to carry copies of the Queen’s junk while they fly around outside waiting for another Queen from somewhere else to fly along and mate with them and thereby help spread the first Queen’s junk far and wide... right?</p>
<p>That’s why they’re called drones right? They’re just copies of the queen going about doing her “business” on her behalf. </p>
<p>And the queen has one orgy early on in her life and then spends the rest of her life playing with the cum she collected from that one orgy. That’s pretty rad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. They escort a virgin queen on her mating flight. When they find another mating swarm her brothers will try to mate with another queen while she mates with as many drones from other hives as she can. So it's a series of bee gangbangs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, drones and an unmated queen do not necessarily go to the same drone congregation site.</p>
<p>We aren’t sure what determines the location of a mating site, but the queen does it on her own - there is some evidence that she will specifically go somewhere her own related drones are not present</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow, this is actually really interesting after a bit of thought. this model of reproduction allows bees to reap the benefits of both sexuality and asexuality. They can exchange genes between colonies rather than organisms, and also benefit from the mass production of a successful genome.</p></div>		</li>
