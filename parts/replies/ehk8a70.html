			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I live near a small general aviation airport and am able to locate any aircraft in the sky quite easily.</p>
<p>I visit my SO down in London and it's certainly much harder to do this in general, but especially with helicopters and even more so when we're in the city.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, my point was more that the OP's supposition wasn't really a good comparison, since a plane flying a similar profile to a helicopter (since helicopters generally fly lower and less predictably because that's why they're useful) is also hard to locate. A helicopter flying in a straight line at high altitude isn't much harder to locate than a plane.</p></div>		</li>
