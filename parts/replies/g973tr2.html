			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this. Lots of furniture also has lock washers now, you often see them where you have a bolt going into a metal insert, so metal on metal. </p>
<p>A lock washer has a slit in it, but the ends dont line up. Its basically a tiny spring, its purpose is to keep pressure on the nut/bolt to stop it from loosening over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Despite their ubiquity and reputation, split washers do nothing to prevent bolts loosening off and in some tests actually quite significantly <em>aid</em> in loosening.</p>
<p>NASA on the topic in 1990 (reference publication 1228) -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The section on lockwashers states: “The typical helical spring washer … serves as a spring while the bolt is being tightened. However, the washer is normally flat by the time the bolt is fully torqued. At this time it is equivalent to a solid flat washer, and its locking ability is nonexistent. In summary, a lockwasher of this type is useless for locking.”</p>

<p>If I had to guess the reason for their being included in so many designs, it is either that the designers never questioned tradition, or because it can give the <em>appearance</em> that the product adheres to best principles without having to shell out for something that actually works, like Nord-locks.</p>

<p>During my ME Undergrad, a couple engineers from Fastenal came to give us a guest lecture (or something like that) during our Machine Design class time senior year. They said: &quot;If you don't remember anything else from this talk, at least remember that locking washers DO NOT WORK&quot;. I have never forgotten that lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi I am a french engineer, the edges of the slit on the washer act as a cutting tool. In order for either the bolt or the part to turn, the edge of the slit will have to scrape about .001&quot; to .002&quot; of the metal on at least one of them. This is more than enough to lock everything in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See also: They make for a smooth surface on the product, so the nut/wrench doesn't scrape it up, which makes for a more reliable interface, especially important for things for things that get taken apart and put back together more than the one time initial set-up.</p>
<p>This has a number of factors beyond sinking into the material:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Protects paint, which helps avoid corrosion(and just looks better)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gouged surface can cause variation in height/pressure, which means precision is harder to attain and prevent damage due to uneven pressure(if the metal is all scraped and has bits sticking up and you attempt to tighten it can deform the material)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helps avoid minor sinking into the material over time, which means it can be backed off easier. Same general point as what OP says, but the long term effect I thought was worthy of a separate point.  Proper washers on both sides can significantly impact longevity of the part.  People may not think a metal cover is able to be damaged much, but damage can grow exponentially and likely will if it's something that is removed a lot.  <a href="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/old-green-grunge-metal-plate-rusted-cover-bolts-background-photo-texture-50424871.jpg" target="_blank">Even something that's meant to be semi-permanent...</a></p>
</li>
<li>More generally: It's easier to replace a washer than a whole new access door or cover or whatever else.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: you do also see rubber or plastic washers for metal on metal fastenings, this is usual to prevent vibration from loosening the bolt over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also: Seal out water or debris. <a href="https://img.sellercube.com/UploadFile/P1001/POA767566/448f1fc6-7e8e-9bb2-9260-8c6c39901016.jpg" target="_blank">Common on metal roofing/siding.</a>  Also, as an extra step against corrosion, a lot of corrosion comes from metal on metal contact.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all correct, but I'll add one more item to the list. Washers are also often used when running a bolt through a slotted hole. In addition to giving the bolt more contact area (since the slot removed contact area), it prevents the bolt from grabbing a side and moving the part while tightening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Washers also give more consistent torque. If you tighten a bolt on a slippery/smooth surface to 20 lb/ft and then tighten the same bolt onto a dry coarse surface, the bolt will be &quot;pulling&quot; more on the wet surface. It will effectively be tighter even though the turning force is the same due to differences in friction. Add a washer and it is much more consistent, assuming the threads are consistent too. This probably almost never matters and is negligible but 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>I broke a bolt on an engine the other day with a torque wrench and I'm 99% sure it was because the bolt and hole were covered in oil. 27 lb/ft dry is a lot different than 27 oily ass lb/ft. Should've known better.</p></div>		</li>
