			<div class="markdown"><p>The most important thing to know is to characterize or do a pathological exam on the specific breast cancer type to know if the cells still express the estrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor, or if they overexpress the protein called HER2. This is something routine that is done when a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. If the cells still express these hormonal receptors, we can treat them with hormonal treatment. If they don't, the cancer will be treated differently. Another piece of important information is whether it is localized or if it has already spread to adjacent lymph nodes. This is called staging. </p>
<p>Yes, women with genetic predispositions, for example mutations in BRCA genes, are at higher risk for breast cancer. Smoking is also a risk factor. As is age and the age of childbirth. </p>
<p>There are many clinical trials going on.</p></div>		</li>
