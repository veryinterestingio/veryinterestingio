			<div class="markdown"><p>The best example I can think of is my time in culinary school.  16 students with the same recipe and ingredients for cream of chicken soup... 16 different results.  </p>
<p>Then they mix it all in one bucket and sell it at the campus cafeteria, but that's a different story. ðŸ™„</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I did my red seal exam they sold it.  Lol.  Culinary students got 50% off in the cafeteria because we were free labour.  Got $9 lamb shanks!  Level one classes ran the hot line for lunch.  Level two ran a classroom restaurant on campus in the evening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beer is like that. I can get the same ingredients. They might share their entire process. Local breweries are usually friendly about even sharing samples of their house yeast strains with homebrewers. Doesn't matter. It is EXTREMELY difficult to replicate a specific beer. </p>
<p>Hell, it's often difficult for a brewery to replicate their own stuff with perfection. Consistency is a HUGE deal, and a tricky goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve heard a lot of brewers give props to macro brews like Bud, Coors, etc. Making that kind of beer at major volumes taste the same every time you open the can isnâ€™t easy. Sure, the beer might not be good. But the process is impressive nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example:  eggs.</p>
<p>If you get them hot, they scramble.  But if you get them hot very slowly, they temper.  If you whip the whites, they turn stiff.  If you whip them too hard, they go soft again.</p>
<p>If you combine those process and whip the egg whites just enough, and then GENTLY stir (fold) in the yolks, and heat it all up fast, you can get a super fluffy omelette.</p>
<p>Just knowing the ingredients isn't even half the process.  You've got to know exactly what to do with the ingredients in order to get the desired outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I chuckled.</p>
<p>I recently found a great way to make omelettes.</p>
<p>I whip the whole eggs, add milk to taste, then pour them into a skillet on low. I cook it slowly, allowing it to come to temp, stirring the whole time. About halfway through you can crank up the heat to finish faster. It gets very light, and almost like a dang custard.</p>
<p>If you want to elevate them, put in two handfuls of shredded cheese about halfway through. It melts the cheese to the point where you donâ€™t see it and it gets that nice carmelized flavor from encountering the hot surface of the pan.</p></div>		</li>
