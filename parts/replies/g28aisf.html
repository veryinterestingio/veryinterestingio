			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad wording on my sentence, it should say &quot;it's scattering the same amount of light&quot;. The light is scattered off the water surface, but part of it it's scattered forward (through the water, a.k.a. refraction), and part of it it's scattered back (reflection). </p>
<p>Depending on the shape/structure of water body, and angle of light hitting it, there'll be more light going forward or backward. The amount of light scattered is the same, but sometimes it doesn't get scattered back to you, it goes somewhere else following narrow paths, sometimes creating the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caustic_%28optics%29?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">caustic patterns</a>.</p></div>		</li>
