Then, make sure you have a good teacher who responds well to questions. Ask them. Any time you don't understand something, ask a question without fear of &quot;looking stupid&quot; or anything silly like that. They're there to help you learn.</p>
<p>Assuming you're already in a calc class and don't have a good way of changing teachers, look online for explanations of concepts like limits and derivatives. Keep looking until you find one that resonates with you and you understand the concepts. </p>
<p>Then realize that 90% of math questions on tests are just you regurgitating an algorithm where it's all about finding the right puzzle piece to plug into the right place in the right formula in the right order.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Calculus, imo, is intuitively understood as working with ~Infinite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal#History_of_the_infinitesimal" target="_blank">Infinitesimals</a>. i.e. If you want to figure out the area of a sphere, and you cut it into more and more pieces, eventually you get a nearly infinite number of really thin slices. When you add the area of each slice up, it gives you the area inside the circle. </p>
<p>Physicists invented calculus trying to solve real-world problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like to think of calculus as the mathematics of <em>changes.</em> It is (mathematically) trivial to calculate the distance of a straight line and hence the area <em>and</em> volume of any geometric shape with all straight edges. But curves are lines with <em>changing slopes</em> and calculus provides a method for calculating these. </p>
<p>Additionally, it works with things that aren't obviously geometric, like <em>acceleration.</em></p>
<p>People have an intuitive understanding of <em>position</em> and, usually, <em>velocity</em> - if velocity is constant. Acceleration is a little bit different, but it follows a simple calculus pattern: Velocity is the <em>derivative</em> of position; i.e. how much the position is <em>changing</em> over time; acceleration, likewise, is the <em>derivative</em> of velocity; i.e. how velocity is <em>changing</em> over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard anyone say that calculus (part of analysis) is applied algebra. I mean, I suppose if you wanted to say something like &quot;the derivative of a function is the linear transformation which best approximates the function&quot; then sure? Could you elaborate on this?</p></div>		</li>
