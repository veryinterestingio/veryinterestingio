			<div class="markdown"><p>This also goes to show that how thoroughly and diligently you apply the sunscreen matters <em>much</em> more than its SPF.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thoroughly applied SPF15 in sufficient quantity over your entire body: 97% protection.</li>
<li>SPF100 applied to 90% of your body because you missed a few patches: &lt;90% protection.</li>
<li>SPF100 applied to your entire body, but only half as thick as needed: Possibly &lt;50% protection (maybe more if the drop-off is non-linear, but still much less than 97%).</li>
<li>SPF100 applied to your entire body, but not renewed often enough: Depends, but much lower than 97% too.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SPF 100 is balogna.  The FDA even has a rule forbidding companies from claiming anything over 50+ because it is &quot;misleading&quot;.  The companies who sell SPF100 in the US pay a nominal fine per product.  It is so small, it is basically a.marketing fee.  It's really sad. Also as someone who has been studying sunscreen for over 5 years I can tell you that while chemical sunscreens stop you from burning (UVB Ray's).  They do a horrible job at blocking UVA, which causes cancer and actually increases cancer causing free radicals.  Zinc Oxide is the only sunscreen that actually stops UVA and UVB.  This is a FACT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the game, but I hesitate for a minimum of 60, the lowest that feels ‘comfortable’ to me is 80 or so, &lt;60fps has a weird tension almost to it, that weirds me out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a mathematical model, the numbers come from 1-1/SPF</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So SPF 15 = 1 - 1/15 =  0.9333333333... or 93.333%</p>
<p>But the important thing to focus on when it comes to sunscreen is how much UV reaches your skin, which is 1/SPF</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So SPF 15 lets through  1/15 = 0.06666666666... or 6.666%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to chime in that the <em>amount</em>  of sunscreen applied to get this kinda coverage is one ounce. Like a shot. If you aren’t applying this amount (and let’s get real, who applies <strong>that much</strong> )then you aren’t getting that level of coverage.</p>
<p>So maybe just get a higher SPF because you probably won’t be applying a whole shot of sunscreen; SPF15, 30, and 50 are usually the same price (at least in the US in my experience).</p></div>		</li>
