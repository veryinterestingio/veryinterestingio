			<div class="markdown"><p>You can determine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height" target="_blank">a characteristic height for an ideal gas</a> in a gravitational potential well. The linked workup does so for an average molecular mass, but as an IG is explicitly non-interacting, you can repeat the process for each component of a heterogeneous gas, like air, and determine a unique scale height for each gas component.</p>
<p>This won't separate them into layers, as you are correct that would require more significant interactions, but the differing scale heights would force a heterogeneous ideal gas at constant temperature to change in composition with altitude.</p></div>		</li>

<p>hydrogen and helium do escape our atmosphere into outer space</p>
<p>hydrogen is not so much a worry but helium is: all we have is a little trapped underground with natural gas, built up over billions of years due to radioactive decay. we need helium for a number of applications like MRI machines</p>
<p>children's balloons at parties should concern you. we are wasting a finite resource. it is cheap now because we extract so much natural gas. but it will run out and will not be recreated</p>
<p>hydrogen escaping is a concern for mars and venus: there is very little on either due to the gas simply leaving the atmosphere. mars does have some water underground. but on venus it is extremely scarce. mars has low gravity and venus has no magnetosphere (besides the small induced magnetosphere) like earth</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of years from now the sun will be significantly hotter (to about 10% in about a billion years) and the earth will begin to lose a lot of its water due to increased evaporation and then hydrogen escaping. about 1.1 billion years from now the oceans will be lost (a lot of also subducted into the mantle)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/DeVoe's_%22Thermodynamics_and_Chemistry%22/09%3A_Mixtures/9.8_Mixtures_in_Gravitational_and_Centrifugal_Fields" target="_blank">this source</a>, gravitational fields do affect ideal gas mixtures. The separation might not lead to pure layers (wouldn't be the case for real gases either), but it definitely leads to a composition gradient where the heavier gas molecules are more abundant at higher pressures.</p>
<p>From the source:
&quot;For example, in a binary ideal gas mixture the mole fraction of the constituent with the greater molar mass decreases with increasing elevation, and the mole fraction of the other constituent increases&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even without air currents, the atmosphere wouldn't separate into pure layers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...except that our atmosphere <em>does</em> separate into stratified density layers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosphere" target="_blank">heterosphere</a>.</p>
<p>This is the region above the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbopause" target="_blank">turbopause</a> around 100 km altitude, where the eddy diffusion coefficient is equal to the molecular diffusion coefficient. Above that height (the heterosphere), diffusion dominates, and atmospheric constituents separate out by density. Below that height (the homosphere), turbulence dominates, and the atmosphere is well-mixed.</p>
<p><del>I'm not sure how your explanation sits in the face of observational evidence to the contrary.</del></p>
<p>EDIT: With a more careful re-read...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the partial density distribution of gas A in a mixture of A and B is the same as the density distribution of A on its own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, this is exactly what does happen in the heterosphere. The scale height (vertical distance over which partial pressure drops by 1/e = 37%) for each atmospheric gas in this region scales inversely as its molecular weight. That's why heavier gases like oxygen mostly lie in the bottom of the heterosphere while lighter gases like helium will be distributed to much higher altitude. </p>
<p>You end up getting multiple independent exponential distributions <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y+%3D+e%5E-x,+y%3D+0.5e%5E-(x%2F2\),+y+%3D+0.25e%5E(-x%2F4\)+from+x+%3D+0+to+10" target="_blank">like this</a>, where each curve is height vs. the partial pressure contribution of each gas; at any given height one gas dominates, with lighter gases dominating higher regions. That's why if you up looking at each gas in terms of volume mixing ratio vs height - i.e. what percentage of the total pressure comes from the partial pressure of gas X at height H - the bottom tends to be stacked with the heavier gases and the top tends to be filled with lighter gases.</p>
<p>That's certainly a kind of separation by weight, though not one that produces homogeneous layers of just one gas at each height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong but I believe he's saying they won't separate out into homogenous layers of each molecule. I'm not sure about the part about the pressure - maybe the interactions between particles are insignificant, maybe they're not? But googling the composition of the heterosphere shows atleast 2, usually 3 different elements present at any given altitude.</p>
<p>tl:dr; i don't think what he's saying contradicts observed composition of the heterosphere</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, after a more careful re-read, I don't think our comments are contradictory. Edited my comment accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what does that mean about the greenhouse effect? </p>
<p>Is it caused by the separated layer of CO2 in the hetereosphere or is the mixed CO2 in the atmosphere enough to keep solar radiation from getting out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the total amount, and it doesn't really matter how it's distributed (well it does a tiny bit, but not much). Think of it this way - every photon of infrared radiation is emitted from the surface of the Earth, headed for infinity and beyond. Every time it goes past a CO2 molecule, it has a chance of being absorbed. If the atmospheric concentration is higher, that photon has a higher chance of encountering a CO2 molecule, therefore a higher chance of being absorbed and not escaping. Since the <em>total number</em> of molecules it passes by is the same whether they're all concentrated in a tiny area, or spread out over 20km, the effect is identical. There will be small differences due to <em>where</em> the heat is absorbed, but this is fairly small. Whether we have 400ppm spread over 20km of atmosphere, or all the CO2 squashed into a 15m band of basically pure CO2, the ability to trap heat is identical.</p>
<p>Also note that the amount of CO2 (and all other gas) in the heterosphere is absolutely tiny, almost all of the atmosphere is in the first 20km or so.</p></div>		</li>
