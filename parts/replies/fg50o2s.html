			<div class="markdown"><p>Very unlikely in a developed country, quarantine procedures are very effective and people who may have been affected are contacted or notified to watch their health. If you're in developing country it's difficult to tell but your chance of contracting the virus is much higher because the people who already have the virus have likely not be isolated thus you may get it from them.</p>
<p>Overall your chance of contracting Corona is quite low, just take safety precautions such as staying away from people who seem sick. Sanitise your hands and eating surfaces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no line. There is no one universal health budget or policy across borders and jurisdictions. I highly recommend Hans Rosling's book on this very topic called &quot;factfullness&quot;. He also happens to have been an epidemiologist (the type of doctor that manages epidemics). One way to look at it is by dividing populations into groups that earn under $2 a day; between $2-$8 a day; between $8-$32 and those that earn over $32 (us). Similarly these lines are arbitrary. To give context, the group with the worst teeth is the $8-32 group. This group has sufficient infrastructure to get sugar and coca-cola (and coronavirus), but insufficient public health spending to promote toothpaste and fluoride in the water (and isolation rooms in hospitals).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thai people are overreacting (not the first time). It’s a combination of the fact that Wuhan was the most popular overseas destination and a general mistrust of the government. </p>
<p>There’s no proof that it’s spreading locally in Thailand. </p>
<p>Singapore just banned all visitors from China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chances are low. While some cases have appeared in Europe and the Americas, so far they have been isolated occurrences. Given that governments are aware of the virus and actively looking for it, standard quarantine measures should prevent a widespread outbreak outside China. Obviously the risk is not zero, but for the average person in a developed nation the flu is a much more immediate threat than this virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really have an opinion on the dissemination of information as it's not my area. So far though despite diseased individuals showing up in several major cities throughout the world, none have had a major outbreak. This suggests to me, at least so far, that the current strategy is working. Obviously if outbreaks do occur in these cities I will need to reevaluate my perception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The incubation period is defined as the time between exposure and showing symptoms. It is estimated at 2-14 days by the CDC.  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html</a></a> </p>
<p>Being in the incubation period <em>does not</em> necessarily mean you can transmit the disease. In fact the WHO suspects transmission of 2019-nCoV to be very rare in the absence of symptoms.  <a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1223659708072038400" target="_blank"><a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1223659708072038400" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1223659708072038400</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>What measures are governments taking to find infected people? Is there any concern about the the discovered infected cases being part of a larger chain of infections? If not, for what reasons?</p></div>		</li>
