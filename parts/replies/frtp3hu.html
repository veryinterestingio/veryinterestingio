			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on your problem. </p>
<p>A/C addresses the &quot;it too hot&quot; problem. The dry air helps our bodies stay cool with our natural &quot;it too hot&quot; solution.</p>
<p>But if you're having &quot;air too dry&quot; problems, then yeah a humidifier with your A/C is probly good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>solution to what?  you Want to NOT have sweat work?</p>
<p>or do you mean to make the cold air feel like &quot;normal&quot; cold air? its risky to add a lot of humidity to your air though.  they are generally only used in residential situations in very dry environments like the desert. (popular in Arizona for example)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I was in engineering classes, I remember reading an article that the temperature of your walls impacts how warm you feel. Like when it’s 22°C inside and the wall temperature is 10°C you would feel colder than when the wall temperature would be 20°C. </p>
<p>It had something to do with the radiation of heat. Like how the heat of a fireplace feels more warm than a room without heating even if they are both at the same temperature.</p>
<p>We humans cannot sense temperature, but we feel the difference in heat transfer. That’s why we feel cold in a 22°C pool, but feel totally fine in a room at 22°C.</p>
<p>EDIT: To further clarify. When you turn on the A/C it means that it’s hot outside, so your walls and windows are radiating heat. </p>
<p>The reason I researched this, was because I was living in a 1 bedroom apartment close to the university. This apartment was half a floor underground and I noticed that I had to turn the thermostat to 24-25°C to feel comfortable in a T-shirt, while at home with my parents I only needed 22°C. It turned out that because the walls where half underground, they were colder than usual. So it was the walls that made it feel colder inside than what it actually was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An old flat i used to live in had a great example of this. </p>
<p>One year it was bloody freezing (not literally, just that you could see your breath inside), and no matter how much I ran the heater, it did nothing (zero insulation didnt help). </p>
<p>But one day I decided to rearrange the furniture. The couch was against a big window, and i swapped it to the other side of the room, so it backed onto an interior wall. </p>
<p>The place suddenly felt so much warmer, even though the temperature was the same (&lt;10 degrees). I could still see my breath, but didn’t feel the cold anymore.</p>
<p>Cold surfaces suck the life out of you so easily</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone who lives in a basement apartment, buy a heated floor mat for under your desk.  The difference of the floor your feet are on not being freezing cold is insane.</p>
<p>Probably saves you on heating cost too because they are way more energy efficient than space heaters (mine is about 30 watts) and you'll probably not be putting your heat so high anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its mostly due to humidity and airflow. Its why you feel so different when its windy vs not even in the same temperature. Humans don't feel temperature directly, we feel how easy it is to warm ourselves (or cool ourselves)</p></div>		</li>

<p>ex: a 100°f day with fan feels better than a 90° day without fan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how humid the air is.  Here in the south, the humidity is so high that 100F and a fan won't help as much to aid in perspiration for body cooling. So it will feel like it it is blowing hot air.</p></div>		</li>
