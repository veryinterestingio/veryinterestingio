			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too. But I'm a woman, and I don't know why but it's much easier for us?  I remember being told in school by my science teacher that boys find it much harder (it wasn't a lesson, we were just having a chat about how her nephew was being potty trained but was on a safari and they couldn't pull over so they just let him go in bottles - and had to switch them out mid-stream so made a mess).  All us girls sat there puzzling over it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>however, we actually see higher rates of incontinence in women. </p>
