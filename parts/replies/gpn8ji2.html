			<div class="markdown"><p>By the end of your life it is possible to sequence a cell from your left hand and a cell from your right hand and get very very close but ever so slightly different sequences. </p>
<p>That is <strong>EXACTLY</strong> the info I am looking for</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in fact I'd say its incredibly unlikely for the 2 cells right now to have exactly the same DNA sequence. Errors in replication dueing cell division and random damage due to many different sources means cells are always going to have differences in nucleotides. We are very fortunate that it takes alot of mutations accumulated in alot of cells to actually have notiecable harm to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a specific type of cell or part of the body you could sample to get the most accurate copy of one's genetic code, where &quot;accurate&quot; is defined as genetic consensus at time of birth? If not, what about genetic consensus in the body today?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every cell division in human somatic tissues has about 1/10th chance of a mutation event. (Per base mutation rate 1x10^-10, diploid genome size 6.4x10^9 bases, 6.4 billion bases. Each cell of your body undergoes between 50 and 3000 cell divisions in a lifespan, by our estimates. You have trillions of cell divisions in your life. Your genome is riddled with mutations. Likely every single base in your genome has been mutated at least once in your body.</p>
<p>90% of mutations are harmless because our genome largely consists of transposon expansion, the corpses of no longer functional selfish genetic elements. 1% is coding, and scientists generally generously estimate the regulatory genome to be perhaps 9%, also it makes for easier calculations. The worse mutations are cellular lethals and create nonfunctional cells-- and are selected out of the extant cell population. The exact distribution of dna mutation across our bodies is unknown, no one has sequenced quite that much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting some cells actually undergo hypermutation on purpose.  During the adaptive immune response, B cells purposefully mutate the region of their genome that makes the paratope (the portion of an antibody that binds to a pathogen).  The mutated B cell that produces the best paratope (binds best to the pathogen) survives and proliferates.  Once done successfully, the B cell can pump out a ton of antibodies that attack the pathogen.  It's kind of like evolution at the cellular level on steroids.  This is how our body can create antibodies so selective to pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.  This is also how we train our bodies to fight off re-infection in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure that apoptosis prevents most mutations from being passed down?  I thought this is only true for mutations that cause substantial problems for the cell.  Most mutations are harmless.</p></div>		</li>
