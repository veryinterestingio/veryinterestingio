			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The color killer a circuit in color TVs which acts as a cutting circuit to cut off the color amplifiers when the TV receives a monochrome signal. When it becomes ‘on’, it disables an amplifier during monochrome reception. Thus it prevents any spurious signals which happen to fall within the band-pass of the amplifier from getting through the demodulators and prevents causing colored interference on the screen. This colored noise is fact called ‘confetti’. It kinda looks like snow but with large spots in color.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any images or better yet videos of what noise looks like with the color killer disabled? I tried searching but couldn't find any.</p>
<p>(I know I could do this because I have an old TV and even have its service manual but I'm too lazy to do it right now. Sorry.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly  think that the PAL signal, and how colour was added to it, is one of the most elegant technological advances humans have made. It's a beautiful beautiful thing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NTSC suffered from a problem where colors would be wrong when the signal wasn’t perfect. One color signal may be reduced more than another.  Sometimes the green would be a little higher than the original broadcast, sometimes the red, etc. This was particularly noticeable in faces. American TV newscasters with green or orange tinged faces was a common thing. </p>
<p>PAL (which came after NTSC, and therefore had the opportunity to learn from the flaw) fixed this in a very clever way. Instead of transmitting some kind of additional information that would allow the Tav to rebalance the color, or something equally complicated, they just flipped the “polarity” of each line of image. So whatever color shift happened, the exact opposite shift would happen on alternate lines. Watching from a few feet away, the viewer would see this as no color shift at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PAL is derived from NTSC, and later advances in receiver technology made the main improvement (no hue control) made by PAL unnecessary. PAL designers had the advantage of being developed later than NTSC . It was first broadcast 13 years after NTSC. By then transistors were common. Early NTSC TVs were all vacuum tube. PAL has more horizontal lines, but has worse frame rate (25 vs NTSC's 30). If it sounds like I think NTSC was a more impressive accomplishment it's because I worked for RCA and knew some of the people who helped make color TV happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah. Amazing. </p>
<p>I studied broadcast engineering in the UK, so we focused the technical aspects on PAL, not NTSC. </p>
<p>I repeat my position, and direct it at you. </p>
<p>Of the technology achievements I know of in a detail, the analog TV signal is one of the most elegant and beautifully constructed structures I have ever studied. I remember learning about the various features of the PAL signal, the front and back porch, the colour burst, the line and frame timings and learning some of the history around how colour was retro fitted inside the existing black and white signal. At the time, I remember my delight and amazement as the elegantly clever and simple beauty of the signal emerged through our study. I recall being in awe of the people who designed it, and even though the intricate details have faded in my memory over the years, it remains my persistence example of elegant human engineering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also what I find highly elegant was that the color TV signal had to be just as usable to a black and white TV.  And it was. Careful use of these alternate signaling techniques meant that a B&amp;W set made with no concept of colorization could use just what it needed to show a clear picture.</p></div>		</li>
