			<div class="markdown"><p>An important reasoning for thinking this, is that worker ants cannot breed and therefore pass on their traits/genes to their offspring individually. However since all the worker ants are offspring of the queen, they have a certain relatedness to the other female and worker ants, so if their sisters are helped to survive the uncle ant passes on those genes to its nephews and neieces via the female ants. </p>
<p>TL;DR: since (EDIT: some) ant colonies have a single queen, they are the only part of the colony to pass on theur genes. Therefore in some instances you could treat an ant colony as a single organism, unlike people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FYI, not all ant species have a single queen. There are many species that normally have multiple queens. It's called polygyny. There's also at least one species of ants where all the females have the ability to reproduce but only the queen is allowed to reproduce (but others do anyway if they can get away with it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. Cells together can make up a different organism that is alive. An ant colony is not alive as a seperate organism but thinking of it as an organism helps us understand its patterns, behaviors etc. </p>
<p>Now does countries or civilizations resemble mega organisms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because each human potentially passes on their individual genes. In ants, all of the workers have the same genes and their &quot;goal&quot; is to propogate those genes as a colony. This means caring for the colony and spawning members that can propogate their genes, which is all done collectively. Essentially, the unit that breeds in ants is the colony moreso than the individuals, with the males and the queens acting as the reproductive organs of the colony.</p></div>		</li>
