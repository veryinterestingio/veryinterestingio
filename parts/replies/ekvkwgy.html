<p>I remember growing up as a kid in the late 80s and early 90s in the mountains of Western North Carolina, and it was a major issue - there were giant swaths of trees that had been completely devastated. As a 7 year old, “acid rain” was just below quicksand when it came to terrifying natural phenomena.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the pH concentration from 1985-2016 you will see a definite increase in the pH (good!) which shows a reduction in acid rain across the US.  The pH of neutral water is 7, but we will never actually reach that because dissolved CO2 in the water will always make it slightly acidic, but nowhere near as acidic as dissolved sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides.</p>

<p>The Clean Air Act (1990) made the difference. It introduced an emissions trading scheme (aka a cap and trade scheme) for key industrial emissions including oxides of sulfur and nitrogen.</p>
<p>Despite protests from coal generators that abatement technology would be far too expensive, ultimately it was all dealt with at a reasonable cost by industry, with those costs passed on in slightly higher power prices.</p>
<p>It's a textbook example of how well emissions trading can work to get emissions down at a lower cost than other forms of regulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully this doesn’t exceed a reasonable limit for politics in r/askscience. I often think about how I wish politics in the 2010s meant debating cap and trade vs more heavy-handed government solutions like the 1990s. Instead, we are stuck debating whether to even try to fix problems or to just stick our heads in the sand and ignore them.</p></div>		</li>

But look at who was President when that bill passed. It’s not hard to figure out why oil and gas companies are exempt from all that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;does it still happen&quot; is sort of a weird thing to ask, because bit wasn't like there was occasional rain that was highly acidic, it was that the average rain in areas downwind from coal emissions was mildly more acidic than it should be, and it was eating away at things and messing with soil.</p>
<p>And no, not here at least. The air here is so, so much cleaner than it used to be. I remember scrubbing soot off of the siding and windows of our house as a kid, and horrible hazy smog  over Los Angeles in the news. The areas near the highways and factories smelled like egg farts and smoke. Rivers were catching fire in the 1970s because there was so much nast in them. There used to be medical waste and sludge down by the beaches.</p>
<p>We've done a tremendous job cleaning up our air and waterways. We just haven't addressed carbon emissions and global warming yet.</p>
<p>And like 'acid rain fear', global climate change isn't something that causes any one kind of dangerous thing to worry about, it makes a whole lot.of things subtly worse in ways that add up. In America, it will mean that things like hurricanes, tornadoes, weird seasons, and sea level rise happen more, and that in itself is a huge, huge deal. My city can handle rising sea levels, bit it's going to cost BILLIONS to fortify against it.</p>
<p>You could play outside in the worst acid rain we ever had. It's the cumulative effect of it on buildings and the environment that was scary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>*as  the nitrogen and oxygen in the air react to make nitrogen monoxide then dioxide when it comes in to contact with more air outside the car</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not quite. EGR valves and other similar things took care of reducing nitrogen oxides - by cooling the combustion temperature. The catalytic converters burn off the extra hydrocarbons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in exhaust pipes catalytic converters provide a place for the oxidation and reduction of toxic by-products (like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons) of fuel into less hazardous substances such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and nitrogen gas. It used to be so that it they only did carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons however three-way converters do nitrogen oxides as well
In conclusion catalytic converters do lower nitrogen oxides reducing acid rain ( going back to original point) :)</p>
