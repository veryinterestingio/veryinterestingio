<p>Once the call is made and the phone starts ringing, it sends the bursts much faster. This is still picked up as a string of clicks, but now it is too fast, to high a 'frequency', for the sound system to amplify and for you to hear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know what, this bit really helped. I always figured that is just stopped when the phone was ringing, which didn't make sense to me. Makes perfect sense to understand that it's still going on but just not in the audible frequency range.</p></div>		</li>

Before the phone rang, it could pick up the signals and you had a &quot;pre-call&quot; light flashing as it detected the signals 3 or 4 seconds before the phone rang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a little light charm from a Mountain Dew /Xbox promotion that would flash when the “pre-call” phase happened. I always wondered why it worked but then stopped working. I am not sure if it stopped doing that “pre-call” phase light up when I went from THE Nokia to my XV6700 or from that to my Samsung A950.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't it only on certain carriers? I believe GSM, which worked at a different frequency than CDMA.</p>
<p>I used to have these little star wars characters that were supposed to light up when I was getting a phone call but it only worked with my friends who were on AT&amp;T. I was on Sprint and never got them working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - GSM used the bursts of signal, each handset talking one at a time. CDMA had ways for multiple handsets to talk at the same time, and the tower could sort them all out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way CDMA (spread spectrum) was explained to me in school was that it was like having a conversation with your friend in a very crowded room, full of other people having conversations with each other. Even with all the noise,  you (your brain) is able to focus, and understand, what your friend says, while &quot;tuning out&quot; the other conversations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TDMA was the distinction, I believe. The clicks and pops were generated from the timing (the T in TDMA) signal being received by the phone. CDMA phones did not use this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly it. TDMA had time slots where the phone could communicate and this caused &quot;burst&quot; transmission which (and I could be mis-remembering this as its been 20 years since I dealt with cell tech) could cause there to be voltage spikes on unshielded wiring similar to the way an induction coil can work. where as CDMA doesnt have these time slots and you dont have these rapid burst transmissions so the voltage doesnt rise and collapse in the same way and doesnt create the same spikes as you are assigned a channel, not a time to transmit on. Early GSM  was based on TDMA and wasnt until 3G did they switch to a CDMA tech</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember my first flip phone, I could <em>feel/hear</em> it about to ring, or get a text message before I would get the notification. Was it the actual phone audio hardware I was sensing or was it external? Was the 216 frequency picked up by the phones speaker, or something else possibly in my environment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say, but both things are possible. There's lots of things in a phone that could cause noise or vibration when the phone starts transmitting. For instance, the ceramic capacitors helping supply the phone with smooth power do physically react to changing voltage in the power supply circuitry. Powering the transmitter will draw 216 bursts of power from it's supply, and this could easily cause vibration or sound.</p>
<p>People who try to build silent gaming or media computers know this effect as 'coil whine', even though it is often the capacitors, not the coils, creating the sound.</p></div>		</li>
