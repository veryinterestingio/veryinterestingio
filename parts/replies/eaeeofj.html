			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up: I'm teetering with having a panic attack rn and I use scrolling through reddit as a distraction to try to calm down. If I went for a jog would that help? I try not to take my anxiety meds until there's no turning back, so if this works, it could be a game changer</p>
<p>Update: I am truly honored and touched by the outpouring of advice, support, and well-wishes! I have never felt so supported (I don't have a great support system), and that so many Ppl relating to me makes me feel less alone, although I hate that all of you are suffering.</p>
<p>So, I took my pill, went for a jog listening to binaural beats and waves, got back home and did the 5 step sensory thing, and I feel much better. Thank you to all of you!</p>
<p>PS. I would love to respond to all the questions, as well as asking questions of my own on a few posts. However, right now every time I start reading and thing how to reply my heart starts back up again, so I'll get back to it tomorrow when I'm feeling better. </p>
<p>More post script: I did take my med as suggested by several of you bc it did make sense, but I think it was a combination of all the suggestions that brought me out of it and keeping it from becoming a full on panic attack. </p>
<p>TL;Dr: thank all of you for everything, I'm pretty ok for the most part, I did several of your suggestions, I'll respond to you guys tomorrow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have actually gone for a jog/walk around the neighborhood during a panic attack and it really helped. I find the best thing to do (for me, I can’t guarantee this works for you) is to keep your body physically active, that way you don’t feel trapped and helpless.</p>
<p>Edit: I love seeing everyone respond with their own stories about what helps and doesn’t help. Hopefully someone can use these tricks to help themselves in the future when they need it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I feel myself start to get that tingling dissociation feeling before having a panic I will lay on the ground stomach down and do planks and hold for 45 seconds then a break then repeat until my body is too tired to have a panic attack. Still fat tho </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a direct answer to what you asked but there is a song on YouTube that has been scientifically proven to reduce anxiety by 60% I think? It’s called Marconi Union-Weightless. </p>
<p>When I feel really anxious I put the 10hr looped version on and pace around whilst I listen, after about 10 minutes I feel so much better, maybe it could help you?</p>
<p>Also Charles Linden has an mp3 about eliminating panic attacks and I haven’t had one since I first listened to it, could be worth a look for you. if you can’t find it the gist is instead of fearing panic attacks, tell your body to bring it on, do it’s worst, tell your body to give you the worst panic attack ever, and for some reason, it just stops it. Not sure how, I can’t remember the exact reason. I think it’s because fearing the panic attack gives it more power? </p>
<p>I hope you feel better soon. :) anxiety sucks, I have GAD but the things I mentioned stopped it from being really bad constantly! Best wishes!</p>
<p>Update: Found the research:</p>

<p>There is a list of other songs too although this was number 1 for reducing anxiety! :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow, thanks for posting that.  I started listening to this and I could feel my anxiety start to melt away.  Maybe it's just placebo effect, but I don't care.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it works for you then far be it for me to take that away.  I’ve had issues with anxiety my entire life. That said, in the interest of truth, I did a deep dive on the Marconi Union claim on my podcast a couple of years ago.  This included contacting the researchers and reviewing their results.  Spoiler: It was a marketing gimmick for Unilever.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with &quot;It's only a panic attack it will pass you'll be fine,&quot; is that I literally feel like I might slip out of reality and lose my mind when I have panic attacks. I know physically nothing will happen, but having the possibility that my mind will break is x10 worse. Therefore everything will be fine once it passes doesn't really work for me because I feel I am always clinging on to my sanity during an episode. Like my brain wants to leave the torment I feel and jump out of my body. I guess that's disassociation, but the thought of never returning from that nightmare is the worst part. </p></div>		</li>
