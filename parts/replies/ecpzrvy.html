			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly is a dimension in this context? I’m used to thinking of dimensions as the “generalized coordinates” (numbers) needed to define the state of a system. For example, three numbers x,y,z can be used to represent the position of an object in 3D space. But my understanding doesn’t make sense when you say stuff like “curled” dimensions </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about old videogame maps. You go off the right side and appear on the left, and going off the top gets you to the bottom.</p>
<p>This shape is a torus (doughnut). Glue the top and bottom and you get a tube, then glue the ends of the tube together.</p>
<p>Thus, for these maps, going &quot;East&quot; will take you around and around the doughnut. There is nothing outside the &quot;edges&quot; of the map. Much like making a map of the Earth where the right side cuts off just right of your left foot, and the left side cuts off just left of your right foot (same spot). Asking &quot;What is outside the map?&quot; is asking what is between that point and itself. </p>
<p>Likewise with our torus videogame map. Both edges are just the same point, and it doesn't make sense to talk about outside a point and itself.</p>
<p>This torus map has 2 curled dimensions.</p>
<p>And if you want, we could make a hyper torus by making it so when you dig down into the ground, you appear in the sky. Instead of having those edges (inner torus and outer torus) as separate (like the top and bottom of our &quot;flat&quot; map), we can curl it around so there are no edges. Of course, we need to get fourth dimensional about it, despite it only having 3 dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever played 'Asteroids'? In that game if you pass through to top of the screen you reappear at the bottom. The game is 2D but you can picture this mechanic in 3D by &quot;folding&quot; (curling) the 2-dimensional plane in the 3rd dimension to create a tube (connecting the top of thw screen to the bottom). If you connect the left and right side as well you get a hollow donut sort of thing.</p>
<p>It is kind of like that, but in this case the dimensions would be really small iirc, as in you only need to move extremely small distances to &quot;loop through the whole dimension&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another analogy of a curled dimension, other than video game maps, are ropes.  This illustrates the difference between our &quot;normal&quot; 3 dimensions and the 8 hypothetical curled dimensions that the brane-theory version of string theory requires.</p>
<p>To a human walking along a tightrope, they have one dimension of travel: Forwards and backwards.</p>
<p>An ant on the same rope, though, has two dimensions. Besides going forwards and back, they can go around the rope.</p>
<p>Particles in space need to travel only along the 3 dimensions. The strong and weak nuclear force carriers only need to travel along a couple of extra dimensions... Electromagnetism travels along a few others, and gravity travels along all dimensions.  The more dimensions that a force travels through, the more diluted it becomes... which is why a fridge magnet can lift a paperclip from a table, besides the entire force of gravity of the entire planet working to keep the paperclip in place.</p>
<p>Another way to visualize the &quot;diluted&quot; property of the different forces is... Imagine pouring out a bucket of water on flat ground.  The water spreads out along the plane, then comes to a rest fairly quickly.  Now pour the same bucket down a rain gutter... It doesn't spread out, but it flows quite far; there's more &quot;oomph&quot; as it travels when you reduce the number of dimensions that it can travel through.</p>
<p>(And my personal opinion, which really doesn't matter as I'm really just a lay-person who likes collecting analogies about things that interest me from various consumer-oriented books on science from people like Brian Greene, rather than scientific journals and directly from professionals... In my opinion, string theory and the extra dimensions needed to support it have passed the point where they need to defecate or get off the commode... It's an untestable hypothesis, and until it can be tested, it's about as useful as Russell's Teapot.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, this isn't how it actually progressed at all. Kaluza-Klein theory added a 5th dimension that yielded a broken-but-combined version of gravity and EM. But string theory definitively did not start out with anything other than good old fashion four dimensions. </p>
<p>EDIT: This isn't &quot;incorrect&quot;. This just develops it historically inaccurate. As OP's question wasn't &quot;what is the historical development of string theory's extra dimensions&quot; I think it's a fine answer. I emphasized the point because it's really hard for a layman to grasp why 11 dimensions isn't the insane cuckoo pseudo-science that it sounds like. &quot;11 dimensions&quot; sounds like some stoner was sitting on a field and said &quot;bro, think about this: 11 dimensions and 7 of them are like tiny and curled up&quot; when in reality it was very well motivated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A long time ag I was in a discussion about a physical 4th dimension. The framing was imagine you have to explain the 3rd dimension to someone trapped in a 2d world. A 2d space is a slice of 3D, so 3D objects would be seen passing through. Thinking about how hard it would be to explain the n+1 dimension to someone in an n dimension world was thought provoking.</p>
<p>I’ll have the read up on kaluza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great 3Blue1Brown episode where he explains quite good how you can explain a 3D space to a 2D-being. I will see if I can find it.</p>

<p>Here it is</p>

<p>I recommend anyone even a little bit interested in how mathematic works to subscribe to this guy. I'm a filthy lawyer, but I love this YouTube channel. His visualization of math is outstanding, he explains things very clearly and he really tries to make you understand even if you have no idea how to actually do math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This follows an example from The Universe.  One of the professors talked about sitting in a boat on a lake.  Using the fish as 2d creatures it was explained that we (being 3d creatures) can interact with and perceive their 2d world, but they have a much harder time interacting with ours.  They are mostly just kind of aware of our passing and certain motions.  I thought it was a pretty good analogy for multi dimensions.  But it's been a while.  Now I gotta find The Universe again. </p></div>		</li>
