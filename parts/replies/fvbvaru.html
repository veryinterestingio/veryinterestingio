			<div class="markdown"><p>They're actually still surprisingly cool because of the air pocket it creates around the body.  I vastly prefer wearing loose (yes, even black) robes than tighter Western clothing (even if light colored) when I'm in the Middle East.</p>
<p>I'd wear them in the summer months in the US, too, if it were more culturally acceptable.  It's kind of irritating that culture prohibits what I'd prefer to wear in either direction, if I'm honest.</p>
<p>It's hard to get more comfortable than wearing loose, breathable clothing in the heat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The field service rep I was meeting firmly instructed me on the proper clothing to wear so I could be safe.  I wore a light cotton shirt. It was quite amusing to me that it was cooler to keep my sleeves rolled down, than expose skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The surcoat generally lacks airflow, making it more like a winter coat.  It keeps the sun's heat out, but the main problem is it keeps the heat generated by the body in, and we rely on exposed skin for much of our cooling, much more so than most mammals.</p>
<p>At rest, the body generates about 100W of waste heat.  At max exertion, an athlete can generate up to 2000W of waste heat which can exceed the cooling capacity in even very cold conditions.  Breathing rejects SOME heat- but at 95F 50% relative humidity air in, 98.6F 100% relative humidity out, the wattage you can shed through breathing is limited.  You cannot increase the volume of air breathed in and out much without hyperventilating.</p>
<p>At that point, it's wattage generated minus wattage lost by breathing, times time, divided by thermal mass.  The body will hit a critical heat stroke at 104 F (40 C).</p>
<p>The amount of heat absorbed by the sun is highly variable, but a horizontal black plate at noon in sunny temperate regions is 1KW over a square meter.  A person standing up is much less.  You'll heat up much worse by wearing a coat.</p>
<p>By contrast, dogs do almost no cooling through their skin, they cool through panting.  Panting is a unique rhythm where the breaths aren't deep enough to hyperventilate.  Humans cannot pant, if you try to cool by breathing harder you'll hyperventilate and pass out.  Call it a design flaw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans can sweat, though. We don't have to stop running to use our body's natural cooling system. It's why we're like horror movie monsters... We used to hunt by chasing down our prey until they collapsed from exhaustion/overheating and even though they're faster we never. Stop. Coming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The ability to sweat, the lack of fur, and the fact that we can kick into anaerobic breathing that we humans can keep up for a good long while. We're slow, but we don't stop. </p>
<p>And then we can plan ahead. Wherever the prey animal goes, we're waiting, because we know how it thinks.</p>
<p>When other animals need to rest in the shade, humans in peak fitness can easily jog out and hunt. </p>
<p>We're so badass we put our ancient predators in cages and turned them into cute entertainment.</p></div>		</li>
