<p>Also, to add to that summary a practical part: don't mention it, OP. By all means educate yourself as to what went on, but don't bring the stuff up in conversation unless they talk about it first. I live in Donegal and at least around here it's not considered a topic for conversation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Best advice in this whole thread. It's a fragile peace, and there were no clean hands in the Troubles. Best to just let it be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's closer to asking your Jewish or German grandfather about the holocaust, or someone from Albania about what they think of the Kosovo conflict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea it definitely depends where you are and what the family are like.</p>
<p>Seriously much easier not to mention it, because not only is it complicated with a lot of history, it's also an incredibly emotional issue for a lot of people</p>
<p>The Good Friday Agreement was about 20 years ago, but it's still a topic that can elicit an emotional reaction.</p>
<p>Mainly, the version of history is disputed between both sides.</p>
<p>We're lovely people, and will welcome you. It's quite a unique place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also add to this that the English settlement of the N. Ireland region (Ulster) goes back to King James I (yes, that King James) in the 16th century and English influence even before that with Anglo-Norman invasion in the 12th century. The underlying cultural and historical roots of the divide between the RoI and NI are very, very old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation.</p>
<p>For a slightly more light hearted view on it, its worth watching the excellent comedy &quot;Derry Girls&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Derry\_Girls\_episodes" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Derry\_Girls\_episodes</a></p>
<p>Its set towards the end of the troubles, and S02E01 is all about the sectarianism.</p>
<p>Its also bloody funny.</p></div>		</li>
