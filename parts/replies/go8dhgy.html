			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, people really overestimate the grade of roads. Most of steepest roads in the world are like a 20 degree angle - that's the really gnarly shit in San Francisco. They look like 45 degree angles but they're actually less than half of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned to drive manual cars when I lived in SF. I remember the panic of trying to feather the parking brake, the clutch, and the gas when trying to drive up some of those streets. </p>
<p>Yeah, that would not be a good way to build roads in general. Especially in areas with ice and snow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stop exaggerating. The steepest roads in San Francisco have a 30-35% incline which is around 16-18 degrees. A 45 degrees grade is a 100% incline</p></div>		</li>
