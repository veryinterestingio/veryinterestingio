<p>I always called the &quot;slope&quot; the &quot;hill&quot;, but otherwise everything said here is correct. </p>
<p>Skydiving in the rain hurts. Any part of your skin exposed to the outside will end up covered in what looks like a rash, but is basically the result of impacts of the raindrops. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Here is the really interesting piece of information. Not only are you falling faster than raindrops, you're falling <em>so much faster</em> than them that raindrops hurt you when you catch up and collide with them.</p>
<p>Others have looked up the terminal velocity of both (thanks /u/SpeakeasyImprov) and found that the skydiver goes at  60m per second compared to 9m per second for rain drops. This means you're getting hit by the equivalent of 51m per second (183.6km/h, 114mph) raindrops in the face, as opposed to the normal everyday 32kmh/20mph raindrops. And, of course, that hurts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet another skydiver here. Of course it hurts, like little needles. Not to talk about the little red spots you find in your skin when you get to the ground (let's say.. in summer and you're jumping in shorts and/or short sleeve). And sometimes it doesn't not even need to be raining: You can also feel it while going through some clouds in free fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone mentioned higher up there are suspended ice crystals that form inside of clouds, so that is what a skydiver will feel when falling through the clouds.</p>
<p>Of course these crystals are relativley stationary when compared to falling rain so you would actually hit them <strong>faster</strong> than rain drops</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Have done a few HALO/HAHO jumps.  It's a weird sensation, for sure.  Always reminded me of being poked thousands of times.</p>
<p>Jumping through hail is brutal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never jumped in snow. We tend to avoid bad weather. Only times I've jumped in the rain - twice - was because bad weather came in fast and we got out anyways.</p>
<p>I've never jumped in hail either. </p>
<p>I have gone through wet clouds though, more than twice. The darker the cloud the denser it is. Sometimes there's ice crystals in the cloud, and that hurts too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Technically it's illegal (in the US) to jump through cloud (or even near cloud) due to visibility concerns (small aircraft / other skydivers). That really is the principal danger. </p>
<p>I'm really not the most experienced jumper (500 jumps so far) but I've jumped a few clouds. Some clouds are heavy with water / ice crystals - they look darker when looking at them. Others are just puffy and aren't as dense. </p></div>		</li>
