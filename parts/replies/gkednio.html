<p>Also using band aides during the night will help prevent unconscious self sabotage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's counterproductive, sure, but our bodies aren't perfect. And if this isn't posing a significant problem to our evolutionary purpose (to survive long enough to reproduce), then there won't be any evolutionary pressure for this to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the part that most people don't understand because evolution is taught very poorly. With the exception of periods of very extreme pressure evolution is not &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; but, rather, &quot;least survival of the least fit&quot;. That is why death itself is the most highly evolved trait of life on earth.</p></div>		</li>
