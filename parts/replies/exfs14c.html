<p>That really is the answer to a lot of lifes questions; 'How do you do this without causing that problem?', Well we do cause the problem---we just deal with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder?</p>
<p>According to the CDC, you want to wash your hands for about 20 seconds, but they break the act of &quot;washing your hands&quot; into five parts: Wet, Lather, Scrub, Rinse, Dry</p>
<p>The machine dispenses <a href="https://www.meritech.com/products/soaps-and-solutions/" target="_blank">Meritech's proprietary quat-based solution</a>, and really I'm betting most of this machine's cost can be attributed to the R&amp;D required to make this solution be both effective, and good for the machine</p>
<p>What the machine does is Wet, Lather, Rinse, over about 12 seconds. That makes me think it really only does sanitization, especially since they're using quats, which isn't a replacement for hand soap. Their website adds, you need to rinse your hands with potable water after using the machine, as quats leave a residue. If your hands are covered in BBQ sauce or oil or anything &quot;visibly dirty&quot; you probably wouldn't want to use this machine.</p>
<p>I'm sure you could DIY this, but you will struggle to make an effective solution without knowledge behind the chemistry of it, and I'm not sure anyone in a non commercial setting has a reason to use this over germ-x and hand soap.</p>
<p>Interesting to think about, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quat solution won’t really harm any internals in a machine like that. It’s basically a soapy water, just with special detergents. It’s harmless to materials on the insides of the machine such as stainless steel or PFTE.</p>
<p>Also, “proprietary solution” doesn’t mean much. There are hundreds of manufacturers of quat solution that would work just fine, but the machine manufacturer will recommend their own  so they can charge the customer out the ass for consumable supplies.</p>
<p>Source: I used to be a QC chemist for a company that manufactured quat solution.</p></div>		</li>
