			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also really hard to breathe silicon, since silicon dioxide is, y’know, sand. Carbon dioxide, meanwhile, is gaseous at a lot of temperatures that other substances like to be at. Most critically, water can move between gas, liquid, and solid at temperatures where carbon dioxide is easy to use, which is not true of silicon dioxide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So...maybe there is silicon based life on an extremely hot planet above the boiling point of silicone dioxide? I'm sure there are other problems with this but I'd be curious if you knew about any research into that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Google, the boiling point of silicon dioxide is 4046 Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Obviously that would not be compatible with life as we know it.  I can't speculate on what high temperature solids and liquids exist that would be compatible with those temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no chemist but when I was younger for... academic purposes, I researched the chemical process of producing MDMA.</p>
<p>Long story short, never made on step into that project, but learned a bunch of amazing stuff, namely this:</p>
<p>The thing with complex organic compounds is that they work well below (If I remember correctly) about 150 C. Above that, they tend to break apart into individual atoms and lose their properties, becoming simply carbon, oxygen, etc.</p>
<p>That's why a lot of chemical reactions with organic materials needs to be done in a vacuum, because by reducing the pressure you reduce the temperature needed for the reaction to occur. With a good enough vacuum you can &quot;unlock&quot; chemical reactions that wouldn't be possible at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>So no, really hot temperature generally does not mix well with life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And given the size of the universe its entirely possible it has... but that be a needle in a haystack to find. Meanwhile, given the greater likelihood of carbon based life its a greater chance of finding such than the potentially much rarer silicone or sulfur based. With limited ability to search, its better to sear for things with a greater  chance to be found</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a sort of recent article that said a life form that lives in a pool of arsenic was discovered and proved life can be based on things other than carbon or silicon.</p>
<p>Edit: correction, apparently that was debunked. Disregard!</p>
