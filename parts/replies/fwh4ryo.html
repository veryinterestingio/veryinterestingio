<p>Realistically that is what a tree does. Trees break down though eventually releasing that energy again. We could do more permanent storage than wood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wood isn't too bad for long-term storage. You can submerge wood in low-oxygen water and it will stay intact for centuries. <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/sustdev/csd/csd15/PF/info/A_Alimasi.pdf" target="_blank">Carbonization of the wood into charcoal followed by burial</a> is even better, and can retain carbon in the earth for millenia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but that isn't what happens to most wood now. Left alone, the average fallen tree now is broken down and the carbon is released. The conditions required to naturally turn wood into coal do not exist in many locations now. </p>
<p>We could mass bury logs deep in the ground and bury them i guess, There would be better ways to capture and store carbon though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All coal was made in a short period (40My) a while ago (350My). Then fungi figured out how to eat up lignin and cellulose and there has been no coal made ever since. Funny to think about just palm trees fallen on palm trees for 40M years or more just not rotting away.</p>
<p>If you really want to know how we got out of the other 5 global warming <em>cough</em> mass extinction events, it's chaulk it's always chaulk. So what you want to do is grow a new pair of mountains and wait for about 700My for them to erode due to acid rain and slowly turn to chaulk islands, works every time and it stores sun energy in a very stable form of carbon as calcium carbonate.</p>
<p>The other way would also be a few milion years of algeae growth in shallow oceans like we had when all the oil in the world was made before the Arabian Peninsula rose up on the map, but you need very specific conditions to burry them and keep them under pressure.</p>
<p>Our safest bet now is to aerosolize salt and have 24h cloud coverage over the Pacific, forever, or until we bury back 200 years of coal and oil... somehow, otherwise the temps will keep rising until they hit the equilibrium point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Turning energy into mass is much, much harder than the other way around. Radioactive materials turn mass into energy without any help. I am not aware of any such reverse process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know how we turn matter to energy, usually just light it on fire, but how do you turn energy into matter?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or we can capture carbon from atmosphere, which would allow heat/energy to leave the atmosphere (by being reflected in space), and put that carbon back into the earth.</p></div>		</li>
