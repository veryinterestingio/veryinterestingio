<p>Your body wants to be 37°.</p>
<p>It produces heat as a by product of being alive.</p>
<p>It needs to be able to maintain temperature.</p>
<p>Air is a crappy medium for heat transfer so we really need that air to be a good bit cooler to improve the transfer of heat.  We are able to equalize with air at around 22 degrees.</p>
<p>But in a perfect world, we would feel right at home in a 36.5 degree environment.  And that is exactly what water is for us.  A nice 36 degree bath will feel very pleasant because we can dump heat into water so efficiently.  Its got great thermal capacity.</p>
<p>As the shower temperature rises over 37°, you quickly overheat.  Beyond 40° starts to be unbearable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, 98.6 is kind of made up. The average isn’t really meant to be that specific. It’s not meant to be that precise, to the tenth. It’s just a conversion from 37C. It turns out that’s not really accurate either probably. The figure was from a study about a hundred years ago and temperatures were likely higher at the time due to more general inflammation/ infection from disease at the time(think teeth). It’s probably closer to 98.2 F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For saunas it depends greatly on the sauna itself. For some 70-80 is enough for a pleasant experience. Some need it to be closer to 90 and some really need to be at like 100 for it to be good. Mostly depends on the size with larger saunas needing higher temperatures. Then there was this one time at a friend's place last summer when drunk when we semi-accidentally heated the sauna up to like 120. And it was a small one as well, fitting only like 4 or 5 if you squeeze. That was quite something.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>woah seriously, 120F? not really doubting u that just seems crazy to me. ive been splashed with boiling water (though small amounts splashing pasta and things) and never had serious burns that didnt heal in a few days.</p>
<p>120F is way below boiling, so is it just the length of exposure that would cause serious burns?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No way. Water only just becomes painfully hot right around 113, so him showering at 112 is definitely not out of the question. 8 degrees higher than that in a medium that transfers heat 20x faster than air is a LOT hotter to our bodies. Remember 8 degrees is the difference between normal body temperature, severe hypothermia, and a deadly high fever.</p>
<p>Now, immersion in that temperature of water would be dangerous very quickly, but showers aren't full immersion. You're still standing in air, and the water has to run all the way down your body where it's constantly losing heat to both your body and the air. You also have to take into account that nobody starts their shower at full temperature. You have to ease into it, so he may only be under 112 degree water for ~5 minutes of his shower after easing into it. I know from personal experience that as the shower goes on, it stops being hot enough simply because my blood vessels have dilated and I'm losing much more heat to the environment, but it would feel scalding hot if I got into it immediately at the temperature it ends at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No - especially if you have lower water pressure. What the above comment doesn’t mention (for simplicity’s sake) is heat transfer via evaporation. As the water runs off your body it quickly evaporates, causing a cooling effect (same phenomenon as sweat). However if you had a bath in that temperature water (no evaporation) you would quickly overheat.</p>
<p>Edit: i originally thought it said 102 degrees - 112 is definitely on the warmer side, so my initial thought is there may possibly be heat loss between the sensor and the water you feel, or a faulty sensor. However, the reasons why you can tolerate higher temps in a shower still stand as explained above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband runs a bit &quot;hotter&quot; than I do - he feels really warm to me, and even sweats in his sleep while I do not. Also, the temperature he showers at turns me into a lobster. It's so hot! If he takes a shower at my preferred temperature he perceives it as lukewarm at best.</p>
<p>Do our bodies <em>actually</em> run at different temperatures?  What else could explain this difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because water is a much more effective heatsink due to its density and thermal capacity.</p>
<p>Think how hard it is to boil water over a fire, but yet the air heats up like its nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has a lot to do with thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>For example, you might jump into bed and your bed is cold, even though you're standing in a room that feels comfortable. This is because the bed is made with solid materials (fabric of the sheets, etc.) that has much higher thermal conductivity than air does. So, even though the bed and the air are the same temperature, the bed is much better at pulling heat out of your body.</p></div>		</li>
