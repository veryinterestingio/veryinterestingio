			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. The question was about whether life can exist in a two star system. </p>
<p>The main thing challenging life in a two star system is fluctuations. Fluctuations in gravity and radiative levels amongst other things. Life on Earth has adapted to the seasonal rhythms of its tilted axis, rotation speed, moon, orbit distance and speed around a single star. </p>
<p>We automatically tend to think of life as “life like us”. We can be certain that life on a planet in a two star system will have different qualities than life here.</p>
<p>Life here thrives in relatively stable conditions and struggles in variations, unusual conditions, or shifts in weather patterns. </p>
<p>Life there will have to be adapted to more frequent fluctuations. The fluctuations depend on the circumstances. Maybe 3 mini winters and summer and one more significant summer and winter per year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no. </p>
<p>A “season” requires tilt, orbit, and rotation (at a minimum). Take a look at an illustration showing the summer and winter solstices as well as the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. For the solstices, tilt and orbital position result in different radiative values for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Summer is more radiation, winter is less. But both tilt and orbit are factors. </p>
<p>Seasonality implies a fluctuating expectation of conditions repeated over a period of time. So again orbit, tilt, and rotation are important factors.</p></div>		</li>
