			<div class="markdown"><p>All transistors are analog devices. An analog (continuously variable) voltage or current is generally applied to one terminal, and that produces (generally) an analog current between two other terminals.</p>
<p>Sometimes analog transistors are used in circuits where only a limited number of states are of interest -- on and off, high and low, etc.</p>
<p>The discrete steps are the states we are interested in. There is a &quot;step&quot; from low to high, because anything in between we are not interested in, or the circuit simply cannot settle at.</p>
<p>The resolution is the number of possible states. For a standard digital circuit, on and off are two possible states, which represents 1 bit of resolution.</p></div>		</li>
