			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the biochemistry of temperature sensation, I believe thermally conductive materials feel colder because they're actually removing heat from your fingers.  If both the steel and the wood are at the same temperature as your fingers, you'd sense them to be the same temperature (which they are), despite the fact that they have different thermal conductivity values.  They feel the same because there's no heat transfer when everything is at the same temperature (fingers included).  So what's really happening is that locally, at the surface of your skin, your skin is actually getting colder when you touch an object that is at a lower temperature.  Your fingers sense this drop in temperature.  High thermal conductivity materials just allow for more heat to be extracted, and thus the fingers get colder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good description.  </p>
<p>To elaborate on your description, thermally conductive materials feel warmer when they are above the temperature of your fingers (or skin).  A good example is when you are in a sauna, the wood feels warm, but if your leg touches a nail, it feels extremely hot even though it is the same temperature as the wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Temperature is always trying to reach equilibrium, thermal conductivity determines how fast it can happen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the example of water and air. If it's a comfortably warm day out (say 70 or 80 degrees farenheit) you'll feel relatively comfortable. But, if you jumped into a public pool at the same temperature range it would feel much colder. This is all because air, due to there being physically &quot;less&quot; of it, is less effective at drawing heat out of you than water is.</p></div>		</li>
