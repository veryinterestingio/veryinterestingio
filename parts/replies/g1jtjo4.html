<p>Edit: I ruined the fun and consulted google. Apparently it has to do with the flow of electrolytes in your blood stream (which you need to properly
Contract muscles). The heart slows down, and so does blood flow, and so your electrolyte distribution changes. It takes time after waking up for those electrolytes to make their way back into your extremities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can clench fists in the morning, but weak ones. It’s like I’m missing half my grip strength? I asked my doctor about it once and he said it had something to do with bloodflow and how my heart needed to do some stuff as I wake up. I didn’t pay much attention to the how/why, I just wanted to make sure it was normal to have weak hands in the mornings because I asked friends about it and they mostly looked at me like I was hallucinating.</p></div>		</li>
