			<div class="markdown"><p>That's almost a guarantee; the rest is just making the math tractable. The idea of a measurement has come a long way since original QM formulation. And describing a measurement in terms of decoherence certainly seems more convincing than &quot;things with consciousness cause collapse&quot;, doesn't it? If you've really just stumbled on this question without previous exposure, kudos to you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of. There is a much simpler answer, but someone clever enough with QM can make it seem like that answer doesn't work. Decoherence explains why the simple answer doesn't have any gaping holes in it after all.</p>
<p>The simpler answer is, when you make a measurement - suppose it is an up or down spin measurement - you're taking the wavefunction of your nice isolated system and entangling it with the detector. That splits the much much more complicated wavefunction of the whole detector into an 'measured-up' state and a 'measured-down' state. Note that it's hard for the detector to evolve from one of these to the other one except by emitting some sort of signal that is going to differentiate these outcomes in some way.</p>
<p>Normally, it'll be by recording the data, moving that difference out from the detector to the recording. But it doesn't need to be that - as long as there is a different consequence somewhere in the universe, they aren't even going to be feeding into the same states in order to interfere with each other. And if they DO, you're never going to be able to get interference out because the process of the detector forgetting its value without passing it on is thermodynamic, and thermodynamic processes are too complex to get clean interference out of.</p>
<p>SO, as soon as the two components of the detector have split up, you can handle the dynamics of either one without ever consulting the other. You aren't going to get any interference from the other one. It's just irrelevant. It might as well be in some other world, or it might as well have just gone poof and no longer exist.</p>
<p>THAT explains the collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will make a follow-up comment because you have received contradictory answers. Someone who says &quot;no&quot; trusts our formulation of wavefunction collapse is complete. It is not. It <em>is</em> simple and satisfactory for describing many current experiments, but in the coming decades there will be much development on the relationship between measurement, entanglement, and decoherence.</p>
<p>Bell had a very strong statement: &quot;Here are some words which, however legitimate and necessary in application, have no place in a <em>formulation</em> with any pretention to physical precision: <em>system</em>, <em>apparatus</em>, <em>environment</em>, <em>microscopic</em>, <em>macroscopic</em>, <em>reversible</em>, <em>irreversible</em>, <em>observable</em>, <em>information</em>, <em>measurement</em>â€¦ On this list of bad wordsâ€¦ the worst of all is measurement.&quot; Many people believe there should be a framework QM without arbitrary distinctions (&quot;I'm making a measurement now, don't do the unitary thing for a bit!&quot;). I went looking for a summary and found <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/59209
">this book chapter</a>. Although I don't find its conclusion very convincing, you should see <strong>section 7.5</strong> (decoherence as a solution to the measurement problem) and know that 1. the problem is not solved, 2. the math is unsatisfactory, and 3. decoherence with macroscopic systems has some promising characteristics for approximating the measurement <em>postulate</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot. Yes I took it a bit like that, wavefunction collapse is non-unitary when looked at crudely, but if we had the details of the mechanism it might not be this way. Like many things in thermodynamics are irreversible but arise from micro mechanisms which are reversible. But you state it better and with more details, very helpful. I studied QM a while ago before drifting to biology, and I've always hated this thing of &quot;measurements&quot; being a thing appearing in the theory, so I'll be very glad to hear the outcome the day people figure it out ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>

<p>Due to the uncertainty principle, the outcomes will generally be distributed across a range of values, eg we detect some photons everywhere across the full width of the screen behind the double slit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to clarify, quantum indeterminacy, which you describe here, is completely different from the uncertainty principle, which states that you can't know both values of certain pairs of quantities (such as position and momentum) exactly at the same time.  (This is a mathematical limit;  even if we could measure things perfectly without disturbing them it would still exist.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And more to the point, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) says you could get the outcomes of one measurement highly constrained, at the cost of making the complementary measurement less constrained. The reason the outcomes of this measurement have to be spread all over the place is because they chose to make the complementary measurement very highly constrained (in this case, it's which way was the light going, and it is constrained to be going away from the slits). But even then it's not strictly due to the HUP because 2-slit interference is not all that close to the limit imposed by the HUP. It <em>is</em> due to the same general reasoning that's behind the HUP, though, so it's not too much of a stretch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but nonetheless the uncertainty principle is not the same thing as quantum indeterminacy nor is it necessary to bring it up the uncertainty principle this context, and I think that it is important to use precise language when describing these things as otherwise people get confused.</p></div>		</li>
