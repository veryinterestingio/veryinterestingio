<p>Well, a child can be a loved one. Or a mother. Or sister.</p>
<p>So, it's certainly possible he could be picking something up for his wife <strong>AND</strong> his mistress's sister.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Breakfast burrito? &quot;Hell yeah, I got a long day of travelling ahead of me.&quot;<br />
Layover burrito? &quot;Well...I've got 55 minutes to kill, and that carne looks amazing....&quot;<br />
Arrival burrito? &quot;I better eat, I have no idea how bad traffic is going to be, and I don't know where the good restaurants are in town yet.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to sell sunglasses. Oakleys were overpriced, but they were still the toughest and best-designed sport glasses on the market in the early 2000s. Ran circles around Arnette, Bolle, Rayban Sport even. Sure, they were ugly, but functionally, if you got the right pair for your needs? They were lifesavers.</p></div>		</li>
