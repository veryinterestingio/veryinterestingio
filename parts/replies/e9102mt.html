<p>For example some laws apply to &quot;Great Britain&quot;. That means they apply anywhere in England, Scotland or Wales, even on islands like Anglesey or the Shetlands which are not part of Great Britain in sense of the island.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not the case. Great Britain is an island and nothing else. England, Scotland and Wales are mostly situated on it, but all also consist of territories outside Great Britain, such as the Isle of Wight, Anglesey, Orkney and Shetland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rest of Ireland is it’s own distinct sovereign state/country.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland is a “constituent country” that is part of the U.K.</p>
<p>When British people refer to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as countries, we use it in a very different way to most people in the world.</p>
<p>Our “countries” are not sovereign states, which is what most people actually mean when they talk about countries. Instead they are historically separate political entities brought together by treaties (Edit: and/or conquest)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Although some people would prefer them to be the same country. A lot of people got killed over that, both in the 1920s, and from the 1960s onwards (although it settled down a bit since the late 1990s).</p>
<p>There's still a lot of political and social tension, there are some parts of NI where you wouldn't want to go wearing orange or flying a UK flag, and some parts where you wouldn't go wearing green or showing any Irish indicators.</p>
<p>Most acts of terrorism in the UK still happen in Northern Ireland (by a massive margin) but they don't get much national attention.</p>
<p>NI politics is still very much divided between &quot;Unionists&quot; (want to be part of the UK) and &quot;Nationalists&quot; (want to be part of Ireland), and NI hasn't had a Government since early 2017 partly as a result of this. Plus the UK leaving the EU is really screwing with things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. Ireland the country (described as the Republic of Ireland to distinguish it from the island) is a completely independent sovereign state.</p>
<p>It has a long, troubled history with Britain though. It used to be part of the UK but broke away in the 1920s. The fallout of that was Northern Ireland being split off and remaining in the UK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Want more confusion? The northernmost point of the island isn't in Northern Ireland. The colloquial term for visiting the Republic in NI is to go &quot;down South&quot;. It's therefore possible to go down South while travelling North. Isn't it fun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the <em>island</em> of Ireland has Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the latter of which is totally independent of the UK.</p>
<p>To make things more complicated, anyone born in Northern Ireland is allowed to hold British or Irish citizenship (or both), but anyone born in the Republic of Ireland is simply Irish.</p></div>		</li>
