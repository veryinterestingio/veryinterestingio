			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not quite sure this is an accurate characterization of early expert and modeling statements. While there was obviously extreme uncertainty early on about seasonality, serious scientists were at least looking into strong seasonality effects based on known seasonal characteristics of common cold Coronaviruses. I saw estimates that transmission might changes as much as 80%. Here is one early paper modeling that: <a href="https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20224" target="_blank">https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20224</a></p>
<p>Obviously things did not work out that way, and even early on there were lots of reasons to be skeptical of seasonality and cautious over all (southern hemisphere countries still saw fast spread after all), but strong seasonality was on the table as a possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they are correct in that seasonal variation in virus spread are often not really apparent when they first arrive on the scene, just due to how few people are immune and how well it spreads. The virus could still have seasonal variation in spread that we just haven't really seen yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the disease first broke out in the US we didn't have adequate testing. Now there are ways to get tested but questions around accuracy and turnaround time of certain platforms are growing.</p>
<p>When flu starts up again and infecting ppl with a lot of similar symptoms will that shift the focus back to testing? Not just for capacity but accuracy also?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s probably more like talking about immunity to the flu - the flu mutates so fast that we have to anticipate new strains every year. And there are several strains of Coronavirus that have already been identified.</p>
<p>There aren’t many diseases that our bodies just “forget” immunity to.</p>
<p>And I wouldn’t rule out that what he meant was more like why colds seem to hit harder and stronger in the winter; we are all going to be inside, grouped together, in weather that promotes a weaker immune system/higher susceptibility to disease, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. Do we know yet if those who had one strain is definitely susceptible to any others (that currently exist)? Or is it possible that the strains aren’t different enough from each other that immunity wouldn’t cross over?</p>
<p>In other words, is there a (significant) chance that it’s not going to be seasonal? </p>
<p>If you can, you can include something something T-cell heterogeneity in your answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We “forget” immunity to the flu after about a year. With a drastic step off after about 6 months. </p>
<p>So you can get the same exact strain every year, even without it mutating.</p>
<p>Going by it’s closer relatives: SARS (T-Cell immunity last 2 years), and MERS (has a 4 year immunity), with the mutation rate of COVID currently being somewhere in between the two; it’ll probably mean we’ll need a booster for it every 3-ish years.</p>
<p>Flu, Covid, SARS, MERS are not “one and done” vaccinations. BUT the good news is that with the vaccination of Covid, it’ll probably mean vaccines of SARS and MERS shortly after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you’re referring to, but they didn’t roll it back, they just never talked about immunity in the first place. They just said a positive test can keep coming up positive for 3 months, so you don’t need to think you’re reinfected if you get another positive in that time.</p></div>		</li>
