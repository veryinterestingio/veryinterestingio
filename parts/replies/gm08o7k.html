			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, in case the panelists can't answer anymore, I'll bring a few quick informal answers to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes they are, and actually they must be reported on the package leaflet, <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/comirnaty-epar-product-information_en.pdf" target="_blank">this is an example for the Pfizer vaccine</a> (check &quot;4. Possible side effects&quot;). Long term effects would probably be rare, but I mean... I'll take the opportunity of NOT being a panelist and be frank with you, you can have rare unfavourable long-term effects from lots of stuff that don't save your life or the life of people around you... sugar, red meat, alcohol... One in 100 people dies while driving, does your partner drive? If yes, he can also have the guts to suck it up and have a vaccine that will save if not his/her life, the life of an elderly or immunocompromised person near you.</li>
<li>Possibly, yes - it can't be excluded. The vaccine could protect you enough to not show symptoms, but still produce enough of the virus to infect other people. Chances are higher with the &quot;less effective&quot; vaccines. The best course of action is to still wear a mask even if you're vaccinated. If people get vaccines, we can keep shops open for people wearing masks, until the pandemic stops. If people don't get vaccinated, we will periodically close shops because there are too many people in the hospitals.</li>
<li>Well, my friend, good luck with that! Antivax only see what they want to see. I would *not* focus on research articles, I'd focus on good scientific journalism. IMHO the staff at The Atlantic are doing an amazing job. Check out articles by <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahzhang" target="_blank">Sarah Zhang</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209" target="_blank">Ed Yong</a> and others, they're a joy to read. Or pick your favourite journalists from other journals too :)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To number two, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines DO NOT CONTAIN LIVE VIRUS so they do not make you susceptible to spreading any viral infection from the vaccine. mRNA vaccines work differently and do not contain infectious elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I donâ€™t think they mean will the vaccine give you the virus, or cause you tro transmit it, they are asking if the vaccine stops transmission. So far that is unknown but the latest research hints that they do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that isn't what he's saying.  he's saying that you could still contract covid, but be asymptomatic because of the vaccine.  in which case you could still infect others.</p>
<p>he said nothing about the vaccine itself infecting others.</p></div>		</li>
