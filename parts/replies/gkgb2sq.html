			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your breakdown- I think #4 gets closest in fact to the heart of the question (to me) which really should be “why do things tend to fade to <em>white</em>” (and the corollary, are there any colors that do not fade). Taking a guess here, is the simple answer that we’re basically looking at an elimination process in which, over time, molecules that absorb some portion of the sun’s light are more likely to break down, and those that reflect it will not- thus over a long period of time resulting in white/pale/gray-ish colors such as the surface of the desert, or the moon (bad analogy?)</p>
<p>Also interesting is the question of why more “stable” colored molecules are not more prevalent in nature. E.g. I imagine carbon will not fade easily, nor certain gemstones(?). Is it just that organic matter is the most prevalent source of colored molecules and happens to be delicate?</p></div>		</li>
