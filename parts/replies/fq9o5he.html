			<div class="markdown"><p>Are tense muscles why voices are higher when about to cry?</p>
<p>Ive also noticed that since getting treatment for anxiety and feeling more relaxed, my voice has deepened. I'm a woman. So I wonder if anxious people are subconsciously tensing their vocal chords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about high voices and crying specifically, but I personally have a condition where being really nervous or stressed closes my vocal cords fully, making breathing in really hard and my voice to range from nonexistent to really silent but super high pitched (I have to communicate with pen and paper because people find my struggle to breathe and speak hilarious, haha, she's choking so funny). It also happens when my cords get covered in too much mucus (am chronically very mucusy) or other kinds of irritants like cigarette smoke or stomach acid from GERD. They close up, and stay like that for up to 3 days, unless I get a corticosteroid inhalation. So I'd say yes, anxiety can definitely tense up vocal cords, since they close up mine to the point that my blood oxygen levels fall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this same disorder. My doctors call it paradoxical vocal fold dysfunction (which is a really whack name) but essentially I am gasping for air whenever I get truly, intensely upset. I have to leave the situation and really focus on breathing exercises until my vocal cords relax. It started in my early teens and has persisted through my mid 20s. I have the same frustration with people thinking it's funny (more when I was a teen and I was hormonal and got upset often, especially during competitive sports). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_cord_dysfunction" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal\_cord\_dysfunction" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal\_cord\_dysfunction</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not necessarily. Male voices are just inherently deeper due to larger anatomy, longer/thicker vocal folds, and lower vibration rate (125 vibrations per second compared to 250 in females.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway, for me at least, I think it's because I try to not think about it much so I can function (barely) and the slightest reminder that I'm not ok makes it all come back at once.</p>

Do you have people you can make a group chat with? One of the chats I spend the most time is with people I’ve never met but we have a common interest. Hope you feel better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Anecdotal, specific to me)</p>
<p>When I experience this, its usually because I'm suppressing or not acknowledging my emotions. I think it's a natural self-defense reaction the body takes to shield us from stress. But being asked if we're ok does two things: </p>
<p>1) it forces us to reconcile the way we've been FEELING with the repression we've been DOING, which opens the dams.
2) it causes us to see ourselves through the lens of someone else, and reminds us that it's ok to care about ourselves in the same way that we care for others. It's the second one that usually pushes me over the edge to tears. </p>
<p>I (and I think lots of people) have issues feeling that we are intrinsically valuable. And that makes it easy to bury feelings deeper down. So when someone sees me in pain and cares enough to ask about it, it forces me to see that my feelings are just as worthy of acknowledging as other people's are.</p></div>		</li>
