			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you can also try to not use shampoo at all for w couple weeks during vacation and see if your skin becomes healthier. Not using shampoo works wonders for skin health on some people (others may have it worse, hence just try). Johnny Haris made a nice <a href="https://youtu.be/T-_HKFjxVl0" target="_blank">video</a> about that topic and I can recommend the watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tried it this summer. I was always super conscious of my hair but nobody even noticed anything weird. My hair looks clean and skin feels better by just washing with regular water. I wish i could have some actual stats but it feels like half the population doesnt actually need shampoo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I needed to hear this sooner in life. Was complaining at the barbershop about dandruff, she kindly explained it wasn't dandruff and the anti-dandruff shampoo is actually worsening the drying out of skin. Since switching to regular shampoo and not washing my hair every single day it got better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is correct. if the description fits you, meaning you actually do have dandruff, see your doctor and get a ketoconazole 2% shampoo prescribed and follow your doctor's instructions. they may also give you steroids to help speed up the process. the fungus that causes sd feeds on grease on the skin so try to keep your head, including your face, clean and dry. you can and should use moisturizer. don't worry, once you are clear of it, maintenance is pretty easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My head is pretty thick with hair (more than the rest of my siblings) so whenever it grows too long my scalp just doesn’t breathe. Dandruff gets very bad and if I don’t wash my hair after a day it gets really greasy. I’ll pick out super large chunks off my scalp, all over my head. The only shampoo that helped me is head and shoulders lol. I tried selsun blue and ketoconazole 1 and 2% no bueno.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>did you go see a doctor? you won't benefit from a keto shampoo if you use it like a regular shampoo. your doctor would explain. you're supposed to to wait at least 15 mins after you lather so the skin absorbs it before rinsing.</p></div>		</li>
