			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, inflation will accentuate this problem.  Employee &quot;A&quot; is hired for $15/hour and a year later Employee &quot;B&quot; is hired for $20/hour.  When Employee &quot;A&quot; finds out, guess what happens next?  And when a bunch of employees find out they trained the new people who possess less skills/education and yet also make more money?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They get a raise commensurate with their skills, seniority, and value to the company?</p>
<p>This stuff wouldn't be a problem if management didn't make it a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This basically happened to me. </p>
<p>tl;dr: I undervalued myself based on previous salary + a year or two of inflation made my paycheck considerably less than some new people. </p>
<p>Longer version: I got hired at a retail store for 8.50/he (more than my previous job) with several years related experience. Then this 17yo kid with no work experience at got hired. He asked me about his paycheck and showed me, he was hired at 10.50/hr.</p>
<p>Even with ‘raises’ I was making over a dollar less an hour than this kid with no experience at the time of his hiring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And when you talk to management about it you either 1) get fired, 2) get in trouble, 3) get told maybe at review you can get a raise.   </p>
<p>The last one happened to me. I was working at a retail store for $7.50/hr. They hired some more people later with no experience for $9/hr. When I went to my boss he told me when my review came up we could talk about a raise. Review came and my raise was $0.25/hr more. He told me that was the best he could do. I quit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had almost the same thing happen. I was making 13 and I thought I was rolling in dough at this government job. It was pretty dece and I had years of experience, tbh more than just about anybody there so I figured that was what they paid everyone</p>
<p>Then they pull everyone into a meeting and say we are absolutely not allowed to discuss our wages under any circumstances</p>
<p><strong>Susasfuck</strong>.exe</p>
<p>I'm like nah fuck that, go to everyone directly (excluding the higher ups that called the meeting) and mention that what they said is illegal and probably only bc there is a huge wage disparity, tell them what I'm making and say if they're making less they should demand a raise. They were <em>aghast</em>.
The mf next to me who had literally no experience in the field was making 22, the closest person to my wage was our only bilingual agent (call center so, v important employee) made 15.
I was the most experienced person in the position and making the least, no two people (we all had the exact same job) had the same wage, it was fucked.
After months of negotiation, I got a raise to 15. And then the CEO came to the building and fired literally everyone, within an hour.</p>
<p>Government jobs, man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely agree with this. A new team.member straight from uni was so naive. He started chatting about wages and I completely shut him down and explained that's a pub conversation not one for the office. He laughed it off and said he had no issue discussing his wage he is happy on the £XXX he started on but felt it was a little low.</p>
<p>Then a colleague from a different team asked him to repeat the figure. He did all be it sheepishly.  She let rip as his starting wage was equivalent to the top wage in their team structure that she wasn't even on after 3 years of being in the position.</p>
<p>She went on explaining how he was brushing off his starting wage as nothing and that there are people in the company trying their best on a lot less. She then asked him to justify the difference in pay between the teams and her experience. </p>
<p>Never seen someone sink so far into their chair. Her questions were fair but directed at the wrong person. He started listening to my advice a lot more after this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, that's on the company for undervaluing the team rather than on him. He may have been a bit inconsiderate of lower earners in his tone, but the other person should have been &quot;glad&quot; to hear she should be earning more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think you are taking my response the wrong way. It was no way on him for my company underpaying the other team. However he set himself up for it by openly discussing wages without thinking about the consequences. Whether those consequences are justified or not. The result was always going to be that someone was going to get pissed off</p>
<p>As I say its a pub conversation.  Have a chat see what people are on then go back to the office and do something about it if you want to.</p>
<p>I went for a job interview at a company that had the salary of every employee on the internal wiki. If you felt you wanted more it was on you to prove it. That is a very forward way of thinking that was healthy imo. That said I think people are nieve if they think the every company is like this</p></div>		</li>
