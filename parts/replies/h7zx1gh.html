			<div class="markdown"><p>Not perfectly unless it was very cool, possibly so cool that the gases liquified. At that scale, the kinetic energy of individual molecules - heat - is much more relevant than gravity.</p>
<p>However, if you had a very tall and very cool box that somehow had little currents, then you'd find a higher concentration of lighter gases higher up, but that's more probabilistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That cooling in a tall tube is how we get bottled gases like Argon for welding, CO2 for drinks, oxygen for hospitals, etc. Get it cold enough, and you can seperate them. </p>
<p>It's fractional distillation if you're looking for more info. It's what they do with petroleum too, though at higher temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No - The average speed of the molecules in air at room temp is \~500 meters/second (1100 mph). Constantly pinging off each other at that speed even with no net &quot;wind&quot; direction keeps things too well mixed compared to how weakly gravity is trying to pull those tiny masses into layers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The follow-up to this is that above ~100 km, it <em>does</em> start to separate out.</p>
<p>This is a threshold known as the turbopause. Below that height, atmospheric turbulence is stronger than molecular diffusion, and gases are evenly mixed by that turbulence. Above that height, atmospheric turbulence is weaker than molecular diffusion, and gases begin to separate out by mass.</p></div>		</li>
