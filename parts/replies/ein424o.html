			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that part of the reason firefighters use water is that it flows away and is quickly replaced by new, cold water, which keeps taking away more and more heat.  Applying a solid substance may work too (like dry powder fire extinguishers ) but it has to be a specifically designed one that will spread out quickly and evenly. Water is the most effective tool for larger fires because it's so well understood and so easy to pump large amounts of it directly at the fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firefighter here — most room and content fires only need a tiny bit of water to put onto. When the compartment is hot enough, you can literally just point the nozzle at the ceiling, open the bail a few times and that steam works to smother the fire. </p>
<p>We try to limit water because a lot of residential fires incur more water damage than anything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially, but it isnt practical. The water in the mud would evaporate and leave dirt, which would act more in a suffocating effect and removing oxygen from the fuel source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to raise 1g water by 1 degree Celsius, it takes 1 calorie. To evaporate 1g of water is 540 calories. If you took water at it's coldest state (0 degrees) and heated to 100, that would take 100 calories/gram. At 100 degrees it would evaporate to steam at 540 calories/gram. I'm guessing OP did some quick estimation 100/540 to get ~20%. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Minor nitpick, but because zero degrees is special, you should indicate that it must be liquid water at zero degrees for this to be accurate. If there's any solid water (ice) also at zero degrees C in the container, you also have to take into account the extra heat to melt it. </p></div>		</li>
