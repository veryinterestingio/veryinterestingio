			<div class="markdown"><p>This could have to do with electrolytes, I don't know enough about them to explain the science but I know from personal experience there's a sleepy tired and there's the kind of tired that getting up off the couch to pick up the remote control is just way too much work and when you experience the second kind of tired it's usually means that your electrolytes are low and need to eat some fruit or something</p>
<p>( I had a friend who had a medical condition that her body didn't maintain a proper electrolyte balance and she would keep a can of tomato juice in her purse for when she started feeling groggy)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The melatonin I take is in teeny berry flavored tablets, they felt like diet sleeping pills. Now they're badass little darkness drops.</p></div>		</li>
