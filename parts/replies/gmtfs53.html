<p>Nope, I had never done any science reporting before NOVA came a-calling in 2009. I was writing a tech column for The NY Times. NOVA had a soon-to-expire grant from the National Science Foundation to make a miniseries about materials science. Yeah, there's a really singin', dancin' topic for  MINISERIES!!... how on earth to approach it?</p>
<p>So NOVA's Chris Schmidt punted: Instead of using an unseen voice-over narrator, as usual for NOVA, they'd hire a non-scientist as on-camera host...a stand-in for the audience. Someone curious and funny to interview the scientists. So he asked me!</p>
<p>Our first outing together, the four-part miniseries &quot;Making Stuff,&quot; wound up getting NOVA's best ratings in years, to everyone's total shock. We've worked together ever since... &quot;Beyond the Elements&quot; brings me up to 20 shows hosted!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for answering. I love how PBS humanizes scientists, and a good interviewer can bring out an infectious passion that is otherwise not seen in their published works or public image. Since I first watched your show in 2012, I became the first college graduate in my family, worked in national laboratories, worked with chemical and biohybrid material scientists, and started a scientific outreach program. I look forward to your new miniseries, and the next generation of inspired to-be scientists.</p></div>		</li>
