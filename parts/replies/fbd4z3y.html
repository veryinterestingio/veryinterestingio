			<div class="markdown"><p>You gotta think more like an astronomer, and approximate even more.</p>
<p>Drag is 0.5*k*rho*A*v^(2), where A is the cross sectional area of the Earth, v is the speed through the medium, rho is the density of the medium, and k is &quot;about one&quot;. If we're just looking at &quot;would it take days or billions of years to slow down?&quot; then this is good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that drag equation apply though for hypersonic speeds?</p>
<p>And you're not just forming small shockwaves, you are literally ramming a massive amount of air out of your way because it doesn't have time to form a smooth linear jet around the earth.</p>
<p>I don't know much about aeronautics, though, so I can't personally say.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we're doing rough calculations, a better way to estimate it is assume the volume of air the earth displaces every second has to be brought up to earth's velocity and brought along for the ride.</p>
<p>Is anyone willing to do the calculations and see if they're remotely comparable to the drag equation? I would, but I'll need to do it later, and by that time people will have forgotten about this post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>~rho v^2 is indeed the limit for large sizes at high speeds. This is actually what we use in astronomy for objects ploughing through interstellar gas. &quot;Ramming&quot; is indeed the right word - this is what we call ram pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no stipulation for &quot;the drag equation&quot; as you call it. It's just a  formula conjured up that seemed &quot;about right&quot; when describing the fluid-dynamic forces on an object, and the &quot;k&quot; constant just accounts for any irregularities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that you can't assume drag is anywhere near 1, as that's for Re 9 orders of magnitude lower than what we have.</p>
<p>But I concede... Why not use that? It's as good as we're gonna get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This huge Reynold's number means that it's effectively an inviscid fluid. That actually makes the problem simpler - we're now basically talking about ram pressure rather than drag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I think OP meant that the air in space would be resting relative to earths rotational axis. otherwise we'd had to clarify in which reference frame it was resting and then take into account the relative velocity of that.</p>
<p>I think it is safe to assume that OP meant that the air filled space is rotating around a resting (non rotating) earth at 360°/24hrs angular velocity. How long would it take for earth to rotate at the same speed?</p>
<p>edit: ?</p>
<p>edit²: rotational axis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right I totally overlooked the gif.</p>
<p>But then I think the right velocity of the air filled space was 800000 km/h which is the speed of the sun on its way around the center of the Milky Way. The speed of the earth around the sun could be neglected I think.</p>
<p>I know nothing about the structural integrity of the earth’s crust but a 800000 km/h storm, man a lot of stuff is gonna happen. Just think of the heating of the air due to compression “in front” of it.. I guess there won’t be much earth to slow down after a short time</p></div>		</li>
