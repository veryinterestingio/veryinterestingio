			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Visceral fat is not good at all.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;Men have a higher tendency to accumulate abdominal visceral fat compared to pre-menopausal women. The accumulation of abdominal visceral fat in men, which is a strong independent predictor of mortality, is mainly due to the higher dietary fat uptake by their abdominal visceral fat.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you are literally five years old then for the love of god don't watch this, but if you are over 21 then there is this very eye-opening yet absolutely haunting autopsy video of a very obese woman who died, I think, of heart failure, uploaded on YouTube (&quot;Obesity : The Post Mortem&quot; by Da7eee7)</p>
<p>DON'T SEARCH for this if you are NOT ready to see a dead human body being cut open and seeing A LOT of human fat - the thumbnail(s) alone is already tough to look at. It's very triggering and the images haunted me for weeks.</p>
<p>BUT - it's extremely educational and eye-opening (if not already out because of the shock). It's crazy where the body decides to store fat once it runs out of &quot;preferred&quot; space, and it gave me a different view on my body and why I should take good care of it. I'm posting and saying this because it stuck with me, and seeing only my outside it's easy to forget that there is a very real &quot;inside&quot; as well, doing it's thing (and being gross to look at :P ), and even though I might look fine on the outside might not mean that my insides are fine as well.</p>
<p>And yeah, having tons of visceral fat seems... hard on your body ._.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. You can't just &quot;choose&quot; where it goes because that's not how genetics works, but you can exert an influence on how fat is stored. The body doesn't want to store fat around the organs, so it you want to avoid stomach fat, don't eat too much excess. Things like sugar and alcohol are technically toxins that the body can't process and will often further the development of visceral fat, so avoiding those would be beneficial as well.
Eating healthy fats and making sure you're getting adequate dietary cholesterol will support healthy hormone function, which in turn influences where fat is stored. For a male, this is a little more difficult because men don't store as much fat around the butt and hip area, but the rule for subcutaneous fat development still applies.
Getting into the habit of fasting will give your body's cells a break from the influence of insulin. Hormones involved in the utilization of fat cells are deactivated in the presence of insulin, just make sure you still eat enough and well enough when you do eat, starving yourself through multiple small meals only causes muscle atrophy and contributes to insulin resistance.
Aside from that, any good habits that destress will also help, as stress/cortisol can also contribute to poor weight gain. Exercise is more for building muscle than it is for losing weight, and will generally improve mood, thus lowering cortisol. Massage promotes circulation to the target point and can influence things like muscle growth, tissue repair and fat development.
There's a billion different ways these things have an influence on your body so it's hard to even attempt to type it all out. Do some research! It's all very complex, but a lot of &quot;healthy habits&quot; are called so for a very good reason. Eat well, read a book, get some exercise, etc.</p>

I don't know why. But I explained it to my younger brother as I understood it, and up until he was about 15 he still believed that to be the truth until we were joking at a Thanksgiving dinner about eating too much and he said &quot;this better not turn me into a democrat.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
