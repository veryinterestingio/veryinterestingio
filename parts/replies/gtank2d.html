<p>evolving resistance to fire</p>

<p>*points towards the animals and trees in Australia that evolved/adapted to survive bushfires*</p>
<p>For example, banksia trees have toughened bark to help them survive bush fires and fire triggers the release of their seeds.  Eucalyptus trees have their volatile oils to help fires burn quickly past them so that it doesn't have enough time to damage the living part of the trunks.  Paperbark trees have very flammable bark which quickly carries fire up to the canopy of the tree and triggers the release of seeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fire analogy might not hold up, but the point is hand sanitizer and soap/water mechanically destroy the virus/bacterium.</p>
<p>It’s a brutal analogy, but it would be more accurate to say viruses and bacteria evolving to survive hand sanitizer would be like humans evolving to survive being put through a car shredder.  Humans wouldn’t be able to survive having their entire body completely, irreversibly destroyed, and neither can infectious agents such as viruses and bacteria.  Which is what hand sanitizer does to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, but the car shredder is all or nothing for the human. That's not the case for a microbe interacting with hand sanitizer, since that's a solution that they are being exposed to, and not every microbe will get a full dose. You can imagine some microbes getting a partial dose, akin to a human losing an arm in the shredder.  </p>
<p>I believe it's reasonable for bacteria to evolve in a way that they escape a certain threshold of alcohol (that is currently toxic). For example, right now we know that pathogens can survive in 100% water, and <a href="https://blog.gotopac.com/2017/05/15/why-is-70-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-a-better-disinfectant-than-99-isopropanol-and-what-is-ipa-used-for/" target="_blank">some can survive in 100% alcohol</a>. So there's a window of alcohol concentrations (something like 60-90%) where the solution will be effective. Evolutionary pressure can change the boundary conditions of that window. There is no reason a microbe would not be expected to get incrementally better at surviving various specific concentrations. I'm not saying that every microbe could evade all alcohol-based sanitizers; I am saying that they could resist more sanitizer compositions, which would be very bad. Imagine if that window narrowed from 60-90% down to 70-75%. Considering alcohol is quite volatile, we could be dealing with hand sanitizer having a short expiration date once opened.</p></div>		</li>
