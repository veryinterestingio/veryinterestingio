			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to your last sentence, the fact our immune systems can never rid us of certain viruses on their own is often the same reason a vaccine won't work for those viruses. </p>
<p>Also, non deadly viruses tend to lack funding/motivation for research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment basically nailed it. Viruses that are lifelong infections typically are unvaccinatable. Really a vaccine is most useful is eliminating/significantly reducing the acute phase of an infection. This why we have vaccines for Hep A/B but not C. Genital warts are rarely lifelong infections and typically resolve in a couple of years. This very reason is why we have a vaccine for it now. Even the chicken pox vaccine is an interesting approach. They give you a live attenuated version of it that won't cause an acute phase, but you have that modified version for life. People can and do later get shingles from the virus that comes from the vaccine, although it's less likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats fair, but everyone would get simplex-1 vaccine, mono vaccine, and all pregnant women would get cytomegalovirus vaccine. Simplex-2 would be pretty popular as a vaccine too.  It's a pretty big business if they get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but to my first point, you first need to make the immune system be capable of ridding the disease on it's own for a vaccine to work, at which point a vaccine would only be needed for prevention as people would be able to recover without it. Any profit to made would be one time only of the current generation. Plus, prevention of a non deadly disease that is recoverable would not be practical. Rather than a vaccine, we need to figure out how to make the immune system better target these viruses, then we won't need one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, a vaccine enhances your defences, if a virus can bypass your immune system, you can't really vaccine against it.</p>
<p>That's why herd immunity is so important, as immunocompromised people don't have a working immune system, it basically can't get stimulated by a vaccine and you must rely on everyone not having it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could the fact that these viruses are so hard to immunise against have any relation to their ability to remain dormant/latent in the system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, for “universal” health interventions like vaccines, you always have to play the cost-benefit analysis game.  A vaccine cannot be worse than what it prevents.  When you’re dealing with polio, this gives you more leeway—the disease is so devastating that there is more tolerance for adverse side effects.  On the other hand, for something like herpes, which is generally non-lethal with rare complications, even a relatively rare adverse effect might be enough to sink the whole project.</p></div>		</li>
