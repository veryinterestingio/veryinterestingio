			<div class="markdown"><p>For natural gas, specifications for moisture content are critical for cold weather use. I couldn't tell you off hand what the spec is for the natural gas entering the transmission system here in Canada, but if a producer doesn't dehydrate the gas, they get shut in. Wet gas will lead to hydrate formation in pipelines which will restrict the flow. Adding alcohol as a deicer can work to remove hydrates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if they aren't injecting methanol I assume they had wells hydrating off and with no insulation or heat tracing air lines freezing on instrumentation, not necessarily moisture problems on the transmission side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for one of the largest natural gas processors in west Texas. We had problems with just about every component of the system. Virtually no wells, tank batteries, compressors, pipes, etc outside of the refineries in this region have insulation, heat tracing, steam, or any other form of cold protection outside of methanol injection pumps. The problem started in the production fields. Wells hydrated, pneumatic air lines froze, instrumentation froze and malfunctioned, oil / water / gas separators froze, along with many other odds and ends of field production equipment which ultimately led to production wells automatically shutting down. With the roads so heavily iced and snowed over, when the equipment went down it essentially became unserviceable as many locations could not be accessed. We also had the issue of field booster / compressor stations going down. Some went down because of cold related issues which over pressured feed lines shutting down production wells, while others went down because production wells shut down and there wasn't enough feed flow to maintain the minimum necessary pressures for operation. As the field compressor stations started going down, the main pipelines that feed into gas refineries started losing flow rate / pressure. Just like the field compressors, these refineries require a minimum flow rate / inlet pressure in order to stay operational. So eventually the field shutdowns cascaded to the point of shutting down the refining facilities. These refining facilities are responsible for pushing clean usable gas down residue pipelines which feed into the powerplants and generating facilities. When the refineries went down, it was only a matter of time before these powerplants chewed through their tiny reserves of gas and went down. As the cascade of failures continued on, the loss of some powerplants strained those that remained online and required them to pickup the load which increased their energy demand until they too ran out of gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, hydrates that completely cover the cross-section of the pipe can turn into a heavy projectile going at speeds of up to 180 km/h once one end of the line is de-pressurized. That’s why both ends of the affected pipeline have to be slowly de-pressurized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>El Paso Electric (EPE), not part of ERCOT, and the El Paso Water Utility in West Texas prepared for major freezes after the 2011 storm. Back then, we were hit pretty hard with rolling blackouts, pipes bursting, and water getting shut off in major areas for a few days. They designed and installed safe guards for everything to perform at - 10°, where the prior standard was for +10°. </p>
<p>Fortunately, we weren't hit hard in this end of the state this round. Only a few homes and businesses were affected during the worst of it on Sunday. These folks were back up in under a day. EPE had some new stations that kicked in to help with the power demand of folks staying at home and keeping warm, so no large blackouts.</p>
<p>I wish the folks in East Texas luck, it's a dreadful scene. I hope ERCOT gets their heads out of their asses and makes improvements to that old infrastructure. It was already on its last legs. They set themselves up to fail, and the people are the ones paying that price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc El Paso was hit hard and directly by the 2011 event, for the rest of Texas it was more “what happened to El Paso could happen through the state”.</p>
<p>Learning lessons from others’ misfortune is not the Texan way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe since El Paso isn’t part of ERCOT but the western interconnection, they are federally obligated to abide by those recommendations. Because ERCOT is separate from the rest of the country and doesn’t cross state lines, they are free from federal regulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lubricants are often chosen based on viscosity. Ideally a grease lubricant that is injected into bearings will cling to surfaces, won't be easily flung away from rotating parts, and remains soft and malleable as it is repeatedly squished and squirted between rolling elements and moving contact surfaces.</p>
<p>At high temperatures a low-viscosity lubricant becomes thin and may drip off of parts, allowing direct metal-to-metal contact.</p>
<p>At low temperatures a high-viscosity lubricant can become so thickened and hardened that it acts more like a solid wax or glue binding parts together. It can also shrink and pull away from surfaces, also allowing direct metal-to-metal contact.</p>
<p>Lower cost lubricants are not likely to perform as well across a wide range of temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment you replied to has the answer already. Wind turbines built in cold climates are equipped with de-icing systems. Active de-icing systems would remove ice by auxiliary heat of motors, mechanical/electrical equipment, and blades. Passive methods of using anti-ice paints and coatings can be used to, but are less common.</p>
<p>Historically Texas wind turbines haven't needed de-icing systems, so they aren't equipped with any.</p></div>		</li>
