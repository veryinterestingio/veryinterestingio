<p>It is thought that this &quot;sandwich&quot; structure may exist within Ganymede and some of the other icy moons, and this would potentially make their oceans incompatible with life due to the absence of various interesting chemical and physical processes at the rock–water interface. Europa's ocean, however, is thought to have a rocky floor, substantially improving its suitability to life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. Europa's ocean is most likely sitting on the rocky mantle because it's not large enough to for the high pressures needed. The really large icy satellites (like you're mentioning) like Ganymede, Titan, and Callisto could have multiple &quot;sandwich&quot; structures of various ice phases. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JE005341" target="_blank">Figure 4 in this paper</a> is a good illustrative summary!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also with the little Saturnian moon Enceladus — we pretty much know it’s got a rocky core that has chemical exchanges with the water under the icy crust. Cassini did a fly through of the water plumes erupting into space from fissures on Enceladus and sampled them, confirming that it was very salty, ie. rich in stuff that must have come from interactions with rock somewhere within.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wouldn't put too much stock into this. Really, who knows what is going on in there? We don't even know if Venus has phosphene and possible life on it or not, much less Ganymede. We have actually had cameras on Venus, seen how horrific it is, and still don't know if there is life there. Anything could be going on at Ganymede. It wasn't long ago that we thought we needed sunlight for life, now, lack of that doesn't even seem like a deal breaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only examples of life we do have are the ones we can find on our own planet, and since life adapts to it's surroundings we can only say in which environments this kind of life would/wouldn't be able to develop and flourish. Even on Earth we had discovered microbes at depths of 3km (in Earth crust not oceans) which breath Sulphur and eat rock.  </p>
<p>So yeah, it's entirely possible that there is life on Venus. Maybe just some soil eating bacteria deep in the ground or high in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At 0C the required pressure to solidify is 611.657Pa. You mean to say that after 630MPa, water only exists as a solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your reference is vacuum, and you increase the pressure to 611 Pa would it be more correct to call it pressure of sublimation? But it is actually invariant, the triple point.</p>
<p>It could be fair to call 630 MPa the pressure of solidification if it is the pressure above standard reference state.</p>
<p>This is just semantics though, we know what we mean. The question was well answered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but I was borrowing the language of the poster above, and solidification is not incorrect. Sublimation is just more specific.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really true though. Even after 630MPa it can still be liquid, it just depends on the temperature. Just as for 611Pa, it can be solid or a gas, depending on if you're below or over 0.01°C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask here about the water anomaly? As far as I know, water has its highest density at 4°C - so the water at the bottom of any deep enough lake, sea, etc. should have this temperature.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate how this phase change could happen there?</p>
<p>(Or maybe I made a mistake somewhere else)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only true if you heat the water enough.</p>
<p>Also at the high pressures of this scenario the max density of water will be different, at 200 bar, max density is already below 0°C.</p>
