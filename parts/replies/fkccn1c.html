<p>I recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/mQUhJTxK5mA" target="_blank">this short doc</a> (21m), which explains how the Fed controls the money supply, as well as the remarkably shadowy history of how they came to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Central banks kinda <em>are</em> a conspiracy. Hence why there was so much opposition to having one in the US (including from the Founding Fathers).</p>
<p>Money isn't real at all. It's just a made-up tool for the purpose of control. It only retains power as long as we continue agreeing to the demands of those who seek to control us with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fed materializes this money out of thin air and loans it to the bank at interest.  Money is nothing but a future promise to pay back.   Money is debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They print whatever they want, but that is the smaller part of it.</p>
<p>They just send the banks a transaction that shows they have a billion dollars added. It just comes out of thin air, but it does get tracked in the money supply sheet. They take money in and out all the time.</p></div>		</li>
