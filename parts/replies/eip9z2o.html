			<div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here. Lens stiffening with age happens at 40, which causes our loss of near vision (presbyopia). </p>
<p>This vision under water by increasing depth of field is due to a miotic pupil, really small pupil. Like going outside on a sunny day. Their brains learned to tighten pupil to see under water. Has nothing to do with lens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just paraphrasing the article, which claims that the ability goes beyond what is possible with a miotic pupil alone.  but here are the direct quotes from the researcher Anna Gislen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the Moken children are able to do both – they can make their pupils smaller and change their lens shape.&quot;</p>
<p>“We had to make a mathematical calculation to work out how much the lens was accommodating in order for them to see as far as they could,”</p>
<p>“When we age, our lenses become less flexible, so it makes sense that the adults lose the ability to accommodate underwater,” </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Isn't that just how your eye can focus?  I know the lens gets stiff with age but, like, nearly everyone can change their lens shape.  </p>
<p>(And basically everyone can dilate/restrict their pupil, but that's usually due to light exposure, so that's neat that they can do that.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different wavelengths of light get diffracted more or less.</p>
<p>You will notice that red and blue (violettish blue) are the two extremes of the visible wavelength.</p>
<p>With <em>any</em> diffracting medium you have the effect of prisms splitting neutral light to form the rainbow. The art of creating good lenses and lense systems is actually to minimise tge perceptible effects of that.</p></div>		</li>
