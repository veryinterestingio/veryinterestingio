			<div class="markdown"><p>Physical activity is key. The stress response of fighting or fleeing are both physical actions. Your body rewards physical activity (yay you survived!) with natural painkillers and shuts down the stress response. But many stresses nowadays can't be physically beaten or run away from. You can trick your body by doing physical activity when you feel stressed to get those benefits.</p>
<p>Secondly, take some time to isolate yourself and figure out why you feel stressed. The world constantly tells us we are not attractive enough, successful enough, or having enough fun. Disconnecting ourselves from that pressure and figuring out what truly matters will help you not give a fuck about the the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All great words I appreciate it! And honestly I've been on and off heavy physical activity for the past 5 or 6 years and lately after graduating and starting an office job I let myself go.. the past few weeks I have been walking every day and lifting weights again and it definitely has been helping!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meditation does wonders for stress relief. Even just taking a 10minute break to close your eyes and focus on your breath will calm down the body. When done regularly, meditation can improve your body, mind functioning, and ultimately your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My go to when I lost appetite, and did so after a break up was to get the meal replacement shakes and just drink those when I was aware that I should eat but didnt feel hunger. Boost was my go to but grocery stores have these shakes in their produce section that can have a more pleasant taste and they always have some on sale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really an in-depth answer, but being hopped up on adrenaline isn't exactly the same as being in shape, having the muscle tone needed for proper exercise, or knowing your body's own limits given its current condition. Exercise helped me with a lot of the downer moods following a major breakup once, but I was still just as in shape or out of shape as I typically would be (not to mention the on-and-off demotivation of wanting to even get up to go run or move around).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I really appreciate this information. I've been under chronic stress for a variety of reasons, and my past 2 bloodworks have shown a slightly elevate A1C. Now I know why, and that encourages me to be more proactive with my stress management. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>
