			<div class="markdown"><p>The fight with the cave troll in Moria had a much better interpretation of Legolas being lighter and more agile. It's very small, but it looked a lot more believable than that Oliphaunt scene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom really enjoys Chinese fantasy films. Some I've peeped in on are lovely but the special effects at times are off putting with how the lines get blurred from real to cg work. Sometimes it's the odd changes in speed, other times it's noticibly where a human character is partially edited (human torso and monster limbs),  and sometimes it is like mentioned above- someone picking up something supposedly heavy but it looks like they picked up something much lighter, etc. Other times it's just too something that my brain can't pinpoint exactly but it still seems 'off'.</p></div>		</li>
