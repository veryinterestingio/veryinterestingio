			<div class="markdown"><p>There's one bit here though, once something like dopamine hits a receptor the receptor generally not only binds with it for signalling, but can also perform enzymatic function.</p>
<p>In the case of dopamine, it'll convert it to DOPAL ( 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde), by the Monoamine-oxidase enzyme or in other cases 3-Methoxytyramine. Either way though in the end they trigger the COMT (catechol-O-methyl transferase) enzyme.</p>
<p>So dopamine isn't even the same chemical going in and coming out of these reactions. It comes out as Homovanillic Acid after those receptors do their enzyme chemistry.</p></div>		</li>
