			<div class="markdown"><p>I specified it as non-crosslinked PLA, but to be completely fair, I'm not certain about neither the commercial viability of that, nor how fast it will degrade in nature. What I do know is that some bacteria can degrade it, and that it experience some degree of degradation if digested.</p>
<p>But I agree, PLA would be a fringe case for biodegradability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tg of PLA is in the high 50s Celsius. Biodegradabilty typically requires you to be at or above Tg in order for decomposition to be thermodynamically favorable for the bacteria. Crosslinking would affect that, but I'm not sure to what degree. My only experience is with what's commercial now. </p>
<p>To the layman reading this thread, Tg is the temperature at which the plastic is not considered &quot;glassy&quot; anymore and is much easier to process. Depending on the plastic (and sometimes even the specific grade), it's less of a hard point and more of a range. Below Tg, the bacteria would spend too much energy to metabolize the plastic, above Tg, it becomes more thermodynamically favorable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you mean plastics such as non-crosslinked PLA, cellulose acetate and thermoplastic starch, then the answer is no to both environment and climate hazards</p>

<p>The question was &quot;Do they pose a danger&quot; so I assume you meant to say &quot;Yes to both&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, biodegradable renewable plastics don't pose a danger to environment or climate. At least not to any degree close to what non-biodegradable petro-based plastics do.</p>
<p>There are a few too many negatives flying around for me to be certain on a Sunday evening, so I'll just say this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>non-biodegradable petro-based plastics = <strong>bad</strong> in regards to both environment and climate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>biodegradable renewable plastics = <strong>not bad</strong> in regards to both environment and climate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>non-biodegradable renewable plastics = <strong>bad</strong> in regards to environment, <strong>not bad</strong> in regards to climate</p>
</li>
<li>biodegradable poetro-based plastics = <strong>not bad</strong> in regards to environment, <strong>bad</strong> in regards to climate</li>
</ul>
<p>-Whether the things that are bad are actually bad, depends entirely on how well recycling is handled. Any kind of plastics can be <strong>not bad</strong> if it's kept within a 100% recycle loop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not accounting for waste-to-energy which is entirely viable for a lot of common plastics. PE burns cleanly in the right incinerators and has high caloric value.</p>
<p>PE from sugarcane that is then burned is a great option that gets around the difficulties of using recycled PE in film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting counterpoint -- is a non-degradable plastic actually bad for the environment?</p>
<p>That is -- if you take a renewable plant source of carbon, turn it into plastic, and then bury it in the ground...  shouldn't that be considered a carbon-negative process?</p>
<p>Furthermore, would it actually be better to degrade the plastic (and thus release the carbon back into the fast carbon cycle), compared to burying it and getting it out of the atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>
