<p>You tie a bandana around the rope that runs from one end of the rope to the bottom pulley and pull ten feet of rope, the bandana moves ten feet total, so you're not making rope from nothing. It only has a five-foot lift because the rope is looped and only five feet of the end piece connected to the top has been moved.</p>
<p>I feel so fucking dumb now but at least I'm at peace with this. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easy way to look at this is to lay out a rope, extension cord, whatever,  with one end looped back to meet the other end. Stand on one end and pull the other towards you.  The point where the rope loops around towards you moves only half as far as you pull because you are pulling from the TOTAL length of rope, not just from you to where it loops back around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming that what you couldn't wrap your head around is that bottom pulley is in a way, separate, and acts solely as a dolly. It's what gave me scratches. Glad you figured it out !</p></div>		</li>
