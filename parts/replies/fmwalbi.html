			<div class="markdown"><p>Lmao I love massage therapy but have the same mindset as you. Our Aromatherapy instructor took courses in France and her entire class was basically like “it just smells good and can be more things to offer your clients” we had a lot of instructors who were very realistic and science based so it was definitely helpful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely feel for you, I’m glad it’s shifting more science-most of my CE’s will likely be researched based (I hope). It helped that my class was 80% vocal skeptics; it really exposed the instructors who didn’t actually know they’re shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a long time since I've looked for research and studies, but the general consensus with things like fibromyalgia was &quot;work with the client for what feels good for them.&quot; And always follow the doctor's advice. </p>
<p>Not many people go further in their studies aside from the basic stuff to get licensed, and it leaves very few people who <em>could</em> do the research/work with researchers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I heard explain to me at a free massage offered during a Hackathon, is that toxins would be released as in the breakdown product from muscle work, would that be lactic acid? I didn't really follow their instructions about drinking water though, and I don't believe they actually meant that it would be &quot;detox&quot; getting rid of other potential toxins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc, lactic acid dissolves within a couple of hours of working out/rigorous activity and never is the reason you are sore the next day. Microtears in the muscles are usually the cause of multi-day soreness, but that's the natural way of building up the muscles themselves. There's no way to ever truly &quot;avoid&quot; post-workout soreness if your goal is to build muscle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also; free radicals and other such terminology is entirely used as a marketing ploy, especially to people addicted to homeopathic medicine/alternatives. </p>
<p>Medically, free radicals are atoms that steal electrons from other atoms in order to stabilize themselves and that causes a chain reaction throughout a cell which can possibly lead to oxidative stress. However, those kinds of free radicals are essential as well and are not a bad thing. It is the body's way of balancing chemical reactions with the give and take between free radicals and antioxidants. </p>
<p>In terms of working out, this is not an issue either. Normal, consistent work out routines negate any possible negatives. And even if you did experience oxidative stress, you'd most likely equate it to normal fatigue.</p></div>		</li>
