			<div class="markdown"><p>The oral (live) polio vaccine was discontinued in the United States twenty years ago as it has a very small risk of mutating into infective polio (giving the receiver full blown polio) and it’s no longer considered worth that risk. It has happened on several occasions, including a cluster of 8 children in Minnesota in 2005. </p>

<p>The inactivated polio vaccine (a shot in the arm) cannot become infective and is therefore preferred. </p>
<p>OPV is still available overseas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OPV is more effective but also more dangerous.</p>
<p>This is the issue with almost all mucosal vaccines (only exception I can think of are the oral cholera vaccines) -  the effective ones are  almost all live attenuated viruses (the only exception I can think of  off-hand are the oral cholera vaccines), with all the problems that  entails: potential reversion to virulence, greater potential for rare  but severe effects (like nervous system invasion), inability to use in  immunodeficient patients, etc...</p>
<p>You  generally need a live, replicating virus capable of infecting cells  because there's such poor mucosal uptake of recombinant proteins (or,  for that matter DNA or mRNA)  and delivery to lymphoid tissues.  As most  pathogens infect us through the mucosal tissues, our mucosa have a  whole variety of innate mechanisms for destroying them (from mucus to  stomach acid to lysozyme, defensins and other anti-microbial compounds).    An inactivated virus that is quickly enveloped in mucus and swept  through the GI tract or out of the nose is never going to get a chance  to stimulate an adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>In most wealthy countries, we are not willing to sacrifice safety for improved efficacy.  We could stop using OPV in part because we no longer had polio outbreaks to worry about.  But the American public's low tolerance for rare but severe adverse effects from vaccines has almost ruled out the possibility of a new live attenuated vaccine gaining widespread acceptance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that the likelihood of that happening is determined primarily by vaccination rates in a population. If fewer people are vaccinated, then the attenuated virus can infect a greater number of people, and therefore has more time to mutate into a dangerous form.</p>
<p>I remember there was an outbreak in Papua New Guinea a couple of years ago (<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-27/polio-outbreak-declared-in-png-18-years-after-polio-free-status/9913684" target="_blank">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-27/polio-outbreak-declared-in-png-18-years-after-polio-free-status/9913684</a>) and the response was a mass campaign of immunisation with the same oral vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not exactly a small risk - vaccine derived poliovirus is more common than wild poliovirus these days. The countries we claim to have eradicated polio still have vaccine derived polio. Not saying the vaccine hasn’t done amazing things worldwide. It’s just such a tricky situation. The only solution is to vaccinate like nearly every single person in endemic areas, and that’s obviously isn’t happening in 2020. It’s terrifying to think about all of the diseases that could come back as a result of halted public health initiatives in developing countries. We came so close to handling polio for good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The live attenuated nasal flu vaccine is very much still in circulation and is popular enough relative to production that it sells out every year in my area.</p>
<p>Flu vaccines have to be recreated and reevaluated every year. The effectiveness of that year's version was lower in 2013-2016 so CDC recommended against them in 2016-2018, but they have been back on the market the last 3 flu seasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I can't stand the nasal vaccine. It's much more uncomfortable for me than an injection. Also I have more of a reaction to the nasal vaccine than the injection. But that's just a personal opinion, if the only vaccine for COVID was nasal I'd still be all up in that line to get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nasal vaccine is a live attenuated virus, so it's expected that you will feel some symptoms. Basically it can still infect you, but not as severely and it can't reproduce vs the injection vaccine which is essentially just pieces of virus. I typically feel a little blah for 2 days after getting it.</p>
<p>But I have severe needle phobia and have to lay down with my legs up the wall and an ice pack on my neck for 15 minutes post-injection to not pass out and I've been advised to have someone drive me home, so I'd personally much rather get the nasal spray while doing my fall Costco run!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't gotten the injected vaccine and are interested in the nasal one, the drug maker maintains a <a href="https://www.flumistquadrivalent.com/nasal-spray-flu-vaccine/where-to-find-flumist.html" target="_blank">list/map of all the places that it was distributed to</a>. It's primarily sent to pediatric clinics, but I got my 2018 one from a travel clinic and my 2020 one from Costco! Check the list and then call ahead to confirm that they have it in stock.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Is the sell-out a result of poor estimation of the demand or difficulty producing enough?  Do they just not bother making more, or do they try to make it and can't do it fast enough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-selection.htm" target="_blank">6+ months</a> to produce a batch of flu vaccines, so they have to guess in the winter how many doses to make for the following flu season, based on data from the first half of the current season and seasons 2+ years prior.</p>
<p>There are certainly things the company can do year to year like sending more vaccines to clinics in areas where it has been more popular in previous years, but the ultimate sales in any year will depend on things that are totally out of the company's control like public perception of the vaccine's effectiveness that year or perception about the severity of the flu that year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So Sabin's polio vaccine is called an &quot;attenuated&quot; vaccine. This means that rats were infected with the virus repeatedly, until after generations of replicating inside of rats, mutations added up to the point where the virus had changed into a version of itself that was not as harmful to humans, because it had adapted to infecting rat cells. </p>
<p>There is a danger of course, as you are infecting humans with live vaccines that are just not as dangerous that the virus will mutate again to become harmful. However, generally as a virus and an organism coexist over time the virus becomes milder in lethality and damage, as a virus that still allows the host to be active and move is one that is able to still spread.</p>
<p>I do think someday when we have become more advanced in our understanding of biology we will be able to use modified or entirely man-made viruses as medicine. Essentially, they would be the nanobots of science fiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>20 years ago as an undergraduate, they had me doing phage mediated transfection to inject genes into bacteria. Man-made viruses in medicine some day?  </p>
<p>Both the AstraZeneca (Oxford) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) Covid-19 vaccines use Adenoviruses engineered to build Covid proteins to generate immune responses.   </p>
