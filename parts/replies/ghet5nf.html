			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, in some cases, yes. We update our memories every time we interact with them. They can be polluted by outside information, including the memories of others.</p>
<p>There was a study in which people were asked to write down where they were and what they were doing when they learned of the 9/11 attacks. 10 years later, they were asked to repeat the task.</p>
<p>Many of them had substantially different recollections a decade later. Yet they were absolutely convinced that their newer memories were accurate and the ones they had written immediately after the event had to be wrong.</p>
