It takes a lot of time and effort to describe a new species, so more often we hear from experts that they saw something on iNat that looks like a new species but no one has described it yet.</p></div>		</li>

Most have only been spotted once or twice but a couple (for some reason all in Texas) <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?verifiable=any&amp;place_id=any&amp;field:Similar%20observation%20set=https:%2F%2Fwww.inaturalist.org%2Fobservations%2F1931782" target="_blank">have been reported nearly 100 times</a>.</p></div>		</li>
