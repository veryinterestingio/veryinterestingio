			<div class="markdown"><p>Kruskal proved in 1960 that the set of inf-embeddable trees is well-quasi ordered. A well ordered or well quasi ordered set needs to be finite. Here is Kruskal's paper if you want to peruse it. I haven't read it. <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1960-095-02/S0002-9947-1960-0111704-1/S0002-9947-1960-0111704-1.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1960-095-02/S0002-9947-1960-0111704-1/S0002-9947-1960-0111704-1.pdf</a></p>
<p>For a good explanation of why well ordered sets like this are finite, here's two interesting videos by PBS Infinite series that I highly recommend:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWwUpEY4c8o" target="_blank">Kill the mathematical hydra</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBOZ2WroiVY" target="_blank">How infinity explains the finite</a></p>
<p>Note, these two videos were released together, the hydra one comes first.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No it doesn’t, but any wqo sequence that doesn’t contain an increasing pair must be finite, which is what’s relevant here.</p>
<p>A well ordered set is less restricted and sequences can be infinite as long as don’t contain an infinite decreasing chain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know there is no good upperbound for Tree(3) and you can't get even close with iterations of the Acerman function. So I'm curious where did you get the a(a(5,5),a(5,5)) bound from.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I made an error. This bound was for a different combinatorial problem, not for the tree function.</p></div>		</li>
