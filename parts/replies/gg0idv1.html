			<div class="markdown"><p>Immune response is only one factor, and often it's not the most important. Also, organs don't typically degrade quickly as you suggest, otherwise what would be the point?</p>
<p>The most relevant reason why organs are not transplanted twice is because the surgical process causes scaring at the connection points and the stresses of transplantation cause permanent changes to the organ and host that make a second successful transplantation less likely, though not impossible.</p>

<p>In fact, they are sometimes transplanted more than once: <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/can-an-organ-be-transplanted-more-than-once/" target="_blank">source</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>he never said how quickly, so why do you think he's wrong?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I got this as asking &quot;Could an organ become 200+ years old via getting transplanted all the time&quot;, and to that, afaik, the answer is a solid No.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they can be transplanted more than once, the &quot;gotcha&quot; is that each transplantation reduces the likelyhood of success due to damage to the organ from surgery and stress. If given a choice between a &quot;fresh&quot; organ with the highest chance of success and another organ whose chances are lower, doctors will choose the one with the highest chance of success.</p></div>		</li>
