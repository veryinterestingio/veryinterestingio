			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer.</p>
<p>As a social worker (msw) we are intensively trained in applied communication. If there's no incongruence between observable actions, stated actions, mood and affect, then there's no way to tell if someone is lying. This is why it can be very important to have collaterals as sources (family members etc). </p>
<p>Hypothetically let's say sometimes there are micro expressions after a lie. Theres no way for you to differentiate the micro expression from random facial movements/reactions to internal or external stimuli.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I do not have time right now to log in and collect research articles but at face value this appears to be decent for further reading:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding (which may be outdated since I studied it in grad school about a decade ago) isn't so much the the microexpressions aren't readable as tells, its that there's such a diversity in them across people/cultures/languages, that there's no universal 'tell'.  Computers and experts were able to do slightly better against relatively homogeneous sub-populations, but still not nearly good enough to be labelled 'accurate', or even 'usable'</p>
<p>Fun bonus: University of Arizona, through a grant from ICE (which, admittedly was not nearly as controversial an organization in ~2008 when I took this class) offered a graduate level class specifically in technology aided deception detection.  Really cool stuff, even if it was mostly covering all the ways that stuff didn't work.  Not sure if they still do though.  But both private organizations and the government have pumped a ton of money in testing things out to try and find more consistent ways of determining if someone is lying.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why poker is a really nice domain for this. There really isn't a lot you can do while sitting at a table. Each player only has his hand of cards, his drink, his own face/glasses/hat... and body language. The domain of expression is very small....  how do you feel about your hand? How do you want others to feel about your hand?</p>
<p>But tells don't tell much. Fundamentally, even in such a domain, there are multiple reasons to be nervous and multiple reasons to lie; and with experience, a person even can start to recognize their own tells and replicate them in order to neutralize their effectiveness. </p>
<p>Are you sitting across from a weak hand? A strong hand that suspects it might be weak? or a strong hand pretending to be weak? Any of them could be riding an adrenaline high, or faking one.</p>
<p>And this is in an extremely narrow context where the only unknown at the start is the order of the cards in the deck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At an amateur level (a table with couple of OK tournament players but nobody big league), I did extremely well the couple of nights I've played poker by just playing by how happy the people I played against were with the cards.  Substantially better than the tournament players.</p>
<p>So at an amateur level this is certainly possible; professionals presumably have much less emotions or emotional display, or they'd lose out to people like me that can read emotion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about tells in poker. But I remember watching a World Series of Poker episode and one of the players' father saw an opponent idly playing with his chips in a strange manner, I think he kept stacking and unstacking them, and said the guy was going to fold. And he did!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the pros will adapt their play as their learn more about a player.  They will often look for tells but wonâ€™t know what the tells signify until they see a number of instances of the tell when cards are revealed.  Until they can get to that point they are trying to play perfect strategy with perfect random deviations from perfect strategy while trying not to give up their own tells.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So has US LEO doubled down on using it yet? Sounds like a nice pairing with polygraphs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness, the pilot program ICE was running was for border checkpoints, with the hope that cameras watching people getting questioned coming in from Mexico could enhance to officer's ability to pick out smugglers.  Interestingly enough, the cameras were effective in a way - as a bluff. The pilot program had already ended when I took the class, but ICE largely left the cameras up even though the computer analysis was no longer going on, but officers questioning people at the border (is there anyone else in the car with you? Do you have any narcotics? Etc) would bluff about the cameras being active and effective.  They caught more than a few smugglers that panicked when being told that.</p></div>		</li>
