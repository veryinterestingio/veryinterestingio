			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the information, it's not like humans can't breath in water or use other liquids that are mixed in high oxygen content. It's not pleasant to start since drowning is a fear even people without fear or pain can feel, and even worse part is to clear out the liquids to prevent pneumonia, and liquids can block the flow of air and isn't easily evacuated. The only practical use proposed for it is so you could dive deeply without getting a collapsed lung, but heck you know, submarines are much more convenient and even moreso, remote exploration vehicles.</p></div>		</li>
