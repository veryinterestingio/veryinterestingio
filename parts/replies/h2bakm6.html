			<div class="markdown"><p>You potentially could yes. However, there are two important things to note here:</p>
<p>(1) those waves <em>would</em> be generated by (a lot of) wind somewhere else in the oceans. Probably not that far in terms of the whole ocean, but could be very far in terms of distances we are used to travelling by boat in a day. That’s essentially what is meant by ‘swell’ — large rolling waves which aren’t generated by the immediate wind in the area, but have drifted in due to storms elsewhere, some prevailing general winds that disperse them in a particular way that they interact as they migrate and can produce some big’uns outside of the immediate storm. </p>
<p>(2) 60 foot waves? Yeah definitely possible... but not at all common. <a href="https://www.theinertia.com/surf/biggest-open-ocean-swell-ever-recorded-by-a-buoy-occurs-in-north-atlantic/" target="_blank">That’s practically the limit of the largest ever waves in the open ocean to be recorded by weather buoys.</a>. There have been reports of larger waves from fairly reliable sources (but not officially recorded ones, so not the same quality of data as in that link). These larger ones I mean are often called ‘rogue waves’ and only exist for  seconds before breaking — they seem to be generated by weird interference patterns between waves when the most severe storms occur at sea. They can pop up out of nowhere and there are stories of 80 footers the world over. </p>
<p>Like I say though, these occur in the midst of storms, or similar heights can be made in a handful of coastal places around the world which are exposed to stormy deep seas not far off shore and then the bathymetry approaching the coast forces the wave to increase in height. </p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: literally no wind at all to experience 60ft waves would be impossible, though the atmosphere could feel very disproportionately calm while a 60 footer comes along. <strong>This is a rarity</strong>.</p></div>		</li>
