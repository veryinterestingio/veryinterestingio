<p>where the Canadian stations are allowed to substitute their commercials for the American ones when they are playing the same show</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clearer - They're not substituting the commercials. They're substituting the entire broadcast.</p>
<p>So if Global TV Canada is showing Survivor at the same time as CBS, and if CBS is available on the Canadian cable package, then you will get the Global feed even if you're on the CBS channel.</p>
<p>Where this falls down is when, as you say, the two channels are showing the same show, but not the same episode.</p>
<p>Or if the American feed gets delayed by a news event or an overtime sports game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but it's about the advertising. In my example above, Global doesn't want to lose the advertising in the Canadian market after they've paid millions to air Survivor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Canadian networks will air USA shows - not complete networks. They simply duplicate it or redirect which technically reduces the bandwidth overall cable needs as there's not redundant streams for that one show or half hour.</p>
<p>Also CBC is really not fussy all their stuff is free on their webpage that the simplest of VPN with a Canadian exit node would approve of. This isn't Hulu Disney Netflix HBO level restricted bullshit... It's publicly funded TV and they have an ad or two which helps manage costs</p></div>		</li>
