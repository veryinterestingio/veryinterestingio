<p>In the papers published Friday, the researchers argued that Homo longi appears to have been an adult of great size. … They say that his brain was about 7 percent larger than the average brain of a living human.</p>

<p>That’s similar to Neanderthal brains, consistent with the notion that (1) this is a Denisovan skull and (2) Denisovans were physically rather similar to Neanderthals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this skull is indeed from a male, then in comparison to modern <em>Homo sapiens</em> males (rather than the overall average), its cranial capacity is just about identical.</p>
<p>Encephalization quotient is probably a better measure, though, since it takes into account difference in body size, which is known to strongly influence brain size. Previous measurements found encaphalization of around 4.15 for another individual from this lineage. That's compared to 4.2-4.7 for Neanderthals, 3.4 for earlier <em>Homo erectus</em>, and around 5.4 for modern humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that link. I've been searching for days, looking for details and size, etc. By the way, for anyone who follows F1, this dude's brain cavity is just a bit smaller than the cubic capacity of current F1 engines. They are 1.6L, his cavity was 1.42L. But could he do algebra?</p></div>		</li>
