			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea of cooking risotto is you're trying to slowly cook the rice while breaking the outside so the starch can come out at a slow speed. The starch coming out is what gives it that creamy texture.</p>
<p>Some people say you need to add the stock slowly or the rice will cook before the starch has come out fully. </p>
<p>I've been working in resteraunts for 13 years and can tell you for a fact you can get away with adding the stock 50% at a time as long as you're hovering over the pan. We do it 50% stock, mix the rice like mad, then cool it. Then when it's ordered we add the rest, mix it like mad, serve it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best explanation yet, especially the second paragraph.  I think that's really the answer I was looking for, and it makes perfect sense.  It's all about the speed at which the rice cooks.   </p>
<p>So when you say you &quot;add the rest, mix it like mad&quot;, you mean you add all the rest of the stock at once?  So, basically, you're adding the entire amount of stock in just two different batches?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. The key is all in mixing it right and not walking away. I'm convinced the idea of adding the stock in such tiny amounts is a trick to get people to not walk away and actually mix it.</p>
<p>In restraunts we get 15 minutes after a bill hits the kitchen (probably 17 minutes after the customer actually placed the order) before people start asking where there food is. If we had to do something 2oz at a time we wouldn't run it on the menu. </p>
<p>I should add I've worked 2 places that did add the risotto little amounts at a time. Both of them were old Italian chefs who swore there's a difference. On the flip side I've worked for 2 old Italian chefs who were glad that way of thinking is dieing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was waiting for someone to say this so badly. You donâ€™t have to baby it like some folks do, but whisking it just beats it to shit. Spoon or spat, fold it and clean the edges of the pan or rondo along the way. I hate seeing people use a stock pot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong, mix was a poor choice of words. I'm used to showing people, not typing directions, my bad. </p>
<p>What I do is a series of gentle panflips with a few proper folds carefully done with a rubber spatula, but I'm also usually working 6 other pans and the grill at the same time so I gotta learn how to cut some corners but do it well enough that a food critic or yelper won't be able to catch on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason you should use a wooden spoon for this stirring is that wood is more porous than metal, silicon, or other materials used for cooking utensils, and thus is more abrasive against the surface of the rice - this means it removes more of this surface starch compared to other materials. Yes it also doesn't scratch the pot.</p></div>		</li>
