			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. We don't pay taxes on land the government owns. You can rent or lease government owned land, but you are not assessed taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh it is really semantics because if you dont pay taxes, even if you 100% own the land, they will take it away.  So yes, in a way you are renting it from the government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no such thing as a free lunch.  Government is the citizenry coming together to create a political order, and that effort costs money.  Taxes are used to fund that government.  Land records, deeds, titles, and surveys are all part of that government work, and so owners of land must pay their dues to the government.</p></div>		</li>
