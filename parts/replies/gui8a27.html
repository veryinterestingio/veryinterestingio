			<div class="markdown"><p>Well kinda, partially on the first and definitely no on the second. There's vaginal discharge that acts as lubrication during sex, which is the wet, that increases during arousal. Cervical fluid is more like cervical mucus. It's a different consistency and changes throughout the cycle. Squirting comes from a different hole and is pretty hotly debated.</p>
<p>The Mirena partially works by changing cervical mucus. When I got one I spent quite a while figuring out wtf that was all about haha.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does? How so, by making it thinner? Not disagreeing, just curious! I had the Mirena for a couple years and never noticed a change other than my period completely stopped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. It comes form the urethra, and more specifically, ultrasounds show it comes from the bladder to the urethra. Studies have determined it's not exactly piss, but urine is present.  </p>
<p>Hardest bit for medical science to work out is whether someone is presenting with urinary incontinence, female ejaculation, or something else. There's been varying reports, with urinary incontinence during arousal being deemed prevalent, but abnormal, and FE/Squirting as medically questionable, but potentially present in studied populations.  </p>
<p>Nine times out of ten tho, it's piss or a mix of fluids secreted into the bladder during arousal and piss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in a relationship with a squirter. There was definitely piss in the equation but it didn't seem like it was &quot;all&quot; piss. Usually the piss aspect was most prominent in the first one or two orgasms. It has a taste and odor. We often started in the shower to get the pee out of the way. After that, it was very neutral smelling/tasting, or maybe just more similar to her other juices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I am a squirter and that liquid comes from the urethra, not the vagina. Some say it is urine, and for some women it definitely is just urine. Some say it is discharge from the skeins gland, which is equivalent to the prostate. Either way, it doesn't come from the vagina hole.</p>
<p>But yeah... I talk a lot about sex stuff on various forums online and it is generally accepted that it is probably pee....but don't think about it too much. For many women it is just a part of the orgasm process. </p>
<p>In me....It really seems to just be pee. I try not to think about it because I can't help it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it was 0% pee, there is really no bodily fluid that is cool to soak your bed with in that quantity, so as long as you've got a towel, I think it is rad as fuck to make your partner have an orgasm so strong she forcefully loses bladder control. I am slightly envious that I've never squirted before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also &quot;pre-cum&quot; is clear fluid that helps the sperm swim through and out of the penis until it makes contact with the cervical fluid. Many people think pre cum is semen, which it isn't, but it may contain a small amount of sperm mixed in, which is why the pullout method is useless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So... slightly less effective than condoms (98%/85%, respectively). Hardly &quot;useless.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
