			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this explanation, but I have a follow up question.</p>
<p>So let's take a simple 5x5 grid of pixels.  If you scan through each row one at a time, does that mean the pixels on the row not being scanned are always off?  Would this mean a pixel will only ever be on 1/5th of the time?  Or is there something else keeping the pixel turned on while the other rows are being scanned?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal world with perfect led's or lcd's the pixels that are not being scanned are always off.  One of the quirks of both technologies is that they do not change state instantly. They will hold their previous state for a period of time naturally. This combined with human vision will make it appear seamless </p>
<p>Another thing is that the scan rate is usually significantly higher than the refresh rate, so you may be able to fully scan through a frame multiple times before it needs to be changed.  Each technology and display is different, but lcd tvs are sometimes scanned up to 480 hz, plasma tvs are scanned at 600hz, and dlp projectors can be scanned at something like 16,000hz </p></div>		</li>
