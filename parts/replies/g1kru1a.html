<p>If there was anything I'd have done differently it's get a loan, get the CDL on my own terms, and find a local company that'd pay back the loan for me while working for them. Maybe then the entire experience wouldn't have left such a shitty taste in my mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus if you look at snow tires, there are much wider gaps in the tread at the sides, to improve grip, and allow snow and slush to disperse, as otherwise it builds up as you drive. In one big tire, you lose half of that gripping edge, and half of the ability to disperse slush and snow. Basically, you'll end up hydroplaning with one huge, wide tire.</p>
<p>I had a Mustang GT with really wide tires, basically had to buy another car for winter driving, even after putting the best snow tires available on the mustang. Wide tires are great for dry cornering, for everything else they suck.</p></div>		</li>
