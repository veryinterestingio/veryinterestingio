			<div class="markdown"><p>Most developed nations spend a significant portion of their land, energy, and water on producing food. Over 50% of which ends up wasted instead of eaten.</p>
<p>The problem with capitalism is that the end goal is profit. As long as it generates money, it doesn't matter if the final product is wasted, broken, or simply unnecessary.</p>
<p>In agriculture and animal husbandry it's not uncommon that we produce foods we don't even need simply because those are more profitable than the foods we do need.</p>
<p>For instance, the price and demand for milk fluctuate. But dairy farms need to be able to sell a minimum amount of milk to survive. So milk is often subsidized. Ie. sometimes it's more profitable to produce milk, collect subsidy for that milk and then flush it down the drain than it is to reduce milk production and end up shutting down the business.</p>
<p>So we produce milk we don't need. And in order to produce that milk, we raise cows we don't need. And in order to raise those cows, we raise crops for cattle feed we don't need. And in order to raise those crops, we waste land and water that could have been used for other purposes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That isn't a 'goal.' Capitalism is nothing more than people freely trading with one another.</p>
<p>You have an apple and I have a dollar. We trade because we both feel we 'win' and will be better off. What I do with that apple is no longer of concern to you. I could eat it, bury it or smash it into the ground.</p></div>		</li>
