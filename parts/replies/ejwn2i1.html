			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't often think of mountains as being &quot;in progress,&quot; that's such an interesting thought.</p>
<p>Can geologists predict where on Earth mountains will be forming over the next several million years? Or whatever the correct scale is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh sure, non-volcanic mountain formation is pretty predictable. Upwelling versus erosion effects is more complex but in the end, you are looking at substantial timelines anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add something to this.  Himalayas are at the upper limit of what a mountain can grow to on earth do to the speed of erosion, mainly from the water cycle. This will continually limit the heights of these mountains to stay relatively the same.  Likely there has never been mountain ranges higher than the Himalayas.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I knew enough about geology and plate tectonics, I wouldn't be able to keep myself from figuring out where on Earth is going to be mountains next and just sort of laughing at whatever country's there now.</p>
<p>I guess I can already do that to California.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologist knows in which direction all the plates are moving and which ones will be subducted (pushed below another plate) or collide with another plate creating a mountain range. They also know how fast they are all moving. There are some models for when the next supercontinent will eventually form. </p></div>		</li>
