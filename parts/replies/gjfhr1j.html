			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. Any size is possible, but tracing history back we go all the way from bits with two states, laying those out in rows, columns, eventually <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-core_memory" target="_blank">blocks</a>. For the most part the numbers we started with were arbitrary - a function of financial cost and engineering convenience. For a time the increase in size was a multiplicand of previous sizes, but now it's just tradition and history. The binary aspect isn't what drives it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always a function of financial cost. And it's no accident that we landed on powers of 2, those are standard <em>because</em> they happen to be the most cost-efficient for reasons stated above.</p>
<p>However, this only holds for chip-based memory (not sure what the proper term is) like RAM and SSDs. In magnetic drives, there is no reason for the number of sectors on a track to be a power of 2. As much as can fit is the best size, hence the seemingly random capacities.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not always. Researchers aren't always constrained this way, or concerned with the overall cost of what they are developing. Regardless, it is worth calling out that there is a non-technical reason for the sizes of memory we see. Powers of two are part of the engineering convenience I'm referring to, however, it's not completely accurate to state that powers of two are why products are sold with these values. We can just as easily end up with <code>128 &gt; 130 &gt; 131 &gt; 200 &gt; 333</code> and so on, so an explanation beyond &quot;that's how the math works&quot; is needed.</p>
<p>&quot;Chip-based&quot; is called solid-state.</p>
<p>You're sort of right about sectors. The number and size of sectors kind of has an arbitrary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_sector#History" target="_blank">history</a> as well, but each bit that fits is still constrained to two states. Really, the point you're making about magnetic storage applies to solid-state as well. A company can bulk purchase several sizes of memory chips and stick them on a board to end up with all sorts of capacities. But yes, this really is about financial cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add: having powers of two is actually very handy for other reasons. Most memory implementations use multiple chips; e.g. use 4 chips of 8 to get 32. By having powers of two, the (binary) math stays very simple, two bits of the address can be used to select the chip, the rest to select the ‘word’ (data piece) from the chip. Usinf binary this can all be achieved by simply routing the wires differently without having to add any extra logic or math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you aware that some flash chips store 3 bits per cell? This requires the controllers to distinguish 8 voltage levels per cell and was common. I think we’ve moved on to 4 bits per cell / 16 voltages and they’re working on 5 bits / 32 voltages now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the flash chips themselves usually still have a power of two capacity. E.g. 64GiB. Take 8 of the chips to make a 512GiB SSD, program the firmware to keep 12GiB as reserve for defect sectors. It’s then up to marketing to sell it as 512 or 500GiB SSD ;) (or actually they’d probably sell it as 550GB or 536GB).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the number of bits stored per individual cell. SLC (single level cell) holds one bit per cell. TLC (Triple level cell) can store 3 bits per cell, so the total storage of the drive will be evenly divisible by 3 (like 240). MLC (mulit level cell) holds more than 3 bits per cell (usually 4) so the total storage will be divisible by 4 (like 200)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building on the marketing point as well, consumers are used to those numbers and are more likely to buy them even if there is better deals per size. For example some of the older hdds had sizes of 900gb that were similar to that of 512gb but would sell worse because people weren't used to that number.</p></div>		</li>
