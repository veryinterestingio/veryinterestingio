<p>If you woke up during these sleepy times that can make you groggy but that should go away after a hour or two. If it doesn't then you probably aren't getting enough sleep over all or you might have an underlying issue like a thyroid issue.</p>

<p>I've been on CPAP for about two years now and always before then I thought that being groggy in the morning was the way everyone is.</p>
<p>It's amazing to me that if I am groggy, I can power through it so much easier now.</p>
<p>For everyone else, Please, please talk to a sleep doctor if you have consistent problems getting good sleep and rest. There are a lot of remedies if you just swallow your pride and get help.</p></div>		</li>
