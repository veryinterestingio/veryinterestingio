			<div class="markdown"><p>You can definitely permanently damage a nail pretty easy. I split mine lengthwise when I fractured my toe and now it grows with a ridge where it split. So I imagine different effects could happen if you damage the nail at the base</p></div>		</li>

<p>wow same for me back in January</p>
<p>it's been interesting watching it grow back so far. It's definitely still working its way back but there's a divot that runs across the entire nail that feels interesting to touch</p>
<p>Also boy did that hurt like a mother when the blood started pooling underneath on day 2 after the incident...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With it growing back I swear some layers are growing faster than others. It peels really bad too. I’m trying to keep whatever grows filed down to wait for the rest of the nail to catch up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing is, I had a window come down on my thumb and tear off my thumbnail completely. Within a few weeks it had grown back exactly the same as before.</p></div>		</li>
