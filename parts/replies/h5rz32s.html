			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably a little bit of both. The cells in your eyes are neurons, as well as the visual cortex. Throughout your brain you have some visual noise, think the static on a TV before you switch it to the right channel. That's basically what is happening</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question!</p>
<p>I'm short sighted, with a pretty big margin so stuff starts to blur about 20cm from my face. </p>
<p>During the night if I'm out on the street and I look at distant street lights, something sort of like a cell pops up. I'm not sure it's exactly a cell but it kinda looks like one, so I'm curious if this is the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>You can replicate this if you want by using retina dilating drops, I think</p></div>		</li>
