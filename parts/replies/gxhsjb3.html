			<div class="markdown"><p>Transistors are not stacked on top of each other in this. Those stacks are for individual channels within a single transistor, largely to improve their drive strength. Transistor stacking will probably start one or two nodes after the &quot;2nm&quot; one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, everything except the part about transistors being stacked is true.  Stacking transistors is the next big thing in &quot;traditional&quot; chip architecture in terms of increasing transistor/area</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The channel is the region between the source and drain. The flow of electrons/holes through it is controlled by the gate. More channels = more current when switched on.</p></div>		</li>
