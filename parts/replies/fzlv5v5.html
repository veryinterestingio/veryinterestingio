<p>This, you're not even really benefiting from less staff, as you probably need the same number of crew in case of emergencies anyway, so you go from Driver + Guard, to 2 Guards.</p>
<p>DLR in the UK is full automated and runs on this principle, it doesn't affect the price of tickets (although that might be due to other factors)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DLR is part of Transport for London, which is actually pretty amazing. Fares aren't cheap but neither is the cost of living there and all profits get re-invested in the service.</p>
<p>It's the private companies running lines without competition that take the piss. I'm no fan of London in general but TFL is great, while East Coast and Virgin can go fuck themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DLR would probably be more expensive if it wasn't automated, especially as the trains are fairly low capacity.</p>
<p>The tube lines are also more or less automated too, Victoria Line was from the start (although it has human drivers anyway). The big benefit of rail automation is that you can increase capacity on the line. Thameslink is automated through the core, which means it can achieve 24 trains per hour through the busiest section of track, despite running full-length commuter trains on a twin-track railway through the centre of London. That would be very challenging with traditional signalling and manual driving. Crossrail will be similar.</p>
<p>On the rest of the network (including the peripheral sections of Thameslink and Crossrail), there's a whole mix of different kinds of signalling and different kinds of traffic so automation currently isn't possible. You've got everything from heritage steam locomotives to heavy freight trains to all-stops commuter trains to non-stop express trains, and everything from locally operated semaphore signals through to centrally controlled digital signalling.</p>
<p>Eventually, more and more railways and trains will be upgraded to use ETCS signalling and a greater degree of automation will be possible. In the UK that will probably involve the busiest lines around London and the WCML, ECML, GWML etc. But there will probably still be some lines using essentially 19th-century technology for decades to come, because why would you need anything else if you only get one train per hour or the occasional ad-hoc freight service? Railway signalling technology is expensive and drivers are (at least compared to road vehicles on a per-passenger or per-ton basis) fairly cheap.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm imagining a steam engine with boilermen shoveling fuel into the firebox right next to an engineer who just pulled out his phone to check the signals ahead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen this question asked on here before and iirc  another issue that prevents trains from going fully automated is that train operators have strong unions in most western countries. You could probably already get away with having less people crew trains,  but union contracts prevent this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with certain points, but disagree with your overall sentiment.  Below is a link of a train crash that happened near me back in 2016 due to operator error.  This would not have happened with an autonomous system.  As of March 2020 (4 years!!!) the station has still not been fully repaired.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I get that they are less likely.  What I am saying is that on a per crash basis they are much more costly &amp; disruptive.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Using my example from before, these numbers are from 2017...</p>

<p>.. considering the repairs are still ongoing and this crash forced NJT to make system-wide changes, that $7mm in 2017 can likely be multiplied by nearly a factor of 100 by now.</p></div>		</li>
