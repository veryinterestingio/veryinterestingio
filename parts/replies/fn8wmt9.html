			<div class="markdown"><p>Get up and out of bed.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: you would never sit at the dinner table and <em>wait</em> to get hungry. </p>
<p>So why lay in bed if you are not tired? It is not productive, doesn't lead to sleep, and only serves to create more negative associations that make future sleeps harder.</p>
<p>Get out of bed. Take a shower. Read a book.</p>
<p>Even if you have to get up early in the morning, well, you were going to be tired anyways..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On nights that I can't just fall asleep I find that listening to an audiobook is really helpful, particularly one that you know the story of inside out. Remember to set a sleep timer, usually for the end of the chapter.</p>
<p>My go to is Harry Potter, put it on wherever I left of last time and just close my eyes and listen/visualise. 9/10 times I'm asleep within 10 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wouldn't wish that feeling of tiredness but unable to sleep on anyone.</p>

<p>I had insomnia as a symptom from depression and alcoholism and this is so true.  I'd never get a full, deep sleep; just light doze between awake and asleep.  Then during the day I'd be a zombie.  The whole experience was, somewhat ironically, a nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>OP just forgot about all the times they were on the couch and didn't fall asleep?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe.  I'd say it's more likely to be a <em>framing</em> bias (e.g. framing the information of percent of positives-of-falling-asleep) given how it's written.  The confirmation bias would mean that there was a held belief that is then confirmed by reinforcement by observation....but you'd then expect actual data to defy the bias.  In this case the data presented doesn't betray it, it's just framed to miss something important (possibility of failure to fall asleep).</p>
<p>But...have to invent a lot of stuff about OP here to answer this so mostly just enjoying thinking about your statement/question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you just donâ€™t care when you donâ€™t fall asleep on the couch so you donâ€™t notice it. When youâ€™re in bed and you canâ€™t fall asleep, you definitely notice it.</p></div>		</li>
