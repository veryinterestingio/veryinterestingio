			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if its possible to stop covid via precautions alone (not probable, but possible), is it then also possible to stop the flu or the common cold via precautions? In an ideal world, if we ran these precautions out for a year or so, could we see the end of seasonal diseases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm Aussie, so southern hemisphere, winter, and a country that's taking Covid reasonably serious. </p>
<p>(Also worth saying there's a difference between the common cold and the flu)</p>
<p>Flu spread and deaths are way down this year. Below a quarter of what it would be otherwise. </p>
<p>(Covid precautions, and lockdown restrictions, have obviously played a part in that, so it may not translate to the US experience that well, we'll find out soon right. Also, get your flu vaccine if you're at risk)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way we (USA) are &quot;handling&quot; this I would expect there to be a decrease in flu this season, but it's still going to be here. A lot of people in Los Angeles are just acting like nothing is going on, and we are meant to be relatively progressive compared to other areas.
It could be getting worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a blatant lie. The common flu is still very much around and will not be eradicated.</p>
<p>Covid showed up around the end of flu season (March). You never hear much about the common flu until October.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Lie&quot; is a very heavy word. Maybe I have express myself badly? </p>
<p>The common flu has not been &quot;eradicated&quot;, it stopped circulating in France during the lockdown. SARS-CoV-2 was here at the end of the flu season, but it was still present, and what was observed then was a sharp decrease in cases that was never observed during the other years, probably because during the other years we were not in lockdown. So my point was that even if the flu season will make things harsh in winter 2020-2021, we can expect a mild epidemic since we all wear masks and everything.</p>
<p>Then yes I know that flu is seasonal in temperate regions, that it come during winter or late autumn (this year it was in January), although you do can have a flu in summer here.</p></div>		</li>
