			<div class="markdown"><p>Metallurgist here: the general rule of metals is that beating the shit out of them (or forcing them into shapes, like a wire) makes them &quot;stronger&quot;.</p>
<p>By &quot;stronger&quot;, we mean that you need to apply more stress (= force per unit of surface area) before it deforms or breaks. Ceramic is pretty strong, which is why you can't break a ceramic plate with your bare hands (but you could potentially bend a metal plate, depending on the metal and your workout routine). But it usually comes at a price, since stronger stuff tends to be more brittle (which is why you can bend metal but not ceramic, which will plainly break). Anyhoo, deforming metals makes them stronger.</p>
<p>Why? Because all metals* are made of crystals, i.e. regular arrangements of atoms in neat little rows, a basic pattern repeating billions and billions of times. When you pull on it, or squeeze it, or bend it, you are essentially asking these atoms to move. Have you ever played with <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0067/5915/3721/products/89om0007_a1_1200x1200.jpg?v=1543529350" target="_blank">these little magnetic balls</a> and tried to dislodge them? What happens is, because of all the magnetic forces in play, the balls can really only &quot;jump&quot; from one stable position to another, either aligned with the other balls, or halfway between, but never in a random position. I'm simplifying, but atoms act about the same; when you pull or push or squeeze them, they'll roughly stay in the same regular configuration, except some of the atoms will be one position &quot;off&quot; compared to the rest. That's what in the business we call a <em>dislocation</em>, and that is the main mechanism through which metals deform.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: every time you introduce a dislocation, it's essentially a kink in the system. And as far as Mother Nature is concerned, if the system has a kink in it, then it's not in its most stable energetic state: it's a bit off-kilter, just by a fraction of almost nothing. And that means it makes it ever so harder to introduce the <em>next</em> dislocation nearby, because now when the atoms move, they have to deal with the already existing one. Think about it as trying to cut through a crowd: if the whole crowd is in neat rows, it's easy; but if one row is like half a step off, you'll have to move a bit more, push with the elbows a bit, i.e. exert more energy. And if more and more rows are placed in off positions (one could say... <em>Dislocated</em>) you're gonna have to really push your way through, and kick and elbow and generally fight to make way. You're gonna have to exert more energy. You're gonna have to, well, apply more pressure. The crowd is &quot;stronger&quot;. That's why deforming crystals makes them gradually harder to deform, and that's why wire, which has been deformed to all hell, is very strong.</p>
<p>*Some metals are <em>not</em> crystalline, but 99.99% of the ones encountered in construction are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I’m a materials scientist, what they are referencing is a phenomena where materials are stressed or deformed, and this actually makes the material stronger. If we think about “drawing out steel” we are basically taking a thick cylinder of steel, and then stretching it out until it’s a very thin long cord. Think of when you would hand roll a worm or snake of play dough and then you’d stretch it until it breaks, as you stretch it it gets thinner and thinner. The same thing is true with metals, but as we stretch the metal as and they get thinner, it becomes more and more difficult to keep stretching and thinning the material. Think about stretching a rubber band and how it becomes more difficult the more you stretch the band. Metals are special though and they maintain this new thinner form and are stronger as a result. </p>
<p>Obviously there is more at play here, but that’s a basic rundown of what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think u/Pappyballer was asking why the steel gets stronger as it's worked. I was trying to think of a good way to describe the crystalline structure. As metal cools, it forms small crystals, whose shape is dependant on a few things, like temperature, rate of cooling, and so on. These crystals give the steel it's basic strength. Cold drawing the steel stretches out the crystals, and any breaks in the crystal lattice are more easily contained than in an unworked steel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another small, but important point is that the smaller a wire diameter is drawn, the fewer defects will exist in the material. Larger material defects that might be present in a bar with a large cross section are eliminated as it is drawn down, because the material will break at the point of the defect as the diameter is reduced.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever bent a paper clip or a piece of wire and then tried to straighten it again? The bent part is (generally) impossible to straighten again without tools because it has been work hardened.</p>
<p>&quot;Work hardening&quot; is where a material gets stronger (and harder and more brittle) due to being deformed at room temperature, or at least not at particularly hot temperatures. The material accumulates dislocations (defects in the arrangement of atoms, which are generally arranged in regular patterns) as it's deformed, and only so many defects can be packed into a certain amount of space. These defects can be reversed by heating the material to a high enough temperature that allows the atoms to rearrange themselves, a process called annealing. When the density of defects is maxed out, the material is very hard and strong, but also brittle.</p>
<p>Back to the cable vs rod thing. If we assume the rod and the wire are both made from exactly the same steel alloy, and the same diameter, the cable is not necessarily stronger because the rod could be &quot;cold drawn&quot; to the same strength as the wire strands in the cable. As described above, cold drawing is where you stretch a large chunk of material into a longer, thinner piece. As you stretch it, it is deforming and therefore work hardening. However, on an industrial scale you will not find solid rods that have been cold drawn to the same extent as a thin wire.</p>
<p>But even if we do have this odd rod made specifically to compare to a cable, the rod can/will have larger-scale defects (pits, voids/air bubbles, bits of trapped dust, microscopic cracks) that weaken it and are hard to detect. The wire strands will also have these defects, but if one wire breaks the whole cable doesn't fail. Every individual strand of wire in a braided cable could be broken at some point but the cable will still hold tension because pulling on the cable tightens the braid. This means a break in one wire doesn't contribute right at the break but all the neighboring wires squeeze against it and transfer some of the tension to it at locations away from the broken spot. If the rod has a defect and fails, well, it doesn't have any friends to help it out and whatever it was holding will fall.</p>
<p>I wrote this on my phone without double-checking anything, hopefully it's coherent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add some clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li>tensile strength is generally where a metal starts deforming;</li>
<li><em>ultimate</em> tensile strength is the maximum stress a metal piece can take before it starts necking (becoming thinner in the middle, which leads to fracture) or fractures directly;</li>
<li>fracture load is the load at which the piece actually fractures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since wire is hella brittle these are mostly interchangeable, but for many metal pieces they are not. Most metal pieces have a &quot;give&quot; where they'll deform before breaking, what we call ductility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tensile strength and Ultimate tensile strength are synonymous. Yield strength/proportional limit are the terms used to define the point at which the damage becomes irreversible and the metal starts to deform.</p>
<p>UTS is just the highest strength that the part will see before fracture. This could be exactly as fracture occurs, or well before if there is significant plasticity. Technically necking has nothing to do with it, UTS can and is achieve well after the onset of necking in many materials, as they gain more strength by work hardening than they lose to necking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what, you're right, I usually erroneously say &quot;tensile strength&quot; instead of &quot;yield strength&quot; because I work mostly with materials with almost no strain hardening! But I can't think of any conventional metals whose UTS is not close to fracture/just before necking. If you have any examples I'd be keen to read about it.</p></div>		</li>
