			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an urban myth. All the big flavor companies and Coca-Cola's competitors know exactly what goes into Coca-Cola. They use hugely expensive analytical instruments (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry" target="_blank">GC-MS</a>) to analyze the amount of every flavor molecule, down to the tiniest amounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. 1) The ingredients are right there on the can. 2) A lab, especially a determined competitor's, can buy it and analyze it.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're overestimating what a mass spectrometers can do, and underestimating the skill and background research necessary to make some sense of what one is telling you.</p>
<p>The result would basically be &quot;You have a lot of different complex sugars&quot; with some very fuzzy results. So to get any data out of that you'd basically need to hire a big medical company to figure it out for you (they're probably the only ones with the necessary skill, gear and background libraries) and mass spectrometry would only be the start of it.</p>
<p>It could probably be done, but it's not easy, it's not cheap and it's not fast (especially not if you want to get the flavor profile exactly right and not just &quot;approximate&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah fair enough I've never really looked into it. I heard that for the first time so many years ago and it just sticks with you lol. I do think it does a good job of getting across the point that they could be putting pretty much anything in there, but you're right I should have checked before I included it.</p></div>		</li>
