			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact about batteries. The voltage produced internally is actually constant even when nearly dead. However, the chemical reaction that produces the fixed voltage slows down so much (due to the chemicals internally being depleted) that the internal resistance of the battery (a virtual resistor in series with the voltage source that simulates this effect) increases, which decreases the terminal voltage that we actually measure.</p>
<p>This is why we have batteries that tend to multiplies of specific values based on their technology. You won't find a 1V LiPo battery or a 4.3V NiCad, because the voltages produced are 3.7V and 1.2V respectively.</p></div>		</li>
