			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep you're right, restaurants use the old formula as they need that cling for a better seal to keep their food fresh, since the manufacturer changed the formula for the consumer product freely it never had to be outlawed and is thus still in use for professional use.</p>
<p>I remember that there was a thread about this some time back, a year or two and someone in the comments mentioned that if you buy a full sized industrial roll of saran wrap from a wholesale store then you'll get the better version, I don't remember what kind of store that'd be though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. It was chlorinated. The problem was that it was a single use product, after which it went to a landfill. Turns out, millions of people dumping chlorinated plastic into landfills every week has a negative effect on waterways. Who knew?</p>
<p>We still use chlorinated plastics (PVC pipe being the obvious one), but generally not in single use applications anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope - it's chlorinated and when combusted forms polychlorinated biphenyls. Since they contain benzene rings they're highly stable meaning they're persistent - hence Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP for short). They're highly toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and since they're stable they bioaccumulate in the food chain.  They can't leach out of the plastic since they don't exist in it - they only get formed once combusted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why doesn't it stick to metal then?</p>
<p>There's another answer claiming it's static electricity attraction, and a commenter there mentions this might be why it doesn't stick to metal bowls; I could also see them having a nonsmooth surface as being the reason, idk what metal looks like under a microscope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jeweller here. The metal you're thinking of just hasn't been polished smooth enough.</p>
<p>I can polish up a piece of metal with finer and finer grades of polish until it gets a smooth, glassy mirror shine on it... And I guarantee the film would be able to stick to it then, same as glass. Nothing to do with static electricity.</p>
<p>Edit: OK I JUST CONFIRMED MY THEORY </p>
<p>I'm a little high and a little curious so I took a highly polished metal bracelet that I have, and tested it on the cling wrap. And Yes it sticks really well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love how, like the top-level comments, the replies to my comment also disagree.</p>
<p>I have no idea who's right, both explanations sound sensible! Maybe it just uses both principles, and on regular metal bowls neither works due to it being both conductive and nonsmooth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some stainless bowls that are brushed on the outside bowl area, but the rim is relatively polished. The wrap sticks like crazy to the smooth part of the bowls and not at all to the brushed part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when cling film is unrolled electrons are stripped from the surface unevenly, creating localised charges of static electricity across the surface. on an insulator these can hang about quite well but a metal conductor allows a current to flow and these charges to 'resolve', and it loses its stick quickly.</p></div>		</li>
