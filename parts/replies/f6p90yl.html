			<div class="markdown"><p>Just knowing the dipole moment isn’t that helpful.  Amphipathic molecules cross cell membranes best.  (Why do you think relatively large steroid hormones can disperse so well, and they are far from completely non-polar).  A fully non polar larger molecule is going to form aggregates and not disperse in an aqueous environment.  Resistance to being bound by antibodies and degradation by endogenous enzymes is also a major factor in reaching target receptors across the BBB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was addressing why a lay person might think they possess similar properties based on a simple representation. I wasn't trying to answer the question he asked, which had already been answered, or go into the various factors of membrane crossing, which you have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was mainly addressing your sentence that inferred you could look up what polarity (or lack there of) would allow passage across the blood brain barrier, which even for a layperson would be a confusing and incorrect belief to hold.  It’s not like looking up partial solubilities in THF or benzene vs H2O .  Molecule size and flexibility as well as conformational and partial dipole moments on certain areas of a molecule (and particularly proteins) is much more important than just an overall dipole moment or polarity measurement.  Phospholipid bilayers have different properties depending on embedded proteins and the type of cell.  (The blood brain barrier is much different than that between the small intestine and nearby capillaries for example).  You made the answer sound like it could be explained just by looking up two chemical constants which would give a partial explanation but leaves a huge chunk of the biochemistry out.  All I was trying to do was let people know that it isn’t as simple as that particular sentence might make them infer.</p></div>		</li>
