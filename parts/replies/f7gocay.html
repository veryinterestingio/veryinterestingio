			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I’d like to point out that cisterns (as I know them) were generally refilled every day as the water inside them was used. We had two at the farm, one in the garden and one in the brewery room. And both would have been nearly empty by the end of the day according to historical documentation. Kids would have a kind of yoke that would hold two buckets to bring in water from the river. That was part of their everyday chores:</p>
<p>So they weren’t stagnant like a birdbath no one is paying attention to- they were regularly refilled and cleaned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up on a farm with a spring-fed cistern as the house water source, it's still in use to this day.  Like you said, water flows through it pretty quickly so it's not standing around collecting diseases.  It has a tight-fitting cover so no animals are coming by and mucking with it.
Worst we'd have happen is an occasional lizard or frog get sucked in and stuck in the kitchen sink tap.  People have been drinking that water for a hundred years with no health issues at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grew up with well water as well.  Not a deep well, but an old brick lined hand dug well about 15 or 20 feet deep.  Chock full of Atrizine I would guess as our well was about 100 feet in two directions from row crop fields.  It was a fairly regular occurrence that some wayward animal (snake, frog, lizard) would fall in the well.  We would notice the water tasting or smelling funky.  The old man's solution was to open the well cover (a cement block over the hole in the middle of the top) and with a flashlight and fishing pole we would snag whatever was floating then pour about a half gallon of Clorox into the well.</p>
<p>Needless to say I was a sickly scrawny child.  Still have digestive issues into my 60's.  We had no water purification beyond a &quot;sediment filter&quot; and this occasional waste of bleach.  Also had no health insurance and we were poor so doctor visits were few and far between.  </p>
<p>I learned first hand what the health effects of poverty are on children. </p>
<p>Rural water co-operatives came to be in this area in the late 1970's.  Purified &quot;city&quot; water piped to rural homes was a huge advance in standard of living for country folks around here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not too much different than the many of us who have bore-hole wells.  My water comes right of the ground, gets a bit filtered for sediment (to be nicer to my pipes and appliances) and iron but goes straight into our cups.  Treated water tastes funny to me, not always unpleasant but always ... funny.  </p>
<p>But my system sounds the same as the one on your old farm, minus the cistern.  I’d think a coarse filter (like screen-door coarse) would spare you the occasional frog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And again I’d like to add in that duckweed is beneficial for humans, so this answers your question directly. It has some anti fungal and anti bacterial properties. It’s possible (but undocumented for what I worked at) that duckweed would be something encouraged for the cisterns. </p>
<p>I know for our garden cistern (our brewery was was indoors) we almost always had some of it floating in the water we would use to water plants for human consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume the duckweed simply denies anything else in the water of any excess nutrients. They're used in low-nutrient aquariums (fresh water shrimp for example) for that exact reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird, I'm on a well too but that just means I take extra long showers. Only thing we pay for is the electricity for running the pump and heating the water, no actual charge for the water itself. Was it a really small water table or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had to spend days or weeks finding a place likely to contain a decent underground water supply and then digging for days or weeks to create the well verses just carrying a few daily trips from a nearby stream or river, which would you do?  Keep in mind that you have to dig the well when the ground isn’t frozen or too muddy. You also have to dig the well when you aren’t planting or harvesting and when you can spare time away from otherwise tending crops and livestock. Plus there are dangers  in digging holes in the ground—build up of gasses, collapse, etc. I would guess that wells are more common the further you are from waterways.</p></div>		</li>
