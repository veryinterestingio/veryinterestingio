			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn’t about diminishing returns on clock speed — it was about heat.  (Also it was more like 15+ years ago).  Making everything on the chip switch faster makes everything dissipate energy that much faster, and temperatures were getting too high to ensure the chips could operate reliably (or even not melt parts of themselves).   Since then, an enormous amount of work has gone into to optimizing power, but it’s extremely difficult, and so clock speeds have only crept up marginally since then.</p>
<p>It has been much easier to just start throwing down multiple cores instead, effectively transferring the problem into the software domain (to actually take advantage of the parallelism available).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actual performance benchmarking programs designed to do just that.  They perform massive numbers of carefully chosen commands to the CPU, GPU, etc. to measure how well the specific hardware it’s being run on performs at those commands.</p>
<p>Those benchmarks have evolved over time but many can still be run on older machines, or are comparable measurements to older benchmarks.  For cpus, they normally focus on number of instructions completed per second.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing</a>) has an overview and links to specific standards.  The SPECint and SPECfp ones might be of interest, since they can provide comparison points - they have data  back to some of the early supercomputers and early PCs through to current processors.</p>
<p>As stated in the grandparent post, CPU instructions per second are only one piece of overall performance.  The takeaway for a given benchmark is that, <em>all else being equal</em>, the two items compared perform at this specific rate; and for ones that you can run yourself, <em>your specific implementation</em> of the hardware can be compared to the reference implementation or to other user’s results.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Consider what work you're doing.  Is it for productivity, or just for gaming?  Traditionally (though this is changing recently), productivity roughly meant you wanted more cores, while gaming meant you wanted better performance-per-core.  If by productivity you mean some kind of scientific modelling that can't be done in parallel, then it's per-thread performance you'll care about.</li>
<li>Look at benchmarks.  Synthetic benchmarks like PassMark can give you a rough idea of per-thread speed on a CPU and overall speed across all threads; but if you really just care about gaming, you can just look up how many FPS people get on one CPU or another.</li>
