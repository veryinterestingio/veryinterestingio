<p>In an internal combustion engine, you have cylinders that move around where the piston rings have to slide against the cylinder wall so there is a small amount of gas leaking past. You have to lubricate the cylinder wall that will be hot and exposed to the burning fuel.  There is also lots of another point where there is the part that moves relative to each other</p>
<p>So it is a comparison of ball bearings with rotation spheres vs metal that move against metal.  It is the metal move again metal at high temperature that is problematic lubrication part in the internal combustion engines. </p>
<p>If you like a comparison in a car with internal combustion it would be the wheel bearings that you do not lubricate. The wheel being will be in a worse situation as they are exposed to the elements in a way the bearing in the electric motor is not.</p></div>		</li>
