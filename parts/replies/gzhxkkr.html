<p>This paper uses google earth data and looks at coastal lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This translates into a net loss of approximately 14,000 km2 of surface for human settlements and terrestrial ecosystems </p>

<p>But once you start to include the drying of lakes, swamps, reservoirs, etc. there is an overall increase. </p>
<p>TL;DR: It's very hard to measure accuratly, and the change from erosion is pretty minor on a human scale(except for very specific locations that the coastline is disappearing by the year).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it becomes a sandbar only seen at low tide, sometimes it fills a channel &amp; later gets removed by dredging, sometimes it gets added to a different beach. There are a lot of possibilities before it will resemble new land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See the coastline of Italy vs the coastline of the UK. The coastline of italy has grown by several km since the early middle ages. The coastline of the UK has shrunk since then. So there's no mistake one did not transfer to the other, erosion played a part in both. The trajanic basin, an ancient Roman port, one on the coaat, is now several miles inland</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an answer but somewhat related is the problem with <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7dcDuVyzb8Y" target="_blank">measuring coastlines</a>.</p>
<p>Basically you can't. The smaller the units you measure in, and the more accurate you get, the longer the coastline becomes. The video linked is not that long and pretty interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I might disagree with you there? You don't need to precisely measure land area to know if it is decreasing or increasing over time. You can show it by simply establishing reasonably good lower and upper bounds on land area - which is very possible even if you can't precisely measure coastlines.</p>
<p>Like, I don't need to know infinitely many digits of pi to know one pizza is bigger than another pizza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't take that long.</p>
<p>The Earth will naturally become uninhabitable for humans due to the Sun's stellar evolution within about a billion years.</p>
<p>In around 1 billion years from now, the Sun's brightness will increase as it's supply of hydrogen decreases and the heating of its outer layers will cause the Earth's oceans to mostly evaporate, leaving only minor forms of life.</p>
<p>Well before that time, though, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will be too low to support plant life, destroying the foundation of almost all food chains.</p></div>		</li>
