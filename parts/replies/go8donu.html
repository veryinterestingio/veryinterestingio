			<div class="markdown"><p>And sometimes the traffic on the road gets too much for a tunnel. I remember on I-77 in West Virginia, when they widened the interstate they ended up blasting out the mountain beside the tunnel, cheaper and less dangerous than trying to widen an existing tunnel.</p>
<p>And then you take all that rock as use it as fill in valleys to level out the road in other places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in Norway a few years ago and was astonished by the quantity of tunnels.  As a tourist it was pretty cool, though I can see how construction would be maddening for a local.</p>
<p>There are a handful of mountain tunnels here in British Columbia, but they're nothing like Norway's</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just a few miles south is the Big Walker Tunnel entirely in VA.</p></div>		</li>

Wytheville, Bland (is it boring? heh), Beckley, New River Bridge, etc.  It's been probably close to 30 years now since I've gone that route though.  The Memorial Tunnel is the one I was thinking of where they rerouted around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those two tunnels are still in use, but I think they were referring to Memorial Tunnel, as seen <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1bB8ubLVnjwFXowq8" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The concrete structure off of the roadway was/is Memorial Tunnel and you can see how the mountain was removed to allow for the wider interstate to pass through instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has a lot to do with cut and fill. Sometimes a hill/mountain will be blasted and excavated because one or both are true: 1) diverting the road would require fill material to be brought from somewhere else 2) fill material is needed on another portion of the road and blasting and excavating gives roadbuilders a nearby place to get it.</p>
<p>One of the most challenging aspects of any sort excavation for development is filling. Fill material has to reach a certain compaction level and stay within a certain moisture content to be deemed suitable for building, including building roads. It also takes a lot of time to properly install fill material, as just dumping it all on site without layered compaction will make a site that could take decades to finally settle before it can be developed. It is almost always cheaper to cut material out and use it somewhere else or even just dispose of it than it is to purchase and install fill material. </p>
<p>When building roads, engineers will plan a route that is as short as possible, has the least amount of incline and curve, and has near zero sum quantity of fill/cut material. When you start peeling back the layers, it’s really incredible how much planning and work goes into building a road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with the blasting.. How do they turn the big rocks that form into &quot;fill&quot;. I mean it's not like they can just drive a steamroller right over a boulder that's as big as it, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have attachments for machines like excavators that are basically giant jackhammers to break up the boulders from the blast excavation. Those pieces are then fed into other machines that further grind those down into &quot;well-graded crushed stone aggregate&quot;, basically a mixture that is about 1&quot; for the largest pieces on down to about sand-sized particles with evenly distributed sizes. These pieces are rough, so they grab onto each other more effectively, and the array of sizes allows the larger pieces to provide the strength while the gradually smaller pieces fill the progressively smaller gaps, which if dry and voided of air (i.e. &quot;compacted&quot;), is both stable and supportive.</p>
<p>Bonus fact, both asphalt and tarmac (&quot;tar and macadam&quot;) are not actually considered &quot;load bearing&quot;. The fill underneath, known as &quot;base course&quot; and your sub-base, are actually the parts of those roads that take the primary force of the traffic. The asphalt or tarmac are just very effective dust covers that slow the erosive effects of traffic traveling across it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, tunnels are safe against avalanches and rockfalls. Some areas, making a road along a steep mountainside safe would cost a lot more money than a tunnel. Also, if going over the mountains take you up to real winter elevation you run into cost of snowplowing and risk of shutdowns.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The A83 in Scotland, near the Rest &amp; Be Thankful junction has had various slippage and landslides every couple of years for the last 15 years. Quite often they haven't finished fixing the previous one before the next comes crashing down. </p>
<p>If it affects the older road too, that's a 60 mile detour. Now that doesn't sound like a massive inconvenience to people in some larger countries but it's detours over smaller country roads with a fuckton of trucks taking the route too. It can easily turn into a three hour detour when traffic if heavy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I visited Islay in September and got caught out by this. It was an enormous detour in torrential rain coming from Loch Lomond to Kennacraig. </p>
<p>Ordinarily it's beautiful scenery, but when you can't see more than 20 feet in front of you, half the roads are underwater and you're booked on a ferry with a strict leaving slot, it's nothing but stressful. Luckily we left much earlier than we needed to and made it on time. Thank god we'd upgraded from an old hatchback to a 4x4 the month before. </p>
<p>Much more relaxed on the way back in the sun without time constraints, and it was a stunning drive.</p></div>		</li>
