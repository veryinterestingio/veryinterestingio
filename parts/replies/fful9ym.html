			<div class="markdown"><p>My best math teacher in college (multivariable calculus) did something similar to this. </p>
<p>He gave a quiz each week adding two new questions on the new subject matter each week. First week two questions, 2nd week there were four. The first and second questions were variations on the material on the first quiz, and so on for each subsequent quiz.</p>
<p>You only had to get a question correct once, so if you got question three correct, you would not need to answer it on the next quiz. If you did not understand how to do that kind of question, you got another chance on each subsequent one. Your final score was based on the total correct answers. </p>
<p>At the end of the class was a final exam, basically a long version of the complete quiz. </p>
<p>I did not understand the material at the begining of the class, not getting any questions correct on the first or second quiz, but understood it by quiz three. I ended up getting an A in the course. If it was a traditional class I probably would have failed or dropped it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem I had was not understanding the basics well enough because my teachers were teaching obscure theory with absolutely zero relevance to real life, and I absolutely hated Math and Science. </p>
<p>But my parents forced me to take it because “Math is needed for 80% of jobs out there and Science 60%” but then, when you enter the real world, the majority of day to day jobs are either menial or easily learnable if you can work a computer at a basic level. I had no plans of being an engineer or an architect or a pilot so it wasn’t very relevant to me and I suffered “bigly”.</p>
<p>Learning that things like “light is a particle and a wave” means absolutely nothing to the average kid. But if my teacher had said to us, “So, you know how when you’re swimming in the ocean and a wave picks you up and dumps you on the beach? A small wave can barely knock you over but a huge wave can absolutely destroy you when it smashes you into the sand, and your clothes start flying off and you get sand in places you really don’t want sand getting? And how the wave seems to draw you up to its tip before dumping you in the sand? And the longer I stand on the beach and watch you, the higher the chance is that I’ll see you somewhere further up that wave to the point where it’s almost certain I’ll find you at the tip of it at some point? Well you intuitively know that, so let’s relate that to how probability, wave function, and particles all work..,”</p>
<p>At that point it’s not hard to translate that into  how the wave of probability collapsing results in a particle, and that everything we see is just a collection of different fields each interacting and providing a particular aspect of each particle. And I’m an absolute layman in terms of understanding physics; imagine how much more I could know right now if someone properly trained had taught me about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similar model for one of my college courses: </p>
<p>If you scored higher on your final exam than your course grade, then your final exam is your final grade.</p>
<p>If you did well enough in the course to get an A, you did not have to take the final exam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how the later course content build on the earlier content.</p>
<p>Students who are already behind may have to answer much more questions in later quiz than students who are ahead. This can create additional stress.</p>
<p>Also some students may slack up since they know they will have a second chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine it's way easier to grade by hand this way. A simple Excel sheet with a row for each student, and a column for each question type. At a glance while grading you know Student A has green across the board so only needs the 2 new questions graded. Green for correct red for incorrect maybe yellow for a partial wrong answer (correct form but small mistake). Student with red across the board each week needs help. Copy each previous week sheet to a new tab for the current week. Shows history and progress.</p>
<p>At least that's how I'd do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metacognitive practice is powerful. My students' first two weeks of school is spent in part leaning about metacognition, practicing it in the classroom with immediate feedback, and developing a personalized action plan. (Medical school, so there's more time!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking about thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did I get this wrong and how can I improve?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, it's &quot;thinking about your thinking&quot; and has three parts, planning, monitoring, and evaluating. In the previous example, students monitor how they did (grade their own assessment) and evaluate how they can improve (reflection writing). They can then formulate a new plan for studying/practicing/problem solving/etc and the cycle starts again. Feedback is important, however the process must be done by the learner. </p>
<p>Metacognitive practice has several benefits. It improves problem solving and transfer (applying prior knowledge to new situations). Learners are aware of strenths and weaknesses, and have a plan to approach them. Retention of information improves though spaced repetition during transfer. Learners learn concepts over isolated facts, increasing cognitive integration and mental networks. It's cheap/free, doesn't require any special equipment or fancy tools so it's ideal for k-12. And last, but definitely not least, metacognitive practice helps close the academic achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Online, this is a good place to start. There's some videos (or transcripts if you prefer to read) along with recommended books and articles. (On mobile so I can't do the fancy hyperlink). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! </p>
<p>I teach in a community college, and I tell my students to submit their work to me as soon as possible (as I let them have a second crack at it) so that I can grade their papers. This way if they get something wrong, they can go back and retry it. I do things a bit differently from you, but I think my method is working this semester. </p>
<p>So far I've had on average 2-5 students stay after each class (we're in week 2) to discuss the questions they missed. I typically will address the issue in class. </p>
<p>I do get some slack, though, as I teach computer classes and we do a lot of hands on. So for example.. not just learning about what an SMTP (email) protocol is and used for, but also actually setting one up on a small server USING it and seeing it in action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for caring so much about your students. Even at a 4 year I would sometimes go weeks, even a month or more without getting grades on my assignments - and often, since they were submitted digitally, I would get them back with no feedback. Those rare profs who care about their own punctuality, and not just their students’ (what kind of awful double standard is that?) are special.</p></div>		</li>
