			<div class="markdown"><p>For the Kessler Syndrome fans, &quot;Seveneves&quot; by Neil Stephenson is a fun read.</p>
<p>As long as we don't go down that road, even if there are tens of thousands of Starlink satellites, space is BIG. Like really really BIG. Much bigger than you can possibly imagine. As long we know where the satellites are (and we do), missing them is trivial and doesn't make for any real launch complexity.</p>
<p>The reciprocal problem...intentionally hitting a satellite, is *hard*...that's what anti-satellite missiles do and they need a lot of fancy tech to do it reliably. So the odds of hitting one by accident are very very low. Not zero, and rockets and satellites are expensive enough that it makes good sense to check, but even if you just launch blind the chances of hitting something are incredibly low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Objects between 1 and 10 cm are generally tracked with slightly more predictive methods.  Some of the stuff is honestly too small to hit with radar, but they know where it came from so they know where it is likely to be.</p>
<p>I had always thought the majority of our 600,000 or so tracked objects was from the anti-sat tests in the 60s.  Researching my comment here I learned that In fact more than half comes from exploded Delta upper stages.  (If left in orbit containing any fuel at all they tend to eventually explode)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most current space junk is from the space race or from catastrophic failure of unnacounted for shitty components.</p></div>		</li>
