<p>While we are on the topic, I’ve got another question for you. I heard the largest dinosaurs that lived were vegans. Is there any proof based explanation for why the vegan food is more healthier than the meat ones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not a question of healthier diet - it depends on the adaptations of the animals concerned. The plant-eating dinosaurs attained large body size to make themselves less vulnerable to predators and to have larger guts in which the plant fodder could slowly be broken down by symbiotic microorganisms. Meat is easily digest but plant food is mostly made up of cellulose, which vertebrates cannot digest unaided.</p></div>		</li>
