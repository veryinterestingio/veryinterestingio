<p>Would a new population of mammoths survive in an arctic that's warmer than the ice age and getting warmer really fucking fast? </p>

<p>The scientific experiment Pleistocene Park aims to have mammoths or &quot;mammophants&quot; if/when they are created. They would be key to keeping permafrost intact and reverse global warming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool thing such as changing taiga (shrub and small trees) into artic 'savana' of sort by breaking the bigger trees. This in turn makes the ground a lighter color, keeping less heat (albedo effect) and keeping the ground frozen. Their is a guy in Siberia trying his hand at recreating these artic savanas with a pletora of other animals and his personnal buldozer replacing the mammouths will waiting for someone to make some XD. Would really like to see that work</p>
<p>Edit: just realise you allready mention the ?same? Project... so yeah,  more details?</p></div>		</li>
