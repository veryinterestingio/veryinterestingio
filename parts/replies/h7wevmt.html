			<div class="markdown"><p>What's worse, is that in some cases we're required to type in our zip code. </p>
<p>The problem is that most times when this is asked for, it clearly displays big and bold on whatever screen is present, that we're typing that zip code in on. </p>
<p>Should someone bump into me and steal my wallet, having watched me out at the gas pump, put in my five digits, they can take any one of my cards and if requested would have seen the answer already. </p>
<p>Oh, and that's if I wasn't using the card close to home, where the ZIP codes are spread out a little so you have a one in three chance if you're from the area of knowing which zip code to punch in. Unlike some random number that I may have chosen that would normally have been hidden upon entry and such a scammer would have easily been seen trying to get close enough over my shoulder to see what I'd typed.</p>
<p>Yeah makes no sense either way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK and Australia, contactless payments are very common. You don't even need to hit credit/savings/debit or swipe or insert your card. It's just a tap and leave. When I was in the US, I was very surprised that it wasn't widespread at the time – I was legit tapping and people were looking at me like I'm an idiot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use my Samsung Pay everywhere in Australia and have never had a problem with any kind of card reading other than their system being down. </p>
<p>Travelled around America and soon learned only certain types of cards work at certain businesses... My travel card (Visa prepaid), loaded with USD at a favourable rate didn't work at a number of places forcing me to carry more cash just in case it didn't read than I've ever had to carry anywhere in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Luckily my normal Australian bank card (Visa credit) worked in most places the other didn't. But I did get hit with a conversion fee on top of the worse conversion rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, so, when I was travelling, I had a Citibank Plus debit card, so I wasn't paying any conversion fees – just the Visa rate (now it's MC). Just have to be careful to pay in the local currency, not the dynamic currency conversion ripoff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Canada you need it on credit if the cost is over a certain amount. Kicks in at $100 before COVID, but they raised it to $200 in our region because so many people were now using cashless buying due to precautions. So, convenience for low-cost stuff mixed with fraud prevention for more expensive items.</p></div>		</li>
