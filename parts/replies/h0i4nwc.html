			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out, in case you didn't catch it from this explanation, that the majority of the sodium does NOT get put into the house water supply. The sodium from you salt blocks get used up making brine that refreshes the plastic beads and then gers dumped down the drain. The house water does get salted, but not much. You can't even remotely taste it when it's operating correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, many studies have been done on the effect of soft water on the health of people drinking it. With your  calcium and magnesium diet taking quite a bit (up to 30%) out of the water you drink in a day. Both of these ions help prevent cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>A nice book about this: <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319357843" target="_blank">https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319357843</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding this correctly, then the (small amounts of) calcium and magnesium in your water is replaced with sodium at a 1:1 ratio?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.  Calcium and magnesium have a positive 2 charge; they're divalent.  Sodium has a positive 1 charge; it's monovalent.  So, for every calcium or magnesium removed, two sodiums are released into the water.  This maintains electroneutrality.  In terms of mass, 46 g of sodium are released for every 40 g of calcium or 24 g of magnesium.  (It's based on atomic weights.)</p></div>		</li>
