			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s actually some interesting research looking at intranasal vaccination. I’m not sure if they’ve looked at it for COVID but definitely for flu. Essentially, there are several types of antibodies (in the news, they talk the most about IgG) but mucosal membranes generate their own form of antibodies. If you can engage these antibodies, you could presumably prevent infection in tissues that are initially colonized by the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I remember listening to an interview of Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute and he said that the current vaccine candidates are promising, and they give immunity to the individual, but not sterilizing immunity. </p>
<p>That person <em>will continue to be infectious,</em> the reason being that active virions continue to exist inside the mucosal lining because immunity derived from current vaccine candidates occurs in the blood, not the mucosa. </p>
<p>The point is that people should continue to wear masks. Even though you've been vaccinated non-nasally, you can still possibly continue to spread it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha. So it seems that it will mostly be muscle cells that produce the protein along with a smattering of other cell types. </p>
<p>The immune system would then destroy these transfected cells in the process of developing acquired immunity, just as if it were fighting a localized infection, so you're basically sacrificing some otherwise healthy cells to acquire immunity. </p>
<p>It seems rather odd - SARS-CoV-2 is very specific to humans because it has evolved to have a spike protein that just happens to fit well enough and bind to the ACE2 receptor on certain human cells. It's a complicated and very specific process, like the popular key (spike protein) and lock (receptor) analogy.</p>
<p>But these LNPs sound like they're fairly basic... and yet they're capable of transfecting numerous cell types and injecting their mRNA payload to be translated by the host cell, all without the need for a specific surface protein that binds to a specific receptor for the entire thing to gain entry.</p>
<p>If it's <em>that</em> easy to transfect a huge range of cells, shouldn't there be more viruses that have this simplistic structure? I'm guessing because such LNPs are exceptionally unstable and couldn't easily occur in nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SARS-CoV-2 isn't that specific to humans, it can infect a variety of mammals, like minks and cats and bats and civets etc, but happens to be particularly harmful for us. We're still not really sure why but a lot of the thinking is that our immune system overreacting is often the reason for severe disease. Many animals have similar enough ACE2 receptors to also get infected. (Side note, I also don't know that key and lock is the best descriptor, since the viral proteins undergo confirmation changes as part of infection so induced fit might be more accurate in this case. But that might occur after internalization in the low pH of endosomes, hopefully a virologist will chime in and correct me if I'm wrong)</p>
<p>As for transfection of a huge range of cells, we can do that because scientists and engineers have done huge amounts of work designing special materials for these LNPs, to make them work so well. This comes with some tradeoffs like poor stability, which is why both leading mRNA vaccines need to be frozen, and also why this would not be a viable path for a virus to evolve towards (although never count out evolution, who knows maybe we'll find one someday that does this). In the lab when you use these tires of materials, you mix the nucleic acid with the lipid/polymer and then have to add it to the cells within tens of minutes, so stability is a key limiting factor.</p>
<p>For a little more clarity, it is actually believed that these gene delivery methods likely bind to cell surface receptors as part of the process to get internalized, it's just not a cell type specific receptor. I believe for example that polyethyleneimine (a cationic polymer used commonly in some transfections) binds to sialic acid receptors that's are on the cell surface of pretty much all cell types (didn't confirm this in literature, just writing this based on my experience in lab, I'm a phd chemical engineer who's worked a lot with mammalian cells and RNA). It then gets internalized because of that interaction. (Interesting side note, I believe the sialic acid receptors are also targets of influenza for infection, although I hope some other redditor virologist can confirm that, not my specialty)</p>
<p>Of course, the materials used for the leading vaccines are proprietary so don't know the exact details, but I would expect they use similar gene delivery methods in their liposomal particles (see lipofectamine, which is a lipid and cationic polymer material commercially available for gene delivery). Whatever they're doing it seems to work thankfully!</p></div>		</li>
