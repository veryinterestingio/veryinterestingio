<p>Eventually, the list expanded to 12 intervals, roughly equally spaced.</p>

<p>What's really interesting is <em>why there are exactly 12</em> in Western music.  It is not just because people happened to do it that way -- it's because of a cool mathematical coincidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use the even tempered scale these days, IIRC, because it makes transposition easier: a well-tempered keyboard will sound really good in C, if that was the key it was designed for, but really bad playing a piece in Eb for instance.</p>
<p>Kind of similar to why a capella music has such pleasing harmonies: they can be more exact than a chord on an even-tempered instrument or ensemble</p></div>		</li>
