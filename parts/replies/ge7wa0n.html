			<div class="markdown"><p>For larger automated systems it can take a few hours to a few days to clear your email from their marketing systems. We used to purge lists overnight, so give it a day or two. </p>
<p>To add to what has been says here as well, there is a difference between junk/marketing emails and spam emails. Marketing emails are almost always something you signed up fir at some point (either through making an account on a website, setting up a rewards card at the grocery store, or not clearing the “send me your newsletter” option when clicking through some Terms of Service). Spam is unsolicited email that is usually malicious and often is sent using harvested lists of addresses.
Marketing emails must have unsubscribe links that actually unsubscribe you from the listing, spam technically must have these links too but they are already doing shady business and so either don’t include a link, or include a link solely to see if the email is real so they can sell it for more money to other parties.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It sounds to me like you might be a person who works for a marketing firm or has implemented these systems so let me just say, on behalf of all human in the entirety of the world, nobody has ever signed up for a marketing list. We are required to give you our email to get a tracking number, or some thing we actually want, and then conveniently get signed up for notifications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the unsubscribe links, this is what I had found a very popular company in India doing in their email newsletter:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hypnosh/status/1313014611910647809?s=20" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/hypnosh/status/1313014611910647809?s=20</a></p>
<p>Basically, the footer of the email has text that says 'unsubscribe', but not only is it NOT an a href tag (meaning an active link), it's not even an a tag (not even an inactive link) - it's simply a span styled to look and feel like an active link - the cursor changes on hover, but nothing happens when you click it.</p>
<p>Don't know how it's not considered a fraud!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A marketing campaign is planned a week or more in advance... your email address is already committed to that. But eBay will certainly unsubscribe you eventually since they are actually worried about government penalties. </p>
<p>For Real “spam”, unsubscribe is just a confirmation of valid address to make selling your address worth more money to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That only applies to spammers. For any legitimate company, it's not the case.</p>
<p>The more likely scenario is the entry level marketer sending out the emails screwed up. Send a written request in requesting all the data the company has and ask to be unsubscribed to all communication.</p>
<p>That will work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Obligatory 'not-a-lawyer, this-is-not-legal-advice' text here).</p>
<p>In Canada, it's actually <em>illegal</em> to use a deceptive or overly-burdensome unsubscribe option.  The Canadian Anti-Spam Law (CASL) levies a large monetary fine (up to $1,000,000 for individuals and $10,000,000 for businesses) for failng to provide a working and 'readily performed' unsubscribe feature (CASL broadly defines 'readily performed' as 'text the word STOP or follow a <em>single</em> hyperlink to enter your e-mail address').</p>
<p>You can report deceptive or intentionally-obfuscated unsubscribe methods to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (and two more agencies that are, together, responsible for enforcing CASL) at <a href="https://www.fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/frm-eng/MMCN-9EZV6S" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/frm-eng/MMCN-9EZV6S" target="_blank">https://www.fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/frm-eng/MMCN-9EZV6S</a></a></p>
<p>Stay safe out there, folks!</p></div>		</li>
