			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranium's natural isotopes have either a 700 million or 4.5 Billion year half-life.</p>
<p>Uranium in and of itself is so non-radioactive as to not be worth any significant consideration.  One of its decay products, Radon, does provide some mild radioactivity, but unless it's confined in a small space and people live there for a long time with poor ventilation (read: basements in areas with lots of granite) there's no danger.</p>
<p>Uranium is only dangerous because, if we use it in a fission reactor, it splits into lots of pieces that are very radioactive.  The uranium itself still isn't dangerous, but all of the stuff some of the uranium turned into is dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last paragraph is not completely correct. It’s not the most dangerous compound, but it still has some risks attached. Uranium is still a heavy/toxic metal. Most forms of it are fairly inert and are just passed through our digestive system and don’t like to get through the skin. </p>
<p>Unfortunately if it gets into the blood stream it is fairly dangerous because it tends to bioaccumulate and excrete slowly. It also can be inhaled and can cause toxicity in lung tissues. Uranium loves phosphate compounds and likes to build up places like your bones. It also hits your kidneys like any other heavy metal and can cause big problems with liver, gallbladder, etc. </p>
<p>For years the uranium used in ceramic glazes between the world wars were a junk level byproduct of booming radium production. It was in everything ceramic. Some of the cheapest colors available were uranium reds. Lots of houses had it on tiles in kitchens and bathrooms. That industry was clamped down on after the publicity of the watch girls in the 20s and 30s and production dropped. It also was entirely halted during the war years because they were using all of domestic production for the Manhattan project. </p>
<p>They started selling it again in 1959. The glazes weren’t as cheap, so you stopped seeing it in stuff like bathroom tiles, but they were still produced in huge quantities because we were making insane amounts of depleted uranium in our efforts to build bombs. At a certain point they decided to reduce the stockpiles of the depleted stuff and it found its way into everything.  They made armor, ordinance, sailboat keels, glazes, fishing weights, etc. Fiestaware, cast slip busts, enamels, lab glass, pins, etc. </p>
<p>The NRC banned glazes containing uranium in the 1980s but really didn’t take much action on it because they estimated that no large manufacturing operations were still making the stuff in the us. The glazes mostly contained sodium urinate, which under certain conditions can be converted to compounds that absorb readily through skin. </p>
<p>After the ban, there was a gray market for it. Thompson enamel sold its old stocks of #153 into the mid-90s. We were still using it for specific applications when I was in college in the early 2000s. I have a string of Venetian/Murano beads that we made in ceramic studio one year and three of them have uranium glazes on them. I did a glaze over flux preparation and to get the right effect without having to go through a lot more steps, I used a very small amount of #153. </p>
<p>Would I use it again? Yeah. Would I be a bit more careful with the glazes? Probably. Do I think it should be banned... certainly at an industrial level where you are exposing employees to it day in and day out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 100%... but the most common isotope- ^238 U has a half life of 4.5 × 10^9 years. That is essentially 'stable.'</p>
<p>That's why atomic bombs are so hard to make. They have to remove the stable stuff from the fissionable stuff to a very high degree. That's not terribly easy to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! All elements with a higher atomic number than lead (82) are absolutely always radioactive. Uranium is 92. Vaseline glass is radioactive. There just isn't that much uranium in there, and it's absolutely minuscule amounts of radiation. <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/blag/radiation.png" target="_blank">Keep in mind we are exposed to a lot of radioactive sources daily, and none of it matters.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bismuth is technically radioactive but it takes so long that half of it will have decayed by the time it's estimated that all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_timeline_from_Big_Bang_to_Heat_Death" target="_blank">stars everywhere stop fusing and galaxies may not even exist, much less solar systems.</a></p>
<p>It has a half life of 2.01x10^19 years. On the timeline I linked, that's 128 on the y axis, for <em>one</em> half life.</p>
<p>Bismuth is pretty much not radioactive.</p></div>		</li>
