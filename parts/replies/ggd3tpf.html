			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally, an ELI5. The only thing I would add is that for the holding down the power button, when the chef comes back again, the kitchen would be clean, but someone else quickly did it before he got there. Some food might have been thrown out, or some knives gotten lost since the cleaners didn’t know as well as the chef how to clean, but for the most part the kitchen is ready for the chef to start his work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: IRL, the computer follows an abbreviated version of shutdown. So for the chef example, you can think of it as the wait staff quickly cleanup as he's leaving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The night janitor who's pissed because it's not really his job to clean up the kitchen just the front of the restaurant, so he puts shit where he wants to or throws it away and the chef may have to scramble to find things or may not be able to crank the kitchen back up at all without outside help. Don't hold down the power button.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think holding down the power is more akin to taking everything that is out and throwing it the garbage before the chef leaves, rather than putting things where they belong. When he comes back in the morning he may not be able to find certain things or might have to remake certain things, but at the same time the spoiled food that was ruining things is now also gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In modern OSes, not everything. Windows 10 would actually get a signal that the power button has been pressed and would try to handle some state before everything shuts off. For instance try to save off some important RAM info to disk so it helps diagnosing later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also not right.  By default in windows 10, there's a setting enabled called fast startup that makes it so a restart is more of a shutdown than an actual shutdown.  You can disable it by going to the 'choose what the power button does' menu and disabling fast startup, or the command prompt command 'powercfg -h off'.</p>
<p>With fast startup  still on, shutdown your computer, boot back up, and check uptime in the task manager.  It will not show 00:00 uptime.  Try restarting and it will reset.</p>
<p>I manage about 750 windows systems across 20 companies at the MSP I work for, we disable hybrid sleep on all our machines because lingering problems that would usually be fixed with a restart tend to stick around when shutting down with fast startup enabled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate fast startup. My users think they are doing a good thing by shutting down everyday, and cue their annoyance and disbelief when I tell them &quot;oh your computer hasn't rebooted in 45 days.&quot;</p>
<p>I want it turned off so bad. Unfortunately, someone at HQ who thinks he's more important than he really is saw that fast startup saved about 5 seconds and screamed loudly enough and got a stop put to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyone involved in IT support about 3-4 years ago had to have this conversation dozens of times.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know you already turned it off and on again... Windows, in their infinite wisdom, have made shut down more like 'sleep' these days. Humour me and restart it&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not &quot;wrong&quot; per-say.  The issue is that Windows 10 has erroneously labeled the &quot;Sleep&quot; option as &quot;Shut down&quot; when the fast startup option is enabled.  It's not actually performing a full shutdown of the computer (which would, in fact be shutting down completely).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to expand the analogy, a regular shutdown has the chef clean up, and require him to prep the materials upon startup, where as a fast shutdown just has him throw currently prepped stuff in the fridge for tomorrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fast startup is like the chef does all the prep for the next day and leaves some of the knives out on the counter so he can get to work quickly.</p>
<p>Restart is like he doesn’t do any prep, cleans out the fridge, and puts all the knives away. It’s slower to start again, but if he needs to change recipes or some of the food went rotten, that’s the only solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a battery, It used to be called the CMOS battery or BIOS battery that allows the computer to remember not only Date and Time but all the hardware and bios settings.</p>
<p>These batteries usually outlast a computers usefulness but occasionally they die and you need to replace them. There were also cases where the bios could get trashed, so you remove the battery and everything resets back to defaults and you setup the bios again.</p>
<p>On todays computers, most people never have to deal with BIOS and the batteries last like 10+ years.</p></div>		</li>
