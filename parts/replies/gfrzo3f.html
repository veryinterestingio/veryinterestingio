			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not even true though. They have flaws like any other diamonds. They are rated on clarity, cut, and color just like natural diamonds. And, by the way, the closer to perfect either a natural or lab made diamond is, the more valuable it is (it’s just that the lab made one will cost you a lot less for the same quality)</p></div>		</li>

<p>You'd get a picture of your loved one, a poem, or whatever in the stone. You could then put your diamond ring in a special projector that would display the image contained inside on a nearby surface.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Needs to be video. Then they can sell the contraption to “play the diamond” that will need to be replaced every so often as well as profit from the diamond. And level that up by increasing quality. So instead of diamond size they can start selling 4K, 8k, etc. causing people to have to upgrade.</p></div>		</li>
