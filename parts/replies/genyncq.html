<p>Yeah this is always important to remember. I focus more on statistical epidemiology, so I understand the models more than most, but I still had to do a lot of self study because ID wasn't a focus in my curriculum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is. But it's worth noting that a lot of high profile researchers with a more traditional epidemiological (specifically, evidence-based medicine) focus have turned to covid contrarianism (the likes of John Ioannidis, Carl Heneghan, Tom Jefferson, Vinay Prasad). A part of that is certainly the siren call of contrarianism (thinks of Peter Goetzsche, <weeps>) but a part of it may be their attempting to apply a framework they do understand to a context they don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.  2, 3, and 4 all make sense to me.  I'm confused about 1.  My understanding is that if a vaccine is effective in a person, that would necessarily mean a smaller viral load within them, therefore necessarily making transmission less likely.  What's incorrect about that understanding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with what the trials have tested to this point. The current trials applying/soon to apply for EUA (Pfizer, Astra-Zeneca*, Moderna) have tested for symptomatic infection (since that is the most immediate concern, and also one of the easier endpoints to test for). If a participant developed symptoms, they were tested; significantly fewer of those tests were positive among those who were vaccinated than among those who received the placebo.</p>
<p>However, we know that SARS-CoV-2 can cause asymptomatic infections and that it can be transmitted by people who never develop symptoms. Because of the way these trials were structured, we cannot (yet) determine whether the vaccine reduced symptoms (essentially turning symptomatic infections into a asymptomatic infections) or if it will have a meaningful impact on infectious ness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.280818v1.full.pdf" target="_blank">Primate studies</a> on the vaccines (not a perfect measure) showed the vaccines reduced but did not eliminate infectiousness. If this were to be the case, vaccinated individuals could still infect others. I think it is highly likely that the vaccines do reduce infectiousness enough to at least make a significant impact on transmissibility, but for the immediate future, it is better to remember that we know vaccination protects (most) from symptoms, but we do not yet know that vaccination protects others from you. (Epidemiologists tend to want evidence of a specific outcome if it is testable, rather than piecing together different studies to make assumptions).</p>
<p>*Astra-Zeneca (I believe) sent one group home with swabs (UK, I think) and has been having them test themselves every week. They’ve indicated that they have data that indicates reduced transmission, but this has not been released.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very curious about this... Isn't the definition of epidemiologist &quot;someone that studies infectious diseases&quot;? What else do they study?
I'm a medical physicists and when I started reading about epidemiology this year it seemed like 90% of it is network theory and compartmental models to see how a disease spread.</p>

<p>Wearing masks, distancing, de-densifying helps create an atmosphere (we hope) where these things are normal and accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would you want these things to become &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;accepted&quot;. I work in a covid hub in a place with one of the worst 2nd waves, which is in full lockdown. But inside hospitals bars can remain open. And even ICU doctors/nurses regularly go there because being close to other humans is a basic need. You can't expect that people will accept to distance indefinitely. It's ridicolously urgent to be able to be close</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are coming to epidemiology during a pandemic, so you’re getting a very skewed view of what “normal” is. Most epidemiologists don’t work in infectious disease, most ID epidemiologists are not modelers, and many modelers are not epidemiologists.</p>
<p>An epidemiologist, by definition, is someone who studies population health. As we have been better able to prevent and control infectious disease in most countries, increasingly PhD-level epidemiologists are choosing to focus their efforts on chronic disease or methodology (and training / funding is pushing them that way). Modeling (SEIR, etc) is (was?) also not widely accepted by more traditional epidemiology circles. Infectious disease modelers tend to be their own (small) group, and many are not epidemiologists by training (common degrees are statistics / biostatistics, math, ecology, computer science, data science). I anticipate both of these things changing; more ID epidemiologists, and more modelers. There is already evidence of the latter.</p>
<p>Quick edit to add in: Eric Lofgren (who is an ID modeler and epidemiologist by training) had a good <a href="https://twitter.com/germsandnumbers/status/1301680043358261248?s=21" target="_blank">Twitter thread</a> about this</p>
<p>As for masks, distancing, etc. They will still be necessary for some time, until the number of people vaccinated and the effectiveness of those vaccines is enough to substantially decrease transmission. By doing these things ourselves (even if we were confident our risk was 0, which, again, we are not), we make it more acceptable for others to wear them. Distancing / de-densifying isn’t the same as lockdown, and there are ways to increase lower-risk activities as community risk decreases. (Also, we miss our friends and families too — epidemiologists aren’t robots).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting. Given that a SEIR is the same model that you use for the kinetics of a super-simple drug I thought that it was like the first lecture of intro to epidemiology course!</p>

<p>I guess that in some nations there's a communication problem going on. I see lots of advices to avoid meeting anyone. Which clearly isn't sustainable even on a mid-term scale. At the same time I see in my hospital doctors living &quot;80% normal&quot;. Which is something that would be much better received by the general population. Especially considered how many nations are there that have very few restrictions and at the same time Rt&lt;1</p>
<p>So when I read &quot;we'll stick with distancing for years&quot; I think &quot;how can we think that people will adhere to restrictions if we tell them that there's no way out anyway&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
