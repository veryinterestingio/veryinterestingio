			<div class="markdown"><p>How so? Osgiliath was Gondor's former capital and, during the War of the Ring, an abandoned city that served as an outpost and buffer for Gondor between populated areas and Mordor. Siberia, while also sparsely populated, is essentially a backup plan for Russia's population, bringing them farther away from potential enemy territories and giving them the natural protection of the Ural Mountains. This seems much more similar to Helm's Deep, which allowed the people of Rohan to retreat from their enemies and take advantage of protection from the mountains (the White Mountains, IIRC).</p></div>		</li>
