			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! If you've ever been in a building that is struck by lightning, or near one when it's struck, you'll notice a huge crashing noise rather than a rumble. That's because the sound hasn't had any distance to really be distorted over. You're getting fresh sound</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your assumption from the explanation is correct but that isn't what happens in real life. We live on open plains and regularly get lightening. Thunder has an initial clap and then a residual &quot;tingle&quot; noise. Kind of like dropping keys at the top of a wooden staircase only to have it fall further small drops over and over. You can see that multiple things happen by watching any slow motion photography of lightening.</p>
<p>I have no idea why the duration of a full thunder noise would be defined but I guess it is down to voltage supplied and discharged. Ie 3 million volts ready but only 1.8 million is dissipated in the initial clap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an &quot;altitude&quot; and a &quot;density&quot; issue.,  The <strong>speed of sound</strong> is not a constant, but depends on <strong>altitude</strong> (or actually the temperature at that <strong>altitude</strong>).  A plane flying Mach 1.0 at sea level is flying about 1225 km/h (661  Knots, 761 mph), a plane flying Mach 1.0 at 30000 ft is flying 1091 km/h  (589 knots, 678 mph)  ...</p>
<p>Boring right?</p>
<p>Basically, every zone has a distinct lightning/thunder calculation. learn and know.<br />
That's why people count :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that supposed to be radius? The diameter should increase at 2x speed of sound.</p></div>		</li>
