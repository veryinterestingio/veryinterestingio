			<div class="markdown"><p>It's frustrating because for the longest time I wondered why things were limited by the speed of light. Like why and how was everything so dependent on light and it's speed? Instead it's more about the max velocity a massless particle can travel. We just call that particular velocity the speed of light. I feel like it's almost a misnomer to call it the speed of light. Something arbitrary like Plank's speed or even just c - the max velocity a massless particle can travel. Or am I misunderstanding something crucial?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacker here, when light passes to a new medium it can slow down and speed up right? Is the universal max speed changing in that medium or does the light beam just appear to slow down due to, i don‚Äôt know, some kind of scattering for example</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh it's a TOTAL misnomer. It's &quot;the speed that light travels&quot;, but if there were no such thing as light that same speed limit would still be the same for other things. I prefer &quot;universal speed limit&quot;. It just so happens that light goes that fast in a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for you, since you did a first rate job explaining. Since velocity is relative, and we don't know where coordinate 0, 0, 0 is in the universe, how is this max velocity even defined? Relative to an observer? What if the observer is traveling the opposite direction of the light wave? Wouldn't that create a relative velocity greater than c?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That‚Äôs the beauty of relativity. You can define your own coordinates however you want. There is no absolute spacetime origin. In the case of two objects traveling away from each other, the relative speed between them will always be less than c (assuming they‚Äôre massive objects). Why? Well, you can always boost to the center of mass frame of one of the objects (eg where it is at rest). Since all massive objects must travel less than c, it must be traveling less than c in this frame as well. </p>
<p>If you insist on using a third reference frame (eg one where two objects are traveling away from the origin), you must use the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/einvel.html" target="_blank">Einstein velocity addition.</a> In essence, the simple, Galilean velocity addition where you simply add up the two velocities does not hold in relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I power on a laser pointer directed to some direction, and another one point to the opposite direction, from my point of view one of them is traveling at speed c, while the other one is traveling at speed -c. In 1 year, both lasers will have reached a distance from me of 1 light year, right? So now they are both apart 2 light years. How come they are not traveling at 2c one from the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!  And congratulations: with that question, you are walking in Einstein‚Äôs footsteps.  </p>
<p>The answer he found is what we call the theory of Relativity.  It holds that the velocity of light etc. is ‚Äî get this ‚Äî <em>always the same, to every observer</em>.  How the hell is that possible?  By warping space and time ‚Äî hence the concept of ‚Äúspacetime.‚Äù</p>
<p>So for example, if you‚Äôre driving by me in your car, and I could somehow measure you to subatomic accuracy, you would look to me like you‚Äôre slightly shorter along your direction of travel than you really are, and also it would look like you‚Äôre moving more slowly through time.  Conversely, I‚Äôd look that way to you too.  These changes combine to allow the speed of light to be identical for both of us. </p>
<p>The YouTube channel I linked to covers this, though I‚Äôm not sure in which episode(s) offhand.  But I highly recommend going back to the beginning and just watching them <em>all,</em> in order.  üòÅ</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, as the universe is expanding, two sources of light CAN be accelerating away from each other faster than light.  Aka, the light from one source not being able to ever reach the other because the substrate is causing it to move away quicker than it will ever reach it.This has implications that scientists have discussed for the future:  Long in the future, they think we will not be able to see any other galaxies because they'll be moving away from us too fast for the light to ever make it here.  The effect would observable as over years and millennia, to a telescope - say on Earth (which would be long gone, but go with it ;)  ), a galaxy would fade out.  Over time, they all would.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no (0,0,0) in the universe. There is no absolute reference frame and no absolute motion. As Einstein noticed, every inertial  observer measures light to travel at c, irrespective of  how fast they are moving relative to the source. That has a lot of consequences to the geometry of spacetime, like time dilation  and length contraction and a lot of other things.</p></div>		</li>
