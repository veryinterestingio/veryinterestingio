			<div class="markdown"><p>Apps crash all the time, but the OS rarely does. I can probably count on only one hand the number of times any of my Android phones has locked up and had to be restarted. </p>
<p>Contrast this to the Windows ubiquitous &quot;blue screen of death&quot; and things like runaway processes that you can't kill for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I think in large part the difference comes down to the philosophy of each OS. Windows generally lets programs do pretty much anything they want as long as they're run as admin. Android is far more restrictive in what it allows apps to do, and will judiciously kill or throttle apps that for example are blocking the UI thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't had a BSOD in windows 7 from software, ever. I had 2 in the week before a stick of RAM completely failed and turned into a brick, and a good number from overclocking my new RAM too much. Otherwise, just none.</p>
<p>Now, not being able to kill a process, had that many times haha</p></div>		</li>

<p>With great effort, you still can install the program manually and your phone will start crashing and bugging out.</p>

<p>There's no great effort at all. On Android: Settings -&gt; allow Unknown Sources. This will allow you to install from outside the Play Store in Android and has been included in every release since 4.0.</p>
<p>As far as bugs, Android apps can be terrible for them because there are 9,000,000 different phone platforms running 8 different versions of Android that developers have to try to account for. For Apple it's easy because there are only a couple models.</p>
