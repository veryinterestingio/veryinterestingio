			<div class="markdown"><p>Even humans are a great example of genetic bottlenacking as we, as a species, went through two bottlenecking events, which is why inbreeding is such a huge issues with humans, as we are generally very similar on the genetic level as a species, where other species can much easier bounce back from a bottlenecking event or avoid major inbreeding in nature</p></div>		</li>

<p>Inbreeding is not really a big issue with humans, unless it occurs for several generations in a row.  Even if you have a kid with your sibling the birth defect rate only doubles, from 0.5% to 1.0%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually ik people say that interbreeding meme hapsburgs or dumb rednecks but in reality humans are incredibly diverse. The average somali is genetically quite removed compared to an eskimo, immunologically, dentals, microfauna, musculature and of course temperature regulation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the exact opposite is true. Humans are much less genetically diverse than other mammal species. For example, there is more diversity in a single population subspecies of chimp than between any 2 populations of humans globally. </p>

<p>ETA Also your examples tend to be more changes in phenotype (gene expression) as opposed to differences in genotype (genetic code).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Humans are also generally not diverse at all compared to most mammals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While interesting, that fact is really a very sad symptom of how low genetic diversity is in cheetahs. Another, easily seen sign is the kinked tail gene that might possibly become a fixed trait in the species due to genetic bottlenecking.</p></div>		</li>
