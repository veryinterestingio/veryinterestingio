			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for pointing out the difference. The question that op wanted to actually know: what are the advantages and disadvantages of the shape of the human ear.</p>
<p>Evolution doesn't &quot;make&quot; things. As you point out, the why is always the same: random mutations leading to advantage leading to breeding. Or, random mutations leading to attractiveness, leading to breeding. Repeat the cycle until a part of a population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, the phrase works. But, I think the misunderstanding stems from the incorrect idea that the evolution mechanism is actively changing traits. Changes are passive, and environmental factors rule out what doesn't work. Those two pieces together make adaptation. Even a thousand adaptations strung together do not make evolution.</p>
<p>Evolution is not a point-a-to-point-b type of thing. It is a continual process that only shows permanent change on a long timescale. It is impossible to see evolution at a single point in time. You must have 2 distant points to compare, and that's not an end or beginning. Evolution never starts and it never finishes; it is simply a process.</p>
<p>Creationism is active, has a definitive start and end, and is a much earlier and stronger driven education; hard to break that idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost/benefit would be the first big issue. As far as things sounding better, there are so many variables there, your ear shape isn't going to be in the top ten, yet probably the most expensive to augment. </p>
<p>Physics and biology are complicated. figuring out the slight tweak to improve the performance goes beyond the outer ear, but also the shape of the inner ear. Additionally, despite calling it plastic surgery, your body is not plastic, so making the minute changes necessary would be very difficult, as scar tissue and muscle pulling and swelling would undo a lot of the work.</p>
<p>The brain is actually pretty good at this already - If you ever have an ear cut off or damaged, things will sound funny for a while, then your brain adjusts and it goes back to normal. </p>
<p>As far as tactical advantage: most people in combat positions in the military have hearing damage from firing weapons without hearing protection.</p></div>		</li>
