			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont think it's wrong per se, I think it's incomplete. Like, you could do a lot of things and it doesnt mean you want to. Human sexuality goes beyond wanting to drop kids everywhere, it's a way to form bonds, and a social unit which is imperative to survival.</p>
<p>A male which won't settle and form a family/social unit will have it harder to survive. And in a bigger group, a tribe, if a male wants to go fuck with every female {other guy's girls}, well, that can only result in disaster. The other guys will beat him up or kill him or... you get it. It's unnecessary drama, it's an anti-social behavior that can't be good for the tribe's survival.  </p>
<p>I dont have to be a goddamm PhD in UT Austin to see this simple reasoning. So, yeah, either David Buss is a shitty scientist, or he's just misogynist and biased. Pick one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. But I think the main problem is that they assume the explanation from an isolationist/individualist point of view, when in fact, we, humanity, are a gregarious species. We can't be figured out isolated from the environment and the social needs {and solutions} that come with living as a community.</p>
<p>A male with such libido that he literally would rape any woman close to him would only bring him death {it's just anti-social behavior}. Granted, he would have a lot of children, BUT: case 1 {and Im still talking about primitive cavemen, of course}. the rightful mates of such women will kill the children {if they dont kill the women as well}. Case 2. the woman is single and maybe no other male will want to form bonds with her, so she will be forced to take care of the kid alone. We know the kid most likely wont make it, with how hard life was then.</p>
<p>Societies, all kinds of societies regulate themselves for the common survival {theorethically, yeah....}. Because, in the end, self-preservation matters more than genetical legacy {not true for all species, and we are assuming the individual doesn't have kids already, ofc}.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And let's not forget that, today, people want to have sex for sex's sake, not for Genetic Legacy^(TM). You just can't compare the psychology of a guy who wants to mate to perpetuate his legacy, to one {in the postmodern age} who just wants a fuck. OF COURSE, the weight of COMMITMENT will be vastly different from one another. the objective matters, like a rock, in the head of the guy.<br />
And, I want to stress this out, human sexuality helps us form BONDS. You know what these hypothetical pussydestroyers who only want to fuck everything that moves dont seem to have? <strong>Emotional needs</strong>. But we, normal people, do have them. And stable relationships tend to fulfill them better, just saying.</p></div>		</li>
