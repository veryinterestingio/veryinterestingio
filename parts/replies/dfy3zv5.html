			<div class="markdown"><p>There's light in a room only because that light is <em>all the time</em> being replenished by some source (sun, lightbulb, candle). All the time. Needs to be replenished because it moves very fast, and it's very quickly absorbed by walls, people, objects, etc.</p>
<p>Most photons only bounce a few times off bright-colored objects and then get absorbed by the things they strike, but do not bounce even once off dark-colored objects (a few do, but those are a small fraction). So light in a room pretty much gets absorbed as soon as it's produced, hence the need for constant replenishment.</p>
<p>When you turn off the source, all that light zooming by and bouncing around is absorbed in the tiniest fraction of a second, too quickly for you to see how the process goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes complete sense. However, lets say that we do have such a perfect system and we aren't observing the phenomenon. Add a single speck of sand particle in the space. Turn on light for a small period of time...theoretically two things should happen, right? 1) it will get progressively brighter in the space and 2) once the light source disappears, you could, theoretically, heat up the grain of sand substantially as it absorbs all the photons, right? Enough to possibly melt the sand based on how much photons are present? </p>
<p>On another note: in this type of space, is there a temperature at which the sand particles will no longer be able to absorb photons? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But shouldn't light loose some energy with each bounce ? I feel like it should ... I mean, don't solar sails works because of photons transmitting energy upon impact ?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that any sensor (including your eye) will absorb the incoming radiation and disturb the initial equilibrium pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's say you have a very &quot;bright&quot; room with 90% reflectivity (roughly mirror-bright). That means 10% of light is absorbed. After just 6 bounces a given photon will have only a one in a million chance of having avoided being absorbed in such an environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm confused. Doesn't this say that on each collision with an object, a given photon has a 90% chance of bouncing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, the math is a bit off. At a 90% absorbtion rate for each hit, the photon would need to hit a wall ~131 times for there to be only 0.000001 chance of not being absorbed (99.9999% of light absorbed)
If this photon was in a 10m long room it would hit a wall ~30000000 times per second. Therefore, the time it takes for the light in the room to reduce by 99.9999% would be 131/30000000 seconds, or ~4 microseconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, you're right, I'll go back and fix the math. It doesn't change things materially but it's important to have correct figures.</p></div>		</li>
