<p>One thing professionals factor into <strong>business decisions</strong> is &quot;how much will it cost, and what will I get paid?&quot;.  Medicare pays less and costs much more in terms of paperwork, presuming that actually providing the medical care costs the same.</p>

<p>And this is why for-profit healthcare is sociopathic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked with hospitals and billing departments and money isn't always recouped. People get gouged in health care a lot but it's mostly private insurance that does it.</p>
<p>But more importantly, it's our society's inability to truthfully accept how much medical care costs. Insurance does its best to provide cheap, often ineffective treatments at first. If medical costs were truly covered, patients would be able to get more of what the doctors prescribed for them, right away, rather than having to go through ineffective, cheaper treatments for weeks, months or years.</p>
<p>But that would cost more in terms of taxes. We could probably save money getting rid of most private health insurance hell doctors have to go through, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make mistake, the cost of healthcare in the US is artificially high. We can piss about how the cost makes it challenging, but the cost is entirely a US problem. Healthcare here is expensive because the American medical industry has made it expensive on purpose to turn a profit.</p>
<p>If healthcare had to be expensive it would be expensive all over the world, and it isn't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Insurance companies are for-profit corporations whose supreme duty is to maximize shareholder profit. The less care they pay for, the more profit they generate. They are strongly incentivized to screw patients over as much as possible.</p>
<p>Only sociopaths would design or allow such a healthcare system.</p>

<p>Half measures are of little use. We should follow Germany's example -- a single government-run insurance company that negotiates down prices for drugs, hospital services, doctors, ambulances and everythimg else. It covers 91% of the population. The remaining 9% are rich folks who have private insurance so they get frills, basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Health insurance does not 'provide' anything but a massive drain on resources that could be covering the cost of care. They are the largest, most bloated middleman with the worst cost/value in the history of the world economy. Just the top few companies earn over a TRILLION dollars annually. None of that money pays for the cost of care. That money does not pay for anyone's cost of care - no, that's money made simply by controlling the access point to healthcare. </p>
<p>Worst of all, the corrupt and convoluted group negotiating done by insurance companies obfuscates the true cost of Healthcare so badly that it's nearly impossible to discuss any kind of reform or changes to the system. The only people in the country that actually have a decent idea of the economies of all this are the top Healthcare executives that make billions in profits for their shareholders and billions in their paychecks to take home themsbroken.</p>
<p>Even the affordable care act, the most contentious legislation we've had in decades, that's had our country at each other's throats, was really only able to scratch the surface of this quagmire, putting some mild regulations on Health insurance companies and unable to really address the actual cost of Healthcare at all.</p>
<p>Obviously it goes without saying that I don't think anyone working for an insurance company is evil or anything so hyperbolic. But the system is utterly broken, and the Healthcare insurance industry's position in controlling the access point to literal life and death also gives them enormous influence to maintain their position.</p>
<p>P.s. hope it's clear I'm not disagreeing with your post, just adding to it</p></div>		</li>
