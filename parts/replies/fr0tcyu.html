			<div class="markdown"><p>At any given moment there are about 20 volcanoes erupting, and some of them are growing lava domes. There is no evidence that tectonic activity is increasing, as there is no evidence of volcanic activity increasing. It is difficult to know if any of the volcanoes now or ones that may erupt in the future will produce a catastrophic eruption. Smaller eruptions are more likely to occur than larger ones.</p></div>		</li>
