			<div class="markdown"><p>Medication-wise you could try Flonase or another nasal steroid spray for a month. These particular medications reach their maximum effect after 2-3 weeks of daily use. Flonase, nasonex, rhinocort, nasocort, etc, do not provide “immediate” relief. The steroid affects how the new cells in the lining of the nose are made, preventing them from being susceptible to inflammation. These sprays can help with Eustachian tube dysfunction, but evidence is honestly equivocal. </p>
<p>Afrin nasal spray, a potent otc topical decongestant, can be used with some benefit as well. However, do not take it for more than 3 days in a row. The body will become used to having it, and discontinuing after prolonged use will cause rebound congestion. </p>
<p>If these do not help, probably a good idea to see an ENT and obtain an audiogram and tympanogram to test your hearing and compliance of the ear drum. </p>
<p>Ear tubes provide relief for those with persistent pressure. There is another new procedure as well—balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube. </p>
<p>Other conditions that can mimic Eustachian tube dysfunction are temporomandibular joint inflammation and migraine.</p>
<p>Edit: ear wax impaction can also cause ear fullness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine stretching saran wrap tight on the open end of a cone. That's your eardrum.</p>
<p>If you take that to a place with low air pressure, the wrap will bulge out because there's more pressure inside the cone than out.</p>
<p>Now open a hole in the bottom of the cone to let out the pressure. That's you opening your Eustachian tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get an ENT. We spend all day looking at ears and have better equipment to do so. I really don’t trust what any non ENT says regarding a patient’s ear examination. Medications mention in my previous post are an option, but some people just have bad Eustachian tube anatomy and unfortunately need tubes their whole life. Balloon dilation is another option, assuming this is the actual problem.</p></div>		</li>
