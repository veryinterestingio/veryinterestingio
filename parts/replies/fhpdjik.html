<p>Think of the individual trees as just blades of grass connected to a shared root system.</p>
<p>Ninja Edit: For those interested in further info, Oregon public broadcasting did a good piece on a single fungual organism that may be the largest single living thing on Earth. It's estimated at roughly 2,000 acres, or more than 20x as large as Pando by area. (Not sure about by volume).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no and depends on the plant. There are around 60 plant families that contain succulents with more varieties in those families. But if we are looking at the same species, then yeah, the same farm might be the source for plants around the country. But another plant might be sourced from several different farms. Or hundreds of different farms. For a big box store it all comes to the bottom line. Make as much profit as possible. Some plants that means taking many cuttings from the same mother plant. For some plants its more cost effective to sow seeds. Other plants are grafted to others. Some plants it makes sense to grow in one location and ship cross country. Some it makes more sense to source from a local farm. Its all about profit for the company or a network of multiple companies working together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somatic mutations, especially in rapidly evolving regions of the genome, make it possible to uniquely identify the genotypes of twins or clonal plants (including <a href="https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/x26-237" target="_blank">aspens</a>). More recent resequencing projects in trees have even identified variation associated with different parts of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-15-142" target="_blank">a single tree's canopy</a>.</p>
<p>Uniquely identifying different clonal trees in a stand shouldn't be an issue if it's your goal. You just need to look at the right number of rapidly evolving markers. The real issue is going to be identifying the tree a leaf sample came from in spite of the unique somatic mutations in the genotype of the leaf relative to your reference tree genotypes. A relatively simple maximum likelihood model should accomplish that, though, I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Aspens are perfectly capable of reproducing sexually and setting seeds, so if they do that there is genetic diversity among the offspring, but they also “sucker” vigorously from their roots. What looks like an entire forest might be clonal growth of a single individual. Most famously, the “Pando” clone is an enormous clonal “forest” that covers something like 43 Hectares. Aspen is just one of a number of trees and other plants that will reproduce readily by forming adventitious shoots (suckering). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of - depends on your definition of 'reproduce'. When you get 'clonal populations of trees' - these are actually one big organism. The roots of the original tree reach out to a new place, and then start making a new trunk there. The resulting tree is actually fully connected to the original one through its underground roots. It looks like two trees, but it's really one tree with two+ trunks. Many tree species can do this, including aspens. </p>
<p>Trees also reproduce sexually by exchanging pollen and releasing seeds. Many times, the pollen and seeds have ways of reaching places that a tree cannot get to by propagating its roots. So, in addition to the genetic advantages of sexual reproduction, trees use the process to reach further distances.</p></div>		</li>
