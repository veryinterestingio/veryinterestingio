			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on how many days you work. Iâ€™m a nurse and work with a bunch of doctors obviously and some of them do 24 hour shifts in the ER but only work 1-2 days a week and make the same amount as they would if they worked Monday - Friday 8-5. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes its terrible for the mental health of the doctors. But the choice is not an easy one when you can send a doctor home and risk another human to die ... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most doctors I've known didn't do that for their whole careers. My father eventually phased out hospital work -- now he's only got his private practice, for example, and so did most of his colleagues. But growing up, up to my teens, I remember my dad still doing those 24 hour shifts. My sister also went into medicine but managed to stop doing the longer shifts much sooner in order to spend time with her son. If you can move away from hospital work, then you can eventually work less ridiculously long hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big part of it is the non patient care based expectations of American doctors. I think in Europe and in most societies people want to support the doctors by letting them focus all their energy on using their training to help the population. That takes a lot of effort but is not impossible to do in a healthy way and actually is energizing and self sustaining. American doctors are expected to spend that same amount of energy on patient care but overall patient care probably accounts for 35-40% of their total energy. In the US we decided we want to burden doctors with absurd paperwork, billing metrics, corporate metrics, legally defensive practice, fighting insurance companies, prior authorizations, customer service, fragmented records, and a slew of other things that have nothing to do with the practice of medicine. I think a recent survey of US doctors showed about 40% across the board are burnt out and it is no surprise.</p></div>		</li>
