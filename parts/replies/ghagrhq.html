			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one issue though, while luminosity is high the working temperature of the modules is also high with no air to take away the energy. I wonder if the efficiency is net positive in comparison though they might use different modules for in space use that lose less power with temperature or use wider range of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>more interestingly, you can build large mirrors for solar collection of extremely thin foil, that would be impossible on earth surface. this would cut down on solar costs significantly, if 99% could just be a hyper-thin mirror.</p></div>		</li>
