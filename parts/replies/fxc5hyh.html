<p>Like everyone can see a street light at the end of a street at night, but it's pretty rough trying to see the flowers  near that light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>surely it doesn't matter how bright it is if you don't have the resolution to see it in the first place? - the best you would get is a white blob with zero detail?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how we see stars in telescopes anyway, we can't see any details even of close stars. Here is the most detailed image we have of a star that isn't our own: <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27084/astronomers-release-detailed-image-star-besides-sun-betelgeuse/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27084/astronomers-release-detailed-image-star-besides-sun-betelgeuse/" target="_blank">https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27084/astronomers-release-detailed-image-star-besides-sun-betelgeuse/</a></a></p>
<p>You can determine the properties of stars by analyzing the light itself though, the chemical makeup, temperature, mass, distance, movement, etc, you don't need to see the star itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the information you can get on stars is from measuring the properties of the light it's emitting and how the brightness changes over time and how it moves   in the sky. You don't need a whole lot of light to do this.</p>
<p>Essentially the star does just look like a blob but that's fine, it's all you need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like you're having a little campfire and on the horizon you can see the skyline of a city. There's a rock 50 steps away in the dark. The city giving off its own light will be a lot easier to see than the rock that can only reflect what little firelight actually reaches it.</p></div>		</li>
