			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're curious about apparent magnitude, the Greeks categorized 'stars' from 1 to 3 (similar to the Olympics) with 1 being the brightest 'stars' and 3 being the dimmest.  Then they added 4-6 being as even dimmer 'stars.' Turns out, astronomers though the ages kept this system, so that's why apparent magnitude is so odd.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not exactly &quot;kept the system&quot;, but defined a logarithmic scale that approximately mimics the Greek scale. Formally, a star of magnitude <em>n</em> is 2.512 times as bright as one of magnitude <em>n</em>+1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else I find interesting about andromeda (galaxy),  is we can see it with the unaided eye, but only the densest part of the center. If our eyes were sensitive enough to the light (or if the whole galaxy were brighter) it would appear to be as wide as 5 moons - side by side. Some things in the night sky do appear to be very small (like the ring nebula) but others are just very dim and actually have a fairly large apparent size.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The International Space Station goes up to -5.9, because it's so close.</p>

<p>So this means that I can spot it with naked eyes? Wow, I wasn't aware of this! How do I go about catching it? Also, how to predict how bright it's gonna be?</p>
<p>UPDATE: I installed an app called &quot;ISS Detector&quot;. And it seems that ISS would be visible in my region in about a week or so. Excited!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when it passes overhead you can't miss it (as long as its night and not cloudy!). Looks like a bright star moving steadily across the sky, takes around 5 minutes to pass. (So much slower than meteors which are blink-and-you-miss-it quick). Many other satellites are visible too with summer evenings generally being the best time to spot them, but the ISS is particularly bright.</p>
<p>When there's a crew or cargo spacecraft approaching you can sometimes see that too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Faster than most aircraft in the sky but slower than a meteor. Also if you're getting a especially close pass, you can sometimes see momentary brightenings from specular reflections off the solar array or other shiny surfaces on the station</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember one night up in the Midwest with a friend we were looking up at the stars for a couple hours. I remember seeing these <em>tiny</em> dots of light moving slowly in a straight line through the sky. Like, you really had to focus to see them. Took me a while to realize they were satellites. At any point I could usually find like 4-6. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's actually really bright. It's only 400 km away and it's like 100m across and so it reflects a lot of light. Some passes are brighter than others - often its brightest just before sunrise or after sunset, because then it's still catching the sunlight. It was particularly fun about ~10 years ago because the space shuttle was slowly drifting away from the ISS while waiting for good weather to land, and you could see the two dots go overhead in sync.</p>
<p>The other thing to look for are Iridium flares. There's a whole bunch of these satellites that are really reflective and will suddenly shine really bright for a few seconds as they line up just right to reflect the Sun into your eyes. You can find predictions for when they happen on common apps too.</p>
<p>A good website for this stuff is <a href="https://www.heavens-above.com/" target="_blank">Heaven's Above</a> - e.g. <a href="https://www.heavens-above.com/PassSummary.aspx?satid=25544&amp;lat=43.6532&amp;lng=-79.3832&amp;loc=Toronto&amp;alt=92&amp;tz=EST" target="_blank">here</a> are the passes for Toronto. For the ISS there's often a couple per night, they're just not all super bright or at convenient times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's fantastic.  Thanks so much for pointing us to that.  </p>
<p>I didn't realize that the ISS was visible pretty much every day (at least from where I am).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a lot of satellites over my lifetime, so I know what normal satellites look like. One day right after sunset I noticed a super bright satellite and figured it had to be the ISS. I took out my phone and used an app that shows what each satellite is and sure enough it was the ISS.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Quasars have &quot;jets&quot; along their rotation axis. When you give the number of 1000 times brighter, it's supposing that the jet is pointing in our direction right?</p>
<p>These jets emit ultra high energy particles. I don't think it would be a danger for us due to distance, atmosphere, magnetic field etc, but I imagine our <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/images/content/397293main_Fermi_1_year_revised.jpg" target="_blank">gamma ray sky</a> would be very different, with a point-like source outshining our own galaxy? Or am I exaggerating?</p></div>		</li>

<p>A jet pointed at us would actually obscure the light, assuming it to be visible with naked eye.</p></div>		</li>
