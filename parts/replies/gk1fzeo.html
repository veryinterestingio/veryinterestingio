			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely habit. For me a bad posture isn't too bad when sitting but walking or standing up with bad posture feels like shit. It's definitely a habit that's hard to break. I do sports and I have a really good posture but I think it's exhausting to sit like that and I have no intention to stop slouching when sitting.</p></div>		</li>
