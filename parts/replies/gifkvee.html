			<div class="markdown"><p>Fruits are balanced by having fiber, plus vitamins but in this context it is the fiber.  So in general, eating a handful of grapes is better for you than a handful of candy, even if they have the same calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  There are different types of sugars, fructose, glucose and a combination of the two called &quot;sucrose.&quot;  They are found in fruit, and there is a lot of crossover as the same types are also found in chocolate and processed foods, albeit in different densities.  Sugar isn't bad in its own right.  The empty calories in a chocolate bar are considered bad, while the same amount of sugar in a massive bowl of fruit, while possibly deceivingly high in calories, packs so much nutritional value that it outweighs the negatives.   Your body will also break down fruits very differently than processed stuff, which will lead to a lower spike in blood sugar and avoid the ugh feeling you mention.</p></div>		</li>
