			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool question. Satellites of various kinds have been used to map different types of Amazonian palm swamps over the years.  For example, palm swamps dominated by Mauritia flexuosa -- a super common species of tall palm -- have been mapped to varying degrees in tests using common satellite data like Landsat and radars.  But some of the new technologies in orbit, launched in the past 5+ years, may do the job even better.  I think some good options may be high spatial resolution imagery from some of the companies that provide/sell it, or even laser technology.  There are always projects to pursue in this area, and it usually starts with the need or application.</p></div>		</li>
