<p>Waves are really just pulses of energy and can pass through each other. </p>

<p>Like when the beams of light from two flashlights intersect but each continues on as if nothing happened.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as both. </p>
<p>Both are instances of waves passing through each other. </p>
<p>The voices seems different to us because sound waves spread and bounce around the room to make it echo and eventually turns it into white noise. The ocean waves don’t bounce off the shore so it doesn’t degenerate into a mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested, there's also a phenomenon called cross seas. It seems to illustrate  u/bob4apples points about waves continuing even though the wind changed and they eventually run into other waves. Apparently the angle of the waves coming together is very dangerous for boats.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that something magical happens as a result of the waves coming together, but that there is no direction for the vessel to turn to avoid being broadsided. Boats are designed to cut through waves by pointing straight at them. One good wave to the side of the vessel and it can be upside down.</p></div>		</li>
