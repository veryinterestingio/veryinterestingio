			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there is some form of stunted learning in it. Usually a month or so into using a keyboard it operates great, eventually the &quot;learning&quot; feature goes too far and starts to think one of your more common mistakes is intentional. Especially if you use the backspace key to fix it instead of the built in word list.</p>

<p>I had to completely turn off my autocorrect after it learned way too many bad habits from repeated entry mistakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for AI and machine learning is because the sheer amount of data to process. There's too many &quot;common&quot; error to be kept updated by a small developer team. It's actually much more effort to make and maintain that list than to make an AI based on known algorithms.</p></div>		</li>
