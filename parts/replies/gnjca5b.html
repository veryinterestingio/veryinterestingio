			<div class="markdown"><p>It has affected it in two ways. First is higher order taxa, things like “genera” or “families.” There, in combination with the common approach in the field to only name clades (ancestors and all their descendants), it’s had important results: we no longer divide flowering plants into monocots and dicots since dicots aren’t a clade. It’s also led to new discoveries, like the “whippo” (whale plus hippo) clade. It’s also had a major effect with species delimitation. It has been common (still is) to look at morphological characters to help distinguish whether two populations are two or one species, but that misses traits that might have the effect of separating species that are harder for us to see. With access to genetics, it’s easier to tell them apart: one cool example is in a series of butterflies in Costa Rica (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/101/41/14812" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/101/41/14812" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/content/101/41/14812</a></a>). We might be able to merge oversplit species, too: here’s a cool case of stick insects where the male and female were in different species until found in the same clutch -- the same could be done with DNA (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/science/leaf-stick-insects-phyllium-asekiense.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/science/leaf-stick-insects-phyllium-asekiense.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/science/leaf-stick-insects-phyllium-asekiense.html</a></a>). [btw, I have “genera” and “families” in air quotes because there might be a bigger revolution coming that topples Linnean rank-based taxonomy altogether: <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/phylocode-system-for-naming-organisms/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/phylocode-system-for-naming-organisms/" target="_blank">https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/science/phylocode-system-for-naming-organisms/</a></a>]</p></div>		</li>
