			<div class="markdown"><p>So true, especially your point about chikungunya. I actually just submitted a paper on a vaccine we developed against another alphavirus and one reviewer shit all over the fact that with so few diagnosed cases (disregarding the fact that they typically occur in remote regions without access to modern medicine to properly diagnose) that the pursuit of further development was not realistic. Wanted me to put in the paper something like &quot;hey, we did this and it was very effective, but you shouldn't care about it because this will never make it to market&quot;. </p>
<p>Of course we submitted to a neglected tropical disease journal. Like, I get their point, but damn, unless you have points of scientific merit, having your major issues with the paper be feasibility in go-to-market is totally asinine in peer-review.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After living in the Caribbean for school for a few years and seeing friends get Zika and chikungunya, I hope you told that reviewer to shove it. Thank you for doing what you do. Your work is so, so important. Please keep doing it! No disease should be &quot;neglected&quot; just because not enough people are affected by it. Or can make those at the top money.</p>
<p>Edit: I can't spell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I really want to give a very sassy response to them and then let my advisor trim it to something respectful. It was just perplexing how they totally missed/misinterpreted the larger features of the study. They were really angry that we showed cross-protection against CHIKV and another co-circulating alpha since it would never be used off label and other CHIKV vaccines are being made. </p>
<p>It was like &quot;dude, we aren't claiming that. We're showing that vaccines against alpha's should be tested against those in the same antigenic complex because vaccination against the target virus could provide benefits against the other ones.&quot; Idk who they were, but someone shit in their cheerios the morning they reviewed it evidently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the fuck? That's so unprofessional! Reviews should be on scientific merit not business applicability! And especially for the journal of neglected tropical diseases!!! I hope you were able to respond to the editor as that review being irrelevant. 20 bucks says it was a rival lab trying to block your publication.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my best logical guess. Provided no other comments on the manuscript for the methods/results/etc. I don't see how you can so blatantly review it for non-scientific merits and not have a competing issue when all other reviewers had minor corrections and no major experiments they wanted redone/done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huge. That's one of the reasons we were able to respond quickly. Due to the similarities, and all the research on SARS CoV1, groups working on SARS-CoV-1 were able to pivot quickly and apply their learnings to this one!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Didn't realize the two are related. I remember traveling internationally during SARS-CoV-1 and quarantining, but don't remember any more drastic measures... did it just kind of disappear!?</p></div>		</li>
