			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure most eyes are not diffraction limited, so resolution isn't really a factor.</p>
<p>I've read that it has a lot more to do with control of light entering the eye, and having a greater depth of field in the plane that you have your other eye on to better judge distance..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm speaking generally based on the mechanics of the situation and the (dis) advantages to each compared to other devices which act similarly.  Diffraction limits are likely a non - player due to the size and packing of rods and cones in the retina and fovea of the eye in question.  It would be interesting to see a retinal map of horizontal pupil eyes (sheep, goats) compared to vertical creatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely certain I follow.</p>
<p>The mechanics here are largely down to focusing (which improves with a narrower aperture, both by acting as a pinhole camera to account for imperfections or focal length limitations of the lens, and by increasing depth of field even if the lens is working optimally) vs light gathering area. The focusing aspect is the opposite of diffraction limited systems like an antenna.</p>
<p>The vertical slit pupils retain resolution in the horizontal direction both of the subject, and of other things around the animal, whilst sacrificing resolution in the vertical direction in exchange for light.</p>
<p>The factor I was mentioning is unrelated to either, and simply the fact that eyelids can quickly close across a slit to limit light input without impacting imaging ability. This allows the animal even more (and faster) control over light in variable light conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would it be anything like increasing your Field of Vision (FOV) in a video game? For example, I play Titanfall 2 at max FOV settings because of the high degree of movement in-game. I noticed afterwards that I was able to calculate distances much more fluidly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unsure. Increasing the total lens (the curved clear bit) diameter/angle will do this, and I believe it is related to the geometry of the eyes of something like a goat, but the pupil diameter doesn't really change field of view on its own. Different pupil geometries are probably related to limitations of lens diameter somehow though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what you said, the larger the pupil the worse the focus. I would guess that cat vision would be fuzzy vertically and sharp horizontally. The opposite of what the person you responded to said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the end, the pupil slit is related to the edge and motion detection system in the brain, as well as the retinal pattern and cell packing to have angular sensitivity.  The V/H argument optically implies resolution.  The payoff is in image interpretation within the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about spherical pupils like with humans? Is it a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none type of deal?</p>
<p>I know at least that since our eyes are pointing forwards, we can gauge distance better much like predators. But with round pupils, it means that we can't gauge altitude as well as felines, for example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, trade offs.  Circular means horizontal and vertical resolution is the same.  Detection, plus positioning.</p></div>		</li>
