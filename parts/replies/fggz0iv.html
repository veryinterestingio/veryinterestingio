			<div class="markdown"><p>Master student food physics here. I don't know if emulsifiers have anything to do with this phenomenon, but I do know that there are some factual inconsistencies in this story.</p>
<p>Let's start with an emulsion. An emulsion is a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids - for example oil and water. One is called the continuous phase, the other the dispersed phase. Milk for example is an emulsion of fat droplets in water, where the fat is the dispersed phase and water the continuous phase. You could also have an emulsion of water droplets (dispersed phase) in a continuous oil phase.</p>
<p>Any mixture of fat and water will show phase separation, because they are immiscible and it is thermodynamically unfavourable to have a large interfacial area (the area where oil and water touch) between the two liquids. So what you see when you mix pure oil with pure water is that the two phases will separate very quickly, also if you homogenize the mixture. There is an interfacial tension between the two liquids that causes this. Luckily, nature found a way to prevent this phenomenon by using a molecule that can 'link' the two phases. Those molecules are called emulsifiers and they <strong>lower</strong> (not increase) the <strong>interfacial</strong> tension. Proteins, for example, can be emulsifiers. Also synthetic molecules can be emulsifiers, as long as they interact with both the oil and the water. Milk does not show phase separation (at least, very slow that is) because the proteins in milk keep this from happening. The very small fat droplets are covered by proteins, so that droplets repel each other, cannot merge, and therefore do not form one big fat layer on top of your milk. However, if you let your milk stand for a year (without any evaporation of the water) you will see a fat layer forming. Mixtures of immiscible fluids are always an unfavourable state to be in, so they will eventually show phase separation.</p>
<p>Just like normal milk, chocolate milk has emulsifiers in there to 'stabilize' the interface between the water and chocolate fat droplets. Liquid chocolate milk usually does not contain additional emulsifiers, because skimmed milk is enriched with cocoa fat and the free proteins in the milk will act as emulsifiers for the added fat. Chocolate milk powder, such as Nesquick, usually contains lecithin, which is a molecule in egg yolk. You also use this emulsifier when making mayonnaise. The ingredients for mayonnaise are: water, oil, vinegar and egg yolks. Without the egg yolks, your mayonnaise will very rapidly show two separate layers: one oil layer and one water and vinegar layer.</p>
<p>Emulsifiers are only needed in very very low quantities, so therefore they do not significantly influence the taste of products. It is also not true that they taste fatty per se. Proteins can be emulsifiers and they are usually not perceived to be fatty.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> the reason for the phenomenon you describe, I don't know. It could have to do with the higher viscosity of chocolate milk or a lot of other things. But it is not directly caused by the use of different emulsifiers.</p>
<p>TL;DR: emulsifiers link immiscible liquids and can make them appear miscible for a long time, while every mixture of oil and water will separate eventually. Milk contains proteins that act as emulsifier and chocolate milk contains those proteins and/or lecithin, a compound in egg yolk. Emulsifiers are not the cause of the phenomenon that OP describes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've looked at a few ingredient lists, and I'm convinced the entire emulsifier thing is a red herring. Emulsifiers help fats and water mix, but the chocolate in chocolate milk is cocoa powder, which is virtually fat free. Most store-bought chocolate milk contains thickeners like guar gum and/or carrageenan, but not any emulsifiers. The thickeners act as stabilizers to help keep the cocoa particles from settling out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nesquik has Soy Lecithin, an emulsifier, as its third ingredient. In this case it's being used as a wetting agent to make it easier to mix in the power without getting lumps. If anything, its power as a wetting agent would make the cookies get soggy faster.</p>
<p>In short, I think the answer is stabilizers in the chocolate milk increase its viscosity and slow absorption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what everyone is missing here is osmosis, the flow of water towards higher molarities. Chocolate milk has more dissolved stuff in it than regular milk, and so it is harder for water to leave it. Sure, the cookie is not semi permiable, but once a fatty layer is added to the cookie/milk interface, it becomes semi permiable in a similar way to our cell membranes, allowing only for largely water to pass through, leading to osmosis. We also have capillary action forcing liquid into the cookie, but this is slowed down by osmotic pressure.</p>
<p>We could test this hypothesis by replacing the cookie with something like cardstock, letting it absorb from both chocolate milk and regular milk, then check the content of the liquid soaked up on the cardstock. If any component is found in lesser concentration here than in the milk, I believe this would prove the interface is semi permiable, and indeed osmosis must be occuring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just looked up the ingredients of Promised Land Chocolate Milk (the only brand I could think of off hand) and it contains both guar gum and carrageenan. </p>
<p>Your point that there are emulsifiers in chocolate milk mixes for home use still stands. But maybe it's the differences between specific emulsifiers that accounts for the oreo phenomenon. I dunno about lecithin, but guar gum and carrageenan are also thickeners.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lecithin is an emusifier, which helps fats and water mix. It is of no use in keeping cocoa powder from settling out since cocoa powder is virtually fat free. It is added to powdered mix because it is a wetting agent and helps prevent lumps from forming when you mix the powder in. It's not needed in commecially mixed milk because they use mechanical agigation (i.e. a blender) to get the lumps out.</p></div>		</li>
