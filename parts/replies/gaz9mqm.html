			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all animals can synthesize enough vitamin D to meet the body's needs, and need dietary supplementation. For example, New World monkeys cannot convert D2 to D3, unlike humans, who can. So vitamin D gets too be a vitamin. Conversely, most animals can make their own vitamin C, except for primates and guinea pigs (and a few others). So we don't take vitamin C off the list, either.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure I've heard vitamin D can be considered a hormone instead of a vitamin? </p>
<p>Also, can I ask you if dogs can synthesise their own vitamin D? I thought they could thought their fur but now I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are rather special in regards to vitD3.</p>
<p>Loads of animals can't do every step of the UV started synthesis.</p>
<p>And 'sunlight' is also a weird nutrient.</p>
<p>Vitamin C is also considered a vitamin, even though for example dogs can produce it on their own accord. Humans are rather rare in having lost the ability to create vitamin C.</p>
<p>Plus in many areas of the planet the bodies own vitamin D production through sunlight is not enough to cover the minimum needs.</p>
<p>So basically whethet it's a vitamin by classical definitions depends on where you live.</p></div>		</li>
