<p>And since that is simply an article to make the actual scientific study more accessible here is the original study which supports the claims in the article. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18454136/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18454136/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean... that’s kinda a distinction without a difference for a layman. Obviously scientifically it’s important but functionally speaking for the purposes of everyday conversation it’s not a meaningful difference. </p>
<p>That person is saying the number of cells is constant. The article says they die and are replaced at a constant pace and the total number is always more or less the same. </p>
<p>Which is functionally the same thing for a basic conversation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These articles have to do with cell turnover.  Fat cells absolutely multiply beyond replacing dying ones, but that's only after filling them up fully.  Each cell can hold a lot of fat before it needs to divide to make room for more.</p>
<p>Even the abstract of the article you linked states that fat cells remain constant even after weight loss, but does not address the number of fat cells after a marked weight gain.  u/RhynoD explanation isn't that far off.  I like the first paragraph, but not so much the second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They just said that you don’t lose those cells. So you won’t lose them even if you have the perfect weight long enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number of fat cells that a person has throughout their life remains (approximately) the same. &quot;Approximately&quot; because fat cells <em>do</em> die and are replaced constantly. However the number of fat cells someone has <em>doesn't</em> increase when they gain weight. The existing number of fat cells simply adapt to hold more lipids.
