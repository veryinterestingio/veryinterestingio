			<div class="markdown"><p>The seeds aren't actually that spicy. It's the white fleshy part inside called the pith that contains most of the capsaicin. Coincidentally a lot of people also remove that when they de-seed peppers because which leads to this belief that the seeds are spicy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a couple guys that do eating contests with spicy foods. They &quot;train&quot; for the contests by adding more and more hot sauces to their foods over the span of a few weeks. Mind you, these are the kind of hot sauces that have names centered around how they burn your asshole, not like Cholula or something. After a while, &quot;normal&quot; spicy food just isn't spicy anymore, but I can't imagine what it does to their digestion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering most people were grinding their food up with bowl and pestle at some point, they were probably looking for anything that would give flavor. I could imagine understanding that most foods are bland as hell. It wasn’t until we started farming specific flavor profiles would you have found the necessary “fresh” food that people enjoy today to be sufficiently sweet, salty, savory. So if you found something interesting, probably just ground it up with your boring standard foods.</p></div>		</li>
