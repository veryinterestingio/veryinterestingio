			<div class="markdown"><p>The assumption that life on other planets would somehow be unrecognizable or go against our existing models has always baffled me. Have people not taken basic chemistry? The building blocks only go together so many different ways. for instance, All life is going to be made of carbon, or theoretically silicon but there are certain factors to that that make it unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's an assumption that science for school children only scratches the surface and, in truth, mysteries abound and that 'out there' <em>anything</em> is possible if we only have the wit to imagine it.</p>
<p>In some ways that's true, of course, but in many others the universe is pretty prosaic and already well understood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a lot of people genuinely don't know this basic chemistry and have ideas about there being common and stable elements that we somehow don't already know about. It's a fun thing to do in sci fi with semi-magical new elements that for some reason don't exist on Earth, but that's just fiction and it's weird that people get mixed up about this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't there be other common elements that we don't even know about though? Which connect in ways we can't even imagine?</p></div>		</li>
