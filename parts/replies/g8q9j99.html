			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been an &quot;up later, awake later&quot; person. the amount of sleep seems to matter less. 10 hours of sleep and awake at 6 am? I feel like tired and shitty all day. 6 hours of sleep and up at 8 or 9? I feel great</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in the short term i think regularity comes out on top- if you're used to getting 8 hours of sleep and waking up at 9, you'll feel shitty if you get 8 hours but wake up at 6, and you'll feel fine if you get 6 and get up at 9. but in the long term, if you keep doing that, the sleep deprivation will win out and you'll just feel like shit all the time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, sleep cycles are not a set 90 minutes. They start shorter and get longer throughout the night, so that your first sleep cycle is <em>around</em> 40 minutes. It's only your last, longest cycle for the night that gets up to 90 minutes or so.</p></div>		</li>
