</blockquote>
<p>That's not exactly true in that the exact same molecules will not be present in two centuries. The CO2 absorption timescale by the ocean is only about 7 years, but at the same time the ocean releases CO2 on roughly the timescale; for each CO2 molecule absorbed, you'll almost always get another emitted.</p>
<p>So while it is true to say that 2 excess CO2 molecules now will result in 1 excess CO2 molecule in 200 years time, it's incorrect to suggest that it's the same molecule.</p>
<p>EDIT: not sure why this got downvoted...<a href="https://skepticalscience.com/co2-residence-time.htm" target="_blank">here's a post from skepticalscience</a> explaining the difference between CO2 residence time and CO2 perturbation time, and why the two should not be confused.</p></div>		</li>
