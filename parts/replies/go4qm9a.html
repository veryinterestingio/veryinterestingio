			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually if you look at the graph gestational age at birth the pattern is clear. If a baby is born closer to full term birth weight is incredibly predictive of adult weight. If a baby is premature it doesn’t. </p>
<p>Height is basically a flat indicator with a very small slope. So it’s NOT predictive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we need confidence intervals to tell us how predictive it really is. They take means to show the underlying relationship, but don't really show how strong that relationship is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did you reach a different conclusion for height?</p>
<p>For both height and weight, births in the 39-41 or 42-44 week period have good correlation to adult height and weight, respectively. Premature births are less indicative for both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't there been studies on low birth weight/fetal growth restriction associated with being overweight/obese later in life? I remember seeing a study on women who were pregnant during WWII and experienced starvation had children with higher rates of diabetes and hypertension when they grew up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This is the basis for the Barker Hypothesis. Check out the Dutch Famine for results of a truly depressing, but real-world “experiment” that occurred during WWII due to German occupation</p>
<p>Edit: Oops, I see in your comment this is the study you were already referring to, sorry! But it is called the Dutch Famine Study and describes the results you mentioned.</p></div>		</li>
