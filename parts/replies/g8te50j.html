			<div class="markdown"><p>I also learned, from trying to grow potatoes in Central FL in the summer.. that if the average ambient outdoor temp is above, say 70ยบ F, potatoes do not need to create &quot;energy stores&quot; (ie, the plants will be luscious but you'll get no potatoes).    Potatoes grow best with the average outside ambient temp is 50-60ยบ F</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my potato plants looked beautiful, lush, green, super healthy.   when they &quot;matured&quot; and were supposed to have tubers.... all our tubers were tiny, like the size of marbles....  i did some googling and found an &quot;expert&quot; who said that I tried to grow potatoes when it was too warm outside... if the outside temp never drops below 70-75, you won't get tubers</p></div>		</li>
