			<div class="markdown"><p>Both lucky and unlucky. It's unlucky for the obvious reason--that the most common strain is also the most lethal. It's lucky, though, in the sense that a vaccine can target that most common strain and thereby mitigate both the single most common and the single most deadly strain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the expected path for a new virus like this.  Killing the host tends to limit the spread of viruses, so over time they tend to evolve to be less lethal.  A virus that's particularly infectious could easily become more lethal, but between social distancing and self-quarantines for the sick, we should expect to see new strains either being less fatal, or not to spread very far.</p>
<p>Except in outliers, the most common strain if a virus will always be the most lethal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but no. The reason SARS fizzled in the early 2000s is because it was a much deadlier strain: people got sick and got sick <em>quickly</em> and were almost immediately placed into isolation, so they werent able to infect others. We have the opposite with the SARS-COV-2 virus, where it's not as deadly and takes longer before victims show symptoms, so they're more likely to spread it. It doesn't kill as much, but its much more pervasive, so you end up losing out in pure numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read something a few months ago along these lines.  Basically, that as time goes on and Covid mutates, the less deadly strains will become the dominant strain.  That's why the seasonal flu isn't all that deadly.  At least, that's how I understood the article.  I don't have any sources to link to this comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I meant is that it could have mutated to keep its long asymptomatic phase, and THEN be more deadly, which would be way worse</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it’s more likely to be one of the least lethal.</p>
<p>If you die from a disease it’s much harder to spread it compared to if you live and continue breathing on things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but if the most common variant of a virus that has spread enough to cause a pandemic is the most lethal variant of that virus, that seems worse than if it was not the most lethal. Going by this post, most affected people are affected by the most lethal version, which I would not call lucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the mutation.   I believe currently with COVID some of the strains are a bit resistance to plasma Transferred from someone with antibodies, but they all are close enough genetically that they are all affected by the same antibodies, so for now, Yes.</p>
<p>Think of it this way,  Viruses and cells interact kind of like a bunch of keys and locks.  A virus has evolved with the key for the locks in the cells in a bats lungs. But that lock doesn't protect anything important, so it doesn't kill the bats, and it just incubates in them.    Since bats and humans are both mammals, the locks in their lung's cells are similar, so eventually the virus evolves with a key that works on bats AND humans, and it jumps to humans.</p>
<p>Now humans lung cells are a little different, that lock in our cells actually protects something important, so the virus kills the cell, and causes pneumonia and other problems that we see with COVID.  So it spreads around and we get an epidemic.</p>
<p>Now eventually, our immune system will produce antibodies, with all of the keys its ever used on other things, and if none of those work, it will make a bunch that just have random keys, until eventually one is made that unlocks a critical part of the virus and kills it, then well get better, and our body will add that antibody's key to its list for next time.</p>
<p>Now that virus is also evolving, if we have antibodies that kill it, then eventually it might evolve so that lock ISNT critical, and so our old antibodies wont work on it anymore and well have another outbreak.  But, in that case, its very likely that the key that killed it the first time is at least similar to the last one, so our immune system should still kill it quicker.</p>
<p>Think of a virus mutating as it makes a copy of itself, with one part different, usually this will kill the virus, but every million or so tries its something that doesnt kill it, and you get a new strain.  So as long as the virus mutates, but keeps that same critical lock the same, our antibodies will work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is also why it is not good to just keep the vulnerable people safe and let the virus &quot;burn thru&quot; the young and healthy population until we get herd immunity. The more people that get it, the more chances the virus has to mutate into something different enough that we have to start over again, or even something more fatal.</p></div>		</li>
