			<div class="markdown"><p>If genetics are interesting to you, you might want to consider reading a book called The Selfish Gene. It's a reasonably digestible account of how genes and genetic inheritance work, especially within the context of evolution, and the theories behind it actually revolutionised society's understanding of evolution only a few decades ago. </p>
<p>Also if you do delve into this subject, bear in mind that it's <em>really</em> complicated. It's also best understood with aid of diagrams, as all things are, so you might want to find a textbook or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The self gene is a great book but is one Dawkins heavier works. If you’re interested I’d recommend you start with River out of Eden it’s much more accessible.  Work your way up to the God Delusion. Honestly these books should be required reading in schools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I’ll check it out :) I realized reading what you said (and also a lot in the last year) that I understand so much less than I thought about genetics and chromosomes and stuff. Fascinating! (I’m not studying it thankfully, just general curiosity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know they don’t have the reputation for this but TikTok and even InstaGram have a lot of these types of content from people who just talk you through stuff like genetics questions, and often even do lives about them so you can ask questions directly, which is kinda similar. </p>
<p>TikTok I think especially gets a bad rep but, despite relying on the ALGORITHM vs subscribing specifically to certain communities, it’s a lot like Reddit where the default is kinda crazy but once you tailor it a bit, gets to some really amazing content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd google high school/college biology textbooks then find pirate copies of one of those that sounds relevant. Textbooks tend to be written for the express purpose of teaching complicated things in simple, easy to digest ways and they're exactly the kind of level you'd probably want after a question on ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not <em>entirely</em>. Crossing over isn't fully random - it happens preferentially in certain places and close genes tend to cross over together. It's possible that if crossing over puts 10% of grandma's chromosome onto the one you get, then crossing over after that could get rid of all 10% in the grandchild, giving them a chromosome with no grandma genes. However, crossing over does dramatically increase the number of generations needed to be statistically likely to have got down to 0 grandma genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say crossing over do you mean genetic recombination? I seem to remember that from when I took biology 10 years ago and it sounds like what you're describing (as far as I recall). I also remember something about independent assortment but I think I'm gonna have to dig up my old textbooks and brush the cobwebs off. </p>
<p>Funny you mention grandma because what sparked this conversation is my MIL has died and I was trying to explain to my son how he carries some of her genetic information and so in a way she lives on through him. Then he asked if this way she was going to live forever and I said yes but honestly had no idea (I just had to say something positive, he's only 4 and not ready to face the fact that when you're gone, you're gone).</p></div>		</li>
