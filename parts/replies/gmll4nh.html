			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one next to  one of my nipples. When I was a kid I took a bath with my cousin, and she had one in the same spot. when I pointed it out to her, she said her mom also had one in the same spot. When taking care of our grandmother in her old age and bathing her, I noticed she also has one in the same spot. It seems like some sort of inherited birthmark, if that's even a thing.</p></div>		</li>
