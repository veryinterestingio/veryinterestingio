<p><strong>Technical-</strong>We have a limited amount of extension agents in the rural areas where 93% of the farmers live. Farmers are uninformed about proper management of fertilizers, application rates, timing, placement and sources, and therefore, soil is not replenished to fulfill the nutrient requirement of the crop. They do not perform soil tests to determine nutrient availability in the soil before planting, which would help them make better decisions regarding fertilization.</p>
<p><strong>Regulations-</strong>The fertilizer market is not widely open in Haiti. Even if you had money you won’t be able to buy whatever you want. Most of the fertilizers on the market are subsidized by the government, not necessarily the one you want/need. For example, the Cul-de-Sac plain, a few miles away from the Capital city, Port-au-Prince,  has a High extractable K (247 ppm) but farmers are still using mixed fertilizers such as 12-24-24, 16-10-20, or 20-7-25, which is not good for the plants. So, they need to buy more single fertilizers such as Triple Superphosphate to provide the phosphorus needed by the plants.</p></div>		</li>
