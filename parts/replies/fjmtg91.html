<p>If you can grasp a bowl of water freezing then you should have no problem grasping this. Both sources of water are in motion. The waterfall is just a really long, vertically positioned bowl. The &quot;falling&quot; aspect is just a matter of perspective. We are all falling around a star afterall. </p>
<p>Maybe watch some timelapse footage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, let's talk about why</p>
<p>I don't want to refute your first claim entirely because I feel too confused by what you're trying to say to know if it's wrong or not. But let's agree that as the molocules lose energy they phase shift to ice and because each part of the river remains mostly still relative to the areas next to it despite the fact the whole thing is moving small sections will start to freeze first and gradually form larger chunks.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that solids aren't totally still atomically there is an exact moment when they transition to a solid and it's called a phase shift. But now we get to the truly egregious part of your comment. &quot;As they cool down then whiz by at a slower and slower speed on average&quot;. Atomic energy (speed) is separate from gravity. Gravity pulls all things at the same speed. Consider the fact that dropping an icicle it will fall at the same speed as a drop of water. If one small section (say a droplet) froze on its own then it would just fall down because it has no support. An entire column of water would have to freeze at once to somehow support itself and that is pretty much impossible since it's all moving and the water at the top and the bottom would carry away the bits of ice that form. Most important waterfalls aren't solid columns of water. The falling droplets aren't all connected except in really short drops, so there's no way a connected column could form, even if it was freezing at some crazy rate.</p>
<p>Read the other guy's comment he's right. Frozen waterfalls form like oversized icicles where water freezes on the underside of the overhang and water flowing over it slowly freezes as well and it accumulates until it either breaks, the whole river at the top freezes and it has no more water running over it, or it connects with the bottom and creates what looks like what you've described.</p></div>		</li>
