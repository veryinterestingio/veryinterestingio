<p>Seeing as most cars won’t get air bags and seat belts anyway, why don’t we focus on treating ppl in car accidents so that the rest of us don’t have to refrain from driving forever?</p>
<p>It’s obv a weak analogy but you get what I’m saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it but if you have $1 Billion to spend you can prevent a lot more deaths by putting airbags and seat belts in 50% of cars than you can by spending it researching better trauma treatments. If you have $1 Billion dollars to spend you can save a lot more lives with a vaccine that you give to 50% of the population than you could save by improving ventilators and drug regimens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This analogy isn’t quite robust: plenty of treatments are there to  stop the virus from getting serious. It’s more like retrofitting airbags and seatbelts:reducing harm from the moment of collision.</p></div>		</li>
