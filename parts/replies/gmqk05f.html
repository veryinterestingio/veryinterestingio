			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a scar on the base of my thumb from smacking a table with a metal edge. It was like a scrape and maybe bled just a little. The other day I cut my self with a chef's knife on the tip of my sideways thumb and it cut a few mm into my thumbnail. It's healing without leaving a scar, but was definitely deeper. </p>
<p>Is the skin on the tips of the finger just very thick? How come I have scars from cutting a box open and just lightly scratching my forearm with the boxcutter where it only bled a little?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an ELI5 but look up healing by primary and secondary intention. It’s likely why your cut with a knife healed better than your scrape, even though it was deeper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/jundeedle said, shallow metal edge ripped through your skin plowing it, whereas deep knife cut was created by a really really sharp object and is precise, thus easier to heal since not much is pulverized, rather separated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The skin on your palm and on the bottom of the foot has a thicker surface layer. We call it “thick skin” in anatomy. Most of your body is covered in “thin skin”.  You can tell the difference by feeling and looking at your palm vs. the back of your hand, which is “thin” This just means that the epithelial (surface) layer has a much different volume/thickness to its cell population. As with everything in medicine there is more to it, but this is the simple explanation. </p>
<p>If your [insert mechanism of injury here] doesn’t make it through that surface layer, there will not even be blood, which should give you an idea as to how easy it is to pierce that first layer. Even a very small scrape will cause a little bleeding, but a scrape to the palm takes more to get at it. </p>
<p>It is within that second layer, the dermis, where scar tissue will develop.  The injury needs to be large enough to be visibly noticeable. A little scrape may very well produce a scar tissue arrangement as it heals, but it wouldn’t be large enough to be visible.</p></div>		</li>
