			<div class="markdown"><p>Just went through this. Father died to Covid, and the morning we got the news, it was just a gut punch. </p>
<p>I think a normal death to old age, it feels like a story that ended on the final chapter. A sudden death is like that book slamming shut mid-chapter, and it's totally shocking.</p>
<p>We all just sat around the living room dazed. My mom even made dinner. Saying it was going to be a normal day. I sat out, and had a beer. Brother went for a drive. We even went for a drive around downtown (Savannah) just to get fresh air. Oddly normal conversation.</p>
<p>I just remember my mom not wanting to update her social media because &quot;then it will be real&quot;.</p>
<p>It took weeks for it to feel real, and not some weird dream. I had to look at visual reminders, just to pinch myself.</p>
<p>The shock lasts for a LONG time. I still feel some of it 4 months later. Your mind can just blank stuff completely out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, I'm so so sorry for your loss. I hope that your family have been able to find comfort in each other.</p>
<p>Secondly, this is one of the most eloquent descriptions of death I have seen. Beautifully written.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>:/ The trauma of an unexpected death adds another surreal layer to grieving. Iâ€™m in Ireland where nearly the first thing that happens after you share the news is that neighbours &amp; friends randomly start dropping round meals &amp; food so that you donâ€™t have to worry about that aspect of your days ahead  - but, like your Mum, sometimes cooking a meal is good, something you can do as if your world was still a little bit normal. So sorry to hear about your Dad, will keep you &amp; your family in heart ðŸ’ž</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would expect a lot of this is denial, like really awful news is so bad that the brain protects itself by just refusing to accept it for quite a long while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>denial can be part of the shock. but its not always the case. when my Papa died, I wasnt in denial that he was dead, i was just so shocked that he was suddenly gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There's a difference between denial as in &quot;I don't believe you&quot;, and not yet accepted as in the difference between intellectual understanding vs visceral acceptance. The first is knowing what's happening, the second is when it &quot;sinks in&quot;. Denial isn't required for this to happen. This is a normal reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think denial <em>is</em> a normal reaction. When I've had terrible things happen the natural reaction is &quot;this isn't/can't be happening&quot;. You desperately want to go back to five minutes ago or yesterday or last week when it wasn't happening. I don't mean willful denial where you tell yourself a little story or ignore niggling things so you don't have to accept them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was this tv-show, where a police told a story about exactly that.</p>
<p>He told that they stopped a vehicle driving erratically, and after stopping it, they found a dead body in the trunk. The police explained that during the first, immediate seconds, he was just thinking that &quot;Oh, they have killed an animal and put it's body in the trunk&quot;, even though it was clear that it was a human body. He then explained that it is indeed way to protect one's psyche, by interpreting some shocking/traumatic thing in to a less traumatic thing, and then slowly altering that interpretation more towards the reality. Of course, in this case with experienced police officer, the mechanism only last for a few seconds, but depending on the person and circumstances it can last much longer.</p></div>		</li>
