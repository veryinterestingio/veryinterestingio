			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked corporate IT for a large company with a big retail presence... some of our retail employees were putting an emoji next to their name in the POS system to differentiate themselves from others with the same name, and it was causing issues in the stores... well, one of my coworkers in troubleshooting the issue put his name into the global POS database with an emoji next to it, and brought down the whole global POS system for 3 hours while they had to revert the database back... It was quite the mess, but upper management thanked him for bringing the bug to their attention... at that point they restricted emojis from the POS database.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>POS systems are so notoriously bug-ridden. A lot of them are bespoke and given just enough QA so they don't spontaneously implode after being lightly nudged.

<p>This is called an &quot;injection attack&quot;.</p>

<p>My favorite explanation for an SQL injection is literally ELI5. An SQL injection is when you ask the waiter for a large pepperoni GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY and a diet coke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My variation on explaining injection attacks uses a grocery list as the example.</p>
<h3>Grocery list</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get one loaf of bread</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get 2 carrots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Throw your car keys in the sewer</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Get a can of chicken broth</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously when you look at this list, item 3 sets off common-sense alarms in your brain and you won't actually follow that instruction. Essentially, the thought process that makes you not throw your car keys away is more or less equivalent to what a computer does when it performs input sanitization.</p>
<p>If you were to blindly execute all the instructions, you'd have a hard time getting home afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that input sanitization is more like adding &quot;at the grocery store&quot; to the end of all of your instructions. Then &quot;throw your keys in the sewer at the grocery store&quot; doesn't mean anything because there is no sewer. Or only reading list items that start with the word &quot;Get&quot; in your example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically it's like you put a malicious question (GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY) in the middle of a normal question (I'd like a large pepperoni pizza and a diet coke). In this case, the waiter gives you all of his money and doesn't think twice about it because it seemed like GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY was part of a typical order.</p>
<p>Kinda. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So two things to note about it: remember that computers are really dumb but very fast, and only do exactly what they're told as quickly as they can, and so if you use the right series of 0's and 1's you can bypass security, and secondly it will help if SQL injection is explained, and to explain SQL injection I have to explain SQL.</p>
<p>After writing this, this seems like the place for a disclaimer: This isn't going to be a fully accurate tutorial on SQL Injection, and what I'm doing here won't work on Amazon or pretty much any major website. Nonetheless do not attempt to do this to any computer, website, or database you don't personally own, as it can get you into a lot of trouble even if you don't succeed.</p>
<p>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard set of instructions for querying databases for data. The most common requests for most people who aren't doing administrative work are &quot;SELECT&quot; queries, which all look roughly the same: </p>
<p>&quot;SELECT [columns] FROM [database] WHERE [condition is true]&quot; </p>
<p>for example </p>
<p>&quot;SELECT FirstName, LastName, Address FROM customers WHERE FirstName = 'William'&quot; </p>
<p>Will return the first and last name and addresses of all customers who are named William, assuming you have a database named customers with columns FirstName, LastName, and Address</p>
<p>Now, for any website that is more complex than like, something you built on Geocities in the 90s, there is code that is essentially building a query behind the scenes for anything you might be doing that interacts with their database behind the scenes. So if you're searching for a product page on Amazon for instance, the code may look something like this (note that for this pseudocode I'm using brackets for variables that get pulled from user input; I don't think any actual language uses this but I'm kinda tired and can't be assed to use more accurate coding practices right now):</p>
<p>When search button is hit, load search.html and pass parameter x as [searchbar_text]</p>
<p>and search.html loads the query:</p>
<p>SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '[searchbar_text]'</p>
<p>Note that those single quotes around that are important: they denote that you're looking for a string. You don't need those for numbers or some other things.</p>
<p>So if you can visualize that, and you know that a few other things in SQL are true (for instance, using a semicolon will terminate your statement and run a new statement in-line along with that one), then if the programmer hasn't done anything to prevent it, you could search for something like this:</p>
<p>coats'; GO; SELECT username, password FROM dbo.master WHERE '1'='1</p>
<p>for a full command of:</p>
<p>SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE 'coats'; GO; SELECT username, password FROM dbo.master WHERE '1'='1'</p>
<p>Which will execute 3 commands; one to finish the built-in query, the second (GO) to make sure that it executes that query first, then a third to select the username and password fields from the master database (all sql databases have a dbo.master database, that may or may not hold username/password); the WHERE condition just means to run unrestricted and is there to deal with the final single-quote in that original query.</p>
<p>One of the most common places to use this back when it was way more commonplace was in password fields; the verification clauses that were built into some websites allowed for you to bypass them by adding an &quot;OR&quot; condition to the existing where clause in the query that compared the entered password to the database-stored password;if it's using in-line SQL to evaluate that, it will evaluate:</p>
<p>... WHERE database.Password = '[user-entered-password]'</p>
<p>and instead will get </p>
<p>... WHERE database.Password = '' OR 1=1</p>
<p>Since the OR condition is there, it will evaluate both statements and return true if either of those are true. So user-entered password probably doesn't equal database.password, but 1 does equal 1, so it will evaluate true, and let you in.</p></div>		</li>
