			<div class="markdown"><p>I also want to point out that in tennis many times the player will ask the main referee if he agree with the call. They aren't allowed to answer but sometimes a non reply or facial gesture says, &quot;you should challenge that call.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the idea of tradition when it comes to sports. Baseball is an example of this. Instant replay deciding the true call of a discrepancy could really be used every play to get every call right. We've had a strike zone tracking technology that gets displayed on tv. Yet the MLB still hires umpires and they make the calls. I'd even say 99% of the time they're right. So the tradition factor negates the 1% of the time umpires are wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not too long ago, in a Gaelic football match the Referee overruled HawkEye. I'm not sure how common this is, as I don't watch the sport often I just happened to be watching that particular game, but yes sometimes a machine is just going to get it wrong because it got confused. Humans have millions of years of Object Recognition development behind them whereas computers have about 50. So while we're still in a state where a human can overrule the machine, it doesn't really make sense to do away with the humans. </p>
<p>I'd say the error rate of machines right now is probably actually higher than humans, but because we only really use the machine's judgement when our own is uncertain, 1) there's a lower chance of anyone actually paying attention when the error takes place and 2) even if it is wrong, we've decided at that point to trust it so it doesn't really matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tradition is huge, and part of that tradition is what makes it appealing to grass roots games.</p>
<p>There is something about you playing the same game your Grandad did when he was your age using the same methods and mechanisms, and your grandchild doing the same.</p>
<p>That same game then being played on TV by people earning millions gives us all a bit of a dream, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually home plate umps are <em>really</em> terrible.  I would love to replace them with an automated system for balls and strikes.  Humans can call foul tips, HBP and calls at the plate (all subject to traditional review).</p></div>		</li>
