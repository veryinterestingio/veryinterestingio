			<div class="markdown"><p>It would cost more to orient the station in such a way to make use of the minuscule thrust than it does to periodically correct orbital degradation/wandering due to airlock decompression. The station is low enough that they have to make fairly frequent corrections anyways.</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Edit:</em> You all should read replies before replying yourself.</p>
<p>I do appreciate the answers, but you waste your time when you are the 20th person to say they still experience atmospheric drag and avoid debris.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The airlock can be depressurized through pipes(maybe not the actual space station, but in theory) that can be directed however without reorientating the station. It would probably be a waste of money, I couldn't say, I'm just pointing out that venting via the door is not the only solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They wouldn't need to orient the station first. They aren't venting by opening the door. or something uncontrollable like that. They'd just twist the tiny vent nozzle in their direction of spin, like a car air vents flaps, and vent thru that to reduce their spin. But it's all moot since there's so little energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the weight of the station this is likely negligible. The gas is also moving at the same speed (inertial frame) as the station.  Additionally that assumes it'd be in the direction they wanted. </p>
<p>A kid farting on a boat railing being used for navigational/steering purposes might be a decent analogy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So it's roughly 1 KFAOB of directional energy. Why didn't anyone mention this earlier. Thanks, Teripid!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true of any propellant used to create thrust from any object. I'm not disputing your conclusion, but this isn't one of the arguments that leads to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It it negligible - There are 13 kg of air being vented.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas will expand to fill a room but you have to remember its made up of individual particles that have a particular trajectory, until they bounce off something amd change trajectory. Normally they're bouncing off the walls and eachother quite often in a decent pressure area. The pumps can be thought more as scooping out the air, creating area where there is less gas, opening it up for more particles to fill since there is less matter for them to run into now. As the pressure decreases as gas is removed, the motion of the gas particles becomes less like a uniform body because they have less stuff to bounce off of.</p>
<p>This means that every single atom has to move towards the pump and then the pump has to be powerful enough to scoop out all the particles and not allow any of them to reenter the vacuum chamber to be a true vacuum. Like u/Inductionroar said, its just not worth it, both in waiting time and vacuum pump power.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an issue in ultra high vacuums but not an issue at 1/10 or even 1/1000 of the sea level atmospheric density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a space-ship brings a tank of air to the middle of nowhere within the solar system, let's say L5 just behind Earth, and carefully released it, the gravity from the atmosphere would pull it all-together and form a ball. Most of the air would be in the middle with diminishing density the further away you got.  </p>
<p>Sadly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind" target="_blank">solar winds</a> (particle shot out from the sun) would strip away matter from the air-ball until it was all gone.  Doing this is DEEP deep space without a sun... it might sustain it's form. But then there are energy/power needs.</p>
<p>You'd also need a planet-sized amount of air to have 1atm at the center. You'd have better luck if you placed a big chunk of lead at the center. Or, say, a space-station. But you're looking at creating an artificial planet. The scale is just impracticable. </p>
<p>It gets more interesting if you think about encapsulating the whole thing in a multi-walled bubble. Anything thick/strong enough to keep air in at any amount of pressure is rather heavy or large (and therefore heavy), but a space-bubble habitat is NOT outside the realm of feasible if new materials like graphene pan out (and the production capabilities to make it in at scale).  Note that there'd still be losses and you'd need a top-off canister from earth every now and then.</p></div>		</li>
