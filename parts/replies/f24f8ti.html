			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. You do not build muscle by using it, you only gain muscle when you exhaust, rip and tear your current muscle, and when your body goes to repair it, it repairs it slightly better than it was before. If you are not straining yourself and it doesn't burn, then you're not tearing muscle fiber and you're literally just wasting your time and energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I cycled for the majority of my exercise,  used to work out my arms and shoulders by doing 10 pull ups after every time I used the bathroom.  When I started, I could probably only do 15-20 total at a time, but after doing that as my daily routine (50-70 a day spaced out) for a month. I could do about 40 in a row. I was never straining myself too hard or getting sore from it, but I definitely improved my strength and stamina for the activity. I think spacing exercise out over the day is still beneficial if you aren't someone who works out all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t have to be straining yourself or making it burn, but the idea of pushing yourself is right. </p>
<p>Progressive overload is what makes you stronger and gain more muscle. The gradual increase in intensity. 100 in one go is more intense than 100 spaced out, which leads to more “gains” lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t call it a waste of time, not everyone who works out is trying to bulk up. You can perform exercise that tones the muscles and adds density instead of tearing down and building up. Identify what you are trying to achieve then choose the appropriate approach</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Waste&quot; is definitely the wrong word. You're still burning calories with that movement. It may be that you're just not performing the right function to achieve your goal. Whatever that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're still burning calories to perform the pushup though. The 100 spread out would burn fewer calories over all and not help you gain much size. 100 at once could burn slightly more calories at the time due fatigue in your larger muscles so you use smaller stabilizers more. However when the body goes to repair the muscles from 100 at once it will definitely use more calories than if damage wasnt done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but you can’t do 100 push-ups straight without progressively working up to be able to do 100 push ups straight. So if you work up to actually be able to do 100 push ups straight, your muscle endurance and strength would be so high that doing 10 push ups in one setting would feel like you were doing nothing and have little effect on your muscles. </p>
<p>Using this theory, I’m not sure OPs question can even be achieved </p>
<p>To a person that has not been working out, I think this could be tested as they would actually see gains from 10 push ups spread over a day OR 100 straight push ups. However, they would not be able to do 100 straight! I think this would require testing on 2 people simultaneously while measuring the effects vs themselves and see what the biggest % change is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let’s talk about it on an even playing ground:</p>
<p>This person can do 100 push ups in one go. For this person, which would lead to more progress? 100 in one go or 100 spaced out?</p>
<p>100 in one go would lead to more progress being that the person is pushing themself more than doing 100 spaced out</p></div>		</li>
