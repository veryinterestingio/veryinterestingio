<p>Up to 300 million years ago, the bacteria and fungus on earth didn't eat wood and wood-like plants.  So they just kinda piled up, and piled up, and piled up... but didn't rot and release most of their carbon into the air.</p>
<p>Most of the coal ever mined by human beings comes from that period, because during that period - tree-like things were around but tree-rotting microbes weren't - coal formed at hundreds of times the rate it does today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so are there microbes that can break down lignin?<br />
Back in college a couple of my professors made a big to-do about fungi being able to use enzymes to break the bonds of lignin and ultimately consume the sub-components for energy (and a discussion of coal deposits largely existing because of the time before fungi evolved the enzymes to break the bonds in lignin).<br />
The way they taught it was as if ONLY fungi had developed the required enzymes and metabolic processes to break up the lignin. They stressed that one of the big engineering challenges of our generation is the development of a process to mimic this breakdown for more efficient biofuel production.<br />
If there are some microbes that can do this too, I feel like I was cheated (though I guess there's a chance that this wasn't discovered/confirmed back when I was in school).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly should have just asked if mycelium actually does break down and pulverize bedrock over long periods of time. I must have learned that as a child and just never really questioned it, I wasnt sure if that was actually true or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally soil as opposed to sand or silt has a large amount of organic materials from fallen plant and animal pieces. Which a majority comes from carbon captured from the air during photosynthesis. So you can say, at least in part, that dirt comes from the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic answer thanks! One thing I would still like to know is whether or not the majority of the formation of soil on earth is due to abiotic or biotic processes? Or is it more evenly distributed ? Or difficult to tell?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soil, and the processes that form it, are diverse so a single answer is not really meaningful. I.e. the answer will be different depending on the type of soil (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USDA_soil_taxonomy#Soil_Orders" target="_blank">USDA taxonomy of soil types</a>) and will be different within a particular soil depending on which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_horizon" target="_blank">horizon</a> you're asking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends if you're going to count the organic matter in dirt. The loam is certainly organic. So are you asking about the sand and clay?</p></div>		</li>
