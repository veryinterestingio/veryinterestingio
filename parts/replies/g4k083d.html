			<div class="markdown"><p>Another trick is to coil your pointer finger in with a tiny hole in the middle, and you can use that to have a better effect to squinting while looking through it. I can actually use it to see the lettering on farther objects. Not enough to make it out, but it‚Äôs cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can try this with a piece of paper too (which is why its the pinhole effect). If you take your glasses off, take a piece of paper or  cardboard and poke a really small hole through it. Hold it up and look through it and things will be more in focus. Smaller the hole, the better the focus will be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the memories! I've worn glasses since 7yo. My optometrist would bust me for the squinting trick at my appointments. I was a child, so no logic or physics or biology lessons. I just knew it helped me see better and did it out of habit, but that would also skew his test results, so he had to watch for me squinting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. Me too. My parents didn't discover my truly horrible vision until fourth grade because I was always among the last in line to take the eye test and, by the time they got to me, I had memorized the chart based on my classmates' answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I‚Äôm in bed with no contacts/glasses and my wife tries to show me something on her phone, I have to close one eye and hold it about one to two inches from my open eye.  Can‚Äôt have both eyes open at two inches away or I can‚Äôt see it.  What‚Äôs with that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mostly unrelated to your eyes focusing. Depending on if you are far sighted or near sighted your eye can actually focus and view objects up close. Thats why you can see it holding it close to your face without glasses. But you have to close one eye due to parallax. Parallax is the difference between what our left and right eyes see. It's what gives us depth perception. When you hold a phone a few inches from your face your eyes are seeing two widely different images/angles and it confuses the brain making it difficult to focus on the object.</p>
<p>Put your index finger on your nose and try and look at it with both eyes open. You should go cross eyed and see a double image of your finger. Thats a lot of strain on your eyes and makes it not very easy to read small text when seeing double like that. Now do the same experiment with one eye closed and just focus on your finger with the open eye. A lot less strain and no more double image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I just tried the finger to the nose thing. My eyes crossed, but I did not see double. I basically saw a full tip of my nose and finger. Close one eye, and I got half an image. Or more of a side view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess you are a moderately high myope and that 2&quot; (because of the myopia) is your near focal length or where things are clearest at near (w/o your glasses)
When you read your eyes do 3 things simultaneously:
1) they accommodate (the muscles reshape the crystalline lens in the eye to create a lot of magnification so reading is possible)
2) your pupils constrict and
3) your eyes converge... looking far they are parallel to each other and looking near the cross a bit. </p>
<p>But, If you look too close (2&quot; is too close), they cross A LOT forcing you to close 1 eye to avoid the image doubling.
Hope that was 'clear' enough
