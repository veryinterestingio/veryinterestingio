			<div class="markdown"><p>So, possibly silly question, but if the heat that is normally circulated to the North Atlantic/Europe  is disrupted, it's still going somewhere, right?  So wouldn't the global average temperature be the same?  </p>
<p>Kinda like if I have two rooms (one with a heater) with an open door, the temps equalize at say, 75Â°.  But if I close the door, one room night be 100^ while the other is fifty.  So the average doesn't change, you just have higher/lower local extremes.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm missing something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes and no. The Younger Dryas was intensified in the North Atlantic so in many ways it's better to think of it as a regional event than a global event, which is a significant part of the reason why ocean circulation in the North Atlantic has been implicated. However, the climate system is extremely complex and interconnected so whilst changes in ocean circulation directly only redistributes heat, it can trigger other feedbacks that do alter global temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool, thanks.  I think sometimes I find it hard to get questions answered because I think people assume I'm a denier, when that's far from the case.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to understand how the things I have been taught integrate together.</p>
<p>For example, everyone says that eating meat is bad for the environment, but I have had a hard time finding numbers to back that up.  I could certainly see how grain fed meat is bad, but there is lots of land which would is not really cultivable without adding massive amounts of water, which in turn affects the climate.  Would it be fair to say that dry land ranching is actually a better use of arid areas than trying to irrigate it and turn it into farmland?</p>
<p>Also, I could see how planting trees is very helpful for temporary sequestration of carbon on a scale of 1-2 centuries, but on a thousand year time scale isn't that just kicking the can down the curb because those trees will eventually die and burn or rot and the carbon they contain will be released?  So we should really be trying to find a way to store carbon inorganically, like diamonds it something?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought there were indications of the Gulf Stream slowing significantly, probably due to the freshwater coming from melting Greenland reducing the sinking of the northern end of the Stream. (I.e. there's a switch turning off the Gulf Stream, which will seriously affect south-to-north heat transfer.)<br />
Is that incorrect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing available today on the scale of the absolutely <em>ginormous</em> Lake Aggasiz/Ojibway, which was held back by glacial ice and therefore prone to abrupt and rapid release of huge volumes of freshwater.  Look at Fig. 1 in this paper: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08408-6" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08408-6" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08408-6</a></a></p>
<p>While melting on Greenland and elsewhere is indeed increasing, there's nothing approaching draining a lake that big.  We're prodding the system in different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe what happened (my partner had this in their project for Paleoclimatology class) was that as the ice sheet receded from near the Great lakes region, it left a large lake of melted fresh water. As they receded further, the melt water that had built up into a huge lake found a new path to the ocean  that led it straight to a critical region of the Atlantic for oceanic temperature stability. More specifically, the part where warm waters sink down to the deeper levels of the ocean. These parts are critical for smaller scale temp changes because they remove tons of heat from the atmosphere. The huge influx of fresh water (which is less dense than salt water) in this particular location completely screwed up the cycling in this one critical area, and it affected the entire world.</p>
<p>At least, this was the theory he presented - there are a number of other, older papers that have other theories</p></div>		</li>
