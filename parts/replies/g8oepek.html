			<div class="markdown"><p>Softeners, especially liquid ones but also dryer sheets, leave a coating/residue on fabrics which can act to protect the fibers (good for clothing). But with towels, this coating interferes with absorption. So to a certain extent, line-dried towels actually are more absorbant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep, never add fabric softener when you launder your towels, it reduces their ability to aborb</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My theory is that it feels clean. The stiffness and dryness is interpreted as &quot;no dirt or oils left in the garment&quot;.</p>
<p>Line dry is the way. Tumbler dried is OK. Softener is an absolute no-go, feels super fake and oily and weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air movement is probably the most important. Even a small breeze will remove moisture -even with &quot;100%&quot; humidity.</p>
<p>Temp and humidity is less important than air movement in my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best smell ever is clothes that are dried under a hot sun. They smell incredibly crisp and clean and warm, it's amazing.</p>
<p>Second best is clothes ironed with an old fashioned charcoal iron. Somehow they smell really similar, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I live in the wrong part of the world for this.  It is very humid here so clothes have to be left out for a long time to dry.  By then, so much pollen has collected on them that any thoughts of taking a big whiff will send me straight to the medicine cabinet.</p></div>		</li>
