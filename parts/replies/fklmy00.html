			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as you described, I get this too and I’m curious if frequently waking up to numb arms (once or twice a week) adds up over time. Or if it needs to be one long period of pressure. </p>
<p>I’m a musician and anytime I wake up and can’t move my arms it’s seriously distressing to my very purpose as a human. I practice a lot so there’s plenty of fine motor action between these occasions but it still worries me that 20 years on I won’t be able to play because I can’t sleep on my back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would ask a doctor about thoracic outlet syndrome. I didn't take care of that and ended up with a musician's injury that slowed my growth as a musician quite a bit. </p>
<p>TOS is where the muscles in the neck and shoulder pinch off nerves and can cause numbness, loss of coordination, and pain in the arms and hands.</p>
<p>Treatment can rarely be surgery but most often is stretches, postural corrections, and other lifestyle things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to Dave Mustaine (Singer and Guitarist for Megadeth, original founder of Metallica). I never saw where he stated it was due to drugs or anything but he had to completely re-learn how to play guitar.  Pretty interesting.  <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/dave_mustaine_how_i_recovered_from_my_hand_injury_after_doctors_told_me_id_never_play_guitar_again.html" target="_blank">https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/dave_mustaine_how_i_recovered_from_my_hand_injury_after_doctors_told_me_id_never_play_guitar_again.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He passed out one night with his arm hanging over the back of a chair. Had to get surgery to be able to play again. </p>
<p>Knowing dave, probably a mix of alcohol and speedballs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I saw this question, this was my first thought. He has an entire chapter on it in his autobiography - he was in rehab at the time, and fell asleep draped over the back of a chair. Complicating things, was the orderlies at rehab thinking his panic and lack of arm were drug-related hysteria. They told him he'd never play again - he fought long and hard to get his hand back to the level it needs to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People keep mentioning this &quot;falling asleep draped over the back of a chair&quot; and I'm having a really hard time understanding and picturing what y'all mean. </p>
<p>Someone have a picture or can draw what the position might look like?</p></div>		</li>
