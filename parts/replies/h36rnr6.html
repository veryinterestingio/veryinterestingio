			<div class="markdown"><p>May I also add to both of these comments - yup, the phone connects to the strongest BTS, and also a few weaker ones, just so the transition from one BTS to the other appears seemless, when you get out of the range of the strongest one, you're not connecting to another one, you're already connected and it's just being selected as the active one</p></div>		</li>
