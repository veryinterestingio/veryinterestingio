			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting threshold. Where do you draw the line? Lately I follow the viewpoint of only eating meat that was hunted, from one that lived a normal life beforehand. I feel this is natural concept, it's hard to judge eating something based on its intelligence in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know where you draw the line and in my instance its arbitrary. I love bacon and eat pork but I know many pigs are are probably smarter than a lot of those dumb yappy dogs and I wouldn't eat one of those.</p>
<p>I guess its just easier to forgo octopus because if Im somewhere thats offering a good grilled octopus there are probably a lot of other things on the menu I can find equally as enjoyable. </p>
<p>I love the idea of eating meat thats only been hunted though and have been trying harder recently to know the sources of the meat i'm eating.</p>
<p>TLDR: I have no good reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean.... a French Mastiff might only live 5 years. Doesn't mean i'm going to start eating dog. </p>
<p>I'm not trying to convert anyone. I just made an arbitrary cut off in my brain that I'll stay away from octopus. Lots of other really good food out there. I wont miss it too much.</p></div>		</li>
