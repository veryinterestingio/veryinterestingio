			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a kitchen honer, it works on the scissor too (although I've only tried with a ceramic honer). Just hone only in the direction of the other blade, then cut with the scissor a few times (it will crunch at first). Actual sharpening is indeed much harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that using right-handed scissors (the vast majority) in your left hand will also increase the risk of slide mode, as using them in the wrong hand pushes the blades apart horizontally instead of pushing them together, and making it more likely the tear won't be against the blade.</p>
<p>Source: am lefty who learned at 25 years old that actually most of the scissors in the world don't in fact suck, but that I was using them wrong</p>
<p>Edit: apparently I need to work on my reading comprehension- I thought OP was talking about when the scissors misfire and slip past the paper instead of cutting. My bad</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inferring by your use of the words “risk” and “suck”, am I correct to think that you don’t love slide mode? I find that interesting, as slide mode is like my Holy Grail. Also, what else sucks about being a lefty? I’m a righty raising a lefty child.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get left-handed scissors and vertical spiral-bound notebooks. Left-handed scissors are quite a bit more comfortable to use, and normal notebooks will have you writing on top of the middle binding which can get painful and awful. The vertical notebooks also make you a bit more interesting in school for bonus points, but they really are just way better to use than normal notebooks.</p>
<p>Also, pens are better than pencils because pencils will rub off onto your hand after like 30 seconds of writing. Unless they specifically like pencils over pens, invest in some decent pens. Doesn't have to be $40 each, but it should be better than the standard office 25 pack.</p>
<p>There's other left-handed stuff you can get as well but those in particular are the best and most worth it for me.</p>
<p>Edit: After reading u/ataraxiary's comment, I want to add a few extra points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Left handed scissors are based a bit on how the handle is shaped, but the blades are what's important. With right-handed scissors in the right hand, you're able to see the exact edge on what you're cutting because the top blade is on the right side. However, with right-handed scissors in the left hand, you can't actually see what you're cutting along because it's blocked by the blade. Proper left-handed scissors have this reversed so that you can see what edge you're cutting along while holding it with your left hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those desks with arm rests are awful because they're designed for right-handed people. Nothing you can really do about that but they seem to veeery slightly be going out of style, which is cool (they're small and suck anyways)</p>
</li>
<li>As said in their other comment, much of the entire world is designed around being right-handed. Again, not a whole lot that you can get around that, but it'll just be something you'll have to live with. I'm a lefty, but right-(hand/eye/etc) dominant on other things like guns, bats, etc just as a result of having to live with it. It's worth researching other things that you can get left-handed versions of - I know when I was in elementary school my mom managed to get me a left-handed pencil sharpener. If you used your right hand like everyone else, it went with the blade and didn't sharpen. I remember people always did a double-take when they used that, haha.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the commenter you asked, but I am a lefty. I am also confused by their wording - I love slide mode. Regardless, they are correct that you don't get that awesome slide using right-handed scissors in the left hand, you have to find proper lefty scissors.</p>
<p>And in case you don't know - real left handed scissors have nothing to do the shape of the handle and there is no such thing as ambidextrous scissors - it's all about the blades. Do your kid a favor and get them some proper scissors when they are old enough for school. Spending decades thinking you are inept because you can't cut a straight line sucks. </p>
<p>The only other real thing I wish i could change about my childhood is having someone who could teach me to do stuff properly left handed. Learning to write from right-handed people was frustrating and I still have terrible form that causes my hands to cramp if I go for very long. Also: sports. In elementary school, people tried to show me how to do things like swing a bat by just saying &quot;do it like me, but backwards!&quot; It was awful, I was awful, and as a result I have avoided sporting situations my whole life because it's always so awkward and I feel like I am using the wrong hand no matter what I do and at a certain point I think those reflexes are never going to happen. </p>
<p>Finally there are a million tools that are designed for right handed people. Safety switch placement, labels, ergonomics - lots of things. It effects everything from the stupid can opener I just bought (grrr) to hardcore power tools. Most stuff it's just irritating, but some things - like my circular saw - are crazy dangerous because you essentially have to use them with your non-dominant hand in charge and that often makes using the safety awkward, which is never good. I even went to a shooting range once and found out that guns can bite you in the butt too (though at least there are left and ambidextrous options available). Most of these probably won't come up until your kid is practically an adult, but I think it's good to be aware that they should approach dangerous tools with an extra helping of caution.</p>
<p>I have spent my whole life finding all kinds of ways in which I am not actually clumsy or accident prone, tons of stuff just isn't made for me. I can't do a lot about it, but it makes me feel a little better to know there's an actual reason and I'm not just crazy.</p>
<p>edit - I left out those stupid desks that are everywhere in high school and college. ungggghhhh. I guess you can't do much about that, but screw schools that don't have enough left-handed desks and screw right-handed people who take them when they didn't need them. Grrr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my edit- I misunderstood what slide mode was haha.</p>
<p>But yes, lots of inconveniences for lefties that you wouldn't think about! Writing can be a pain as you have to push the pen in front of you instead of dragging it along, which if you have to apply.pressure can be tiring... As well as the ink smudging your hand as you go across. My FAVOURITE pen is the Zebra Sarasa 0.5 gel pen- it's free-flowing so minimal pressure required, but quick-drying so no smudging! I buy 24 at a time haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>your language makes me wonder - are you referring to when the material slips between the blades instead of cutting? This is initially what I thought, too, but OP is referring to cutting by pushing the scissors forward without chopping continuously.</p></div>		</li>
