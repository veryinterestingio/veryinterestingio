			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a submarine is a rigid structure, the internal pressure doesnâ€™t continually climb as you dive. This pressure differential is why they have to be built so strongly and why failure at depth is so violent and deadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your squishy body resist the pressure of the deep by breathing pressurized gas and letting your insides be at the same pressure as your outsides. A submarine resists that pressure with a giant steel hull, so it doesn't need high pressure inside.</p></div>		</li>
