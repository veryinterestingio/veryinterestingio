			<div class="markdown"><p>And indeed if you're talking about something like a C130, on things that arent runways at all.  I've taken off in the cargo bay of a c130 from a large grass field, before.  When australia used to still have carribous, those things could take off from an unprepared paddock full of mud, just about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to that the fact that in the design and costs decision making process... commercial airlines care about how to get as much money as possible out of every dollar so there is a lot more care into the efficiency of a lower wing and being able to maintain lift with lower output from the engines.</p>
<p>As for military... well they will strap as much horsepower onto those puppies as tax payers are willing to fork over. ^which ^is ^a ^lot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not about range it is about performance. There are military designed aircraft for those types of operations for cost saving others for high performance. Comment is in regards to OP questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn’t really answer the question though. As spend-happy the government is, there would’ve been a good reason to design it opposite from how it’s commercially made, unless you’re saying that down swept wings are less efficient than up swept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, they technically are with regards to takeoff efficiency. But the main reasons I’ve always heard given are that military planes are used on poor runways more often and having a suspended load means they are able to be hastily packed with less input from a loadmaster with regards to balance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well bear in mind the very odd oxymoron that is military procurement. &quot;Get it designed, tested, and built by a private but vetted and cleared vendor with a blank check budget, unless the federal budget is being reviewed or the head quartermaster is watching, then retrofit a civvie model&quot;</p>
<p>Its an odd dichotomy to see a military base's hangars. A mix of really awesome looking new stuff right next to a rebuilt 1990's era 737 with a radar mount strapped to the fuselage.</p>
<p>Don't get me started on the Navy...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Military cargo planes are desired to be very close to the ground for easy loading and unloading of extremely heavy cargo. So the whole plane is reconfigured to avoid banging the wings and engines into the ground.</p>
<p>also they are used sometimes on bad quality runways which may contain dirt and gravel, so again there is a desire to pull the engines up away from debris.   </p>
<p>commercial planes don't deal with that</p></div>		</li>
