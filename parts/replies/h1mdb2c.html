			<div class="markdown"><p>for myself and potentially OP, just to clarify, eventually that super slow physical degradation of plastics will turn them into their innocuous components right? Or will there be a point where no normal natural processes break it down, it remains super tiny plastic and it stops shrinking at a certain size. In which case humans would have to come up with some amazing filtration effort to get rid of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most basic polymers are repeating blocks of carbons with hydrogens hanging off the sides. They may break down in the forces and heat of oceanic environments to shorter carbon chains, but the carbon-carbon bond is pretty strong and the carbon-hydrogen bond about 4x stronger, and they require chemical (oceanic microbes can do it, oil has been seeping up from the ocean floor for millenia) rather than natural physical mechanisms to breakdown any further. Trouble is the amount and dispersion of today‚Äôs plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of both. The basic problem is that &quot;plastic&quot; isn't really a good term. It's just something we say that probably includes just about any solids we make out of hydrocarbons that isn't glass, wood, or metal. Epoxy resin and similar is used in fiberglass, which most of us wouldn't think of as &quot;plastic.&quot;</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds of groups of plastics and thousands of formulations, including which hardener or UV stabilizer is added. Plastic bags are made of multiple layers for strength, odor resistance, stretch... </p>
<p>So the short answer is yes, no, partially, and not applicable, depending on your question. </p>
<p>More properly, nature will eventually deal with it. One of the major reasons that plastics are an issue, unlike metals or glass, is that they float. They're all mostly inert, but if you smash a glass bottle in your yard, it'll either stay there and not do anything, sink into the ground like a rock, or eventually get ground down into smaller inert particles, or similar. </p>
<p>Plastic floats. Throw a plastic bag out there, and it'll be blown by the wind and shredded, end up in a ditch, get carried downstream during a flood, and eventually, end up in the ocean. There it might trap creatures who die, sink to the bottom and decompose, releasing the plastic back into the cycle. </p>
<p>Nature is full of waste materials. We have coal, largely because trees evolved a long time before anything could decompose lignin, the structural part of wood. Whale carcasses sink to the bottom, the flesh is eaten, and the bones themselves are silted over. Even land-based animal bones can last a long long time. None of this is an issue. </p>
<p>Plastic is an issue because it doesn't have a mechanism to be sequestered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Eventually</em> it's almost certain that something will evolve to eat all that plastic (there's a few things that can eat certain hydrocarbons already, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxworm#Biodegradation_of_plastic" target="_blank">waxworms and polyethylene</a>) ... but &quot;eventually&quot; is a real long time, as demonstrated by coal from trees that piled up before anything could eat them, as you mention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure if there is a plastic which never breaks down into harmless components, but this doesn't matter because the next best thing is plastic that breaks down on the order of hundred or thousands of years. Unfortunately we already have plenty of that, which means that you better start inventing or investing into the next big filtration technology.
At the moment we are not able to remove microplastic on a large enough scale to clean the oceans. The only reasonable chance we have, is to remove all the large parts before they break down further... Sad, but true üò≠</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeding the oceans with bacteria and plankton engineered to be able to attack a large number of different parts of plastic chains might help, particularly since some bacteria are able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilus" target="_blank">exchange genetic material with one another</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that for a lot of plastics photodegration is a far more potent method of degration, and as soon as the plastic is swallowed or ingested that degradation stops.</p>
<p>Photodegration is where light, normally sunlight, is the cause of the breaking down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation and I just wanted to add one clarification here because this is a common misconception that I see all the time. The term ‚Äúbiodegradable plastic‚Äù refers to the end of life of the material, meaning that it can be broken down by microbes in one or more specific environments (ocean, soil, landfill, etc). The term ‚Äúbioplastic‚Äù generally is used to refer to polymers made from bio-based materials. It‚Äôs totally possible to make conventional polymers (polyesters, polyethylene, etc) from bio based sources, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they will biodegrade. </p>
<p>TLDR: bioplastics =/= biodegradable plastics</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention even biodegradable doesn't have too much of a meaning. It's defined by being able to eventually be broken down by living organisms. There's no timeframe specified for biodegradable. Compostable does have a specified timeframe and therefore has much more value if a product has that label on it.</p></div>		</li>
