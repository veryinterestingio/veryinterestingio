			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I will use the Moderna numbers for the calculations as I had them handy. They had 30,000 people in the trial. Those people were divided evenly between 2 groups: 15,000 received placebo and 15,000 received the vaccine. Then those people went out and lived their lives. At the follow-up date at the end of November (about two months after the people got their second dose of vaccine or placebo), 185 out of the 15,000 who received placebo had gotten symptomatic COVID-19. In the vaccine group, 11 out of the 15,000 had gotten symptomatic COVID-19.</p>
<p>You can use these numbers to calculate vaccine efficacy (Moderna's has been quoted at 94.1%):</p>
<p>(185/15000)-(11/15000) divided by (185/15000)</p>
<p>aka risk in unvaccinated-risk in vaccinated/risk in unvaccinated</p>
<p>This will give you a 94.1% efficacy of preventing against COVID-19. This is a very impressive accomplishment in vaccine development. You will notice that the final efficacy number in the trial might vary a bit from this as time goes on and the number of those infected changes a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible that the efficacy is lower because most people in the placebo group were still quarantining and sterilizing effectively? Or does it kind of cancel out since the people in the non placebo group were also doing that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people have argued what you have described may have happened if the placebo recipients knew they got placebo and the vaccine recipients knew they got vaccine. The studies were blinded so the participants are not told which group they were in. Thus, it should be largely cancelled out since both groups would be doing the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were the people in the studies still using masks and social distancing? If this provides more exposure resistance, would the efficacy be adjusted for that? So maybe itâ€™s something like 70% with no mask?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If 10,000 study participants in a double blinded Phase 3 clinical trial study (neither researcher nor participant knows who gets what injected)-- 5,000 get vaccine, 5,000 get placebo. Over time as they go about normal life (masks or not, front-line worker or stay-at- homer, etc) how many people self-report COVID-19 like symptoms (they have a list) and then test positive for CoV-2?  After say a total of 100 participants report COVID-19 symptoms (clearly defined list) and also test + to detect CoV-2, the blinding is released to see who got vaccine and who got placebo. If 90 of the COVID-19 confirmed illnesses are in the Placebo and 10 are in the Vaccine group, that is about a 90% efficacy (effectiveness) of the vaccine in stopping COVID-19 disease. Hope this rough example helps. I agree its important to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other 9,900 participants will continue in the blinded study without knowing if they received placebo or vaccine. They continue to do this same procedure and reporting to in long-run increase strength of data. Side effects and long-term effects continue to be monitored as long as study participants remain in their groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question.  I am NOT one of the doctors, but here's some helpful info.  The efficacy rate is the <em>reduction in risk of virus contraction</em> made possible by the vaccine.</p>
<p>So, it's a bit more complex than your scenario, but still simple.  Let's take the same numbers.</p>
<p>Out of 1000 recipients, let's say 500 got the vaccine and 500 got a placebo, offering no immunity at all.  Then, let's say out of the placebo group 9 contracted the virus and out of the vaccine group only 1 got the virus.  In this scenario, the efficacy rate is 88.8%.</p>
<p>How?  The calculation is as follows.</p>
<p>(Unvaccinated Risk Rate - Vaccinated Risk Rate) / Unvaccinated Risk rate.</p>
<p>((9/500) - (1/500)) / (9/500) =</p>
<p>(.018 - .002) / .018 =</p>
<p>.016 / .018 = .888 (or 88.8%)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not to nit-pick but this isnt quite right. The efficacy data from the Moderna, Pfizer and Astrazeneca vaccines are based on &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;symptomatic&quot; infections, not infection generally. The data about infection generally is unclear, which makes it hard to tell whether the vaccines will &quot;just&quot; prevent severe COVID-19 or whether it also prevents infection generally, and as such, transmission</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in all fairness, isn't that quite good anyway? If people only got &quot;asymptomatic&quot; Covid, then we wouldnt need to lock the country down every time there was a spike in case numbers. To me it seems that being protected from the more severe version of Covid is good enough, if not almost exactly what we need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor nitpick on your comment from a few hours ago - the vaccine's efficacy isn't being reported off of &quot;severe&quot; COVID-19 development, just COVID-19 development. The vaccine reported 8 patients with COVID-19 7 days after the second dose versus 162 in the placebo group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not seen anything that says transmission will be stopped. Which makes it seem that everyone who gets the vaccine will just turn into asymptomatic super spreaders? How does this help? Am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But still... , can this percantage figure be transfered to a figure that describes the effectivity of the vaccine?</p>
<p>Like if the vaccine is approved, if you vaccinate 1000 people will 88,8% (sticking to your example) be &quot;protected&quot; from the virus but 12% are not? If not how can you calculate a more comprehensive figure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes in this case 11.8% would not produce an immune response after being vaccinated.</p></div>		</li>
