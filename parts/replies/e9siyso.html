			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fairly unscientific statement from Hawking. For example, &quot;overdue asteroid strikes&quot; is simply gambler's fallacy. Independent random events aren't made more likely by long dry streaks. </p>
<p>Furthermore, whether humanity survives the next century or turns the earth into a fireball by 2600 is in principle unpredictable, since those events depend on the future growth of knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think asteroid impacts are random. Lots of stuff happens in cycles : orbits, revolutions, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it has to do with the sun's location on the milky way disk. Some places are way more likely to produce an asteroid impact so it's sorta predictable on a giant timescale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fully agree. Iâ€™ll just add that we evolved on this planet at a point of rich biodiversity. We are about to make a world in which biodiversity is very low. Can we survive here with fewer species and a climate that may grow more inhospitable to us by the year? Will we have the technology to adapt our species to these changes? Or is this one of the reasons the universe I relatively quiet? </p></div>		</li>
