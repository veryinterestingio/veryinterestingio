			<div class="markdown"><p>Note, though, that only the consonants are safely established. The vowels are distributed according to a standard rule and Egyptologists are aware that a real ancient Egyptian would not have understood a word of their pseudo-Egyptian. Thus, we have <em>k-m-t</em> &quot;Earth&quot; and pronounce it <em>kemet</em> but for all we know it might as well have been <em>*Kumati,</em> or insert any other vowels that you like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. In some cases, like in many modern languages in the region (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.), the vowels are implied in the written language. In others, they are written. So there is a good bit of what we know that is still guesswork. The language is readable because that only requires an internally consistent set of rules to apply. To speak it, though, you need to know what sounds to apply to the text in the context of the text around it. As an example, in Arabic, you can pick out the meaning of words and know the vowels to use from reading a sentence and using context clues to know exactly which word a written group of consonants actually is. </p>
<p>Mch lk rdng hieroglyphics, you cn prbbl ndrstnd wht ths sntnc means frm the cntxt.</p>
<p>So, if you had our level of understanding of Hieroglyphics, but replaced the Hieroglyphics with English, that's sentence up there is a pretty okay illustration. You can clearly make out the meaning of my sentence without explicitly being given the vowels. If you tried to speak it to me, though, a lot of it would sound close, but wrong. I'd recognize it as an English type language and probably could figure out what you were trying to say. Same thing with ancient Egyptians. They'd likely understand that we were speaking their language, but not quite correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnâ€™t that vowel situation the same for ancient Hebrew (that the vowels are unwritten and largely guesswork)? Given that modern Hebrew is pretty closely connected to Arabic, do historians/linguists make any connection between ancient Egyptian and ancient Hebrew?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the Semitic languages have triliteral roots (which is what those consonant triplets are), and there are various rules for how you form vowel sounds around them, there's usually a base rule and then a ton of radicals that modify it and make lots of different cases.  It's also not limited to triliteral, either, there's also quadriliteral roots with 4, and, rarely, quinqueliteral roots with 5.</p></div>		</li>
