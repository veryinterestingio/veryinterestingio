			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because there are systems that create it (safely under water) when in operation.</p>
<p>But it can happen in air, and since that's usually not by design, that's usually a &quot;run or look for an humane end&quot; situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on many things. The most important is distance. The radiation reduces quickly (quadratically) with distance.</p>
<p>See e.g. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#Second_incident" target="_blank">second Demon Core incident</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh89h8FxNhQ" target="_blank">this fictionalized movie scene</a> based on it, showing one of the guys throwing the others pieces of chalk to mark where they were standing so they can determine how much radiation everyone got.</p>
<p>So, yeah, if I see Cherenkov, I'm still running.</p>
<p>Edit: Damn, now I'm on a YouTube binge of nuclear-related documentaries again.</p></div>		</li>
