<p>cheap to produce (also to recycle)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately these two statements work against each other. Plastic is so cheap to produce from raw material that actually recycling it is a waste of time and money. Even if you, the consumer, put your plastic in the recycling, and even if you city diligently makes sure it actually gets to a sorting facility (rather that being &quot;exported&quot; to SE asia where it will be dumped,) it might still end up in a landfill if it isn't deemed clean and high quality. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-11/documents/2017_facts_and_figures_fact_sheet_final.pdf" target="_blank">Less than 10% of plastic waste actually gets recycled.</a> </p>
<p>Compare that to an aluminum can. Aluminum can be recycled an infinite number of times, and the energy needed to produce a can from recycled material is only 8% of the energy needed to produce a new can. Not coincidentally, aluminum is the most recycled material on Earth. The average aluminum can is over 70% recycled material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely! Great write-up! </p>
<p>I could've clarified that it is in theory easy/cheap but while there are no taxes on producing new or incentives to recycle, new production always wins out due to cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, i assume you are talking plastics that come from fossil fuels. Plastics is a generic term for a bunch of materials that are... plastic as in they can be deformed and they retail that new shape under some conditions (does not mean plastics can't be elastic). They are easy to use in a molding process, are usually chemically inert and so on. We do have other than just plastics made from fossil fuels but so far.. there are problems getting all of the necessary properties, how hard/soft, what temperature range they can withstand, are they thermoplastic or not, can they be melted and molded indefinitely or do they degrade, can they resist UV, do they need to be degradable or not etc etc etc. It is hard to get all the properties right.</p>
<p>One example is PLA, which is most commonly used 3D printing material for FDM printers. It is made from glucose which is turned into lactic acid (its name Poly Lactic Acid comes from here), one H2O molecule is removed from the middle, which leaves two monomers behind. Fermentation or catalytic reactions can be used to do this. When they are heated, they monomers snap together end-to-end and they create a polymer plastic. The good properties is the moderate resistance to solvents, it doesn't degrade in water, can be endlessly remelted, is very environmentally safe, you could even consume it and it won't do a thing to you, just passes thru. The bad sides are softening above 60C, it has very little elasticity, while it is very hard it is also brittle and it degrades in sunlight.. It also is quite impossible to produce in the necessary quantities, we use corn husks etc biowaste to make it now but if it were to replace PET which is the #1 plastic at the moment.. we would have to grow a lot more plants where to extract the glucose. It is hard to replace ABS, PET, polypropylene and polycarbonates with anything.. Oil is too easy, nature has used a LOT of energy to make those hydrocarbon chains ready for us. You boil em, take what you want from the exact stage of what is essentially a fractional distillation column and you have the molecule you needed for your application. Doing it the other way is more a &quot;we made this molecule, can we use it anywhere?&quot;..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all outstanding, but I'd add that biopolymers are good at a few things, and have been used for over a century now for what they're good at.</p>
<p>Cellulose-based polymers like rayon have a solid place in the plastic pantheon.</p></div>		</li>
