			<div class="markdown"><p>Is “fuze” the American spelling of “fuse”? Do Americans use the same spelling for the current limiting devices in cars and buildings? What about “fusion” where things “fuse” together? Just curious really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So apparently they’re technically two different words. </p>
<p>The UK Ministry of Defence states (emphasis in original):</p>
<p>FUSE: Cord or tube for the transmission of flame or explosion usually consisting of cord or rope with gunpowder or high explosive spun into it. (The spelling FUZE may also be met for this term, but FUSE is the preferred spelling in this context.)[7]</p>
<p>FUZE: A device with explosive components designed to initiate a main charge. (The spelling FUSE may also be met for this term, but FUZE is the preferred spelling in this context.)[8]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm aware they arent...That is why I say the initiator &quot;arms the fuse (per se)&quot; remember, this is an ELI5, and I am unsure of how much of this I can actually say online. </p>
<p>I bet you're ammo, aren't you. Might explain why you cant see past your own caveman forehead or have any bit of critical thinking.</p></div>		</li>
