			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. You’re really smart. I take an SSRI. I remember before I did I was always in complete agony. I would spend hours at a time reliving the pain of learning my spouse had cheated on me. Life was just one big painful moment. And let’s say I were to lose my supply, I become a sarcastic jerk. Not centered on the pain of that relationship anymore as I am now in a healthy relationship. But I just become impatient and snippy. I think I’m a true SSRI success story. Life isn’t sunshine and rainbows, but it isn’t doom, gloom and pain anymore. What hormone is associated with the feeling when let’s say someone were to shove you, or insult you and you’re hot and bothered by it all afternoon? It definitely feels like a fight or flight type thing ( as though it’s something you can’t help ) but it’s very unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hard to pin down. If you're thinking about it a lot, and feel like a failure in that regard that's probably the ruminations associated with depression. The pathway associated with that is not known, but it is known that it's a very ancient serotonin-related mechanism to get animals out of situations where they continue to hurt themselves.</p>
<p>If you feel angry about it that's the amygdala and there isn't much of a simple answer there. I don't think cell signalling via hormones is used to mediate anger other than secondary stuff like adrenaline.</p>
<p>If you feel stressed that's the cortisol / seretonin systems at work, mediated by the amygdala.</p></div>		</li>
