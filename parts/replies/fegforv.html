			<div class="markdown"><p>Side question, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an alternative to selling stock to raise money for investing in a new venture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does this work? Because I thought investors own stock, not the company. Does the company just create new shares, and sell those?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say I'm a company and I want to invest in a venture (a new product for example) and it will cost $x which I don't have.</p>
<p>I have 3 ways of raising money:</p>
<p>1 - Borrow the money a bank (or rich person)</p>
<p>2 - Issue stock (i.e. Sell part of the company)</p>
<p>3 - Issue bonds</p>
<p>When a company goes public it typically doesn't sell 100% of all shares, it sells some and retains some.  and the initial owners get shares as well.  Then at a later point, it can sell more shares.  It can award shares to employees as a bonus. And it can buy back shares.</p>
<p>A company can't just endlessly create new stock and dilute its current shareholders ownership.  In some cases if it offers new shares it may first offer them to existing shareholders.  And not all stocks have the same voting rights.  It gest complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that’s what’s kind of confusing. If you found a company with say 3 people, and you split the company for example 60% 20% and 20%. Then if they go public, do they lose their stake in the company? How is determined what stake they lose and why would they want to lose their stake in the company to begin with? Shouldn’t the money from selling the shares go to those 3 people, who lose their stake in the company rather than to the company itself?</p></div>		</li>
