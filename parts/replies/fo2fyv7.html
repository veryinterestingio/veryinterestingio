			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? Do you dislike coffee, beer, and chocolate? Bitterness is an essential part of the flavor of the flavor of all of those. I can understand not liking things that are primarily bitter, but I think a lot of depth of flavor would be lost without bitterness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup for me. I can tolerate it but dark chocolate is my nemesis, coffee goes with sugar and bier, the whites ones are way better imo. The pain when as a child, you don't like chocolate cake and don't want to offend the hosts by not taking any dessert...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity do you tend to eat and drink a lot of sugary stuff? As somebody who really likes bitter like black coffee and dark chocolate the great thing is I'm not as strong to sweet stuff as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate bitter tastes. Milk chocolate is great, but coffee and beer are intolerable for me and I don't see the appeal of dark chocolate. No matter how much sugar and cream you put in coffee, none of it masks the extreme bitterness that clings to the tongue when you swallow. I'm from the south and never understood the obsession with sweet tea either, no amount of sugar covers the bitterness of tea. Sweet and bitter is still bitter. Eventually I learned that milk gets rid of the bitterness in tea so I can drink black tea now, but I still don't drink sweet tea since it's not served with milk or cream.</p></div>		</li>
