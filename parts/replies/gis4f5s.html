			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! Ford is the only US president and Vice President not elected to the office. He was the house minority leader, then was appointed by Nixon to replace Spiro (Nixon VP) based on the 25th amendment, and then replaced Nixon when he resigned!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ford was probably so hyped to be the VP and just kick back away from the buzz of congress. Then Nixon's cronies fucked up and he ended up in the most powerful seat in America. Must've really been a buzzkill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He had already told his wife that he would stay on in Congress just to try to recapture the House for Republicans in '74, then retire in '76.  Then, when he was nominated to be VP, he told his wife it would be &quot;a nice conclusion&quot; to his career.  </p>
<p>He absolutely had no expectations of becoming president.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gerald Ford had been in Congress since the late 1940s and probably felt fine staying there.  He was chosen to replace the disgraced, bribe-taking Vice-President Spiro Agnew because Ford was the least-controversial and most-honest person available for the job, and his Senate confirmation hearing showed that he had been in Congress for 3 decades but still had no money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ford replace VP Agnew well into the Watergate hearings. Justice dept had built a strong bribery case against Agnew and fast tracked it to force him to resign. The AG gave Agnew a very favorable plea deal just to get him out of office so he wouldn't be lined up for the presidency if Nixon was impeached, which seemed likely. Ford knew what was likely coming from the get go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 25th Amendment has four section. One of those sections (Section Four) is what to do if the President is unfit, which is why everyone is talking about it at present. However, another section (Section 2) is about how to replace a VP if the current one dies/resigns. Prior to the 25th Amendment, there was no legal way to replace a VP in the middle of a term.</p>
<p>EDIT: The 25th would also allow a VP who has replaced a dead or resigned President to appoint their own VP, such as when newly sworn in President Ford appointed Rockefeller as his VP. Prior to the 25th Amendment, the office of VP would remain vacant until the next election. Johnson did not have a VP when he replaced Kennedy. He only gained one when he won the 1964 election with Humphrey as his running mate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nixon was the same way. He wasn't doing anything new, he was just the first to get caught. Worse things were going on in his administration as well as his opponent's, no doubt.</p></div>		</li>
