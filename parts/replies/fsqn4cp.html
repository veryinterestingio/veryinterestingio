Several hypotheses involve additional objects, either as impactors that delivered rare earth elements to Earth or as passing objects that affected the Moon's orbit. I can't recall right now any idea that involves something as big as the Moon impactor, as these hypotheses usually involve bodies smaller than the Moon. </p>
<p>There is a formal and practical way to approach the 3-body problem. Mathematically it can be solved only in some very special cases, I think. In planetary science it is moot point, as there are always more bodies and effects to be considered. So for my purposes a robust solution using either analytical approximations or (now more frequently) numerical integrations would count as solution, even if it's not a true formal solution.</p></div>		</li>
