			<div class="markdown"><p>Like if everyone just acted normal and bought the normal amount of TP, everything would continue as normal.</p>
<p>But when someone panic buys a bunch of TP, then the person next to them goes “oh shit, maybe I should buy extra too”</p>
<p>Then ten people later, a person arrives and sees there’s no TP at the store, so they think “huh, better travel to X and grab some TP while I can”. And so on, this creates an artificial shortage, and spreads not unlike a virus until everyone’s doing it all over the world</p>
<p>The TP craze started in my country (Australia) but it made its way to the US pretty quickly. I don’t think they’ve stopped making TP though so eventually it should even out</p>
<p>Point is, there ARE some resources that will be affected with this crisis out of necessity, so shortages and panic are likely unavoidable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any readings you can suggest to further understand this process? It makes sense, but I couldn't explain this myself to others. I thank you for mentioning this. I've read several responses here and I realize there's a lot I have to learn, so hopefully I can help others in some way.</p></div>		</li>
