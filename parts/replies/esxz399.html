			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the center ceiling is best for cooling applications only. If used for heating it is one of the worst locations, because in order to throw the hot air down into the space  you require higher air velocities (louder) and you don't get a comfortable air mix. </p>
<p>For heating and cooling, they treat the outside perimeter as unoccupied space, used for mixing air. People sit within the occupied space which holds the average air temperature, away from the air movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the thermostat is always on a wall in “unoccupied space” at like standing height, not sitting height. Boooo</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That probably explains it.  We usually never run the heat here since it is pretty warm all year round.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the heat from the day at the windows will produce the mixture mentioned above.  The center colder air is vented in a way to disperse evenly across the room if positioned on the ceiling correctly.  In some instances if a building was not properly measured for static pressures a makeup air system will be installed bringing in outside (warmer air / colder air relative to which season of course) to bring the system under ideal pressures for a more controlled environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know... But every place I've lived in the midwest and the western part of the US that was built within the last 60 years or so has had registers near the windows.</p>
<p>My house has circulation vents in the ceiling in the bedrooms but they're not heating vents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I am in the southwest and I seem to notice the opposite lol.  My house is around 10 years old and doesn't have anything near the windows, but we also only use the heat a few days out of the year so it may be different.  </p>
<p>I always figured it was more centered in the room to allow the ceiling fans to blow the cold air around better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m in the north east and every house I’ve lived in has had the AC vents either in the ceiling in the middle of the room or top of the wall no where near windows, and heat vents no where near windows (assuming forced hot air.  Baseboard is on walls with and without windows)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it also depends on foundation type. Where we lived in Texas, all the vents were always in the ceiling because all of the houses were on poured pads and thus had no crawl space for AC ductwork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this if you notice whenever you walk into a large building you're blasted right away with cool or warm air. They do that to prevent the giant hole you just walked through from warming or cooling off the rest of the building.</p></div>		</li>
