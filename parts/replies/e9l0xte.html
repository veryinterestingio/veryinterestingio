			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the beer would need to be covered or the alcohol will evaporate. And you’re only talking about going from 5.2% alcohol to 7 or 8% alcohol, it’s not that impressive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can accelerate the separation with salt.</p>
<p>Salt doesn't dissolve in alcohol, so a classic method for cleaning bongs is pouring in some iso and salt and shaking. Because the salt doesn't dissolve, it remains crystalline and acts as an abrasive. Salt does, however, love the shit out of water, so if you use rubbing alcohol of a lower concentration (70% vs 99%), the salt will soak up the water in the solution and settle on the bottom in a thick slush of semi dissolved (and no longer abrasive) salt enveloped in a bubble of cloudy water.</p>
<p>At the concentration level of beer, I'd imagine using a whole lot of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're fighting diffusion and brownian motion here, and I do not believe that the alcohol will separate more quickly than it would diffuse back down.</p>
<p>Are you by any chance talking about dark liquors like rum or whisky? Those have a bunch of other crap (molasses and tannins, respectively) that may layer out.</p></div>		</li>
