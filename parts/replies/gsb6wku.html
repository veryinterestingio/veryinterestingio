			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual answer here: the genitals are covered in two types of skin. The outer skin is roughly the same as the skin over the rest of the body. The inner skin is mucosal like the inside of your mouth. When someone assigned male at birth is circumcised, the inner mucosal skin is exposed and generally experienced as the same as the rest of the outer skin. It's this difference between outer skin and mucosal skin that creates the contrast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that the correct term now? Is it offensive to say &quot;born male&quot;? I'm having a hard time keeping up with political correctness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an unfortunate conflation of sex and gender. You don't have a gender when you're born, as that's part of your identity. Born male is a statement about sex and is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that they're trying to erase the concept of biological sex altogether.<br />
They want there to only be &quot;gender&quot;.<br />
So instead of being &quot;of the male sex&quot; they are &quot;assigned the male gender&quot;, obfuscating the basis for the assignment.</p></div>		</li>
