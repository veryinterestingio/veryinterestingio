<p>It's a thing. It happens regularly under the right conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low carb diet (cut out all sugar and refined carbs)</li>
<li>Get extra Vitamin D3 and K2 (not K1) in your diet</li>
<li>Brush twice a day with a Fluoride toothpaste</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other factors, but those are the biggest ones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the thing... it DOES work!</p>
<p>I've seen it happen in my own mouth. A couple dental caries show up on the bitewing x-rays, dentist confirms them, says &quot;Let's watch them&quot;, a year later they're all healed up. </p>
<p>Dentist astonished, asks me what I did (because she doesn't see dental decay reverse very often). Told her I cut all sugar and carbs out of my diet. She says, &quot;yup, that would do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Remineralization is real. Most people aren't willing to change their diet to make it happen, so many people (understandably) think it is a myth...</p></div>		</li>
