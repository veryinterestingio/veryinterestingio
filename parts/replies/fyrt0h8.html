Just wanted to add that a difference of 1 atmosphere is not enough to blow your body up.</p>
<p>Sure, you can burst your lungs and eardrums, but you need an higher gradient of pressure to actually blow up (for example, one you can find in  deep diving equilibrium chambers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! And yeah, you are correct that we can't go kaplooie from one atmosphere. I wasn't sure about how the rate of decompression would affect the possibility of long-term survival if rescued, though, given some of what I've read regarding Soyuz 11.</p></div>		</li>
