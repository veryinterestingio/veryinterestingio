			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm under NDA, so I can't talk too much about it, but banking regulators would eat them alive if they didn't have off-site replication and  backups. In one case I'm familiar with, their DR data center was too close to the primary one and they were forced to move it hundreds of miles away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to work for a financial services firm, and every quarter I had to travel to a cave facility in Missouri and work a disaster recovery simulation. </p>
<p>The hackers would have to essentially be able to pull off Mission Impossible in order to get rid of student debt, and it's not like Biden's going to do it either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only barely pulled off... It was more like a Deus ex machina. There was no realistic way for it to be pulled off with the plot constraints but &gt;!yay Dark Army full of people willing to kill themselves at a moment's notice just because somehow manage to pull it off without leaving a trace!&lt;.</p>
<p>I loved Mr. Robot for the realistic tech portrayals (did you know they had actual hackers onsite pull off mock hacks in real-time????) and a plot that overall managed to close all loose threads, but it technical perfection is marred in my opinion by its leaning on some easy outs from a story telling perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having worked for a financial services firm, I can definitely confirm.</p>
<p>There are cloud backups, physical backups, and they probably have off-site backup processing facilities in caves somewhere so that they can continue to gouge you even in the event of an otherwise unimaginable disaster.</p></div>		</li>
