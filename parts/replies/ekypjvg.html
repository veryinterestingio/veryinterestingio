			<div class="markdown"><p>And in many animals evolution worked around the &quot;welp, knee structure is mostly sorted&quot; issue by slowly iterating on leg forms to very highly emphasize the ankle. While suddenly having a mutation that reverses an individuals knees in a precise way that lets them still walk may very well never happen, apparently variations between the lengths and muscle strengths of various leg and foot bones are a lot more frequent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet that if you let evolution run its cours for another million to billion years, then ankles might develop completely into something like backward facing knees and the actual kneel becomes stiff and degenerates into a single bone.</p>

<p>But the knee will never suddenly flip around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting this - lots of things in nature are super efficient and cool but a lot of things just happened because evolution made it that way due to a variety of different factors - not because itâ€™s necessarily the best possible outcome, but the good enoughest</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is progressive too, meaning it continually builds on itself.</p>
<p>Knees have been around since amphibians evolved. All vertebrate have the same basic structure. Spontaneously changing the entire structure of a critical joint in a limb is not something you;re going to see in a single mutation, which is why it hasnt happened/</p></div>		</li>
