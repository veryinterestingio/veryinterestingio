			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it probably has far more to do with how it was developed than what it may be able to handle.  Pfizer probably took the view to develop it to make sure it works, and chose to keep it extremely cold for that reason.  And it will take them some time to get out testing proving it can be kept warmer just fine.</p>
<p>However also consider volume here.  Pfizer is looking to produce this themselves through their supply chains, where as Moderna is absolutely not going to be able to produce this at volume themselves just because they are not big enough.  So Moderna wanted something that can transfer quickly to other suppliers where as Pfizer wants to just produce this mostly themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different packing of the mrna actually...we (Pfizer) use one tech they use another, we have the same tech Moderna uses and decided not to use it because the dose has to be higher (modernas is 3x what our dose is) as far as storage, you’re correct, we simply haven’t validated it at warmer temps yet, but early data says that our tech is good at -20 (even higher maybe)...it was more important to use to choose the method that enables us to get more doses from the same batch size especially since were using our distribution and storage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bang on! Pfizers supply chain and distribution network is mind-boggingly large and already accounted for in the vaccine development. Moderna will need a lot of help to get this out in a large scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Pfizer wanted to be first and be sure it worked to sell the most.</p>
<p>Moderns knew that they couldn’t supply enough vaccine, so there was no need to be first, second or third would do. However, a slight competitive  advantage (high storage temp, sicker patients) would ensure that they sold everything they could produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it’s a fail safe? But I’d be very surprised if Pfizer didn’t do -20 and 4C stability studies. That’s a huge difference in storage conditions and I doubt that was a blind spot for Pfizer.</p>
<p>-20C and 4C stability studies for drugs are very standard in industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This &quot;fat&quot; probably stands for liposomes encasing the RNA to facilitate its intake into cells. I would imagine that  being able to take RNAse and DMAse levels in the formulation to zero would critically affect stability.</p></div>		</li>
