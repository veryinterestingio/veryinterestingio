			<div class="markdown"><p>Half-cock was the 'accidental firing' safety. The fact most of them were single-action (you have to manually pull the hammer back each time you want to shoot, pulling only the trigger does nothing) was your 'active safety'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They wont fire with the trigger, but in the uncocked position, the hammer touched the firing pin, which touched the primer.  So if you dropped the gun and the hammer hit the floor, it would be like taking a hammer and a nail to a bullet, it can fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure they would. Due to the firing pin being physically attached to the hammer, if you put the hammer down on a live chamber the firing pin was in direct contact with the primer. A little pressure and you would have a discharge. This is also why it was common place to only load 5 rounds into revolvers during the time period. You didnâ€™t have to rely on a the sometimes worn half cock mechanism and would simply put the hammer down on the empty chamber.</p></div>		</li>
