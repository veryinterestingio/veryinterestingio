			<div class="markdown"><p>This is important. A video of the night sky is not really that useful for you to get an idea since a satellite the size of a car is clearly visible on your 2d view of the universe. It's 3d out there and o collide these things need to cross orbits in 4 dimensions (time...)</p>
<p>I think a big problem is space junk from launches and from a time where we were not careful, like using explosive bolts everywhere. SpaceX for instance don't use explosive bolts and bring down everything the sent up except the sat and the SATs must have decommission plans.</p>
<p>I think space junk and badly designed rockets Nd satellites are not sustainable but that doesn't meant 40 000 controlled satellites like Starlink is a major concern, space is really big, just need to be smart about it.</p>
<p>A modern Russian weather sat did get knocked out just a few months ago...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there are collisions with cars and you can simply tow them to be repaired. Itâ€™s rare that a car will fall out of orbit into a building after an accident.
Today, those sort of risks are non zero for satellites when deciding where to orbit and how to shield the satellite<br />
Although there is a lot of sky, only a small set of orbits let you take advantage of gravity in a way that maximize payload by minimizing fuel. That area is getting crowded already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of the cars as stationary, cuz they aren't, they move and they move fast, they move in all different directions and their paths can cross quite a bit. </p>
<p>Imagine how many car accidents there are on earth, now luckily people who can afford to put sattelites in space can also afford to organise and place them so they don't collide. But the international space station has to move quite often to move out of orbits from mainly space debris.</p>
<p>it's quite the problem, the worst case senario is kessler syndrome</p></div>		</li>
