			<div class="markdown"><p>Let it be said that you also don't have to say it out loud to somebody else. Journaling can also achieve the same effect. Really the point of it is to take your  emotions and,  by putting them to words,  change them to thoughts. </p>
<p>When they are just emotions all you can do is feel them when they are thoughts you can consider them and understand them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's such an interesting way of looking at this! I've been considering starting up journaling again now that I'm stuck in quarantine and really don't talk to anyone but my husband. I've hit the start of a depression spiral the last few days and I'm trying hard to fight it. I can't find the &quot;cause&quot; so I can't deal with it - but maybe I just need it OUT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started a plauge dairy 3/13 and it been a immense help. Some days are jsut a line or two some days pages on end. You can sure tell when I was broken because I tell incredible stories. Its helped me work out things that have crushed me for years. I was injured on the job in January so my world was already trashed before covid. The point of the journal at first was not to help me. It was a bit of a joke I guess in many rpg games you find bits of dairy around locations that will tell the story of a non player character often ending in there demise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true! My therapist, after many years of prodding, finally convinced me to start journaling. That was 3 years ago, Iâ€™ve gone through four full journals and my mental health is much better for it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While lots can be said on this topic, this is the primary and simplest answer: stress is bad for your brain and body. When you are stressed, upset, etc, it changes the way your system fuctions (imagine going into &quot;red alert&quot;): emergency functions are prioritized, long-term health and housekeeping are de-prioritized. In the classic example: If you're being chased by a tiger, it's less important to digest your dinner at that moment, and more important to avoid becoming the tiger's dinner. </p>
<p>So far, so good - you escape the tiger, your system resets, all's well. The problem is when stress becomes chronic and unaddressed, and we live in that emergency response. Housekeeping gets neglected, and does long-term damage to your organ systems, and also changes your brain - so that we perceive things as being that emergency mode more often than is accurate (anxiety, depression etc). </p>
<p>The good news is, much of that damage is reversible if we deal with the stress and find ways to restore our sense of balance and safety. In addition to sufficient rest and exercise, tools like meditation and forms of therapy can help affect this fundamental shift. âœŒ</p></div>		</li>
