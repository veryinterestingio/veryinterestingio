			<div class="markdown"><p>Alligators most definitely do eat wading birds and their nestlings. The premise of the mutualism between these two species is that alligators protect nesting wading birds from nest predators by deterring them due to the threat of predation from the alligator, and in return, alligators consume fallen nestlings (which are ejected from the nest through a process called brood reduction). If you are wondering if alligators would eat living nestlings from the nest itself, the answer is still yes. As I mentioned below--if given the opportunity and they could access it, an alligator would eat a stray wading bird. This includes nestlings or adults, but nestlings tend to be easier to catch and easier to consume. Alligators have even been observed actively trying to knock wading bird chicks from nests into the water below!</p></div>		</li>
