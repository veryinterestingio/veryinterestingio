Commercial ice makers are designed to freeze the water partially, then drain off the part with the concentrated gasses.  This is how they make the clear flavorless ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I own a water business and make ice, the cloudy ice is from impurities in the water. Melted ice tastes different as it has a lot more bacteria then freshly purified water, try leaving a glass of water at room temp for a day and it tastes nearly the same.</p>
<p>If you make ice from two water it will be very cloudy, if you make ice from distilled water (which is actually not that healthy to drink if it doesn't have anything added) or reverse osmosis you will find it is very clear.</p>
<p>Ice Makers like the ones you find in hotels are also a breeding ground for all kinds of bacteria, it can develop pink slime/mold in a matter of hours, I've seen every colour of the rainbow in ice machines. There are plenty of bacteria that can survive freezing temperatures and unless you follow the proper steps to sanatize your machine you'll grow all kinda of things in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems to contradict my (admittedly anecdotal) experience. I find that rinsing ice cubes thoroughly gets rids of the taste, suggesting that it's concentrated more in the outermost layer.</p></div>		</li>
