			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called excoriation disorder &amp; most people are too ashamed to talk about it. For most of my life I had no idea it was anything more than a self-control issue &amp; shamed myself over the fact I didn't have the willpower to stop. Turns out, it's more than likely a byproduct of my high anxiety as a kid &amp; once the endorphins started flowing as a self-calming mechanism, it became a difficult to control addiction. Unfortunately i's not like you can just remove all the rough spots on your skin like environmental things like alcohol or chocolate.</p>
<p>I pick daily at everything from the cuticles around my fingernails to the skin on the inside of my ears. Anywhere that doesn't feel like the rest of my skin gets picked at. If I'm really stressed, I pick at the inside of my nose. I have to stash bandaids &amp; tissues in my car, desk, or bag so I can deal if I make myself bleed.</p>
<p>I would really like to stop but I have yet to find anything that works for a prolonged period of time. I take an antidepressant &amp; anti-anxiety meds which help some. But there is nothing more frustrating to me than getting my fingers all healed with no scabs then finding myself biting &amp; picking them again during a meeting or movie. At least now I can extend myself some grace &amp; not continually beat myself up about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never thought of myself as having any anxiety.  I mean occasionally, but not for any length of time. Nor depression, although lately I've been thinking I might be depressed do to bring completely fine at home by myself. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My SO used to let me pick his scabs. But then we got into a fight about him repeatedly raping me(, which he didn't consider rape). He compared it to how I pick at his skin sometimes. So we agreed not to abuse eachothers' bodies as such. </p>
<p>It's embarrassing to admit that's how I justify staying with my rapist, but I see now that no one is always kind or always cruel. We all have hurt and been hurt. We need to call it out, admit it, and try to make things better.</p></div>		</li>
