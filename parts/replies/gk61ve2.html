			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in 2011, my wife and I attended a Linkin Park concert in Cincinnati.  We drove in from Pittsburgh, and got a hotel room online.  The concert let out pretty late, and we didn't end up leaving until about 11.  To try and avoid the back up on the interstate leaving the venue, we plugged the hotel into the GPS and selected &quot;avoid highways&quot;.  We were routed along a river, into a small town, and directed to turn across some train tracks.  It was pretty dark outside, and in front of us was pitch black.  I stopped the car, and referenced the GPS.  In front of us on the map was a large blue expanse, and the directions &quot;board the ferry&quot;.   We were looking at the Ohio River.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof this hits hard. I was driving cross country when it started snowing heavily. For some reason the GPS told me to get off the HWY and I followed it stupidly, blindly without thinking. Cutting to the chase, roads were even worse than the HWY and I slid off getting stuck in the snow for hours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone laughs at the thought of someone following their gps to some kind of peril but people tend to forget it can happen as a result of not being able to see the road from weather. It's not people staring at their GPS instead of the road under otherwise normal conditions</p></div>		</li>
