			<div class="markdown"><p>Bottled water is like this too. The water doesn't expire, but the plastic container eventually starts failing, and some substances may leech into the water inside. While not necessarily a health hazard, it can change the taste of the water significantly, and not for the better. It's why out of glass, metal and plastic, beverages in plastic bottles typically have the shortest shelf life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the main reason bottled water has an expiration date is that in 1987, the state of New Jersey mandated that all food products must have an expiration date of two years or less.  Because of the way the law works, bottled water counts as a “food” product.  Rather than make special bottles for New Jersey, the manufacturers just printed expiration dates on all bottles.</p></div>		</li>
