			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.barefooters.org/survey-in-china-and-india-of-feet-that-have-never-worn-shoes/" target="_blank">Bunions do not occur in habitually barefoot societies</a>. They are a product of tight shoes - especially pointed shoes. Soze is right that shoes radically change how you walk. If you never wore shoes, you would strike the ground with the front half of your foot very lightly and push off with your toes. What they undersell is that the foot is RADICALLY changed by shoes. To give you an idea, <a href="https://birthdayshoes.com/media/blogs/bdayshoes/2013_Photos/.evocache/human_feet_look_like_if_you_never_wear_shoes.jpg/fit-640x540.jpg?mtime=1386261566" target="_blank">here is a photo of people who have never worn shoes</a>. Their toes are straight and they splay at the front. Our toes are bent inwards and deformed by shoes. Shoes also soften and sensitise the feet – which is why people who have never worn shoes can walk up mountains and through the jungle barefoot, but you might struggle with lego. Flat feet do not bother you if you are always barefoot. I would question anyone saying that evolution is making for smaller feet and ask if they are comparing feet that grew up without shoes to people who grew up in shoes from when they were toddlers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, without shoes, humans are very very mildly inclined towards more digitigrade style of movement?</p>
<p>I can see that. When I'm going around my house barefoot, I'm nearly always on my toes or at the very least toes and front part of my foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here! I usually keep my heels up off the floor anymore. I don't thump the tile with each step since my heel hits with all my weight at once; while walking on the balls of my feet are quiet since I put my foot down then transfer weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, barefoot running isn’t up on your toes. It’s more of a forefoot/midfoot strike, then the heel lands more lightly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm just weird then, because, when barefoot, I definitely move around on my toes (maybe barely the front bit of my sole?) without the heel landing at all.</p>
<p>I guess it's not truly digitigrade (I don't think our toes alone can support the weight) but it's definitely closer to just my toes than it is to all of my foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that many “barefoot” type shoes quickly prompt you to run on the balls of your feet and not heel-to-toe, which is much lower impact on your skeletal structure.</p>
<p>It’s not just those shoes with toes, either. </p>

<p>I don’t run on my heels at all anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heel striking is a side effect usually from an issue called over striding where you extend your leg too far forward when running which results in hitting the ground with your knee fully flexed. Plenty of people start running with heel striking from their improper form but after a while, they start striking towards the mid-front of the foot as overstriding becomes less of a problem. Hell, even elite marathoners such as Kenenisa Bekele have been recorded heel striking during their races such as the 2019 Berlin Marathon. The barefoot thing personally feels like a sham since the underlying issue is your gait which can be fixed through training, many people run in nike pegasus 35s but not everyone heel strikes in those shoes now do they. However if barefoot shoes work for you then you do you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not convinced it's a sham. I grew up convinced I couldn't run and got horrible shin pain with only a 50m sprint. Was encouraged to try running without shoes and my stride automatically shortened and Couch to 5km followed quickly. So yes, it <em>was</em> a gait problem. But I didn't need 'fixing through training', it just happened automatically as a side-effect of chucking out the running shoes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and its also supposed to be more efficient. You waste energy by hitting heel first, it’s supposed to just be better to run long distance on the balls of your feet. I’m sure its a small difference but still very interesting.</p></div>		</li>
