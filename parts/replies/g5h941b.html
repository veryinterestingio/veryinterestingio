			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need to touch the bare metal of the antenna (typically within a plastic housing), and really this effect is more pronounced in analog settings, not digital. </p>
<p>A more obvious way to observe this would be with an old AM/FM radio. Try tuning close (but not exactly) to the frequency of a channel so you can hear static then touch the antenna. You'll hear it either get clearer or more staticy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An even more obvious example was adjusting the rabbit ears antenna on an old TV. </p>
<p>They were hard to adjust because your body would significantly affect reception. You would find a good spot and let go, only to have the picture go to crap.</p>
<p>Lots of old jokes about parents making their kids adjust the antenna and then stay there until the show was over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That works real well for an FM radio with a small telescoping antenna.  And sometimes just standing a couple feet from that antenna makes all the difference in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is the sound exactly the same in different scenarios? I would expect if you were around different radio waves, the sound produced would be different, yet everytime I've heard this it's been the same sound</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's 50 or 60 Hz and the harmonics of those (multiples of those frequencies) that your AC power lines are emanating. Those are much stronger than &quot;real&quot; radio stations.</p></div>		</li>
