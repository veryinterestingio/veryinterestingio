<p>No better (non-medical) relief than about ten minutes on the yoga mat. Not even yoga - just stretching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just stretching doesn't really help many issues. Such as chronic pain where the muscle need to learn to relax again and just stretching can cause more issues but a great masks therapist can help guide those muscles back to what they are suppose to be. Also surgical scar tissue.</p></div>		</li>
