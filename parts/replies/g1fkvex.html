			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's actually from the Mediterranean basin/middle east. If you picture a guy with a handlebar mustache, it's those hairs that tend to turn red, and even have a different texture(more wiry). Though that being said, the Irish do have more redheads than anyone else- but you don't have to be a redhead to have a red beard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive never grown out my beard, always shaving it. But I have a habit of pulling hairs out individually by my nails or tweezers. 90% of the time they are just black/brown. Some are a touch thinner and are white. On some occasions a red one. Very rarely I pull a pure black one that is nearly double the width of the regular ones.</p></div>		</li>
