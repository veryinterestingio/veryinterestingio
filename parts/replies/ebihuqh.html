			<div class="markdown"><p>Geology major here. Not a planetoid but a protoplanet. You are correct: the fusion of the iron-nickle cores of the protoplanets left Earths core very large compared to other Earth sized planets. It also left Earth rich with other heavy metals and that's where the fun starts. The amount of gold at Earths crust is more than average in our solar system. So if it's gold you are looking for from Mars, it might be an empty trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I the only one that noticed that you guys completley contradicted each other by referencing the same event?</p>
<p>The other guys said that due to the collision more of earths metal is unaccessible and at the core. You're saying that due to the collision we have lots more metal in our crust. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is relevant because Earth's heavy stuff, which includes almost all the metals you're asking about, are way more in-the-center than most planets</p>
<p>It also left Earth rich with other heavy metals and that's where the fun starts. The amount of gold at Earths crust is more than average in our solar system. </p>

<p>So which is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold exploration geologist here. Those statements sounds strange but I'd generally agree with both of them. I won't pretend to know anything about the earth compared to other planets as its not my field, but the earth is a dynamic system with gold usually being transported from the mantle or potentially the core via hydrothermal systems and magmatism whereas as people have pointed out, Mars is static.</p>
<p>So I suppose I'd change that second sentence to: </p>
<p>&quot;The amount of <em>viable</em> gold <em>deposits</em> at Earths crust is more than average in our solar system. So if it's gold you are looking for from Mars, it might be an empty trip.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sort of agreed in that the earth has less <em>available</em> iron because it's locked up in the core because of the impact, but the impact also stirred up the <em>heavier</em> metals and distributed them more widely than is normal for other planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth has “too much” metal in the crust and mantle, and There’s something called the Late Veneer which explains why. Basically do to the way metals like Ni, Cu, PGE, Au, Ag etc. chemically partition, most of those should have ended up in the core when it differentiated from the silicate earth, leaving the mantle and crust more depleted than we observe today. So either the bulk earth had WAY higher than chondritic concentrations of metals from the start, or metals were added later after this differentiation. Most likely after the core differentiated from the silicate earth, the planet was bombarded with asteroids and other similar bodies during the Late Heavy Bombardment. This added metals to the still molten bulk silicate earth, but these metals did not end up in the core because that material had already separated out. That’s the part that’s called the Late Veneer. After that (and after the mantle and crust differentiated) metals were transported from mantle to crust mostly by igneous activity, then sometimes remobilized and concentrated by hydrothermal activity or later igneous activity. This could absolutely have happened on Mars also because Mars also probably hit a bunch of stuff after it’s core differentiated while it was clearing its orbit. It also has large igneous systems that on earth host PGE or Ni-Cu-PGE-(Co) deposits, so it’s not unreasonable to think Mars could have certain types of mineral deposits that we have on earth. So we might find PGE or No-Cu-PGE deposits because Mars has the right kind of igneous systems for that, but we might not see porphyry Cu-Mo deposits because those require subduction zones at convergent plate boundaries and Mars doesn’t have plate tectonics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're pretty confident about the Moon, based on a few measurement techniques. Satellites that orbit and measure gravity tell us about the density characteristics of a body. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRAIL" target="_blank">GRAIL did this for the Moon.</a> In addition, mapping the behavior of waves as a seismic event moves around the body tells us a lot about density, too. Apollo left seismometers on the Moon, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InSight" target="_blank">InSight literally <em>just</em> landed some on Mars</a>.</p>
<p>Once you know a little bit of density and elemental composition (spectrographs), applying what we know about physics allows one to fill in the gaps and <em>theorize</em> the composition of a body. We have a lot of observational evidence on Earth, and we're pretty sure elements work the same way elsewhere. We know gravity there (from mass), and so on, what temperature would do as you get deeper, and so on. There's probably other methods, too, but those are some I can think of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know the average composition of the solar system, and earth has a higher percentage of iron. Maybe he was referencing that? </p>
<p>The moon has a lower % iron than average, and the earth and moon combined are about average. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know the average composition of the solar system due the pre planetary state meteorites, chondrite meteorite. We also have iron meteorites and it is determined that they are remnants of planetary cores. So we have an approximation based on the general element composition and we know that heavier elements culminate to the core of the planet, so based on that we can determine the size of the core when we know how large the planet is. </p>
<p>However, the mass of the Earth is larger than the average element composition would give for a planet this size and this has been determined to be caused by larger iron core. Further more, the mass of the moon is smaller than expected.</p>
<p>Also Physicists and cosmologists can just calculate the weight of the planet for it's wobbling or something. (Yes I am a Science!)</p></div>		</li>

<p>the more important question is &quot;why bother? There's way more metal that's easier to get in the asteroid belt.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, if you were trying to set up a habitat (or any other kind of large, self-sufficient operation) on Mars, it might help to use local materials. Mining asteroids for that would add a huge layer of complexity to the project without offering all that much benefit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>If you can send a habitat to mars, you can send automated miners to the asteroid belt, and send their results back with a mass driver</p>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You seem to be saying that mining asteroids would be more complex than mining mars.</p>
<p>Mining is much easier in zero-g, especially if you can ignore the mine afterwards.</p>
<p>Can you explain to me where this added complexity would come from?</p>
<p>As far as offering benefit, there's so much benefit that we're considering doing it today, from Earth</p>
<p>Did you confuse &quot;I don't know what the benefit is&quot; with &quot;there isn't any?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
