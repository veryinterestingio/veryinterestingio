			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still having trouble understanding why gravity wouldn't have a direct effect on how sound waves propagate. It seems like if gravity is pulling on the molecules of whatever the sound is moving through, then the wave should propagate differently depending on whether it's moving towards, away from, or perpendicular to the direction of that pull. Other forces do affect sound, like wind for instance. Shouldn't the movement of a sound wave be a vector sum of all the forces acting on the particles it propagates through?</p>
<p>I know analogies are never perfect, but the movement of a spring is obviously affected by gravity and I thought sound waves were pretty similar to that.</p>
<p>Do you just mean that the effect of gravity is extremely small, even potentially unmeasurable? Or does it actually not exist? If not, can you explain why the spring analogy fails here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a recent observation that <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/23" target="_blank">sound waves carry small gravitational mass</a>. A theoretical derivation can be found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331462298_Gravitational_Mass_Carried_by_Sound_Waves" target="_blank">here</a>, which shows that even in Newtonian limit, the mass is non-zero. This is pretty weird though, and I have no idea what the implication is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely can't say I understand all or even most of that 2019 paper or the <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.134516" target="_blank">2018 paper it cites</a>, but to the extent I understand any of it, it seems to be describing the fact that as a sound wave propagates through a medium it will create local areas of higher relative particle density, associated with compression, and areas of lower relative density, associated with rarefaction. These changes in the density of the medium are the source of the mass, which is relative to the undisturbed medium.</p>
<p>That would be a different source of gravitational interaction than I was trying to describe, but I suppose it makes sense, too. Or, like I said, maybe I just totally misunderstand the point of these papers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So when you yell so loud people cower down and become compressed, it's because you're crushing them with your vocal gravity, nice!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this: The molecules that make up our atmosphere move around due to pressure and temperature changes (that’s what wind is) and are buoyant due to factors of density. The molecules of air are where they are because of the dueling forces of density and gravity. If a bang happens, a wave of force that bumps the molecules together through time and space propagates outwards, but does not necessarily carry said molecules along with it on it’s path outward, lifting them up. It just makes the molecules bump elbows, so to speak. So they mostly stay where they are. The force wave is the thing that does the traveling, and that force wave is not a thing that necessarily has a mass of its own. It is just the sum of its parts. If the force wave were to push a bunch of air molecules upward into a less dense part of the atmosphere, the laws governing density would mostly be the thing that would “pull” them back down again to achieve density equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that individual particles don't move from the source of a sound to some far destination. As you said, though, the particles do move and as far as I know, that movement is the only thing that propagates a sound wave, just nearby particles bumping into one another forward and backward. So shouldn't any other force that also influences the movement those particles (like gravity) act to dampen, amplify, or deflect the propagation of the sound wave, depending on its direction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound is a compression wave, for the most part the molecules/atoms stay in the same area.</p>
<p>Gravity is pulling on the molecules, but the air molecules around them are pushing back.  The molecules are all &quot;floating&quot; together due to intermolecular forces.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermolecular_force" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermolecular_force</a></p>
<p>Even with gravity you have molecules that are bouncing around in all directions, even up and down.  This is what heat is.  </p>
<p>Yes, compared to the atom forces that is pushing air molecules apart from each other, gravity is very weak.</p>
<p>For sound to happen you just need the air molecules to hit other atoms next to them.  They are already doing this because of heat.  Sound is just grouping them together, and giving it direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can certainly understand that the effect of gravity would be very small compared to the other forces acting on the particles, but not why it would not exist at all.</p></div>		</li>
