			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I suppose  a lot of the information they gather will be incidental. It might take some time before they're able to map what happens at each stage of fetal development, which then requires people to volunteer to participate. It would be interesting to find out what services are available for this in other countries (I'm in the UK), and how many countries were able to organise the recruitment for this stage effectively. Hopes aren't high though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former UK resident and current US one, I think your system is pretty great. Looks like you have a programs called UKOSS and UKTIS that respectively study diseases in pregnant people and toxicology, and they are studying this question. Because your healthcare system is so much more centralized, there seems to me to be more opportunity to gather data on inadvertent pregnant vaccines and intentional vaccines for those with high risk factors. This site gives information for clinicians and patients to report pregnant vaccinations: <a href="https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/coronavirus-covid-19-pregnancy-and-womens-health/covid-19-vaccines-and-pregnancy/" target="_blank">https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/coronavirus-covid-19-pregnancy-and-womens-health/covid-19-vaccines-and-pregnancy/</a></p></div>		</li>
