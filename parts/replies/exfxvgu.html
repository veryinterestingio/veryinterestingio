			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens every autumn where i live, and its well known. Birds eat naturally fermented berries and gets drunk. You often see birds just sitting in the middle of the road, crashing mid air with cars, flying into glass windows on houses and so on. Nature can be pretty bizarre. Never seen or heard of this happening to animals like deer and moose, but i guess they would need to consume way more than they are able to, to get intoxicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word <em>sturdy</em> in English originally meant &quot;stunned&quot;. The source word in Latin was <em>exturdus</em>. </p>
<p>Well, <em>turdus</em> in Latin means &quot;thrush&quot; and, according to Merriam-Webster, <em>exturdus</em> was an idiom meaning &quot;like a thrush (that is drunk from eating fermented fruit)&quot;. Evidently, European thrushes were a bunch of lushes!</p></div>		</li>
