			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we crave high sugar foods because they're calorically rich which is a great advantage in a calorie scarce environment, and we're extremely good at being sedentary sort of for the same reason. We got very good at saving calories by being still when we weren't doing survival stuff to better increase our chances of not starving. Which is unfortunate now because we're not burning those calories it took to get our food and just gaining weight instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big difference between humans and other 'running' animals (cheetahs, horses, etc) is that as we are bipedal, we use a different set of muscles to breath as we do to run; quadrupeds typically use the same sets of muscles to both run and breathe, which severely limits the time they can run, as they can literally run themselves to death, wearing out their breathing muscles to the point of asphyxiation.</p>
<p>This makes humans the prime long distance runners, and there are cases where a professional runner can outrun a horse over a long enough distance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a myth that humans are the BEST long distance runners. We're way up there, but some species beat us in specific conditions (like dogs, wolves, horses, etc.) and some species (like camels) beat us in all conditions.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary standpoint, that's just fine, because we don't need to catch ALL the species of animals to kill them, just a good enough number to survive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your <em>brain</em> should decide you are in danger and therefore force your body to keep on running, you sorry-ass-of-a-soon-to-lose-the-Darwin-race-to-a-hungry-wolfpack.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dr. Lieberman’s research, popularised in Born To Run by Christopher McDougall, and you’ll actually find the difference to be that bipedal runners can choose how many strides per inhale or exhale, while quadruped runners’ guts slamming into their lungs every stride lock them into a 1:1 breathing pattern, which coupled with the other factors making up a critter’s efficiency makes for the arms race for traditional sprint-style predator-prey chases, and the total upgrade of battlefield tactics that humans have wreaked on herd populations around the world for two hundred thousand years. Anthropologists recorded their experiences of possibly some of the last traditional persistence hunts, and related it to the rise of science/critical thinking in man, based on the skills required to track an individual animal that’s part of a herd, often out of sight, until its hooves fall off, or its body just refuses to run due to heat exhaustion. Perfect kill, too, no mess, just break its neck. Why do we flock to the marathon to run in any conditions for like two and a half hours? That’s about how long it takes. Woo!</p></div>		</li>
