<p>I used to think it was referring to how much fuel the gas tank could hold but I was way off</p></div>		</li>

<p>The swept volume or displacement is where the size comes from and can be calculated by pi * piston diameter divided by 4 multiplied by the stroke or how far the piston travels up and down. </p>
<p>For ease we can use the Toyota gt86 which has both a piston size or bore of 86mm and a stroke or travel of also 86mm, this is known as a square as opposed to over or under square (bore bigger than stroke like an f1 engine good for high rpm and power or stroke bigger than bore for lower rpm more torque). We can also use pi*r^2 multiplied by stroke so (3.14×(43^2))×86=499,303.96 cubic mm which is about half a litre, multiplied by 4 which is the number of cylinders and you get 2L.</p>
<p>Can't get all the information in an eli5 but tried to keep it succinct.</p></div>		</li>
