<p>This is the mal-functioning circuit involved in tourette's syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ehn, not quite.</p>
<p>First, coprolalia is a rare tic that generally shows up in around 10% of those who are on the more severe end of the Tourette spectrum. It's just that it's the kind of thing the media loves to latch onto and exaggerate because it's so sensational in the wrong hands.</p>
<p>Second, Tourette is a neurological disorder that primarily involves motor tics and secondarily involves vocal tics. Given its verbal nature, coprolalia is a complex vocal tic.</p>
<p>Third, coprolalia is not exclusively swearing per se. It is any utterance that is taboo or socially unacceptable.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a really interesting link, thanks for sharing. </p>
<p>There was a guy on the UK Big Brother about 10 or 15 years ago who had Tourette’s, and I remember as a youth assuming it just meant he would swear all the time. He did sometimes (mostly just the word “wanker”) but far more frequently were other tics like whistling, twitching, and banging on his own chest. It was interesting to see a real person dealing with it, not just a neurotypical caricature. I imagine it did a lot for people’s perceptions of the condition, at least in this country. (It helped that he was a really lovely guy, he ended up being super popular because he was so funny and charming, so definitely a good “spokesman”.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what do you mean by complex ? id just expect some neural network involving both censorship and the motor aspect of language to be fucked up, looks like soemthing youd get by having a stroke in the wrong area</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i do have very limited neuropsychology knowledge though so take that with a grain of salt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple vs complex tics are defined as whether or not they</p>
<ul>
<li>involve more than one muscle group; or   </li>
<li>appear purposeful</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore eye-blinking or head-jerking are simple tics, but touching someone or something or hand-clapping or skipping while walking are complex tics. Lip-smacking or moaning are simple tics, but any verbal tic is inherently complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, about apes, is really interesting to know.  Thanks for sharing.</p>
<p>I think I can sum up the complexities fairly easily.</p>
<p>Someone was offended by ________. They rallied all their friends, and now __________ is unacceptable.</p>
<p>I think it's BS myself... but there aren't many words that offend me, so I'm bias.  I'm more offended by a misplaced connotation.  For example, I know I can be a bitch, I try not to be but I own it when I am.  It offends me when I'm not being a bitch, but someone calls me one in a negative manner just because they either disagree or do not understand what I'm trying to say.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What really annoys me is when a very small group of people make it wrong for me to say a specific word that was never intended to be a curse word in the first place.  Even if I use the term properly, for it's original meaning, I get gasps and dirty looks.  As a tame example (and thoroughly discussed above), my uncle is Retarded.  He's classified from birth as Retarded, and I grew up knowing he was Retarded, and we even worked with Special Olympics with many other Retarded individuals (not all of them, some had a more specified set of disabilities that were not considered retarded, and ofc I would not refer to them that way).  </p>
<p>Fast forward 20 years and it's considered derogatory to call him exactly what he is... </p>
<p>Unfortunately, his &quot;developmental deficiency&quot; is not clearly defined.  They don't know why he never matured past the age of 7, so there really is no exact diagnosis.  Perhaps (also unfortunately?), for this reason, I will always consider him to be retarded.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To go back to the misplaced connotation, I can see why being called retarded when you are not retarded, is an insult.  But why can't I call this man retarded if someone says &quot;whats wrong with him&quot;.  It was his official diagnosis! And forgive me, but the less than PC side of me is saying, &quot;that is fucking retarded&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, it's people using &quot;Retarded&quot; as an insult, that carried over to actual retarded people. We therefore don't use the word to describe mentally handicapped BECAUSE it became a societal norm to use it derogatorily. </p>
<p>Interesting thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems backwards.</p>
<p>The word was specifically chosen for use as an insult because of exactly what it implied.  It doesn't matter what this is changed to, that too will eventually become an insult.  Let's say for example that we said &quot;Developmentally delayed&quot; is now verboten, and everyone who has any sort of mental impairment will be referred to as &quot;Quefkan.&quot;  I'd consider it hopelessly optimistic if you thought it would be even a single week before one person said to another &quot;What, are you quefkan?&quot; in a derogatory manner.</p>
<p>Because insulting the intelligence of a person you are quarreling with is practically THE example of an ad hominem attack, so long as people argue they will gladly appropriate whatever the current term is for such a condition and apply it with hostile intent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean plenty of words once used to describe less  capable individuals are all part of everyday lexicon...some of those words include “Lame” or “Dumb” which were once professionally recognized ailments but have slowly moved into a more general insult category. </p>
<p>So why is the word retarded somehow expected to be exempt from this predictable outcome? </p>
<p>In short, there is no difference and no matter how many times you try and deter it or change the terminology people are going to adopt that into their language and repeat the same process as they have done since the beginning of modern language. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. And now mentally disabled is the term. But guess what? When I was in high school 10 years ago I was already hearing kids replace &quot;retarted&quot; with &quot;disabled&quot; in their insults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. When I was a kid, my sister and I used to heckle each other by using the word &quot;retarded&quot;.  My kids were taught in school that it was wrong, and then I heard one tell another, &quot;You are so less fortunate.&quot;</p>
<p>On a more serious note, &quot;retarded&quot; really means &quot;late&quot; and I don't see why we can't use it to mean developmentally delayed.</p></div>		</li>
