			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about this.</p>
<p>Why do we bother with shielding our other body parts during X-rays, if the damage is so minimal? If a 6 hour flight is 40 times as damaging as an arm X-ray, isn't it all a bit unnecessary? </p>
<p>From a different perspective, shouldn't we be doing more to protect ourselves on flights, if the medical consensus is that X-rays are harmful? I can understand that lead vests for passengers are inefficient in many ways, but what about cabin crew, who fly constantly? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For technicians, it often adds up to a meaningful number and using PPE to block a third or so of the exposure makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Then there are some particularly vulnerable parts of the body—looking at you, ya damn thyroid—where minimizing exposure is always a good idea.</p>
<p>But beyond that...</p>
<p>For patients, there's not much of a reason outside of guarding against rare (practically unheard of?) malfunctions. OK, there's one other: to get the patient to shut up. Seriously, after having conversations with several dentists and their techs about the idiotic conversations they endure around x-rays, flouride, cancer screenings, and any number of other things, it's a pretty easy &quot;yes please&quot; to just throw the apron on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Should patients and carers wear lead aprons and personal protective devices during a dental radiographic procedure?</strong></p>
<p>With well-designed and optimized equipment and procedures there is no need for routine use of lead aprons for the patient in dental radiology. Lead aprons may provide some protection in the rare case of the vertex occlusal examination, especially in a patient who is, or may be, pregnant. On the other hand, the use of a lead apron may reassure patients that every effort is being made to ensure their safety, and may reduce the amount of time that needs to be taken to reassure them. Certainly, a lead apron should be provided for any patient who requests one. It may also be advisable to consider using them on a cautionary basis where equipment and/or technique have not been verified by a radiation protection specialist, and where they will not otherwise interfere with the examination. Thyroid collars should be used in all examinations where the thyroid may be exposed to the main beam or to a considerable amount of scatter radiation.</p>
<p>Lead aprons must be provided for a person who is required to support a patient during the radiographic procedure (i.e., a comforter or carer). Assisting adults should be positioned so that all parts of their body are out of the main beam.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some five years ago a read a research indicating that having a panoramic teeth x-ray increases the chances of brain tumor by close to 50%. Sounds drastic, but statistically if your chances of developing one is 0.00smth then this transfers into 0.00smth x 1.5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nyrin is right, but there's another reason. While with each x-ray exposure the chance to gain cancer is miniscule, it is not zero. You're always rolling the die and there is still a chance that the first  time the die lands on your unlucky number.</p>
<p>So best to minimize as much as you can. Minimize exposure duration, dose, and area exposed as best you can while being more useful than it's absence.</p>
<p>BUT, X-Ray radiation is NOT the same as cell phone radiation in terms of danger. To understand how they are similar and are different you want to learn about the electromagnetic radiation spectrum (it includes visible light, all light is radiation, which I think people like OP's parents often completely miss).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I realize this. My question was more about why airlines are held to a different safety standard, if the amount of absorbed radiation is far greater. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I read that a </p>
<blockquote>
<p>seven hour <strong>airplane</strong> trip exposes passengers to 0.02 <strong>mSv</strong> of <strong>radiation</strong>, which is a fraction of the exposure of a standard Chest <strong>x</strong>-<strong>ray</strong> (0.1 <strong>mSv</strong>). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.xrayrisk.com/faq.php" target="_blank">xrayrisk</a>.  So a chest x-ray is more radiation in this case.</p>
<p>I've heard this from a doctor trying to convince me to have an X-ray, and I don't think it's a valid comparison.  An X-ray penetrates through the body in one focused area, whereas the radiation on a flight would be focussed all over your body and spread out over several hours.  Also, the radiation on a flight isn't just x-rays, it's a mix of radiation types, some not as penetrating like UV, which is mostly stopped by your skin.  X-rays and other penetrating radiation hits your organs and brain, which you don't want it.</p>
<p>Doctors talk about how safe x-rays are, but then they hide in a lead-covered underground bunker when they take the x-ray.  Sup with that?</p></div>		</li>
