			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree on most of your points, except your underlying implication that if it killed 100% of people who contracted it that it would be contained immediately. </p>
<p>We had people who didn't know what covid was capable of ignoring precautions, so it would have probably killed a fair few, even at 100% mortality rate, especially if it killed people after a little while. </p>
<p>Let's not forget how long it took us to source tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on incubation period, presymptomatic transmission period, and how long people are sick (symptomatic) before dying. The longer those variables are, the more spread even with a 100% fatal disease.</p>
<p>Case in point: AIDS in the 80s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this virus had lets say 30% mortality rate we would not  have facebook scientists and Karena screaming about not wearing a mask, most would have died, oh and people would take it way more seriously, and expect travel restrictions and quarantines to be for months</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are we really more likely to take it seriously and stop it if it's deadlier? There was a lot of talk about contact tracing and quarantining Covid, which I thought would be border line impossible because it was already so widely spread, but with a more deadly disease like HIV we didn't contact trace and quarantine which would have been a much easier disease to do that with.</p></div>		</li>
