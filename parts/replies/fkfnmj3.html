			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're looking for a good read, there are two books I suggest about pandemic containment, specifically hemmoragics like Ebola:</p>
<p>The Hot Zone by Richard Preston<br />
The Coming Plague by Laurie Garrett  </p>
<p>The first one is light, breezy and sensationalist. Like reading a story in the National Enquirer.</p>
<p>The second one is like reading the same story in the New York Times. Detailed and sourced.</p>
<p>Both are great reads in their own way. I feel better informed having read both of them back to back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it wouldn’t wipe out anybody. A virus from 10000+ years ago would almost certainly not even be capable of infecting humans, and if it did the chances of it causing a serious disease would be almost zero.</p></div>		</li>
