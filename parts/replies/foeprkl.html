Dark brown/black liquid with very light cream foam, almost white. That's because although it looks opaque, it's quite clear when in a thin film, and so the foam refracts/reflects most wavelengths of light. Blow some bubbles in a can of green emulsion (get adult supervision, kids) and you'll get green foam, depending on the paint. Blue plastic, or chocolate cake mix? You'll get a blue sponge and brown chocolate cake respectively.</p></div>		</li>
