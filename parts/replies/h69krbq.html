			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably a biological clock that causes them to migrate. Birds raised and kept away from cues for season will display behavior of wanting to migrate at the appropriate times, despite never migrating before. Can't speak for butterflies, but baby birds remember the night sky to use for migrating. Artificially altering what they see as babies will alter where they try to go as adults.</p></div>		</li>
