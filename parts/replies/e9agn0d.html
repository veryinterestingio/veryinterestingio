			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, this is Natalie Beck. I am a certified genetic counselor in pediatric and adult genetics here at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Thank you so much for your question. We are always trying to promote genetic counselor awareness not only to the public but also to our colleagues across different areas of medicine. Many health care providers may not have the time needed to take an in depth family history, although we certainly encourage them to ask about their patients’ family histories. Our family medical histories are one of the most important tools to our health care, so we definitely encourage consumers to take their own family histories and then discuss that information with their primary care providers. The US Surgeon General has declared Thanksgiving ‘Family History Day’ If you are concerned about a particular pattern of disease or a specific condition in your family, you should pursue an evaluation with a genetic counselor. You can find a genetic counselor local to you by going to<a href="http://www.nsgc.org/" target="_blank"> www.nsgc.org</a> and using the ‘Find A Genetic Counselor’ search feature.</p></div>		</li>
