<p>Imagine you're sitting on the riverbank, and you see a barge float by on the river, pushed by the current.</p>
<p>When it's a little far away from you it shoots a little boat upstream back towards you faster than the current pushes it back.</p>
<p>By the time the little boat reaches you, the barge has now floated way further downstream. If the little boat had come from where the barge is now it wouldn't have had time yet to reach you. However, since it was launched when the barge was closer it did have time to reach you!</p>
<p>In this analogy the barge is a distant galaxy, the little boat is light emitted by the galaxy, and the current of the river pushing the barge away is the expansion of space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a balloon you bought from the store.  You pull it out of the bag and it is small, mostly flat, and all squished up.  That was the universe at the beginning.  All points were nearby each other.  </p>
<p>The expansion of the universe is like blowing up the balloon.  As more air is added, all those points get further away from each other.  They are all still part of the same whole, but with more air everything is further away from everything else.</p>
<p>This helps explain how light created 13 billion years ago can now be over 40 billion light years away.  During that time space kept expanding just like the balloon.</p></div>		</li>
