			<div class="markdown"><p>I once walked into a Games By James at a mall in the middle of the day. The store was completely empty. No employees in site. I shouted in the back of the store where overflow items are kept and where a little office is and didn’t hear anything. I wondered if perhaps the worker was hurt so I even went into the back room and saw nobody. I decided to wait in the store to make sure no one else came in and decided to steal anything. I waited about 10 minutes before a guy wearing an employee shirt and name tag came strolling in holding a takeout food container from Panda Express. He’d went to the food court to have lunch and literally just left the store unattended. It was so strange!</p>
<p>I told him I had been concerned and said I was glad he was okay and then I just left, perplexed and amused.</p>
<p>He didn’t try to defend himself at all. He just went back to work as if nothing was strange.</p>
<p>I could have gotten so much free stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Running a register is going to be no part of running a business very soon, everywhere except the most backward and broke places. There will be a job for someone overseeing several or many payment-points, for security and / or maintenance. But cashiers have just a little time left before they go the way of travel agents. Automation is going to completely take over all those jobs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think this will happen for at least a few decades. There are still far too many customers who prefer cashiers, for example older people usually prefer cashiers for lack of understanding of self checkouts (in my experience)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't happen for a while because lots of retailers make their cashiers push addons with every checkout like protection plans and membership cards. People are more inclined to say yes to a human compared to a screen even if its for something they don't actually want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually do a few weeks-a month worth of shopping when I go to places like Walmart, and I absolutely need cashiers still since I'm usually purchasing some form of alcohol </p>
<p>Self checkout is fun until you need to buy a bottle of wine or a 6 pack</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Customers with that preference aren't writing the paychecks for the cashiers. Business owners aren't going to pay thousands extra each month to keep those few customers happy. Instead they will hire people to smooth the transition. It's not going to take decades.</p>
<p>In about 15 years the penetration of automation and AI is going to go way past easy-to-automate jobs like cashiers. Cashiers will fall sooner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are a boutique industry, employing a tiny fraction of the millions of people the industry used to employ. There used to be more travel agencies than there are yoga studios, penetrating deep into small towns in the heartland. There were almost as many as barber shops / hair salons. You probably have no idea how massive the industry was.</p>
<p>When you wanted to buy a plane ticket, you didn't call the airline, and there was no Web. You called your local travel agent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then in some places, the laws will have to change because for instance, in California, you can not buying alcohol using self check out. Someone has to ring that up for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the laws will be changed. Things will conform to the needs of those with millions and billions of dollars, as always. The California government is not going to stand in the way of technological progress.</p>
<p>There will still be someone doing security for these automated payment systems. Invalid alcohol purchases won't be possible, and there will be someone there to counteract theft. Lawmakers will require that the software designers certify that ID will be checked, that someone take responsibility and the system works. But the system will be made to work, because the profit motive solves all such problems.</p>
<p>There's nothing like self-interest to problem-solve. That's why a jobs guarantee, like in the Green New Deal, simply won't work. You need self-interest to power any enterprise, and regulation to counteract the inescapable greed. Many people these days think you can take self-interest out to counteract the greed with no adverse effect. </p>
<p>That won't work. A jobs guarantee will just result in make-work. People will be paid to produce nothing of value, because there's no self-interest creating demand that such workers will be employed to fill. Self-interest is the source of value.</p></div>		</li>
