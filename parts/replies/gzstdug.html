<p>If you are in a normal shared home apt you will have to contend with both daylight and noise from outside your bedroom. Both will fuck with your sleep if you always try to sleep just before dawn.</p>

<p>Wearable blinders for daylight. Noise however is on a personal level. I've seen people able to sleep through a car crash, construction work, you name it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago there was a gas explosion that could be heard from 200+ miles away. I lived 3 miles away and heard nothing, it shook our house. Our loft door (which was literally outside my bedroom door) fell down with a big thud and nothing, I was oblivious to the whole thing ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light is subjective too. I can literally sleep through the day easily even when it's quite bright - so bright even the thick curtains in our bedroom aren't enough to keep it out lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar. My apartment (with bed up in a loft) has a high ceiling with a window that I can't reach. That window has no curtain and I've gotten used to sleeping with natural sunlight filling the room. </p>
<p>I can nap in the middle of the afternoon if I want. </p>
<p>Sometimes in the summer its a bit annoying, shining in my face, but I can still sleep if I want to.</p></div>		</li>
