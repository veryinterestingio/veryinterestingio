			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlorinated pool water used to hurt my eyes until I started wearing contact lenses. Now not much can hurt my eyes, although I don't think I've ever tried opening my eyes in the ocean. Obviously I don't wear my contacts if I plan to be looking underwater with my bare eyes, but then I see so poorly that it is highly uninteresting.</p></div>		</li>
