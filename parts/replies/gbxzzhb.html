			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be General Relativity for the very large scales, such as galaxies, black holes, or the expansion of the universe, and the Standard Model for very small scales, i.e. individual fundamental particles and their interactions. They are both very well supported experimentally. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, they don't really fit together - there is, for example, no full quantum-mechanical description of gravity. This is currently one of the big problems in theoretical physics. String Theory (in its many different versions) is an attempt to solve this, but noone really knows whether or not it is correct since it has yet to produce results that are experimentally verifiable. </p>
<p>Another problem is that there are observations that can neither be explained by the Standard Model nor General Relativity alone, the most famous of which is dark matter. So there is still a lot we don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To the unification of GRT and the Standard Model? Yes, pretty much.</p>
<p>I should still point out that on their own, they both work fine, and are supported by lots of different kinds of experimental evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most agree about the big bang, and general relativity. </p>
<p>There's a lot of debate about Multiverses. (Multiple Worlds vs The Copenhagen Interpretation)</p>
<p>Multiple Worlds has gained in popularity and I would guess it's the most popular among post grads.</p></div>		</li>
