<p>An emulsion (or a colloid) is a situation where you have substances that won't dissolve in one another (like oil and water), where one of the substances has been broken down into small droplets and suspended in the other.</p>
<p>Normally, suspensions separate quickly (again, oil and water, or sand in water), but emulsions are somewhat stable. Through various methods, it's possible to make a situation where the droplets of substance A remain small and scattered uniformly in substance B. You can typically recognize an emulsion because it looks white. Fog and clouds are both emulsions of water in air, mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil in vinegar.</p>
<p>Emulsions have varying degrees of stability. It's possible for the suspended droplets to come together, aggregate, and separate out of the suspension. That's why you have to shake a can of spraypaint, or just stir a regular can of paint, to get the separated parts to mix back together long enough for you to paint with them. By contrast, mayonnaise is quite stable. </p>
<p>In order to make an emulsion, you might have to use an emulsifying agent, something that will break up substance A into those small droplets and then keep those droplets from coalescing. Soap does this with oils and grease on your skin. For mayonnaise, the emulsifier is the proteins found in egg whites. </p>
<p>And that's what the octyl stearate here is doing. Cosmetics are primarily oils, but they have small amounts of water suspended in them carrying something they want in the cosmetic that won't dissolve in oil. The stearate is keeping the water suspended in the oil and not separating out. </p>
<p>There's no need to be concerned about applying it to your skin; it's harmless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good reply. Also if you have a CAS number for the substance, you can look it up on the CAS website or PubChem, a database run by NIH which both list common synonyms of a substance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the first website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rich emollient branched chain monoester, developed specially for personal care and pharmaceutical applications. Rich, persistent branched chain emollient with a high viscosity. Excellent superfatting agent in surfactant systems and soaps. Effective glossing agent in shampoos and conditioners. Very good solvent for chemical sunscreens and wetting agent for physical sunscreens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So itâ€™s a nice emollient it seems</p></div>		</li>
