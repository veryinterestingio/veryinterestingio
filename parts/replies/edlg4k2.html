			<div class="markdown"><p>First, thanks for what I thought was the best answer out of like the 10 I looked at.</p>
<p>If someone doesn't get enough sleep... are they going to &quot;lose progress&quot; or will the body just make up for it in the next sleep cycle?  </p>
<p>To clarify, say you work on legs, once a week.  If that person only gets 5 hours of sleep that night, will they make up for it the rest of the week? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chronic sleep debt will lead to skin and muscle breakdown and, in extreme cases of prolonged sleeplessness, organ failure and death.  There have been animal studies to demonstrate this, and there is also an inherited fatal insomnia disease in which death is preceded by a bunch of terrible physical changes. So yes you’ll lose progress without sleep.</p>
<p>In less extreme conditions: Missing a couple hours of sleep one night will lead to something called REM rebound the next night. REM rebound is when your sleeping brain goes into REM sleep sooner and for longer than in would on a typical night, to try to make up for what it lost the night before. </p>
<p>So: I think if you fuck up your sleep the night after a workout you will fuck up some of your gainz. Your muscles are trying to heal and you are stealing precious healing time from them. Your body will compensate the next day but it won’t make up for lost time entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up. Is it more beneficial (for gainz) to work out at night, so you can get to deep sleep faster after a work out? If you were crazy dedicated to every miliounce of increase</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscle growth is a bit weird because it not only involves the duplication of cells, but the duplication of mitochondria is also key. </p>
<p>I would say that they are going to lose some progress, but the body will catchup. More slowly, and with added soreness and risk of injury.</p></div>		</li>
