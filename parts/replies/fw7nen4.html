			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I actually interpreted some graph incorrectly - I think the drop happens later, at about 40-50% pressure drop.   <a href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2387020616307045-gr1.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2387020616307045-gr1.jpg" target="_blank">https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2387020616307045-gr1.jpg</a></a>   - though I'm not sure I believe this plot either. </p>

<p>It seems like many of the tables and charts are very confusing because partial pressure of oxygen in your lungs is lower than that in the outside air (because when you breath out, you leave some air in your lungs that has less oxygen) and so on.</p></div>		</li>
