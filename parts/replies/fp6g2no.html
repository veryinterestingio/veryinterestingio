			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern drives don't need explicit parking. Due to the way the motors are built, their neutral position is to be parked. They require active power to maintain position. The instant power is taken away, they return to neutral.</p>
<p>What you may hear when power is removed is an audible click when the head returns uncontrolled to park.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correctly written software should ensure that any data saved by the user is really on disk (&quot;flushed&quot;) by the time the save operation ends, and also write data in such a way that it can never leave half-written data (&quot;atomically&quot;). One way to do this is to save the data to a new filename behind the scenes, then rename it over the actual file the user is working on. Either the old file is there, or the new one. There is no point in time where the data is lost or corrupted on disk.</p>
<p>The problem is there is a <em>lot</em> of poorly written software out there that doesn't follow these rules properly. So while you can get away with hard shutdowns on modern hardware and modern OSes without issue, and while you won't have any trouble with software designed for reliability (e.g. any database system that is properly designed, like PostgreSQL, with safe/default configuration), if you make a habit of doing hard shutdowns, at <em>some</em> point you're going to run into shitty software doing a write operation unsafely and leaving a file corrupt.</p></div>		</li>

However, this service must be explicitly provided by the application, due to performance reasons the underlying operating system wonâ€™t provide it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I remember losing an entire floppy full of resumes when some glitch in either Multimate or DOS trashed the floppy. I was not happy about that, but I learned from it to create redundant backups for everything. Good times...</p></div>		</li>
