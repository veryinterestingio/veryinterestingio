			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of the marine crocodylians show up in the oceans before cetaceans evolved (e.g. the thoracosaurs of the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene). However, most of the marine members belonging to Crocodylia (i.e. share a close common ancestor with living species) are still semi-aquatic. They probably would have been restricted to coastal and estuarine environments, and thus were probably not in direct competition with cetaceans. Other marine mammalian carnivores (like sea otters, some seals or sea lions) are also mostly restricted to coastal regions, but they tend to be found in cold waters. Crocodylians, as you might expect from their current geographic range, are restricted to fairly warm water environments. The existence of cetaceans might possibly explain why we haven't seen any members of the group move into more open ocean environments in the Cenozoic.</p></div>		</li>
