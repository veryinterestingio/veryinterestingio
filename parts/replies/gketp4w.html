			<div class="markdown"><p>I was watching a video where they were making fuel tanks for SpaceX. The engineer said they aim for a safety margin of 10%. So a part should only hold up to 110% of its expected load. He seemed kind of cocky that it was how knew the stresses it would be under. That is frighteningly close tolerances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rocket tanks usually have vents so that if overpressure is an issue, they can vent the excess pressure. Usually because a launch has been scrubbed, and liquid fuels are cryogenic, so need to be removed before they boil/expand.</p>
<p>And sudden overpressures are usually a sign that something very bad has happened inside the tank (see: AMOS-6), so even if you put in a very overdesigned tank inside, the mission would need to be aborted anyway. and overdesigning a tank so that it wouldn't just burst from such a shock would make the rocket too heavy to fly.</p></div>		</li>
