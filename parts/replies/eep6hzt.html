<p>hm.... I wonder if the progression of CG will change that.  Could we end up with short people doing motion capture and voice modulation instead of employing children in the future?  If realistic alternatives are the reason cited, and legislators' motives are ACTUALLY to protect children then... why not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>CGI is expensive and time consuming to edit.</p>
<p>And you need still need actors to act it out. The CGI just mimics actual actors. Maybe you could get away with non-actors doing the motion capture stuff but I feel like filmmakers would rather hire someone who could act out body language really well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an actor, so I may be able to answer some of this. </p>
<p>Mocap is motion capture. You've probably seen it on behind the scenes videos. In a big, empty room with tracking cameras all over the place, actors wear a bunch of balls on a skin-tight suit and have dots painted on their face and then an avatar of them is animated. Typically it's for big CG movies or video games. Sometimes the actors have their voices replaced, or they're recorded separately. In games, you see kids replaced by adults all the time. The Last of Us. Resident Evil 2. Some parts it's acceptable and it makes more sense to do that. For film/tv, it's a different story. </p>
<p>But trying to mocap a performance and toss it into your shots for your live-action project is an insanely epic task. The cost of renting a mocap studio and crew is colossal. As would be the teams required to animate them, design them, do cleanup on the mocap, continue the dev work on the technology, etc. If it's a fully CG world, it doesn't bug us to watch it. But when we're watching live action/CG integration, we're still nitpicking every shot. We know while watching that the Muppets are actually in the scene with the actors and Ted is not. We haven't fully made it there yet. And if you're doing this for a live action production, you'd need a massive VFX team and lighting team to composite, roto, integrate, track animate shadows, make sure those interactions are realistic, etc. And do you hire a bunch of 30 year-old women who naturally sound 8 to do all the voices? What if the character is 3? Maaaaaybe in the future you'll have AI that can make realistic sounding kids. But it's so far away and way too many hurdles have to be conquered. Google Upspeak or Voice Assistant, that thing might make you think it's doable. But it really isn't, and certainly not right now. Those might be done by speech synthesis. Those might require hiring actors to do hundreds of thousands of words and submit them in a database in which a post process could adjust intonations, or pick from a  library of words or however the tech actually blends words into sentences. That might require recording kids all day every day for months, hoping their voices don't change mid recording, just to future-proof the need to use children in films. Then, what happens when you have to program kids of different backgrounds, ethnicities, etc. How many kids will have to go through that recording process to be perfect to satisfy the needs of Hollywood to represent diversity properly. Or, say a kid has to give a unique emotional scene like in The Sixth Sense. You still have to probably have a kid record lines with those emotions, and to various degrees, for filmmakers to be able to pick and choose with them. And how would it all look in the end? Imagine Harry Potter where all the kids are CG. Wouldn't that look super weird? Or Home Alone.</p>
<p>So, like if you were doing a small movie like Room, as a small indie talking about a single mother who was held captive with her kid in a room and then eventually escaped, do you raise the 40 million required to make a CG kid? Or do you shoot it for the 13 million you were able to raise. And if you think Hollywood is just people with big money, maybe for the biggest studios. Maybe they can take chances like that. But filmmakers don't all just have a magic pile of money to pull from. They get investors, raise capital. Imagine raising money for an idea you have for a blender. There are a million blenders out there. What makes yours special that it has potential to earn money back? Same with film. It's a product you have to prove is so important to investors that it needs to be made, or that it's so good it's a guaranteed sale. It's not easy for them to raise piles of money on a film that may potentially go nowhere. So it would put a barrier to entry for all other film makers to not be able to use children in their films. Well, if the technology is developed, why don't film makers just use that? The way I would think of it is, if it's a niche product that cost billions of dollars to develop, developers would recoup their costs by licensing their software. And not every production could afford to do that for each production where they wanted to have kids. It's just cheaper to get kids, limit the number of shots they're in, and make the film.</p>
<p>And yes, filming with children does have its negative aspects. Child actors having to deal with fame around other kids their age. Exploitative parents. Working on some horrible productions where they don't care about the kids. The seedier producers. People sharing drugs or booze around like it was the 80's (it's much more cleaned up now). Having to try and educate them while they also have to study for roles, and putting that pressure on them. And from working with kids  and parents in the industry, the best of the bunch have great attitudes. As long as the kid gets his school work done and enjoys it, and the parents can supervise, generally everyone's happy. And there are a lot of laws protecting them from stunts and all that, too. They're not earning a paycheck. They treat it like their after-school activity. Not all of them are perfect at it, but there are a lot of instances where it's okay. It's very different from having kids do manual labor, or having them have to develop a specialized skill early, or do repetitive tasks for long hours for the benefit of maximizing corporate profits. Big difference between playing pretend on a set for a few hours a day and working a 12-hour assembling iPhone parts, then going back to your Foxconn dorm afterward. </p>
<p>Ultimately, it's cost-prohibitive to try and develop a gigantic library of performance, both for voice and body capture, to try and create simulation children. So it's not going to be seen probably any time soon.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Do we? That's at odds with the stereotype. I wonder what we might learn from an analysis of present and former child actors' psychological profiles as compared with control groups of children and adults who had more typical childhood experiences. </p></div>		</li>
