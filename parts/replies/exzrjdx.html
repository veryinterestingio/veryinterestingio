			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just about to post a similar follow up, because I think this is absolutely true. Even now, speaking to grandparents vs. younger folks, there is a different rhythm and intonation to the way they speak. When I hear old interviews of ordinary people it's even more pronounced (no pun intended, haha). Is it just that communication changes with different generations, lifestyles, available media, etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's just normal language drift over time.  Written and recorded language has kept it from drifting too far, but this is normal. Before writing and recording were widespread, this is one of the ways in which languages would evolve into other languages, given a few generations of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite things regarding language was oddly enough, an episode of Naruto. He was visited by a sage that was talking in 1500's era japanese, sort of like shakespeares english to us, and naruto can sort of understand him but he has the same reaction most of us did while reading shakespeare in highschool. </p>
<p>Then the sage ended up swapping between different eras of japanese dialect until he started speaking slang and naruto was able to understand him 100%</p>
<p>So it was like the sage saying something like &quot;thou shalt be thine&quot; then saying &quot;im sorry, is it easier to understand if i say &quot;I want to eat your ass? &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one reason translating ancient texts is so difficult, or even relatively simple modern language translations for that matter. Besides different phrases being used and words with multiple meanings depending on context (I'm looking at you English), something as simple as the order of two or three words could convey completely opposite meanings...</p>
<p>Especially given that in ancient literate cultures only about 1% know how to read or write (not even royalty in most cases), you'd see drastic changes from one generation to the next within the scribe class... You can pretty much compare this to people today using &quot;internet&quot; acronyms while attempting to explain something to someone born 60 years ago and not at all accustomed to these phrases. After a catastrophe such as a plague, natural disaster, etc., and remembering only 1% of the population could read or write, it didn't take much to effectively knock them out of the picture, and it often took many many years for the newer scribe class to catch up with the previous ones. One of the suspected reasons here relates to the clarity of accents being used in broadcasting - writen words were often formatted more formally but drastically short-form compared to normal conversations (using a clay tablet, for example, required the writing to be impressed into the clay and then baked to prevent the message being changed by someone else - a rather lengthy and space conscious process), which all was supposed to work by almost using a lingua-franca, but in reality was more like trying to have a normal conversation using just legalese...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think this is set by the mood and tone of society during that time period, or do you think with the spread of audio entertainment there were like influencers who people liked and so like that generation sort of mimics the cool people the hear on the radio or tv/movie. Probably some of both? And likely other factors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've noticed anecdotally seeing some video of &quot;regular people&quot; in local news clips and home video even from the early 90s is that the regional dialect was a lot stronger and more common then. I was around then; I live in the same region I did then. When I do hear someone talk like that now it seems odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s just cultural language and every generation learns from their environment which is constantly changing and thus so does the accent. Also separate from the tone and style, you also see one of the biggest difference is just how they articulate certain sounds and syllables</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a movie called this sporting life. From the 50s iirc. It's about a rugby player in Yorkshire.... and god. The accents. They sound more like people from the north east today. Its as if the poshness has moved north, pulling everything a notch towards it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wouldn't base much on a <em>drama</em> movie for what accents were like. That's simply a product of the UK film board.  The lead in that is <em>Irishman</em> Richard Harris doing his best &quot;ey up muther&quot; broad northerner voice.</p>
<p>It was novel enough to show working class people.
They didn't bother to put the actors though any kind of accent training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I can even tell a distinct kind of sing-songiness in a lot of women's voices from the '90s that isn't there now.  Only women though, the guys haven't changed as much. I first noticed it rewatching &quot;The Bird Cage&quot;- nobody sounds like the kid's girlfriend anymore.</p></div>		</li>
