<p>Although sometimes I find I look less attractive in photos even when it's flipped the other way.</p>
<p>Is there a way to ever know accurately how other people see you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was hoping someone would share this, as I believe it’s by far the biggest factor here. When you look in a mirror, you’re seeing with both eyes and therefore get a wider and more 3D view of yourself and your features.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a more in depth explanation of what's happening taken from the comments on the article</p>
<p>&quot;These are cool images but I think it’s worth putting some effort to explain exactly what’s going on here. </p>
<p>The reason the subject is occupying the same amount of space on the frame is because each time a longer focal length is used, the photographer is physically moving the camera farther away from the subject. The longer focal lengths actually have a more narrow field of view and so in order for the subject to appear to occupy the same space, the photographer must move back (otherwise you’d get the effect of “zooming in”). </p>
<p>How is that significant? Because the closer you are to the subject, the more substantial the distance between his features are. If you’re only standing 9 inches away from the man, his nose will be very close to you and his shoulders might be 3-4 times farther away from you than his nose; his nose will look quite a bit larger. It’s just like using a forced perspective technique by taking a picture of an arm where the fingers are right up near the lens but the person is standing in front of the lens; his fingers might occupy the same amount of space as his head!</p>
<p>As you physically move backwards, the relative distance of those features to each other doesn’t change but their relative distance to the camera does! Using a 200 mm lens you might need to be standing back a good 20 feet to get a picture like this (just estimating). At that distance, the subject’s shoulders are no longer 3-4 times farther from you than his nose; both his nose and shoulders are about the same distance from you. The result is that the nose gets less distorted and the subject flattens out quite a bit.</p>
<p>You can test this out yourself, simply look at a person while standing very close and then look at them from far away; there’s no real trickery here, the same thing happens with your eyes (you just can’t freeze the moment in time and review it later). </p>
<p>This is why when I do shoots for people who are self-conscious about their weight I tend to use a lens with a shorter focal length and wider field of view because it forces me to get closer to them. Getting closer to the subject causes their body parts to overlap more. Especially for female clients, this generally results in their curves overlapping in more flattering ways. Shooting from far away with a telephoto lens tends to flatten subjects out and make them look heavier. </p>
<p>This is also why sports photography, especially sports videography, tends to have that strange effect where two players are actually a fair distance from each other but they seem to be standing right next to each other. The photographer might be 400 m away from them and the players are 10 m away from each other. At nearly 30 feet apart they’re not even close enough for a casual conversation but relative to the extreme distance of the photographer, they’re actually pretty close, and their sizes relative to each other will not be that extreme for that same reason.</p>
<p>The stars in the night sky have a similar effect. The objects your seeing are vastly different in size and even shape but they’re all so very far away that their relative sizes are often hard to distinguish.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider that your phone will be applying various image processing algorithms to lighting, etc, even if you don't select any filters.  So in addition to a right/left swap you'll also be getting maybe significant changes in lighting/coloring.     </p>
<p>The best guess I've got on how other people see you (and it'll vary from person to person, 'cause part of that is mental), is to see video clips taken by other people when you weren't paying attention.  That'll get your natural movement and behavior (and seeing things in motion is important for understanding them too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>kind of the same reason a lot of people hate to hear their voice played back on a recording.  you are used to hearing it when you speak partially from vibrations in your skull, so when you hear it 'unfiltered' through a recording it sounds way different.</p></div>		</li>
