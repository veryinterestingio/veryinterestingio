			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuine question since I don't know how people in music works. Do you not prepare the tracklist and/or transitions beforehand? If not, why not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the situation - a big name dj on tour will likely have a tracklist set up in advance, but smaller dj's , like one at a nightclub adjust what they're playing to the audience, some things just vibe better with a crowd on different nights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For weddings, you generally get given a song list, and some things are set in stone (like their first dance, and their last 3), but the rest needs to able to adapt to the night. Photos went too long? Need filler. Dad's speech went for 25 minutes? Need to cut some things. No one's dancing to this shitty song list? Time to improvise. Throw in the fact taking requests is basically demanded, and 80% of song lists are incomplete, and a prepared track just wouldn't work.</p>
<p>In these situations, and anything other than a wedding, you need to be able to read the room, and play songs to suit the crowd. That ability is arguably what seperates a good DJ from a bad one; and you'd be surprised what some crowds dance to, I frequently was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worst part is - a lot of the requested songs are going to bomb. The drunk sister wants to dance to a particular song, which no one else likes and once you play it (after her telling me she's waiting for it for 30minutes after 5) she goes outside for a smoke and after the song she complains you never played it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you use Apple Music or Spotify to DJ these days? Is there a way to beat match songs from iTunes downloaded through Apple Music, you could take any request that way and you can save the usual songs for offline playback in case 5G drops out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, good DJs have a way to source new content on location. The only legal way to do that at the time was iTunes. You still couldn't do it with with streaming platforms though, that would violate your music license (have to own a copy of the song). You'd want a local copy to load into your mixing software anyway.</p>
<p>My issue was half the places people have weddings are in the middle of nowhere, and reception was unreliable, so I didn't advertise that I could do it.</p></div>		</li>
