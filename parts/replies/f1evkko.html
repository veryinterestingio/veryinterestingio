			<div class="markdown"><p>The Great Lakes (for sure Superior, not 100% sure on the others) were created during a rift in the North American Plate in which the continent nearly split in two. It didn't quite split, but did leave a depression in the middle, which filled with sediment over time. Then the glaciers came and scraped away much of the sediment and dumped it south of the lakes. So it's a combination of things at play.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>yup. and so we see these south of the great lakes all over the land here (speaking from western NY):</p>

<p>these are weird and cool. they are meandering wrinkly ridges that counterintuitively were the bottom of a river/ stream in the glacier where all this rubble and silt was deposited. when everything melted the bottom of the groove became the top of a ridge</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live just west of Toronto. We have two massive ravines that run through my town on the shores of Lake Ontario. They are over 150 feet deep in some spots and today have gentle little creeks flowing through them to the lake. These creeks are 2-10 feet deep and 10-15 feet wide. But the Ravines themselves can be as much as a mile wide or more in spots.</p>
<p>These ravines were absolutely cut by glacial melt water.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence were formed from a different glacial effect and tectonic activity. But once formed a later ice age(s) cut hundreds of ravines through melt throughout the region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you talking specifically about the channelled scablands in Washington?</p>
<p>The phenomenon that likely shaped them - a recurring ice dam on a glacial lake - isn't that uncommon (on a geological timescale, at least). There's one in Patagonia that occurs every four years or so. Likely, there were a lot of them all along the southern edge of the ice sheet. There are a lot of smaller incidents (a lot of replies in this thread giving some excellent examples), but the glacial Lake Missoula was just an order of magnitude larger than the rest. It's simply a matter of scale. Small glacial lakes are way more common than huge ones. (There was one in the Altay region of Russia of a similar scale to Missoula, though).</p></div>		</li>
