			<div class="markdown"><p>totally, if it's doable it works great I imagine. I'm just thinking of like the tiny tunnel across the small channel in the bay near my house that's definitely not solid bedrock and not that deep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shorter tunnels are usually built in segments and sunk into a small trench, then welded together underwater. The Baltimore Harbor tunnels, the bridge-tunnels in Hampton Roads, the Detroit-Windsor tunnel, and the Mobile River tunnels were all bult this way, IIRC, whereas the Holland and Lincoln tunnels were bored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tunnel is a long steel tube, it isn't as if they just carve out a hole. The surrounding material wouldn't have much to do with the integrity of the tunnel itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't even have to be bedrock, though that helps. But yeah the earth shielded TBMs are quite common.</p>
<p>For example one of the issues for the needed Gateway tunnel between NYC and New Jersey and adding to the cost is that the geology there is very hard rock with sandy layers in between that makes it hard for the machine to work.</p></div>		</li>
