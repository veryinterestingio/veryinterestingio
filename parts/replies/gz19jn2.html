<p>Water boils at 100 degC at atmospheric pressure, but it boils at 120 degC at 2 * atmospheric pressure. </p>
<p>It’s really the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the molecule (the pressure the vapour molecules put on the liquid when it’s in thermodynamic equilibrium) is equal to the atmospheric pressure that something boils.</p></div>		</li>
