			<div class="markdown"><p>I live near the Viking Aircraft facility. They produce the Twin Otter under license. Absolutely fantastic airframe and the modern version is in high demand in Russia and Baltic states. A real workhorse in a seaplane config. A modern bush-plane so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not under license. Viking purchased the Type Certificate for the DHC-2 through the 6 or 7 a while back and started manufacturing it. Not long ago they purchased the TC for the 8 (and 7 of they hadn’t, not sure when they acquired the 7) and the rights for the DeHavilland Canada brand, so the new planes will be once again branded as DeHavilland Canada.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an airplane is in a skidding condition (fuselage misaligned with the relative wind), the sideways force on the wing tends to roll it into a bank -- which will correct the heading.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Stability vs maneuverability is a fundamental tradeoff in aircraft design. Trying to line up with a runway in turbulence, or join up with a tanker, can be very difficult if the airplane is too stable.</p></div>		</li>
