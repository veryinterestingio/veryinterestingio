			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, when I lived in a rural area our address was purely a mailing identifier: &quot;Route 1, Box 201A&quot; it said very little about our physical location. Didn't even have the street on it. So we also had &quot;fire numbers&quot;, a five-digit number assigned to each rural house that the fire department knew where you were. That one wasn't usable for mailing, just dispatching emergency people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our distance number in NC is based on 1000/mile.   2579 Bumpy Country rd would 2.579 from its origin point.  This origin point is not necessarily the start of the road and may start further up in the line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in many older places in the US multiple towns grew together over time. So the numbers will continue sequentially despite the name of the road changing 3 times in a 5 mile span. Or vice versa. The numbers will change town to town (the division between towns now invisible to the eye) but the road name stays the same.</p></div>		</li>
