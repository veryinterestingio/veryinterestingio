			<div class="markdown"><p>LinkedIn is the worst.  I kept getting spam emails from them a bunch of years ago because my cousin's husband dumped his entire email contacts list into LI for potential contacts.  I kept clicking on the link within the email to stop receiving requests and marking those emails as spam, but the emails kept coming.</p>
<p>A couple years ago I went back to school, and one of the classes required a LinkedIn account.  In order to pass the class, I created a new email address to link to the LI account, and I deleted that email account once that class was done.  I tried to delete the LI account as well, but I'm sure that it's still out there somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I unsubbed from everything. Change every single setting from that site in my profile. Even suspended my account. The only way i could stop it was deleting the account. Quora are the worst for spam. You get a different email from a different recommended category every day that you never clicked on or subbed to. And there's no stopping it.</p>
<p>I love the ones you don't even see are from Quora until you read the small print.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just mark it as spam/junk. When you do this it’s like filing an electronic chargeback and it goes all the way back the chain to them. </p>
<p>As an e-marketer nothing stings more than someone who had accidentally marked something as Spam/Junk. There is no reviving delivery to that address in many cases as the ESP, the customers provider, the customer’s email client will all be on the lookout.</p>
<p>One less nuclear option is to use the unsub links provided at the top of iOS mail/Gmail clients. Marketers are being held to a pretty straightforward standard with those links and are providing them in exchange for whitelisting and deliverability. They have less control over what the links do and their intended purpose as an “unsub from marketing”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on which email you use, you might find my solution to a lot of spam that can't seem to find it's way to trash itself helpful: put them in a folder.</p>
<p>In my outlook account I have a folder that basically takes in all the kind of subscriptions that automatically activate when making accounts to online stores and whatnot. I only do this to the ones I don't care about of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other issue is simply bad data, and companies have a ton of it.</p>
<p>Your email was unsubscribed successfully, but unfortunately they have 4 other contacts in their database with near identical info and using your email.</p>
<p>Perhaps one has the time you misspelled your first name. Another has the time you used an initial instead.</p></div>		</li>
