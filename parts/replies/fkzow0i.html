			<div class="markdown"><p>From the CDC: &quot;For initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19, CDC recommends collecting and testing upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab). CDC also recommends testing lower respiratory tract specimens, if available. For patients who develop a productive cough, sputum should be collected and tested for COVID-19. </p>
<p>Basically, they <a href="https://www.kob.com/kobtvimages/repository/2020-03/nasopharngeal-swab.png" target="_blank">stick a swab in your nose</a> as far back as they can get it. Sputum is another name for the shit you cough up. Then they take that sample and do DNA analysis looking for a match for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On this note - jamming that swab in your nose causes you to cough and/or sneeze - which is dangerous for whoever is doing the jamming. That's why there's such a high rate of transmission for healthcare workers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tests for COVID-19 aren’t blood tests, they’re tests for viral genetic material done on respiratory specimens such as a throat swab or sputum sample. These tests may be supported by medical imaging, as well as by looking at symptoms.</p>

<p>so what that is saying is the test is not a quick one, most of the &quot;tests&quot; they are doing is a simple questonaire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With Sjogren's I always have a cough and a fever. Are they looking for high fevers? When I feel weirdly off, CV is the first thing I think about. We have no idea what the prevalence is in my city because tests are nearly impossible to get. I just posted on another social media platform a doctor's long effort to get someone tested that was fruitless.   </p>
<p>What the hell is the delay in getting tests to people? Lab Corp said they don't want people coming into their labs for tests in order to protect their staff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to nitpick, but it’s not purely the respiratory tract — there is also very clear evidence of the virus being neurotransmissable, and post mortems are showing high levels of virus concentration in the brainstem. (But commenter is correct that the virus is not blood borne.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the virus get to the brainstem if it's not in blood? Is there a non-circulatory pathway from the lungs to the nervous system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are exactly correct. The virus is capable of crossing the synaptic barrier between the lung tissue and the baroreceptors (nerves that provide feedback about the pressure inside the lungs). From the baroreceptors, it travels into the central nervous system and fixates on the brainstem. The brainstem is the regulatory center for respiration. There is evidence that this is a significant contributing factor to respiratory failure in addition to the virus’s local effects on respiratory tissue. Evidence also points to active virus infection remaining present in the central nervous system even following complete recovery. We do not know the long term implications of this yet, but there may be some that we discover in the long term (I.e., think of varicella virus that causes chicken pox, which also stays in the central nervous system long term, and can come out again later to cause shingles).</p></div>		</li>
