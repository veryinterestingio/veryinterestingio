			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps we do to a degree, but it’s not quite the same structure. If you look at the legs of creatures that will travel in the snow, they often have a thinner pinch point. On our bodies, it’s our ankle. It’s pretty close to the ground and fairly wide as compared to say, a deers. At these points the vessels are forced closer together for longer runs allowing more transfer of heat. But, because of the same transfer length, the body doesn’t get shocked by the difference in temperature between the extremities and the core body.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right , gradients are important. And we have huge floppy hands and feet compared to deer and wolves for example. But I really think people forget how much heat is generated by physical activity. I was just working on a small construction project in 25F weather and I had to strip down to jeans and a T-shirt and I was still sweating. Animals don’t sit in the snow watching TV all day lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do this yes. </p>
<p>But our bodies also care nore about maintaining core temperature bc birds are exothermic, and will reduce metabolic needs as temperature decreases. We are endotherms so need to keep our core temp up. </p>
<p>To do this, we use blood shunting, where basically oyr bodies cut off blood supply to our extremidies.</p></div>		</li>
