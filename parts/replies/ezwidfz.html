			<div class="markdown"><p>Slate's linguistics podcast, &quot;Lexicon Valley&quot;, recently did an episode addressing exactly this, called <a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/lexicon-valley/2019/08/john-mcwhorter-on-language-versus-dialect" target="_blank">&quot;Language vs Dialect.&quot;</a></p>
<p>The tldr is that it's a mostly arbitrary distinction. Or perhaps more precisely, it's a political distinction, not a linguistic one. While the traditional definition of dialect usually refers to a concept called &quot;mutual intelligibility&quot; (ie can we understand each other), there are so many exceptions to this &quot;rule&quot; that it really can't be said to be a rule at all. </p>
<p>Rather, if you come from your own country and have the ability to call your particular dialect its own language, you probably do. But if two separate dialects originate within the same country, they're likely to never rise to become distinct languages, regardless of their differences. </p>
<p>That's the trend, at least. But that's kind of the point. There is no actual rule that is remotely consistent when examined with any level of scrutiny. It's just politics, and linguistics doesn't provide a clear distinction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't.  Hanover German isn't the same as standard German, dialectal speakers there are influenced by low German.  Midwestern American isn't neutral at all.  Standard/formal registers are developed politically and not necessarily around a specific region, and most language speakers can use either their local dialect or a more formal register.  Midwestern American (technically Inland North or Central Midland) has all sorts of crazy vowel shifts and different ones between city and rural speakers, a great example being heard in Netflix's &quot;Making a Murderer.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn't allowed to dub his lines in Terminator 2 into German. Arnie is a native German speaker, but has an Austrian accent, which is roughly like the American southern hillbilly accent. It would have been ludicrous for a killing machine from the future to talk like a hillbilly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Midwesterner here from west of Chicago. I always thought my dialect was neutral, until I moved to Colorado. I don't have a strong rural midwest accent, or anything too northern like Wisconsin or Minnesota, but I still catch myself saying &quot;goin' on out der&quot;. It's some obvious now it echoes in my head when I hear myself say things. &quot;Waddaya think yer doo-in'?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since I wrote this part already before the comment got deleted: I think you misunderstood the question.</p>
<p>Linguists absolutely acknowledge that there are standard forms of languages. In fact, we can even talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_language" target="_blank">standardization</a>.</p>
<p>/u/ConanTheProletarian , it may be worth reading that wiki page first, but largely it comes down to a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ruling class: this is often based on wealth, race, and other sociocultural factors that put a certain group as the 'ruling class' over other speakers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>writing system: the dialect which correlates most with the standardized written form</p>
</li>
<li>language ideologies: concepts of what language is or should be and how a specific dialect relates to or adopts those concepts</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
