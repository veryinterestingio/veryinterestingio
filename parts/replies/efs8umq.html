			<div class="markdown"><p>Half lager half lemonade is a shandy in the uk. Or 95% beer with 5% lemonade is a lager top. </p>
<p>They're pretty rank but half lager half cider is a snakebite commonly served with black currant cordial (snakebite and black) I haven't had one in a decade or more but I definitely used to enjoy them frequently. I also had questionable hair and taste in men. So impossible to conclude if they're nice or not.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Commonly known as diesel.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that there is a north-south divide on snakebite and diesel.</p>
<p>In the south, snakebite has the blackcurrant, in the north, it does not.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allegedly, a German innkeeper was waiting for his cyclist regulars, when he found out that he did not have enough beer. So he blended the remaining beer with a fresh citrus lemonade. The regulars really liked the new drink, so it became popular.   There's no evidence of the story, but it seems legit enough.</p>
<p>Leinenkeugel's (a Wisconsin brewery) does a ton of different shandys, and they run a commercial every summer talking about this story also. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Apparently small sample size preceded by fasting is a common flaw in studies that show sports drinks are better than water. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-dont-need-sports-drinks-to-stay-hydrated/" target="_blank">link to good but long article on the subject of bad sports drink science</a></p></div>		</li>
