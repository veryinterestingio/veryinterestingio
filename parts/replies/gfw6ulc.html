			<div class="markdown"><p>We dilute Dawn dish soap between 10 to 20 to 1 with warm water (so it shake mixes faster) and put that in the hand soap dispensers. If you go too high of concentration you'll end up with 'dish pan hands' and skin cracking. We've used it in normal liquid dispensers and the foaming ones too.</p>
<p>Dawn is about the best grease cutter of all the P&amp;G dish soaps and many mechanics will use it to degrease their hands after working on the car/truck. I'm sure you've seen the advertisements of how it's used on animals after oil spills. So we have trusted it more than other hand soaps or their possible replacements during these current times.</p>
<p>I was looking for beard butter/oil/conditioner last year and all of the products by all the brands started with coconut oil and then fragrances. It's easy to get coconut oil at 1/20th or less of the price per ounce of the branded stuff. Add your own fragrance.</p></div>		</li>
