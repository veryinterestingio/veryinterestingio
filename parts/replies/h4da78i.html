			<div class="markdown"><p>:) it might go without saying, to you, that one washes the meat before patting it... but this is the internet. Also I've just seen far too many people just plonk their meats into their pans without washing it first, so sometimes I suspect this is some kind of well-kept secret. So to avoid food poisoning for some individuals, maybe add step 1...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get a vacuum packing machine, like a foodsaver. Get meat as fresh as you can, remove it from the store packaging and immediately portion it into whatever amounts you think are appropriate - even thickness and flatter is better, especially for ground meat. Put it in a proper vacuum storage bag and pull a strong vacuum so that there is zero air left around the meat (if you've applied a proper vaccum, the packaged meat should feel pretty solid, even before freezing), let the bag seal (most machines do this automatically after the proper vacuum is reached) and store it deep in a very cold chest freezer where the temperature won't change much. The faster you freeze it solid, the better it will store.</p>
<p>Meat stored this way will last years, if not longer.  </p>
<p>Even if you don't have a vacuum sealer, you can extend the life of regular frozen meat (or anything) by removing as much air as possible and sealing it tightly. Place it in a zipper freezer bag and leave one corner of the zip open, then submerge the bag in water up to the zipper line. The water pressure will force a lot of the air out of the bag, so you can seal it up and keep a partial vacuum inside the bag. It won't be nearly as good as a vacuum sealing machine, but it will help a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big bowl of water, meat in plastic bag, slowly lower bag with meat inside bag into water. Water will push out all the air through the open top of bag. There videos on YouTube if you want a video of the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this to suggest freezer burn is exacerbated by air around the frozen food? Genuinely curious—most of the time I get to the frozen meats before freezer burn but not always...</p>
<p>Edit* Lol I’m dumb and googled “freezer burn” so yea it has to do with oxidation. </p>
<p>Thank you for your response!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the freezer built into your refrigerator doesn't have anything regulating the temp to a constant zero.  It cycles on and off based on the internal temperature, so there is plenty of chance for a thaw to get going and then a refreeze.  Rinse and repeat that over months and you can see how the environment to support new life might be created.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, and a lot of modern freezers actually have heating elements built into the back wall to prevent the coils from icing up over time. I have actually experienced less reliable freezers completely thaw items that are near the back wall during automatic de-icing cycles. Also DO NOT store meat in the freezer door.</p>
<p>If you want to store food very long term, you'll have better results with a chest freezer, ideally a deep-freezer that can maintain a temperature of -18C (0F) or below.</p></div>		</li>
