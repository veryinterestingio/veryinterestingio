			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, but a falling canister might be cliped on the regulator, which is by far the weakest part of a compressed tank. They're also heavy AF, large metal cans that are filled with liquid. You don't want them falling on someone because it's not properly secured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isaac Asimov wrote a murder mystery novel (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_Dealers" target="_blank">A Whiff of Death</a>)  in which the murderer lubricated part of an oxygen tank's regulator with something like glycerol that would have exploded on contact with oxygen, displacing the regulator and leaving the heavy oxygen tank to rattle around the room like a cross between a sledge hammer and a bottle rocket. In the novel the potential victim noticed the hazard before the worst could happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI, NOT liquid in most cases. Liquid oxygen is cryogenic, and stored in stainless steel, double wall insulated &quot;dewar&quot; style tanks. These are almost always silvery stainless steel colored tanks with a much larger diameter :)</p></div>		</li>

<li>It's a big, heavy chunk of metal, so whatever it falls on is getting messed up.</li>
<li>There's extra danger if the valve gets sheared off, then it takes off like a rocket. A poorly aimed, careless rocket. In such accidents the phrase &quot;drunken torpedo&quot; almost always gets tossed around.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the cylinder wall is typically more than heavy enough, for pressure reasons alone, to take a fall, but as others have said, it's the valve getting sheared off during the fall that poses a risk. The larger industrial sized cylinders have a heavy, threaded on valve cap that is to be left on whenever the cylinder is not in use. And if the valve comes off, it can become a projectile easily, but won't necessarily explode. Just having all that extra oxygen in the room with flammable materials just makes it way easier for a fire to start, and get out of control very quickly.</p></div>		</li>
