			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all this agree with. I get it. What I was more interested in was if someone who was not vaccinated could infect someone who has up to date vaccinations? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real danger is to other unvaccinated people - and there are legitimate reasons to not be vaccinated - but vaccines aren't 100% effective. However, the real power of vaccines is not in protecting individuals, it's in protecting populations, with what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity" target="_blank">herd immunity</a>. Of course, that means that they are most powerful when most people are vaccinated.</p>
<p>We only need to look at things like recent measles outbreaks to see the damage that the anti-vaccine movement is doing. It's not just to themselves.</p>
<hr />
<p>That being said, I don't get a flu shot every year; I probably haven't gotten one since I was a child. But the flu is not likely to kill me and I don't hang around at-risk populations. However, these are factors that I consider before making the decision, so that I can be sure that I'm not going to be harming people. I doubt your coworker has considered these things. And lets not forget that the real danger with the anti-vaccine crowd is that they aren't vaccinating their children, which means they are risking serious harm to people who aren't themselves; people who they are supposed to be acting as caregivers for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to feel the same way about the flu shot, but you really can't be sure that you are not harming others by not getting it. You may not be at high risk, but 1) you don't know that everyone you interact with is not at-risk, even if they appear to be healthy adults, 2) healthy adults can still (albeit rarely) become seriously ill or even die from influenza, 3) you may be infecting other healthy adults who do hang around at-risk populations. Getting your flu shot is an easy and incredibly low-risk way to help keep vulnerable people in your community safe, I hope you'll reconsider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the virus can mutate and become infectious to people who were immunized for an earlier lineage of the virus that did not have the new virulent mutation.  Immunization was effective for previous strain, new mutated strain overcomes this immunity. It's not extremely likely, but each infected individual is like 10-100 million dice rolls towards potential mutations, and maybe 1 in 10 million mutations could result in a more dangerous virus with no current immunization.
(These numbers are completely conjecture for the sake of simplification, not hard science).</p></div>		</li>
