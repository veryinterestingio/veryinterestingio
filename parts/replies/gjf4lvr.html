			<div class="markdown"><p>How do contemporary artists know if they're any good at art? Or how do they feel about pursuing something where their degree of accomplishment is effectively defined by some rando who is likely only notable for having a lot of cash? Classical (or whatever the correct term is) pieces seem particularly intricate, realistic, or pleasant to look at. Contemporary art seems like it can be none of those things (e.g., Andy Warhol's soup can comes to mind).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being 'good at art' is quite ambiguous since the postmodern period set in. Basically, all of the older ways of determining what made art good was out of the window, and art was more used as making statements and evoking feelings than to be esthetically pleasing (The last thing was already setting on in the early 1900's due to the invention of the photograph: painters were not needed anymore to accurately depict reality, so they had to find another niche). So it's more 'is what you're saying sound, and does your art reflect is accurately?', and whether that's the case is determined by the whole 'artistic community'. Whether you get discovered and become a big artist can depend on a single rich guy though.
That is why a lot of artists are more the alternative type: it's hard to be in it for the money, and most of them rather want to tell a story through various media.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drives me crazy that 99% of the population equates hyper-realism and technical ability with “good art”. Nearly everything I see on Reddit’s art subs is hyper realism. And like, yes, well done you for making a portrait with a ball point pen which looks exactly like a photograph, but...why not just take a photo instead then? You’re simply recreating reality and not doing anything interesting. It’s skillful, but it’s just a xerox. What’s interesting or creative about a copy? Zzzzz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being “good at art” has always been ambiguous. That’s the point. Even before the postmodern period medieval painting (which doesn’t look realistic) looks nothing like renaissance painting and who is to say which is better? You can’t say a Velazquez painting is objectively better than a Michelangelo painting and they both painted in a rather realistic way. It wasn’t just photography that made painting change, there are plenty of less “realistic” examples of before that</p></div>		</li>

<p>And this is what has led to the downfall of how people view artists. People think it's all just a fuckin joke now - and frankly, speaking as someone with an art degree - it is. It doesn't matter how skilled you are anymore; it matters if you can bullshit your way into someone's wallet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue there are two main types of contemporary artist: (1) those who are discovered; and (2) those who are made. Both can be objectively good at the fundamentals whether through training or natural ability, but they can also be mediocre yet easily marketable (think family name or lineage).</p>
<p>For the first group, a niche is created for them to fill. For the second, they are groomed (by collectors, by gallerists) to fill a niche. In both regards, it is a wealthy patron who is manipulating the market - by influence, by money, or both - to make that niche attractive to others via a broad network of appraisers, dealers, and exhibition venues.</p>
<p>Some artists might be excited by the prospect of being patronized, others might feel cornered and creatively stymied. It all depends on why the artist decided to make art: for success or for expression or for some other reason.</p>
<p>There are some beautiful contemporary pieces, such as those by Ruth Asawa or any ceramics by the Living National Treasures of Japan or even the fish prints of Dwight Hwang (my specialization is in East Asian art). But there are others that obviously have a massive &quot;propaganda&quot; team behind it, like the banana taped to a wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know when you are upset or so happy that you can’t produce a coherent sentence? Where all you want to do is to jump or hug or punch a wall? </p>
<p>Art is sort of like that. Art is what you use when words aren’t enough. </p>
<p>I think I create ‘good art’ when I look at my piece and say, yea, that’s what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>I used to draw often. I was okay. I couldn’t do hyperrealism but I could do portraits. People liked them and thought I was a good artist. I wasn’t happy with it because I didn’t see them as artwork. They were just technical drawings. When I started pressing flowers and forming them into some sort of flower collage on glass (I call them visual haikus since they represent seasons usually), I consider those my artworks. But most people don’t. Because they can press and put flowers together but can’t draw a face. </p>
<p>In the end, I know my flower collages are not going to fetch millions or even the cost of the frame and glass they are on. But they aren’t worthless, they are just worth less. I know they are good art because I see myself (and who I am) in every single one of them.</p>
<p>Edit: I just want to add that I think most artists dream of having their art valued highly not because money validates our artistic merits but because the majority of us simply can’t live off their artworks.</p></div>		</li>
