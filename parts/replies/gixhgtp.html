			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to nitpick, but Gears of War is my favorite game series. The government is the COG (Coalition of Ordered Governments), and the soldiers are called gears. Sorry that your analogy no longer works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's does still work really. Many times throughout the games they are called COGs, probably because they identify more from that than whatever countries used to exist by this point. So people under the Coalition of Ordered Governments are recognized as COGs and the military of the COGs are Gears aka COGs working together to run the military machine.</p>
<p>So COG civilians become the Gears of War when they enlist and work together.</p></div>		</li>
