			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation in space isn’t as big a deal as most people are lead to believe. </p>
<p>It’s a concern because a typical interplanetary journey planned to avoid solar storms would put you just above the OSHA radiation guidelines making it legally unacceptable, but genetically modifying yourself to be a ginger would be far worse due to higher sensitivity to radiation.</p>
<p>In fact if you were a ginger, and decided to move to Mars over a 2-3 year journey, you’d actually noticeably <em>decrease</em> your chances of cancer from radiation.</p>
<p>Space radiation isn’t healthy, but smoking is a lot less healthy. Its well within the range humans already subject themselves to willingly. The biggest risk is being caught in a freak storm of radioactive particles ejected from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhh I'm no scientist but doesn't the Sun's gravity have an influence on the Voyager probes even to this day? If the engines shut off wouldn't they (eventually) return towards the sun?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thrusters have been shut off for decades. Just like how if you get going fast enough you’ll leave earth orbit and never come back, if you get going fast enough you can leave the sun’s orbit and never come back. The probes have slowed slightly from the gravitational attraction to the sun, but they were going so fast from their initial trajectories and subsequent gravity assists that it will never make them fall back in towards the sun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Voyager 1 did successfully fire its thrusters briefly in late 2017, for the first time since 1980.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well <em>technically</em> it is. But it becomes a non factor Once you get closer to the next big object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this point, the Sun is pretty much out of the ballgame for them, especially for Voyager 1. It’s now classified to be in interstellar space, so while the Sun doesn’t exert no force on it, it’s pretty much negligible. Voyager 2 isn’t quite in interstellar space yet, but it’s close. It’s true that they are still within the furthest reaches of the Oort Cloud, but they are going so fast that they aren’t at the level of danger of falling back that the Oort Cloud members are. We gotta remember that these guys are going over 38,000 mph. It would take a lot to make them turn all the way around. I’m not gonna try and mess with the numbers, but I think they wouldn’t fall back if they turned off right now, but I very well could be wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they are nowhere near the Oort Cloud yet, you're misinformed. They won't reach it for [edit 300 years, will pass it in thousands of years], so technically they are still not in interstellar space.</p></div>		</li>
