<p>Naturally you only use some % of your muscle to do a lift. This is in part to prevent injury and in part to conserve some energy incase of emergency (like a lion comes out of the bush). We are able to do the same exercise many times in a row because a different set of muscle fibers &quot;fire off&quot; each rep. This gives you recovery time while you continue the same movement. </p>
<p>However you can train your body to fire higher and higher percentages of your muscle on a single rep. This is why different people of the same size and muscle mass can have different 1 rep maxes. </p>
<p>The fight or flight mechanism kind of bypasses the training needed and allows for someone to fire almost or all of their muscle at once. </p>
<p>So you aren't gaining strength, just unleashing your full potentional</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, with the boxing that's not so much adrenaline and overriding muscles as it is technique causing breaks. If anyone punches wrong they can break their hand/wrist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You misunderstood what I wrote, but what you said it's correct</p>
<p>Best boxers have to actively manage their strength because if they hit at full strength at the boxing dummy they would absolutely break _something_ in their own hand. If actively reducing the strength of the punch you call <em>technique</em> then we agree :)</p></div>		</li>
