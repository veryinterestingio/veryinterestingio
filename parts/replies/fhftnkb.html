<p>&quot;Who is able to afford these devices?&quot;
&quot;Uhh... Basically like everyone, you can get a shitty one that can do all that for like $50&quot;
&quot;What do these scientists who own a hand held computer use it for?&quot;
&quot;We like... You know, avoid doing work with it. You can also look up these things called memes that are cool, uhhh you can watch TV and order food. I guess that's about it&quot;</p>
<p>I did get to work with an old computer programmer who told me some cool stories about programming with punch cards once, he was cool and it was great hearing about all these weird complications that they had to overcome. He was a computer programmer in the... 60s I guess? When it was more magic number crunching and less screaming at your computer for not compiling because you missed a semi colon somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>go to a college textbook store and find the Mathematics section.</p>
<p>Look for anything with the phrase &quot;Discrete Math&quot; on it.</p>
<p>Grab the ISBN and go pirate the text online.</p>
<p>Shit will blow your fucking mind.  Those guys were actual wizards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took that class. AFAIK discrete mathematics is more computation theory and complexity analysis than programming.</p>
<p>Likewise, linear algebra sucks ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hardest part about making a course correction is knowing where you are and how that differs from where you should be.  A phone easily has enough power to do that if it was plugged into the ships' sensors, <a href="http://astronomy.com/news/2018/06/the-story-of-the-apollo-sextant" target="_blank">or you could calculate it yourself with a sextant</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>the math for orbital mechanics is surprisingly simple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In two-body systems, sure... but in the real world a spacecraft flying from the Earth to the Moon is influenced by the gravity of the Earth, Moon, Sun and Jupiter at the most noticeable levels, and by the rest of the objects in the Solar System at much smaller levels.</p>
<p>In other words, it's not as simple as just plotting the right trajectory and pushing &quot;Go&quot;, you need several correction burns along the way.  </p>
<p>Which the Apollo program did make use of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but for most missions (including the moon landings) a patched conic approximation can get you pretty close.  Correction burns can be done by regularly calculating your position and computing an updated patched conic trajectory from your position.  Repeat a couple of times and you'll get where you need to be.</p></div>		</li>
