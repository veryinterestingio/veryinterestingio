			<div class="markdown"><p>So as far as I understand, if you say something incriminating during the poly, they end it and then dig into what you said and probably have you sign a confession/statement. So that way, the results of the poly are irrelevant and they have your confession/sworn statement to use in court.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with lie detectors is that you can be innocent and still fail one. Even though that can’t be used as evidence against you, the cops will then only focus on you as their suspect because of the flawed lie detector result. There’s no good reason to ever take one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are they used? Wouldn't a spinning cardboard wheel from a cereal packet or those red acetate fish that curl up in your hand be just as effective (and cheaper) for employers to use? Is it just for intimidation to weed out candidates, or some sort of weird initiation ritual? It's just baffling that they're using the equivalent to a body thetan detector with straight faces in the 21st century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tradition... That's literally the answer. Because it's part of the bureaucracy. It's been embedded in the clearance process for so long that it's just part of the deal.</p>
<p>That being said, it's really not that big of a deal anymore. The agencies know that it's not accurate. Like people have said, it's an interrogation technique more than anything. People say dumb fucking shit during a poly. </p>
<p>You can deny everything and get wack results and still pass as long as you're consistent in your answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Evidence in a criminal trial” is a high bar to clear. In the case of a security clearance it’s much less “He is lying and now we got him”, and more “huh, questions about this subject deviate from his baseline. Might be something we pay attention to during the rest of his investigation.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You write your answers to the SF-86, basically an autobiography of things that would interest the government. You get quizzed on the answers and potential omissions. The polygraph's a distraction, but any inconsistencies can be used as evidence of dishonesty and get your clearance rejected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you didn't say they are, but even those are not completely accurate. Some of the most famous outed spies in history were passing lie detectors for years. And almost certainly there are currently spies in those agencies passing them regularly.</p></div>		</li>
