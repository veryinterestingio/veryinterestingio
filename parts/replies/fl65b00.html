			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a quote from Mark Twain related to that bridge. The bridge had two tracks for trains on the upper deck, and the lower deck was used for horse carriages.</p>
<p>I gogled it and its different than what i remembered. Maybe there are two versions.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you drive over to Suspension Bridge, and divide your misery between the chances of smashing down two hundred feet into the river below, and the chances of having the railway train overhead smashing down on to you. Either possibility is discomforting taken by itself, but, mixed together, they amount in the aggregate to positive unhappiness.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>that French nutter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Philippe Petit, a very interesting, and by many accounts, rather difficult individual, who achieved a number of eye-popping feats of funambulism. I almost met him on a couple of occasions but it never came off, which is a pity, I suspect he would've been very memorable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that is also how Navy ships connect for underway replenishment. The smaller line is called the &quot;shot line&quot; which is loaded into a rifle and shot over to the other ship. The crew of the receiving ship pulls over a heavier line or cable (called the span wire) which is secured to the superstructure of the ship and then the cargo or fuel hose is sent over via a pulley system across the span wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the span line really physically connected between ships? From watching a TV show quite some time back I seem to remember that to be able handle the independent rolling actio. If each ship the line is run through a pulley on each end with tensioners at each end to keep the line taut.</p>
<p>In some cases the tensioner is several sailors moving forward and back as needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cargo ship has tensioners that automatically compensate for the roll. The only time that the crew touches any lines are a) bringing in the shotline/span line and b) hauling over any cargo that is manually pulled over (or pulling the cargo the last bit onto the deck/attaching the fuel hose to the intake pipe). &quot;Don't touch the span line&quot; is one of those commandments that are enforced strictly.</p>
<p>EDIT TO ADD: I left the Navy in 1996, so things may have changed since then.</p></div>		</li>
