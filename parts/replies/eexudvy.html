<p>while wrestlers (known for extreme dieting) are generally shorter than average</p>

<p>What about bias? Highschool wrestling coaches seem to favor shorter wrestlers since they excel in the area. Just as football coaches favor stride/height and speed. This could then become a &quot;thing&quot; in the family and the love of the sport is passed down along with the genetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They talk about that as a source of bias in the summary, but there is evidence that begins to discount it. Wrestlers during the season have lower mass growth rates, but during off-season they typically jump to the top 99% in mass growth. It wasn't clear if this extrapolates to height growth as well, but there is an implication there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me wonder if wrestlers would therefore have exceptionally large and/or obvious growth rings in their bones, like trees that grow a lot in the summer, and very little in winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very possible for female gymnasts. The paper discusses the high potential for selection bias. When comparing age groups the 7-10 year old group is in the 48th percentile for height, but the 11-14 year old group was in the 20th percentile. It is possible that continued training drops the average height significantly during the 10-14 year old growth spurt, but a 28% change is extreme for a single growth spurt. It seems more likely that the taller children quit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being short isn't necessarily an advantage in wrestling, it just changes the dynamics of <em>how</em> you should wrestle. The lower center of gravity is better for performing certain shots like a fireman carry but the leverage of a sprawl from a taller opponent is equally as advantageous. </p>
<p>Maybe if you're super tall like 6' 9&quot; it might just be too difficult, but in my highschool wrestling coaches were always trying to recruit big/tall ass dudes for the heavy weight division from the football team. But not many guys have it in them to go from a football season and then IMMEDIATELY start wrestling season.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For women it appears that extreme exercise such as gymnastics makes you shorter, </p>

<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That single factor, added to the marked energy expenditure of training and competition for some sports, and in concert with the self-selection of certain body types, makes it difficult to identify the individual factors responsible for the slow linear growth of some adolescent athletes, for example, those who partake in <strong>gymnastics, dance, or wrestling</strong>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention “sports that are extremely body-type selective,” pretty much any able-bodied kid’s body is perfect for dance and gymnastics (I don’t know much about wrestling) but puberty hits a lot of those kids in ways that make them less successful simply due to growing boobs, or getting too tall, or not being able to keep your flexibility up to your growth spurts, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does gymnastics encourage you to starve yourself? There aren't weigh-ins there.</p>
<p>That said, the real problem with &quot;gymnastics&quot; is that gymnastics already selects for shorter people to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Competitive dance, figure skating, and gymnastics aren't entirely performance based. They're not like running or shooting where there are objective measures of success; quality of performance is determined by judges, who tend to take <em>appearance</em> into account as well. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I used to climb at a gym that was attached to a gymnastics school. It seemed like having a poor body image or an obsession with overdieting was almost par for the course, which is unsurprising I suppose; I'd have an unhealthy body image as well if I was literally being judged on my appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They determine that it is an effect of the sport through comparison. There are well established growth patterns based off parental height and age. They are not perfect, but with a large enough group of participants they should be accurate. Girls who have not menstruated that participate in gymnastics and dance were 27% shorter on average than you would normally predict from their parents' height.</p></div>		</li>
