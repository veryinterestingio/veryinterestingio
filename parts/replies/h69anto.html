			<div class="markdown"><p>I use the same train of thought but I reduce the zeros to compare speeds when driving in adverse conditions like rain or so. Rather than using (mv^2)/2 in m/s, I simply use 90 kph, reduce to 9 and square to 81. This number can then be compared to say 60 kph (36). Is the reduction in time spent on the road worth the risk of 125% more kinetic energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's some good shorthand!</p>
<p>Of course, irl braking conditions are a great deal more complex. Personally, I err waaaaay on the side of caution during heavy rain/fog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh absolutely. Just something as simple as added reaction distance (distance travelled before braking/acting) is also added to the overall risk of things. It’s more something I do to keep myself entertained while driving. </p>
<p>Ultimately I thinks it’s quite ironic that doubling the speed quadruples the kinetic energy whilst only halving time saved. Quite obvious when you think about it, but it also puts the additional risk of speeding into light.</p></div>		</li>
