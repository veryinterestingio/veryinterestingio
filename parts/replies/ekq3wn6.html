<p>That makes sense. Muscles have to be ready to react to fighting and running and all sorts of high demand responses. Meanwhile your heart has a pretty predictable and manageable payload.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not about feeding either, statistically heart rests half the time, iirc 0.4 seconds is contraction cycle and 0.4 is rest
Also the tiredness in your skeletal muscles is getting too much lactic acid (is that the right name?) in your muscles because of a insufficient oxygen which then gets better as your heart and breath rates go up and more oxygen gets delivered to muscle so lactic acid can be dissolved (oxidized to some relatively harmless stuff I don’t remember). It’s one of the reasons you don’t stop dead after running, but walk around. Also one of the reasons for “second breath”
In case of the heart it has a REALLY good oxygen delivery so the “tiring” of muscle issue is mitigated even further when combined by rest-work cycle</p>
<p>Source: was in a bio-med profile back in school</p>
<p>Also fun trivia: the muscles we use to chew our food (jaw whatever, forgot the English word for them) are the strongest by area</p>
<p>EDIT: thx u/Owzna for pointing out the correct name of lactic acid</p></div>		</li>
