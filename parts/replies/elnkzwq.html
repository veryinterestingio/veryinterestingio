			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, from the INSIDE it's very easy to mistake for laziness. It took me forever to get diagnosed (as an adult eventually) because I always just figured I was lazy and hiding it well.</p>
<p>Edit: Have mercy!</p>
<p>Edit2: Ok, if I didn't answer your replies, pm's, chat requests, etc... it's because I got hosed by this thread (on multiple levels) yesterday. I had to turn off all notifications otherwise my phone would've kept me awake all night...</p>
<p>If you need help: seek help. I'm not a doctor, I can't advise you. I feel for you, but I have a job and life that doesn't involve me counseling 100's of people online. Especially not as me dealing with ADHD means NOT attending to all of the distractions....</p>
<p>As said, if you need help, go find professional help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this. My wife recently got diagnosed at 30, after being told for years she was just &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;needed to apply herself more&quot; and &quot;try harder&quot;.</p>
<p>Thankfully found a psychologist who is working with her to help find techniques to help her learn and study better for university.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This too. And the feeling of laziness causes anxiety, which then causes the ADD to be worse, which causes me to spin my wheels more, which then ends up with me laying on the couch, staring at the wall, trying to figure out what to do next before giving up and flipping on the television to shut off the noise in my brain for 30 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Got 2 hours of study done last night. Spent today basically lazing around, playing Hearthstone mostly or flicking through Reddit, even though I have 50 hours of study to get through just to catch up. And an assignment due in 5 days that I haven't started on yet. (Should be easy at least though)</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>For reasons I went to see a well regarded psychiatrist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was on Concerta for a good couple of years.</p>
</li>
<li>It changed my life. I now get by without it, but kinda miss the medication... but I'd rather &quot;cope&quot; without it than be on it (it aggravates some insomnia problems I get).</li>
</ol>
<p>TL;DR: On the medication it feels like someone has lifted a fog on reality and I can engage with the world more directly. I can just decide what to focus on and then.... focus on that. I fly through work, don't struggle for motivation, pay attention to what people are saying, almost as if I feel a bit more 'real'.</p>
<p>Without the medication... I lack those things. Which is why I miss it. But it did help me develop some of my own coping mechanisms and I manage life better now than I did before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not /u/OfFiveNine, but I was recently (12/17) diagnosed with ADHD after being given a series of neuropsychological tests that lasted the better part of a day. They tested for IQ and other memory/cognitive conditions to rule out something like early-onset dementia. </p>
<p>I'm currently trying Strattera, but it hasn't worked for me. It not only has given me intermittent insomnia but has also ruined my ability to hyperfocus. This drug works <em>really</em> well for other people, so I don't want anyone to avoid it if they need help.</p>
<p>Adderall made my anxiety skyrocket in unpleasant ways, and absolutely removed my verbal filter. I was able to get my laundry room really clean the first time I tried it, though! (Too bad I was supposed to be studying.)</p>
<p>My kid is going to be trying Evekeo soon, and her psychiatrist is hopeful it will help. If it works for her, I'll be trying it out as well. It's a different combination of amphetamine salts, and supposedly doesn't trigger anxiety the same way Adderall does.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, try to really account for what's going on with you. Is it stress? Has it been your whole life, or just recently or since some event happened? </p>
<p>Go look up the official ADHD self report test developed by the WHO and a team of psychiatrists. They do a bad job of hiding which answers indicate ADHD, but try to be honest. Find out if you have a family history of ADHD. In my case, I discovered father has inattentive ADHD and just forgot to tell me until two months ago (grew up with separated parents so I don't know a ton about his personal life unless I ask). </p>
<p>If you notice yourself scoring highly, make an appointment with a psychiatrist - if you can't find one that you like that you can afford (a lot are private pay only), you can typically go to any doctor you trust with your mental health. But at least for a diagnosis I strongly recommend a good psychiatrist. This is important for ruling out conditions that may seem like ADHD but actually aren't (general anxiety and OCD are common; this is compounded by the fact ADHD is highly comorbid with other conditions). </p>
<p>For me, medication has helped a lot. I cried the first time I took medication because it was such a drastic change.</p>
<p>Source: Was diagnosed about six weeks ago with &quot;significant&quot; ADHD. Disclaimer that I'm just another 23yo software geek; my recommendations were personal and not professional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always thought that a lack of efficiency due to ADD was a bit like a lack of traction while driving. You keep pressing the accelerator, but you end up making so little progress.  The wheels have to spin 10x more than necessary just to get you where you want to go.  And when you compare yourself to people without ADD, it seems like they barely have to accelerate at all. They just tap the pedal once and coast the rest of the way.  It's hard not to become discouraged by that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great write up. All though I would change one thing. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likewise, a person with ADHD isn’t forgetful; they often have brains like sponges. They just don’t choose what they will remember.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would said it’s more “They don’t choose what they will recall”. </p>
<p>Memory is not the problem, recalling it when it’s appropriate is. For example I will remember I was supposed to do something, just not until after I was supposed to do it.</p></div>		</li>

My other half walks in the house, takes shoes off and leaves them wherever she happens to sit down first, and at some point in the next few hours puts keys down somewhere.
