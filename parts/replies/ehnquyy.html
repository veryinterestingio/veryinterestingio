			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for everything you do. I have a follow up question, though. Why aren't there enough surgeons? Are there too few trained medical students? Is the hospital unwilling to hire enough people to allow everyone a safe and healthy work schedule? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a multi-factor problem and is a bit different all around the world. Mainly it's that surgery is hard and surgical patients tend to be more acutely unwell than other patients. Add to this the fact that surgical interventions take a long time (admission, prep for theatre, anaesthetic time, surgical time, recovery, transfer back to the ward) and someone needs to oversee much of this. Surgery as a specialty is also skills based as opposed to internal medicine which is often knowledge based. You can't give someone surgical skills to manage a sick patient over the phone, you have to be there yourself.</p>
<p>All of these add up and often it means too few surgeons, which leads to longer hours and more calls, which means less time with the family.</p>
<p>Source: I'm a surgical trainee who's done numerous 30+ hour calls, sometimes up to 9 times a month. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't hiring more doctors be a way around it? I know there isnt an infinite supply of doctors, but there are always steps that can be taken to get more doctors out of schools. If working 24h shifts was a significant problem, there would be steps taken</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my thought, too. I am sure there are lots of factors I do not know about, but, Just hire two more people. It is expensive, but what is the price of treating your doctors with decency?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many reasons for this, but one is that hospitals are run by CEOs with MBAs, so they extract every cent of profit possible from the hospital, usually including cutting staff. Physicians hate it, nurses hate it, techs hate it, etc but hospital administration loves maximizing profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also I would assume the doctors working overtime are paid more than their regular salaries? meaning extra hires could actually reduce the costs</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I had surgery, I was being prepped at 7:30 Am. He'd already done one procedure that morning and I saw him again in the evening.</p></div>		</li>
