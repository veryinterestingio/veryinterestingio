<p>Do you have a source for that? I don't know about efficiency but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode_physics#Efficiency_and_operational_parameters" target="_blank">blue LEDs usually have the lowest efficacy</a> (lm/W).</p>

<p>But as they are most energetic of the visual spectrum it makes sense we need less sensors to pick them up too.</p>

<p>The physiology and precise pathway/pathways of S-Type cones is, AFAIK, an open research topic that <a href="https://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-iii-retinal-circuits/s-cone-pathways/" target="_blank">has found a complicated network regulating how blue light is processed by the ganglia of the eye.</a> I would speculate that perhaps we evolved fewer blue sensitive cones because our daytime environment is often saturated by blue light but I don't think that would relate to how energetic that light is.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/CCD-vs-CMOS.html" target="_blank">CCD and CMOS sensors use a RGBG filter</a>, if red wavelengths were less energetic than blue wavelengths, and thus a camera sensor would need more red light for charge to voltage conversion,  wouldn't you need more red sensitive photodiodes?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are several related but distinct measures of efficiency or efficacy.</p>
<p>Blue O/LEDs tend to have the highest <em>quantum efficiency</em> - that is photons emitted per charge injected - due to their relatively large bandgaps and the energy gap law. That property (larger bandgaps) works against them for <em>power efficacy</em> however, as they require larger driving voltages to function than diodes emitting lower energy photons. Additionally, lumens are a photometric unit and the human eye's decreased sensitivity to blue light is also working against the power efficacy. Thus blue O/LEDs perform comparatively worse when measured in lm/W.</p>
<p>Edit: You also asked somewhere else about CIEy. I didn't look at the paper, but academia usually uses the 1931 CIE chromaticity diagram (x,y) to measure the color of LEDs and, for blue O/LEDs specifically, the y value is particularly difficult and important to get right for &quot;true blue&quot; emission.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338355749_Review-On_The_Search_for_Efficient_Solid_State_Light_Emitters_Past_Present_Future" target="_blank">This review article</a> about LEDs suggests that, at least for white LEDs, Wall-Plug Efficiency can be multiplied by Luminous Efficacy of Radiation (the theoretical max of human vision, 683 lm/W at 555nm) to get a lm/w value called Luminous Efficacy/Efficiency. I assume the same calculation could be performed for any LED/OLED?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if you are taking into account that the so called 'efficacy' considers the reduced eye sensitivity to blue light, and that's why blue LEDs score a low number at that metric.</p>
<p>As other people said, blue LEDs are indeed more efficient than red or green ones, since they are the basis for the white LED lamps, so a lot of money and time has been invested in developing efficient blue LEDs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am. What I'm curious about is if the advances in blue LED efficiency offset the low efficacy. From what I can assume from that chart, which is based on 9 year old data, is that when comparing blue with red LEDs, blue have \~90% of the efficiency coefficient at \~47% efficacy.</p>
<p>I'm not an engineer so I'm not sure if the takeaway &quot;blue LEDs need more than 2 times the power to match the luminosity of red LEDs, in photopic conditions&quot;, is correct. Certainly LEDs have improved in the past nine years and I'm additionaly curious how blue OLEDs compare to other OLEDs.</p>
<p>Edit: To specify, efficacy refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficacy" target="_blank">Luminous Efficacy</a> measured in lm/W. Efficiency could refer to a whole bunch of things, Luminous Efficiency (<a href="https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/325793" target="_blank">as defined here</a>), <a href="https://www.ledsmagazine.com/home/article/16701295/terminology-led-efficiency" target="_blank">External Quantum Efficiency, or Wall Plug or Radiant Efficiency</a>. I'm probably most focused on Wall-Plug Efficiency.</p>
<p>Double Edit: <a href="https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1421610" target="_blank">Reading this report</a> indicates that in 2017 Blue LEDs reached an EQE of over 80% and that standard AlInGaP-based red LED have only a 25% EQE at 614nm. It also mentions Blue LED Efficiency Droop, and I have no idea how this factors in today. The original question wasn't taking into account current densities...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Red LEDs have a lower forward voltage (1.5-2.5v) than Blue (2.5-3.5v) so red has a lower wattage Amp.  </p>
<p>There may be 70% efficient but they would be very expensive. Reds in the mainstream high brightness market are not 70% efficient. The best right now in 2017, is about 600mW of Radiant Flux out for 1.5 to 2 Watts in. Less than 80 lumens of Luminous Flux for the same power.  </p>
