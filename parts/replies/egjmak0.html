			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, mafia convicts get more years, and the most dangerous bosses get the 41-bis, which is a system of rules that make conviction harsher;basically, it makes it harder to communicate with the outside, it's stricter regarding permits (Tot√≥ Riina could only be brought to a hospital when he was on his deathbed) and tries to have a 24/7 surveillance on the gangsters with microphones and cameras everywhere. </p></div>		</li>
