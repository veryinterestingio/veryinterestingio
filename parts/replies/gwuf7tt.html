<p>Even with all the anti-vax rhetoric out there, if Covid-19 hospitalized children in large numbers or if kids accounted for 85% of deaths instead of adults 65+, people would turn out in droves and vaccinate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The percentage required for herd immunity can be approximated as 100%*(1 - 1/R0). This is the percentage of people needed to be immune, so you’d presumably need to multiply 1/R0 by the effectiveness of the vaccine (I’m a bench scientist not epidemiologist so take that with a grain of salt). I’m not sure if there’s a strong consensus around what the R0 is for SARS CoV2, different numbers have been estimated/modeled by different groups and these estimates have changed with time. It is certainly higher than influenza. Initially, it was believed to be around 2.5. More recent results I’ve seen show 5.8 (3.6-6.1). Generally, the idea is that it is higher than 2.5 but may or may not be that exact number. Either way, we used to think that 70% of people needed to be vaccinated, now it may actually be 80% or more. Either way, we probably won’t get that many people vaccinated due to mistrust in institutions, misinformation, and politicization, but I think we’ll come a lot closer than where we are now. And of course since R0 is just the approximate number of people infected by a single infected person, it can change with new strains, behavior (I.e. distancing/masks), and other factors.</p>
<p>Edit: here’s the paper I mentioned. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519321000436" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519321000436</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: changed some wording to sound less emphatic since this isn’t my exact field of study so I’m not an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is that we have a new seasonal &quot;flu&quot; that we're going to deal with every year or so. Nice.</p>
<p>Reasoning: herd immunity will not be achieved. It'll infect millions worldwide across hundreds of different environments. It'll mutate, as they do. Eventually one or more of these mutations will bypass our immune systems efforts and start a new wave.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The coverage is always 1-1/R0 so 1-1/1.5 = 33% to 1-1/3.5=72%. There are simplifying assumptions that go into that. So maybe 80% to have a little safety margin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the reference you link was written in Feb. 2020, before the higher-transmission variants like B.1.1.7 starting taking over. The current R0 is definitely somewhat higher than the R0 at this time last year (though not spectacularly higher, just moderately). On the other hand, interventions like masking and distancing bring the transmission down significantly.  It’s probably under 2 with current masking and distancing, but might be 4 or more with no restrictions at all. </p>
<p>Keep in mind also that the herd immunity can be a combination of natural (infection) immunity plus vaccination. Infection immunity is never enough to reach herd immunity, but it certainly can contribute. As well as the roughly 100 million vaccinated people in the US, for example, there are roughly 100 million infected people. Since at least some infected people were also vaccinated you can’t simply add them, but immunity is certainly higher than the simple vaccination counts. </p>
<p>Still probably not enough to reach herd immunity though, at least for several years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recently they just updated the herd immunity prediction to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/covid-herd-immunity-vaccine.html" target="_blank">about 80%</a>.</p>
<p>One important aspect that article mentions is that this is 80% for any given community, not 80% averaged across the nation. So if my town is at 95% and your town is at 65%, that's an 80% average (assuming equal populations) but your town will be in deep trouble.</p>
<p>Also, check out that depressing map.</p></div>		</li>
