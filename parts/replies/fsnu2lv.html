			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to have an annoying problem with fruit flies but they disappeared during the winter. As the weather started heating up again, they started to come back but this time I mopped the floor with a disinfectant (phenyl I think) and they are completely gone and Iâ€™ve only done that twice in 4/5 months. Do they hate disinfectants like phenyl that much?</p></div>		</li>
