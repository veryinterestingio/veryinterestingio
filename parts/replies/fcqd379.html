			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the same mechanism is why we give rescue breaths in CPR as well. Most people automatically think the rescue breath is for giving the person oxygen to allow them to survive, but the real reason is increasing the amount of CO2 in the body, thus triggering the breathing reflex. The air we give during the rescue breath is high in CO2, as it is what we exhale. Just a quick info.</p>
<p>EDIT: After some research, appearently my biology teacher was wrong. Turns out this is not correct at all, but I can at least give some info about why I was wrong, which will hopefully make up for it.</p>
<p>The air we inhale is about 21 percent oxygen with 0.04 percent carbon dioxide. </p>
<p>The air we exhale is STILL about 15 percent oxygen, and only 5 percent CO2. </p>
<p>About 8 percent and above CO2 is dangerous, 5 percent of it is enough to make someone drowsy, but it is ultimately better than not breathing at all. </p>
<p>So the real reason behind rescue breaths is appearently indeed supplying the body with oxygen, while the chest compressions help with circulating that oxygen into the body. </p>
<p>I apologize sincerely from anyone that i might have misinformed, please feel free to correct any other wrong info. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Someone in cardiac or respiratory arrest for any real length of time is plenty acidotic already. They do not “need more CO2.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No way. If they haven’t been breathing for however long they’ve been down, their C02 will already have built up. If they’re not circulating blood to the tissues because the heart isn’t pumping, there will be no perfusion and thus no C02 exchange anyway. Also, a pulseless person will not have a respiratory drive, no matter how high the PaCO2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah....that's not going to be correct. Your expired air is going to have significantly less CO2 than the air that has been chilling in their lungs, absorbing CO2 for however long they have been down without ventilations. Giving rescue breaths is both providing them with oxygen (your expired air is about 16% oxygen, compared to 21% in normal air) and letting them blow off CO2, making them slightly less acidotic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, but it does. Natural gas is also colorless and odorless; that’s why they add odorants to it like t-butylthiol, so you know it’s there. If you could smell CO like that, it could easily wake you up and tell you to get out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure it does. If it wasn't, it would not be nearly as dangerous.</p>
<p>I see what you're saying. It's odor or lack of, is distinct the fact that the body detects excess CO2 not the presence of CO displacing O2 in hemoglobin - but both those factors are necessary parts of what makes CO poisoning a silent killer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the reaction to the sudden buildup of CO2 is handled by completely different parts of the brain, the most oldest parts in evolutionary terms of it in fact. It is outside of any cognitive functions and it can't be controlled. You can only make the secondary response, the fear to go down for ex when you know you are in a testing situation and help is seconds away but the initial reaction is totally outside of any control.  </p>
<p>Guess why waterboarding is so effective? No matter how tough bastard you are with the strongest mind in the universe, you are going to panic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It stimulates the instinctive drowning response, Co2 takes time to build up in the blood, longer than the immediate, visceral reaction of waterboarding.</p></div>		</li>
