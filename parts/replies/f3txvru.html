<p>Edit: Thanks for the answers, now I'm curious what <em>gives</em> electrons more energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it you get in the weeds of it it gets really complicated. The analogy of speed is a good eli5. The electrons are being pushed down the line faster. It's sort of accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same way the gravitational potential energy in an object can vary. Voltage changes aren't about changing charge of the electron they are about potential energy and more related to the overall system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its charge stays the same, but the forces acting on it don't. It's like raising an object of the same mass on jupiter: it requires more energy than on earth because you're working against a stronger gravitational field.</p>
<p>To my knowledge the energy carried by each electron varies more or less in that sense, though it gets complicated if you look closely at what electrons are doing.</p>
<p>Edit: Energy often isn't an inherent property of an object, it often only makes sense in the context of forces and interactions with the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I had assumed electron is a &quot;constant&quot; thing that doesn't vary, and voltage difference just meant a different amount of electrons between two ends.</p>
<p>This makes more sense. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are constant (they have a constant (rest) mass, a constant charge, etc.), but they can carry different amounts of energy depending on their environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to remember is that electron have a constant charge, but Voltage is defined as the change in energy per unit charge. Current is defined as change in charge per second (flow of charge). So if you multiply them together, you get change in energy per second (power)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the mass energy or electric energy per electron that is constant. They can also have kinetic energy. That changes quite a bit from situation to situation. </p>
<p>Think of that waterfall example in the top comment. Power is analagous to how much it hurts when the water hits you. You can get mailed by a heavy flow falling 10 feet (low voltage high current) but you can also get mailed by a small stream falling 200 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's... not really right at all. The voltage isn't energy <em>in</em> an electron. It's the amount of energy the electron (or any charge carrier) will get from moving from one place to another, from a high voltage to a lower one, as the electric field does work on the charge carrier.</p>
<p>The electric field is what's doing the pushing. When you look into it, the electric and magnetic fields are what are moving energy from place to place (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector" target="_blank">Poynting vector</a>), not electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's correct in the same way that an object has &quot;potential energy&quot; which is just the energy an object can/would get from moving place to place within a gravitational field.</p>
<p>But that's fair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The voltage is the potential energy divided by the electric charge, so saying the voltage of an electron is the amount of (potential) energy in the electron is basically right since the electric charge is fixed and known.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way the parent commenter wrote it it sounds like it's something intrinsic to the electron rather than a property of a position in space due to the presence of an electric field.</p></div>		</li>
