<p>So a Harley engine could be made more powerful and more fuel efficient by adjusting the timing a speck, but you'd lose out on that &quot;awesome sound&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be Erik Buell.</p>
<p>After Harley bought controlling rights to Buell they forced Erik to use the awful Sportster engine for the new XB line of motorcycles. Erik wanted a modern liquid cooled v-twin but Harley pulled the &quot;lol we own you&quot; thing.</p>
<p>So Erik and his team <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3BcMKN-2Nk?t=215" target="_blank">redesigned half of the engine</a> and squeezed another 50% or so horsepower out of it. The engine as they got it was good for about 60 horsepower. When they were done the engines were rated at 92 horsepower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The majority of all Harley riders will blip their throttle as they pull in the couch when coming to a stop. But, all of them feel the need to blip the throttle two or three times before the light turns green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for Harley-Davidson, specifically in the plant that produces every Harley-Davidson engine. Stock harleys are not loud. In fact they are all very quiet, and comply with EPA sound levels leaving the factory. The problem is that 90% of people who buy a Harley-Davidson motorcycle have the stock exhaust replaced with something much louder before they even pick it up from the dealer.</p></div>		</li>
