			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is actually one of the better answers. I think the two car analogy is a bad example (accurate, just not as good), since everyone would probably agree that they would <em>not</em> feel safe or in control trying to pass things between two cars driving down the highway.</p>
<p>You on earth's surface are likely currently traveling at almost 1000mph in a geocentric reference frame, yet you can sip your coffee calmly, becuase <em>everything</em> is moving at that same speed. When your car is at speed, you have air, ground and objects moving <em>not</em> at your speed which makes things still rather chaotic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are travelling 40km/h and the wind is blowing the direction you're both travelling. Then you could pass objects back and forth without issue.</p>
<p>Drag is a thing. All that stationary air that you're cutting through behaves a lot like a liquid at high speed.</p>
<p>Luckily for both the ISS and the Dragon capsule, there is no atmosphere. Otherwise docking at 17,000 mph would be pretty tricky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just chose the two cars because there are also two approaching bodies in the capsule-ISS scenario. Docking is hardly a stress free experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A somewhat better two-vehicle analogy might be a car driving up the lowered ramp of a moving carrier vehicle. (Done in the movies, mostly, but I believe Mythbusters showed it works just fine in real life.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big difference that makes it so simmingly slow is also that it has virtually no drag or forces making it slow down. On earth if you were to drive a car and at high speed try to align perfectly to another moving car in front of you, anything less than perfect acceleration to keep a constant distance keeps you off alignment. In this case once you match the speed of the ISS, it stays in that constant without further action needed so the final inches is just tiny little adjustments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it safe to say that, while aligning and docking, the dragon capsule has to travel 0.01 mph faster than ISS so it can catches up to it and dock slowly ands safely?</p></div>		</li>
