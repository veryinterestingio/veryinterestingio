			<div class="markdown"><p>the need for houses might be one concern, but also all of the other costs and materials required for a house relative to wood.</p>
<p>Plus you might opt to grow some other tree, like bamboo, or maybe algea.  Something that grows even faster than fir or pine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bamboo are the largest members of the grass family of plants, they're not trees. What you're saying might be a good idea though; bamboo grows quickly and spreads quickly, but is also stopped by a three-foot deep trench if the sides are steep enough. The rhizomes (roots that grow into new plants) don't go into the ground far enough for it to spread to the bottom since they come straight out of the sides of the bamboo stump, and bamboo can't grow out of a wall. </p>
<p>That doesn't stop it from spreading via seeds though, but by the time it starts seeding, it's probably time to cut it back anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some places (like Quebec) actually do a lot of research to turn wood into a material you can use to build much larger buildings than normal houses. Sure it's not THE answer to CO2 sequestration, but it's a nice step forward. It's also better at withstanding fires than their steel counterparts, somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily better at withstanding fire (though in some cases they are), it's usually more important that wood is better at giving people more time to get out during a fire. </p>
<p>As steel heats up it looses its strength and becomes more malleable, wood doesn't do that, instead it chars and maintains most of its strength.</p>
<p>So in the event of a fire that gets very hot very quickly a steel structure will fail quickly, trapping people inside. Conversely a wood building will potentially still burn and fail, but the process is much slower. That gives the people inside more time to escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before 2006 (and the Commission Coulombe report), up to 17% of Quebec's economy relied on forestry in a way or another.</p>
<p>Quebec's forestry industry crashed hard after the Commission Coulombe, and for good reasons. The old economic model based on exploiting the natural resources and getting the fuck out (most investors were foreigners, even though the government was supervising the whole thing the companies exagerated as much as they could get away with) couldn't function anymore. In 2008, the global economic crisis made things even worse. Instead of tackling the issue at it's roots, Gouvernement Charest (the provincial government back then) issued a bunch of subsides to prevent big mills from closing. Some genius though that they would invest in the local economy and modernize their mills, something that they hadn't done for decades. Unsurprisingly, most companies involved took the subsides and let the mills run for a couple years more, milking what was left of profit to be made, before closing them anyway.</p>
<p>Quebec's wood industry wasn't ready for the current era, but nobody wanted to hear it. The solutions the western canada tried to counter similar problems couldn't work in eastern canada. Some smaller companies tried to give more value to their products by doing research, with some mesure of success and some support from local universities. The provincial government later started to back these initiatives up by offering governments contracts for buildings to wooden structures first, and others incitatives like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The building technique is called cross laminated timber (AKA mass timber/ crosslam), it was first implemented in Switzerland and Germany before being adopted by Quebec building code.</p>
<p>Its superior fire resistance comes from the way it burns, chard layers create a natural thermal barrier that protects interior layers.</p></div>		</li>
