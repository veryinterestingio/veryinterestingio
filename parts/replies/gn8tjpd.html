<p>Nobody can answer this question because nobody knows the answer and anyone who does is either lying or can go collect their Nobel prize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered how true that actually is. I get that memory is shit and all but I've had times that I'm telling a story and thinking about the event in question while telling about it, when I'm told by the person I'm speaking to that I've told them that story before.</p>
<p>If I'm actively thinking about the event and don't remember having told this person this story, how can I be remembering the last time I told the story instead of the event?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's somewhat true, but very simplified. Studies have showed that each time we remember something, our brain alters that memory based on our current thoughts and feelings. These alterations will show up in later recollections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't make sense. If memories are just remembering the last time you remembered it, then what's happening the first time you remember it? You can't remember the last time you remembered it because you haven't remembered it yet.</p>
<p>It could be a combination though. After the first time you remember a memory, the next times you remember it could be an amalgamation of the original experience and the times you remembered it last.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the more you recall a memory, the more distorted it gets. The only way to perhaps maintain a memory intact would be if you never recalled it.  </p>
<p>Memory is a fascinating topic. I think the fact all cells regenerate and memories are still kept isn't the most interesting question. The fact is, like you said, memory is deeply flawed. Why do we remember what we remember? I.e., why do we forget so much and don't remember an infinite amount of information that is also there at the time a memory was recorded. The thing is that all memory is an illusion, even though it feels so real to us.</p></div>		</li>
