			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there are some galaxies which are observed to have no supermassive black hole. M33 (Triangulum) is the third largest galaxy in the Local Group but it doesn't have a supermassive black hole. If it does have a central black hole it can be no more massive than a few thousand times the mass of the Sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>basically. Also it is highly possible that there are galaxies for which the central black hole has been a ejected from the Galaxy altogether through gravitational interaction with another large body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely if the central BH is supermassive then nothing is realistically going to interact strongly enough to eject it from the galaxy?</p></div>		</li>
