<p>&quot;Please stay upright.&quot; does not convey the message. I would assume it's because it may have something to do with equilibrium, headache or blood pressure. Not something to do with swallowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are kind of a lot of levels that you could approach this question on:</p>
<ul>
<li>explanations of the underlying mechanisms for things seems like unnecessary legal exposure. if they're inaccurate about why you should stay upright, some clod will sue them over the fact that the mechanism they described was wrong, even if the advice was right. some judge might agree that the rationale provided for staying upright seemed to lend itself to interpretation that allowed the customer to exempt themselves from that instruction, etc. etc. no good deed goes unpunished.</li>
<li>the more information you give people, the more touch points they have to contextualize information, but correspondingly the more snags they have to get caught up in and confused by. if you give people just the information they need, you minimize the number of things on the bottle for customers to misunderstand</li>
<li>without meaning to be a jerk, what you're asking for is more a job for education than for product labels. people should know how various common minerals and nutrients work and pass through our bodies. maybe that came up in school, but i don't remember it, and the fact that this is a thing on reddit suggests there's a group of people that either didn't learn or didn't remember it, same as you and me.</li>
</ul>
<p>maybe there's some scholarship that agrees that explaining the &quot;why&quot; behind a rule evokes better adherence to the rule, but my hunch is that people are just looking for the instructions so they can move on to the stuff they actually want to do. nobody's taking iron supplements to kill time.</p>
<p>well, maybe now some people are lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't work in health-care, so I'm unsure if that applies there, but we had the same issue in our software user-guide.</p>
<p>If you simply give instructions people apply them blindly, even if it's clearly missing something important in their specific case. If they know why that instruction is there, then most can correct for that. So we had to provide both the instruction (the how) and the reason for it (the why).</p>
<p>I assume the risk is people deciding to do different instructions that seems to satisfy the issue (like eating food to swallow) but actually create other issues (iron absorption need acidity, food will reduce that).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not on the label, but, most medications I buy come with a slip inside that has absolutely eye-watering amounts of information about potential side effects. Its definitely worth a read, if a bit challenging at times.</p></div>		</li>
