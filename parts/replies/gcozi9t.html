			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid it's not the gravitational forces that keep the Earth's core molten, it's the radioactive material generating heat inside the earth that keep it molten. Earth has more than we'd usually expect.</p>
<p>If it was due to gravitational forces, the Moon would also have a molten core (which it doesn't) as the Earth would exert stronger forces on the Moon, than the Moon does on the Earth.</p>
<p>It is possible for gravitational forces to create a molten core, but you need the sort of size and proximity relationship that Jupiter and Io have rather than Earth and the Moon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the amplifying information! I didnt mean to imply that gravitational forces were solely responsible for the temperature of the core and mantle. The theory was that it should’ve cooled more than it has, and that the moon’s gravity was a factor. The constant deformation of the Earth caused by the moon, although slight, must generate some heat and/or motion with in the liquid mantle.  Has this been debunked as an insignificant effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is a component of heating known as 'gravitational heat', which is included in the 4 main causes of heating of the Earth's core it's usually not referring to the Moon's effect.</p>
<p>It's commonly used to refer to the act of denser material sinking into the core while displacing lighter material, the friction this generated caused significant heating. This was a process which happened more during a young earth, but the heat is still a portion of the remaining heat, just not a very large portion.</p>
<p>The other two minor causes were:</p>
<p>The heat from when the original particles and matter condensed into a planet, this is between 5-10%.</p>
<p>And latent heat released due to the core expanding as it cools from the inside out, again this is is quite a minor contributor.</p>
<p>The majority contributor around 90% is from the decay of radioactive material inside the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> when we say that the earth should have cooled quicker, we are comparing it to other rocky planets of the same size and how we model they would typical form and what they'd be made of. Earth however, doesn't fit your typical rocky planet profile.</p>
<p>When you are just referring to what we know about the Earth (size of the core, amount of radioactive material in the Earth etc) then it is pretty much in line with what we'd expect.</p>
<p><strong>Edit #2 to add:</strong> You're maybe thinking of articles referring to this paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X16301078" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X16301078" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X16301078</a></a></p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that their proposed model is not the standard accepted model, without accessing the full paper it's hard to say much about their methods or any evidence they are basing this model on. Most of the related papers seem to be about fluid dynamics of planets, so I'd guess this was a paper whose science is more around the models they developed than the suggested cause, which got some more mainstream journalism articles written about it because the easy to understand conclusion was fairly eye catching.</p></div>		</li>
