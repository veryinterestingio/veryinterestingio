			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you can make better stealth planes that don't have polygonal shape. At the time problem was simply computer calculation power. There wasn't enough computer calculation power to simulate reflections on more complex shape accurately. Polygonal shapes were easier to simulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation!</p>
<p>In the book <em>Skunk Works</em> by Ben Rich and Leo Janos, they describe some of the early tests of the plane's design. A smaller wooden model was made to scale and mounted on a pole on the radar range. The radar signature of the pole was greater than that of the model, so they had to design a triangular support (using the same principles as the aircraft) to conduct the tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You want to see something cool, look at drafts of the F-22. All the edges of the wings, tail and inlet are parallel with each other. They all have the same basic angle relative to the front. The flat edges act like the flat mirror, in that they'll provide a good return when they're facing dead-on to a radar. If your edges have a bunch of different angles, you get a bunch of directions where a radar can see you. So they made sure that there's only 3 or 4 exact directions a radar would have to be to get a good return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was something similar on the first test of the 117 rcs. It looked like the return was huge in contradiction of the math, but it turned out to be a bird on the model</p></div>		</li>
