			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you define &quot;darkness&quot;. </p>
<p>In Troms√∏ (city in Norway), the sun is entirely beneath the horizon for over 2 months every year. December is dark, but due to the snow and mie scattering in the atmosphere, it isn't completely devoid of light. The same way that dusk isn't pure blackness, arctic night isn't completely dark near midday, when the sun may be only a few degrees below the horizon. Aurora can also be relatively bright in large events, but that's not terribly common. </p>
<p>Longyearbyen on Svalbard is a couple of shades darker, with the solar disk being entirely below the horizon four months out of the year, I believe.</p></div>		</li>
