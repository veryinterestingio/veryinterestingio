			<div class="markdown"><p>Desire for sex could drive you to make poor decisions with who you mate with, and could also lead to dangerous situations where you could be easily misled and taken advantage of. Imagine a case where while on vacation a pretty woman  lures you to her place, only to have her friends jump out of the closet and rob you blind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason is that hormones are signals parts of our body send to other parts. Just like you would rather someone speak a sentence to you than just scream in your ear, we constantly break down those signals so that they are in effect only when needed.</p></div>		</li>
