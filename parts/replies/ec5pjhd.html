			<div class="markdown"><p>So, how does this work with an LED? Why are they more efficient at creating light? Are the collisions more structured and create less heat and more light...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an LED you force the electrons to jump a specific distance. This causes them to lose a specific amount of energy as light.</p>
<p>Which means all of the light will be one specific frequency, and you don't get any significant amount of heat.</p>
<p>The heat of an LED comes mostly from the actual wire parts heating up due to having some resistance.</p>
<p>In an incandescent bulb you are forcing the electrons to crash into atoms at random angles. This causes the metal itself to heat up.</p>
<p>And any item that gets heated up will emit light. This is called black body radiation, and is the reason why heating and melting metal goes from red to white.</p>
<p>This black body radiation starts at the infrared end of light, which is why night vision Google's can see people in the dark. We are always glowin in IR.</p>
<p>Also this is just a hill in the spectrum, and most of the light will always be in the IR spectrum, even if you hear something to white hot. It's just white because you have about the same light for each frequency from red to blue. But most of that light will be IR. That's just a limitation of the physics of black body radiation .</p>
<p>And since IR is of no use to use when we want to illuminate a room, we call this energy lost.</p>
<p>Obviously if you use incandescent bulbs in the winter, you will safe that amount of &quot;lost&quot; energy in heating.</p>
<p>But creating that electricity in the first place had some energy lost as heat already, so electrical heaters are never as efficient as simply burning oil or gas.</p>
<p>Both explanations are somewhat simplified. But the tl;dr is LEDs make one specific frequency of light (in their most general design) while incandescent bulbs produce a broad range of frequencies, which due to physical limitations is mostly in the infra red range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incandescent bulbs glow because they are hot. LEDs glow because of special properties of the material they are made of. That means they don't have to get hot in order to work. They still do get hot as a result of working, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. The lightbulb is like a brute force approach - we make a little wire heat up until it gets white hot. That means it radiates a bunch of heat because it's so hot. The LED turns electricity into light directly using some quantum mumbo-jumbo.</p></div>		</li>
