			<div class="markdown"><p>A pregnant mother should avoid scooping cat litter due to toxoplasmosis. </p>
<p>Also certain deli meats and soft cheeses should be avoided due to Listeria. </p>
<p>Both of those can infect a fetus. </p>
<p>Avoidance of a lot of seafood is recommended too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats are unfairly blamed for toxoplasmosis. Apparently they only cause 1 in 10 infections in humans in the US. </p>
<p>9 out of 10 people get it from undercooked meat.</p>
<p>Oh, and if a cat does have it, the cat will only have it for a few weeks, then it will be immune for life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just to babies under a year old. Toddlers are fine. It even says so on honey bottles if you are in the US.</p>
<p>Just take a minute to google &quot;safe foods for babies/toddlers&quot; when you/your SO is pregnant. There's a good chance your doctor will have plenty of handouts or take the opportunity if your hospital offers a free parenting class. There's really a lot of quirks for babies for small things you won't consider, but if you are remotely interested in learning about babies before yours comes you should be fine.</p></div>		</li>
