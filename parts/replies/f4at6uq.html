			<div class="markdown"><p>If the patient is suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning and has carbon monoxide bonded to their hemoglobin instead of oxygen it shows up the same way to the device so you gotta be aware of that depending on the situation.</p>
<p>The formula for the percentage is a ratio of unsaturated hemoglobin to saturated, so even though different populations have different red blood cell concentrations (higher altitudes have more for example) that doesn't change the result theoretically. Heavy smokers and stuff can sit at a lower oxygen saturation than would be normal for a healthy person but that's to be expected. If they're bleeding out it can still be normal even though their blood volume is too low to properly oxygenate their tissues.</p>
<p>We use it in combination with another metric &quot;end tidal CO2&quot; to get a better picture of how effective the patient's respirations are. The other half of respiration is getting CO2 out of the body and the end tidal CO2 device is incredibly accurate for showing the blood concentration of CO2 from what I've heard.</p>
<p>Neither is to be completely relied on, like the nurse in the top comment said we treat the patient not the machine. More important than the specific numbers is looking for changes and trends as well.</p>
<p>Doctor might be able to give a better answer, I'm a paramedic student.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The optical properties of hemoglobin are, yes.  Everything else.. not so much.</p>
<p>The idea behind the dual-color system is that not much else has <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayal_Romem2/publication/264009809/figure/fig1/AS:213862549856261@1428000213761/Absorption-spectra-of-the-oxygenated-and-deoxygenated-hemoglobin-molecules-Notes-In-the.png" target="_blank">this weird of a absorption curve</a>.  So you use a point where both lines are the same to get a baseline, then you look at a point where they are way different to measure.</p>
<p>This does require your ear/finger to not have any other components with a highly differential response like that, but IIRC there aren't any naturally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s normally quoted as being accurate to within +- 2%. The lower it goes the less accurate it is as the accuracy of pulse oximeters was initially tested in healthy volunteers and its gets a bit ethically  dicey to start inducing saturation’s below 75% in volunteers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A question i've never really been able to confidently answer (as a nurse) is how anemia impacts pulse ox. like could a patient with a 7 hemoglobin come up as 100% on room air and still feel short of breath due to his low hgb? or will it reflect in his oximetry level?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first hunch is correct. The measurement is percent of hemoglobin that’s saturated, but not total oxygen content or WHAT it’s saturated with (like CO for example). If your patient has a very low H/H their sats may read normal but their oxygenation won’t be. Thus the ABG is the gold standard, but obviously we’re not doing art sticks all the time.
Along similar lines, I always roll my eyes when I hear someone say “his sats went down to 7 during the code”. No, his perfusion tanked during CPR. A pulse ox probe on any extremity is pretty meaningless in that circumstance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True that, i feel like when they give me a number below 30-40 is useless. I used to do anaesthetic and we could watch the Sat drop from 100 to 60 something and pt can still have a rhythm but ofc turning blue. When it goes down to 40 to 50 then we are just getting ready to jump on the chest. ABG is a gold standard when a pt is arrested. I heard nowadays the forehead sensor is very very close to the reading on ABG however I haven’t seen people using forehead sensor during a code blue yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a respiratory therapist. They will show 100% on RA and feel sob. The oximeter may show more frequent desats due to lower o2 reserve. These patients will need supplemental oxygen because their actual content of oxygen in there blood, a combination of oxygen combined to hemoglobin and desolved in blood, is low. Oximetry has its limitations, doesn't take into account hemoglobin, and can be tricked by other things attached to hemoglobin (carbon monoxide or methemoglobin). Only way to know for sure is a blood gas to see hemoglobin, carbon monoxide or dyshemoglobin levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supplemental oxygen only has a very limited effect in patients with high sats but low haemoglobin concentrations. The vast majority of oxygen is carried bound to haemoglobin, only a tiny fraction is carried in solution in the plasma. What they need is more haemoglobin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pulse ox is less accurate in cases of anemia, but will still generally read normal or normal-ish o2 saturation, because it's not directly measuring the amount of hemoglobin. If anemia is suspected, an arterial blood gas test will reveal it, because low hemoglobin lowers cO2 only, while pO2 and sO2 remain normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the anemia is very extreme, it shouldn't impact pCO2 very much. Add cooximetry onto that blood gas and you get a nice breakdown of total hemoglobin as well as oxy- and deoxy-. The pulse oximeter will likely still be correct at a Hgb of 7, but the cO2 (oxygen concentration) will be reduced by nearly half from a normal Hgb level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple other pieces of info:</p>
<p>The detector can tell what's blood from what's skin, bone, and muscle by watching what happens over time.  It looks for the difference between when your heart is pumping vs. when it's resting.</p>
<p>Also, the lights shined are as near a single color (i.e, frequency) of light as is possible (they're two mirrors away from being lasers).  Different substances absorb those specific colors at different, known rates.  Carbon monoxide-laden blood looks different than oxygen-laden blood because of the ratios of the different colors of light that is absorbed.  At least one of the pulse oxymeters out there will tell you how much oxygen is in your blood and also tell you how much carbon monoxide is in there (along with a bunch of other stuff).</p>
<p>They haven't yet found colors of light that are absorbed appreciably differently for glucose than for water but they're working on it.</p>
<p>Edit: Source: I was chief architect on a pulse oxymeter.  A fun aside: my best friend was in the hospital and I was pretty excited to see them use the pulse oxymeter I designed and whose infrastructure I implemented on him.</p></div>		</li>
