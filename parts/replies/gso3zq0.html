			<div class="markdown"><p>Just saying &quot;everything produces light, but some of it is infrared&quot; doesn't actually answer the question, though.  What mechanism produces the photons?</p>
<p>My vague recollection from intro physics is that when atoms/molecules collide, an electron can be temporarily bumped up into a higher-energy orbital, absorbing some kinetic energy from the collision in the process.  When the electron returns back down to the empty lower-energy orbital, a photon is produced with a wavelength appropriate to the energy difference between the orbitals.  So higher temperatures result in higher frequency photons because the higher kinetic energy of the collisions can bump the electrons up into higher orbitals. </p>
<p>Please correct if this is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are on a good path, but there are some wrong things. Here is some additional info:<br />
- Orbitals, or levels as we call them, are so called &quot;bound&quot; states. If the electrons were only bumped in the bound states and then relaxed down emitting photons, your spectrum would consist of a lot of little &quot;emission lines&quot;, and would look like an irregular &quot;comb&quot; or something like that. To completely describe continuous spectrum of a blackbody, you have to invoke two other types of processes:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Free-Bound : Ion and electron recombine to produce a neutral atom (or ion of lesser ionization state), and extra energy is released as a photon. </li>
<li>Free-Free: Ion and electron that are free sorta reconfigure their positions (actually an electron slows down in an environment full of ions), and extra kinetic energy of the electron releases a photon. We also call this Bremsstralung (breaking radiation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, contrary to bound-bound processes, where only discrete wavelengths can be produced, the learler two processes produce continuous wavelengths.   </p>
<p>The key, however, to getting nice blackbody radiation, is that all these processes are in the some sort of equilibrium. When the whole body is kept at the same temperature, and let alone so all the processes can reach equilibrium it will emit as a blackbody.   </p>
<p>If there are some sorts of gradients of temperature (as in the atmosphere of the Sun for example), each layer can *localy* behave as a blackbody, but what we will see is some weird superposition of these, and that is why solar spectrum looks &quot;chopped up&quot;, as u/Astrokiwi neatly put it.   </p>
<p>This all might be too technical but I hope it helps.</p></div>		</li>

So Bremsstrahlung is &quot;braking radiation&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this have to do with entropy? Like how everything is slowly breaking down and giving off energy? Is the free-free process you described the energy emissions of entropy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may not necessarily be in a situation where that simple picture is right. In general, you think of orbitals when you have isolated atoms, or molecules (though molecular orbitals are much more complex). Many solids, however, are crystal lattices (notably metals), where the 'orbitals' might be delocalized in space (i.e. you're no longer allowed to think of an electron as &quot;belonging&quot; to a given atom anymore), and the allowed energies are organized in quasi-continuous 'bands' instead of discrete orbitals. In that situation, the dynamics may be governed by phonons, which are elementary lattice excitations that behave sort of like particles, and collide with defects and/or the material boundaries. You may be justified in treating the material as a phonon gas.</p>
<p>Anyway, point is, this stuff gets complicated fast and it's not necessarily the case that the simple picture of an isolated atom or molecule is instructive for understanding the relevant microphysics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, which means... it is white. Stars are neither green (spectrum more strongly peaked in the green middle than blackbody), nor purple (spectrum more flattened out than blackbody or even a dip in the green so there's more of the red and blue ends).</p>
<p>White light often has the peak in the green wavelengths. Just not strong enough to actually appear green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes were evolved to see in sunlight, so where sunlight is brightest is visible light.</p>
<p>If our eyes are fine-tuned to register sunlight as white, we can better distinguish more different hues. I'm not 100% certain, but I believe the cones that capture green wavelengths actually require more light to register the same perceived brightness, and computer screens actually have to compensate for that.</p></div>		</li>
