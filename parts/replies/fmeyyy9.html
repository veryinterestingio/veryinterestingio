			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm friends with a little old lady at a nearby nursing home. She had her first ever seizure - a grand mal - in her doctor's office when she was ~80yo. She spent about a minute dead before they revived her, then she had her second ever seizure, also a grand mal, in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. She woke up there with no recollection of even going to the doctor's office. Her doctor told her that if she'd had it literally anywhere else, she wouldn't be here right now. She'd never had any kind of seizure or related symptoms in her entire life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can happen yes, but the bigger concern is when the body is actively seizing, your muscles are using up all the precious sugar supply in storage and floating around in the blood.</p>
<p>Only problem with that is the brain. Your brain does not have any storage/reserve capacity. It relies on sugar in the circulating blood to function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be interested in looking at the study for that. From what I know to be true you can burn with +90% max heart rate for about 45 mins before muscle glucose is exhausted. By that time heat exhaustion would likely be a much bigger problem. In any case once the glucose is gone you simply start eating your own muscle tissue (and mainly fat) for energy. Otherwise endurance sports ppl would be dropping dead left and right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So how do alcoholics get out of being addicted to this? Are they supposed to just lower their consumption bit by bit over many weeks until their body gets used to less alcohol content?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had been drinking everyday for over three years, was up to a half gallon of vodka every two days in the last three months prior to treatment.  When I detoxed it was three full days of no alcohol with Librium (Chlordiazepoxide which is classified as a benzo) to help with withdrawal symptoms.  I took three doses the first 24 hours and one dose a day the other two days.  It definitely helped.  When you are in  withdrawal it feels like you are on a string being pulled 7 degrees off of relativity and you go thru states of seeing things in &quot;multi-shot camera&quot; mode if that makes sense.  You try to sit still but just end up twitching and its hard to do cognitive functions.  The librium kept me calm and helped me sleep which was a lifesaver.  Day 4-7 i was on something else not near as strong and after that it was nothing but melatonin to sleep.</p>
<p>When I relapsed 8 months later for only a month, I detoxed at home and ween'd the first night with nothing at all by third.  I have been sober since (over 3 years.)  The second time was rough but way easier since it hadn't been near as long (though i was right back to a fifth a day after 2 weeks within that month relapse.)  Needless to say I'm happy to be alive and sober!</p></div>		</li>
