			<div class="markdown"><p>Giving birth lying on your back is a relatively recent thing to make it easier for the doctors. Squatting, all fours etc means gravity is on your side more and makes it much easier and less likely to tear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true.  For my children I spent the last portion of labour either squatting on a birthing stool or up on all fours.  All natural and no tearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, my MIL broke her tailbone when my husband was born. He was a big baby at 10lb 1oz. My MIL always thought her tailbone broke because he was a big baby. It wasn’t until my SIL got pregnant and went to birthing classes that warned against laying down during delivery that she found out a broken tailbone can also be a complication of that position in addition to tearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere (or saw a video?) a long time ago saying that giving birth while squatting or on all fours is much easier and how women used to give birth a longtime ago. Idk tho I’ll try to find the source</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's how a lot of women give birth, yes. Modern standards give women the relative freedom to assume any pose that's comfortable for them, and both squatting or pushing on all fours are some of the more popular ones.</p></div>		</li>
