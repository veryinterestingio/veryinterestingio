			<div class="markdown"><p>2.4Ghz Wifi channels are like 11 urinals in a row with no divider between them, and your pee splashes and hits people using the four urinals on either side of you (interference).</p>
<p>Urinals 1, 6, and 11 are just far enough away from each other that you won’t be splashed by their pee, and they won’t be splashed by you.</p>
<p>The question is why don’t they just leave urinals 1, 6, and 11 open and close down the others so we’re not accidentally peeing on each other all the time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're in an apartment building, get a 5GHz router because they have way more non-overlapping channels available, but yes, everyone using the same three channels is the best way to avoid interference, and your router will most likely automatically put you on the least congested of the three.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes because WiFi routers in the same channel can avoid talking on top of one another if they can hear one another. If you're on 6 and 5, no coordination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2.4GHz Wifi uses frequencies from 2.401GHz to 2.473GHz and splits this frequency range into 11 channels, each 22MHz wide. Usually a communication channel should be independent of all others, but with basic arithmetic you can see that 11*22MHz doesn’t fit inside 72MHz. This means that channels have to overlap and interfere with each other: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg/1920px-2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg/1920px-2.4_GHz_Wi-Fi_channels_%28802.11b%2Cg_WLAN%29.svg.png</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When 802.11b (essentially the first WiFi that most people got) was invented, the internet was a far more sedate place, but the worlds radio spectrums were not. 802.11b took a bit of the wireless spectrum which was mostly available in most countries and assigned it 14 (IIRC) non overlapping channels. </p>
<p>Eli5: think of passing a message by whistling, if you stop and start your whistle you can send a pattern which can be interpreted by a listener, but someone else can also whistle at a different note, stopping and starting their whistle to send another message, if the notes are sufficiently different then two independent messages can be transmitted and received without interference. </p>
<p>Aside: Different countries have a slightly different set of available channels because the radio spectrum is allocated nationally, so let’s say that there is a emergency service whistle used to draw attention. In a country with these emergency service whistles it’s kinda important to prevent anyone whistling at that frequency, so the standard whistling frequencies are limited there. </p>
<p>Now, let’s imagine that a “channel” could only have two states, on and off, you can send more information in a given time by stopping and starting more frequently, but inevitably at some point it becomes difficult to differentiate the whistle from noise, so that’s of limited success. </p>
<p>BUT if you decided to whistle in two tones rather than one then you can now send 4 states instead of 2 (previously A/a, now AB, Ab, aB, ab), if you select three tones you can send 8 states(4x the throughput). BUT you are using more of that precious space, and rather than using “channel 6” you are actually using “channels 5,6,7”. This is where we are now, pretty much everyone is using a standard that smears the message across multiple channels, but the way we specify which channel to use is by the centre frequency, so while there is an illusion of 14 channels there are only three which don’t overlap, however, it’s possible to chose a centre frequency which isn’t on these three, in which case your signal now overlaps with two of the previously non-overlapping signals.</p></div>		</li>
