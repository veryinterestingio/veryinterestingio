It makes sense now that you have to have the correct partial pressure of o2, but you have to cut it with something to prevent dangerous o2 partial pressure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes and I'm really, really glad you have a basic understanding of partial pressures as this is going to make it so much easier.</p>
<p>Below 9m the partial pressure of pure O2 exceeds the safety margin of (either 1.4 or 1.6) and at this concentration Central Nervous System toxicity happens and this results in loss of control of the body and muscles, usually the diver goes into uncontrollable spasms and has no control over their body at all (or keeping their reg in with facial muscles) resulting in drowning normally.</p>
<p>Edit.... for shallow diving extra O2 can be added to reduce the on-take of nitrogen and extend the no-decompression dive time, but this comes with reduced depth limits. For deeper diving where the normal amount of O2 become dangerous below 60+ meters, it's then Tri-mix is used so a small amount of Helium is added to the air to reduce the partial pressure of the O2 without increasing the PP of the nitrogen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully they worked out the maths and realised that way, but probably not, because the safe limit for PP of O2 has been gradually reduced over the years, it's now (iirc) 1.6 max and 1.4 recommended, before that it was 1.8 max and 1.6 recommended...and divers at work used to run to 2.0+ at times</p></div>		</li>
