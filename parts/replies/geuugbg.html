			<div class="markdown"><p>The obvious answer is you can determine what virus is causing your symptoms. There are good tests for the flu these days, but since there are so many viruses that cause ‘colds’ it is generally not as easy to test for at your pcp. From a pathology standpoint though there are usually some differences between how the flu and a cold may present. Generally speaking, ‘colds’ include sore throats, stuffy nose, coughs while flu will almost always present with fever. While the flu can sometimes cause things like sore throat, fever and body aches are more rarely caused by cold viruses. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I briefly tried to do this research myself, but then gave up and figured I’d ask you. </p>
<p>You write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s unique to influenza, other viruses can’t do that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the part I don’t understand. What is it about influenza that is so unique, that it has these characteristics that no other virus family has? Is it possible that, say, a coronavirus could mutate and take on these influenza-like mutation-be-damned superpowers? Or (in my childish model of it in my head), did influenza branch off evolutionarily from the other viruses so long ago that there’s pretty much no chance random mutation could grant another virus these powers? Is there something <em>radically</em> different about influenza vs <em>every other virus family</em>? Are there any other virus families that are even remotely capable of doing what influenza does?</p>
<p>I mean, <em>how</em> different is influenza from other viruses? Is it like the difference between, I dunno, a human and an iguana, or is it more like the difference between... a human and a jellyfish?</p>
<p>I really don’t have a good grasp on this, would appreciate any pointers</p>
<p>EDIT: and thank you for the wonderful explanation</p></div>		</li>

<p>Influenza (and, specifically, influenza A) happened to draw a hemagglutinin protein that can retain its function in spite of mutations. That’s why it’s <em>influenza</em>, instead of one of the millions upon millions of viruses you’ve never heard of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Explaining a complex system in simpler terms, according to a geneticist I've worked with:</p>
<p>Influenza's spike protein, hemagglutinin, contains a long &quot;neck&quot; between the main body of the virus and the tip where it matches with cell proteins to bind to the cell. Lots of viruses have these spike proteins. Influenza's is particularly tolerant of having the length of that &quot;neck&quot; change without impacting the ability to bind to the cell. However, the length of the neck does impact your body's immune system and its ability to identify and bind the virus.  This is combined with a fairly simple protein structure that forms that neck. It's easy for the virus to take on mutations that change the length of that neck.</p>
<p>So, there is at least one system where mutations can be made that don't hurt the virus, but confuse the immune system. There are a couple other common mutation sites with more complex patterns, but similar results.</p>
<p>Other viruses have spike proteins, but very few of them rely on a system that is as tilted in favor of viruses. In some ways, it suggests that it was inevitable that some virus would find and exploit this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not correct. You might be thinking about neuraminidase, where the stalk length can change, but it’s not true of hemagglutinin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought you need to refresh your influenza vaccination precicely because it wouldnt work anymore due to the virus having mutated.
Good to know its just a short immunisation.
So the anwer as to why influenza immunisation only lasts a year is that we dont know?</p></div>		</li>
