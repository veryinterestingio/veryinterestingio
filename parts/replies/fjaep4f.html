			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true. With the prevalence of distribution platforms, the software downloads only the patches and content additions that are necessary. If a file is changed multiple times by different patches only the latest is downloaded. If you are manually updating software then its dependant on the distributer on how they package their patches but this is pretty rare these days especially for games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh ok.  So does that explain the seemingly long time it takes to 'read' and 'write' the data that has been downloaded?  With one particularly popular game, I was always confused with how it will download 5GB relatively quickly at 100mbps, but when looking at the read and writing bars, it says its reading or writing at 100's of MB/s but that process always seems to take forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long read/write is usually due to how the game files are stored. Typically this is because it is unpacking files (similar to zipped files) injecting the new data and then repackaging.</p></div>		</li>
