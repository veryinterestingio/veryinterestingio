The first dry copiers, the great-grandfathers of laser printers, oriented both the document feed and image positioning to the middle of the paper. Cutting the paper to a funny size that just fit into the paper feed wasn't especially difficult.</p>
<p>Some time between the JFK assassination and the Watergate investigations this became common practice on the legal profession and other gigs prone to multiple revisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for Latin phrases continuing is not wanting to be different or institutional memory. While the origin of its use was a bit gatekeeper esq, the maintenance of it is due to how language normally works and that Latin, being functionally dead, doesn't follow. </p>
<p>Normally a language changes over time, with meanings of words drifting about and sometimes even flipping. For example: decimate originally followed the Latin origin of a type of punishment that affected 1/10 of the group, and meant to reduce <em>by</em> 1/10 but now carries a meaning closer to reduce <em>to</em> 1/10.</p>
<p>In law the aim is to establish clear meanings that can be applied consistently. One does not want a law to be changed by the change in language use instead of by due process. So Latin phrases are used to anchor the meaning.</p>
<p>We see the problem of using English for specific meanings in science with lay-people misunderstanding the scientific meaning of &quot;theory&quot; for a more general English use. Hence the &quot;it's only a theory&quot; phrase.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the only reason science ever uses English over Latin or Greek </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you perhaps talking specifically about biology?  In my field of research, Greek is used only for variable names, and purely for visual clarity -- many letters from the roman alphabet can be easily confused for parts of words, and there aren't enough of the remaining ones.  Its use is falling out of favour; more and more analytical work is done in code, and the tendency there is to use named variables rather than single-character symbols.</p>
<p>I've never seen Latin in a journal paper, unless you want to count occasional use of roman numerals for categorical numeric designators.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the first Latin most law students will see are &quot;res ipsa loquitur&quot; and &quot;mens rea&quot; they are specific terms to discuss topics that are quite old. </p>
<p>However, most modern law schools emphasize avoiding legalese. If it doesn't help lawyer communicate more efficiently it should be avoided. It's very noticeable reading something written today vs something 30+ years ago. Much less overly formal and flowery language for the sake of sounding important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t actually think it is. US laws are made in English and the problem OP talks about in terms of “laws changing with meaning changing” is taken care of by principles of statutory interpretation i.e. courts interpret statutes words by their ordinary and common meaning at the time the law was passed. Most stuff that’s in Latin (and occasionally French) are conceptual not substantive. For example, the res ipsa loquitur seems to stick around because it’s much more elegant than saying “it’s too fucked up not to be negligence,” or “voir dire” is just straight up shorter than saying “preliminary jury selection interviews.”</p></div>		</li>
