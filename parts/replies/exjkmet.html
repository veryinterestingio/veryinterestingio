			<div class="markdown"><p>Another theory is it is similar to the sound of tooth damage. A Neanderthal with a broken tooth could very well die so those that accidentally had a bad reaction to the sounds similar to tooth damage survived longer.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This completely makes sense to me. Whenever I hear sounds like that, I get an unpleasant sensation in my teeth more than anywhere else. And I get the same feeling when I accidentally bite down wrong and grind my teeth together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. Before I even read your comment, this thread was making me think of a developmental delayed student of mine whose jaw and teeth make this godawful squeaky noise as he moves his jaw. AGGHHH it takes everything in me to not just get up and walk away from him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like if evolutionarily humans don’t like this sound because it’s a symbol of distress then maybe humans who are more sympathetic (meaning more in tune to or caring towards the distress of others) are more sensitive to it? Was just having a little fun lol</p></div>		</li>
