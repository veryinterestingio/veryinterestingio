			<div class="markdown"><p>The fish are not sterile, the water just doesn’t have the correct ph to allow the eggs to fertilize. I’m going to assume you talking about Braunig Lake in San Antonio where TPW stock the redfish. The fish spawn every fall and will stack in the deep water near the damn. The guides will slaughter 30”+ reds when they’re spawning. While I know they can’t reproduce and there is no size limit, lots of people take the big ones home for eating. Don’t know how they stomach them. The big ones are not delicious.</p></div>		</li>
