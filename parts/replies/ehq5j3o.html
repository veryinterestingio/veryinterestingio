			<div class="markdown"><p>A woman I knew died owing thousands on credit cards and &quot;buy now pay later&quot; credit accounts.  She was disabled, not working, and was living on benefits (UK) the whole time she was racking up this debt.  She had a negative net worth.</p>
<p>I think the shady &quot;buy now pay later&quot; people were happy to make the interest payments from her for all the overpriced stuff she bought from them, I doubt they lost money on her despite having to write off the outstanding debt.</p></div>		</li>
