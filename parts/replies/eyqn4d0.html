			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays there are heat pump water heaters, which take heat out of the surrounding air and pump it into the water. They're more efficient than water heaters which simply use an electric heating element, but gas water heaters are still less expensive to run probably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a hybrid electric heat pump and water heater.  It dropped my electric bill significantly and unless it's over 90f, just turning on the central air fan (the air handler is in the basement with the heat pump) without turning on the AC will keep my house comfortable and cool (around 70f in the main parts of the house on a 85f day,  60f and lower on the basement with the heat pump) . It's a massive savings too,  the cost of my electric bill dropped almost $200 a month in the really hot months. </p>
<p>Fun fact, the hybrid heat pump water heaters also absorb humidity from the air, so you don't need to run a dehumidifier in the basement either (which certainly contributes to savings).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in HVAC, and heat pumps that heat your hot water tank while cooling your building can definitely work and save energy.</p>
<p>However, they are almost always installed wrong by engineers who are just trying to score &quot;Green&quot; points. They either get the piping wrong or else they try to violate the first law of thermodynamics by only expecting heating/cooling without having a sufficient place to send unwanted heating/cooling on the other side of the heat pump.</p>
<p>Perhaps the rest of the world does better, but here in western Canada I've seen dozens of buildings that have won LEED certification awards and been touted as super efficient in the marketing brochures, but then overheat during the summer, cost more to install, cost more to run, and have far more mechanical breakdowns than just using traditional AC cooling and gas heating.</p>
<p>It's great to see the occasional &quot;Green&quot; building actually working well and saving energy and money for the customers/tenants, but those have been the exception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Passive Houses (specifically the originally German, now international, &quot;Passiv Haus&quot; designation) are so tight and so well insulated that often the HRV can maintain comfort with no (well, very little) actual supplemental heat. There is more heat than you'd think gained through (smartly placed) windows, cooking, even body heat throughout the day. The HRV does a great job of introducing fresh air that retains ~90% of the heat of the building's air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also exist in much larger scales, such as power plants. Also know by the term economiser (any machine meant to reduce energy usage) you use the otherwise wasted energy in the exhaust to preheat the water before it goes in the boiler.</p>
<p>When this was a new invention they grabbed a little to much heat so steam in the smoke started condensing in the smokestack, causing it to rust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are pool heaters that hook into your AC lines.  </p>
<p>If your pool is cool enough to sink heat energy it activates a valve and diverts refrigerant to a heat exchanger to heat your pool instead of using the regular condenser.  </p>
<p>They're very efficient if you live in a temperate climate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do wonder about the balance of how much heat you need to extract from indoors to be comfortable vs how much can be dumped to the pool without making it uncomfortable in the summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is going to get a little mathsy.</p>
<p>Specific heat is how you measure how much heat something can &quot;absorb&quot;. It's a unit that measures how much energy is needed to raise 1 kilogram of a substance 1 degree.  It varies by ambient temperature so I'm going to simplify a bit.</p>
<p>The specific heat of water is around 4000 j/K/kg (that's the unit you use for specific heat). Air is around 1000. That means that for every 4kg of air you cool, you heat 1kg of water the same amount.</p>
<p>Let's say your house contains about 500,000 litres of air. That air weighs about 1.225 grams per litre, so that's roughly 400kg of air. So cooling your house 1 degree would only heat 100kg (which is also 100 litres) of water 1 degree.</p>
<p>So your 30,000 litre pool can absorb the heat of cooling your house 300 degrees before it itself increases by 1 degree.</p>
<p>Water is pretty nuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, that's great if your house is a vacuum-insulated dewar. But there will always be constant sources of heat coming into the house. Otherwise, the AC would run once, then shutoff until you open the door.</p>
<p>So my real point was that over several months of the AC running during the day, eventually the pool will be hot enough that you don't want to add any more heat, at which point you have to switch to the usual method of just dumping the heat to the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pool can probably lose a substantial amount of heat to the outside air, especially if the nights are cool. You could maybe put a fountain in it when it's not being used to help cool it more, like a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_pond" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spray_pond</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, ac units use compression/decompression of a refrigerant to suck the heat out of air and spit the heat outside, but it takes energy to do that, it doesn't give energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Home AC units also use phase change, meaning they boil liquid refrigerant as it absorbs heat from indoors at low pressure, and then condense it back into liquid at high pressure outside as it releases heat into the outside air. The pressure change is what allows heat to be pumped, but compressing the refrigerant gas takes a lot of energy. Blowing outside air to cool the condenser and distributing interior air also takes energy, but is only needed to help increase efficiency and make things smaller. The transition from high pressure to low pressure before the evaporator only happens via a nozzle. A little bit of energy could be recovered there if you wanted but it's not economical to recover it.</p>
<p>Many aircraft instead compress air (which heats it up), cool it using outside air, and then expand it, which cools it down well below outside temperatures. There is no refrigerant or phase change involved there, but it's less efficient.</p></div>		</li>
