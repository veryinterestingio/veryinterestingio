			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on this explanation, modern phones will have chips that perform a lot of functions in one.  The same chip doing compass duties may also do altitude, temperature, humidity, accelerometer, etc.  Both because it reduces the amount of space required to have all these functions in the phone, and they can complement each others accuracy  (the compass can more accurately self-calibrate if it knows which direction is &quot;down&quot; from the accelerometer)</p></div>		</li>
