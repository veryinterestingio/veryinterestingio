			<div class="markdown"><p>More conventional techniques such as the ones you mentioned  (Lorentz, holography, but also STEM-DPC)  all observe the in-plane components of the magnetic fields (i.e. the ones aligned orthogonal to the travel direction of the electron beam). Vortex beams allow to tap in the out-of-plane component i.e. the one parallel to the electron's trajectory. By using inelastic scattering you can measure magnetisation in the atomic orbitals with dichroic measurements (I'm way oversimplifying, but it's similar to XMCD), examples <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399117301195" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.134428" target="_blank">here</a>. Vortex beams are also phase-shifted by out of plane magnetic fields, and this is measurable as shown <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00829-5" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2040-8986/ab51fc" target="_blank">here</a>, though not particularly sensitive and a bit contrived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Giulio, what do you think of the new fusion technique using hydrogen boron-11? Can a lazer be constructed to fire electrons instead of protons?</p>
<p>You said you can manipulate magnetic elements using vortex beams. Does it change the gravitational influence at all through these magnetic fields?</p>
<p>That image where you say how cool is that, showing an image of molecules attached together, would make it seem like it goes against the theory behind how atoms should actually look. Atoms should be miniscule compared to the election wave surrounding them. Does that mean all the little balls touching each other are in fact the outer shell of the electrons?</p></div>		</li>
