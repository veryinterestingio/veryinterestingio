			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty close to the basic physical explanation that I've heard, but your stomach shouldn't really be stretching out that much unless you consistently eat a ludicrous amount for dinner. More commonly, the more food you eat at once, the more acid your stomach produces to deal with the next meal being just as big. So eat much = body prepared for much and disappointed VS not eat much = body cool with that and good for a couple more hours</p></div>		</li>
