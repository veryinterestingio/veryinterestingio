<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold!!</p>
<p>For those worried about clogging traffic, a carmada is when you are traveling at a slightly higher speed than the other cars while you are in the middle lane on a 6 or 7 lane freeway in low traffic. When you look in the rear view mirror, you can see the other cars flanking you on all sides. The overall effect is that of a tightly-formed armada of cars sailing into battle with you at the helm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem comes from right lane drivers who don't like to be passed. This scenario happens way more often than it should : I'll be driving 5mph faster than the guy in front of me, so I go to the left lane. As soon as the nose of my car appears in the slow-driver's peripheral vision he looks at his/her speedometer, realizes he/she is driving slower than expected, and speeds up to match my speed. And suddenly I'm the a-hole in the left lane, unless I floor it to get ahead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not even that.  People have the mentality that you shouldn't be or don't need to go faster than they are.</p>
<p>So a person doing 75 will see someone doing 80 and will speed up to 78/80 just to prevent them from passing.  </p>
<p>They do there best to turn it into a race.</p>
<p>This becomes 100% obvious when you drive with cruise control.  </p>
<p>I slowly catch up to someone but when I move left to pass them they speed up to stop me.  I get sick of the stupid cunt and stomp on the gas, move directly in front of them and go back to cruise control.  They give up and go back to the speed they were comfortable at.  And slowly fade away.</p>
<p>Happens countless times on any long trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The left lane is for passing. If rising above your cruise control speed is necessary, than do it. A 4 or 5 mph differential is not that fast of a pass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's nearly the very same principle as stand on the right, walk on the left when using escalators.  When the road/escalator is sparsely populated it is best to leave the passing lane open so faster people can move through.  However, when there is congestion then the highest throughput is actually achieved by disallowing passing and everybody stays in their lane or stands on the escalator.</p>
<p>Much of rush hour traffic is caused by unnecessary braking due to poor merging and lane changing.  If everyone stayed in their own lane unless they were exiting AND people did not ride the exit lane then rush hour traffic would move significantly faster.  Trying to pick the faster lane is a fools errand and only slows down everyone behind you.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This depends entirely on the road. If there's a turnoff to the left up ahead and one to the right further down the road, traffic will often flow better if most people first avoid the left lane and then avoid the right lane. Even if people aren't doing that, if <em>I</em> do that efficiently I'll get there much faster and will be one less car per mile taking up space. </p>
<p>If there are two lanes with no real difference in traffic flow due to turning, though? Yeah, you might as well just hang out. </p>
<p>And if you're not good at making use of gaps and thinking about traffic four dimensionally you should probably just hang out regardless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Standing on a congested escalator is not the means of fastest throughput.  Stand right/walk left is still faster even in times of congestion.</p>
<p>I 100% agree with your point about people causing the traffic though  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same laws are in place basically everywhere in the US too (if not everywhere) but they're 100% unenforced. It's illegal to pass on the right in the US. It's also illegal to impede traffic in the left lane (regardless of being over the speed limit)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that true that they do not stay together long? On road trips I would often come upon “clumps” of cars and carefully find my way through them. In general, they can be seen from a long ways away and are for the most part a static pattern of cars moving along together. </p>
<p>Thankfully I now live in a place where people generally keep the left lane clear except for passing and also often drive a lot faster than I do, but when I was in the US, the “clumps” were extremely annoying. Seemed like people found comfort driving together, where myself, I prefer to not cruise along next to another car for a long period of time.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. There are definitely folks who enjoy driving in clumps for some reason. I’ve never understood it, and I always prefer to have my own space, when possible. I’ll sometimes ‘group up’ with other fast drivers on the freeway for safety in numbers (from speed traps), but I don’t understand the people doing it at or below the speed limit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I find it a lot easier to go the speed limit when I'm maintaining distance from someone who's also going the speed limit. If I'm on a long road trip and there are no other cars around me, I can absentmindedly find myself going 15 over the speed limit and start to run the risk of speed traps, but if there's a car in front of me, I subconsciously keep perfect pace with them without having to concentrate on doing so. I also grew up in a deer-heavy area and it puts me at ease to know that I'm not the one who's going to get their windshield remodeled if there's even the slightest chance of deer in the area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that I have a range of about 5mph that I'm comfortable traveling at.  So if I come up behind someone who's going around the speed I want to be, even if they're a little slower than me, it doesn't bother me enough to want to speed up out of that comfort zone to pass them.  But if they are going much faster than me they drive away, and if they're going much slower than me I get annoyed and pass them, but I could imagine that the flexibility of the number results in a longer period of time spent in the presence of other cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that aside from fast car/slow car buildup, I think some people unconsciously like to drive in a pack. Having another car on the road allows you to unconsciously monitor your speed -&quot;other cars are around me so I guess I am driving the appropriate speed.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
