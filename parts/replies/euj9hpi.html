			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. You could be in a calorie deficit, whilst being in a nutrient surplus. Depends what you eat. Salads, a mix of veggies and nutrient dense meat/ or lots of cashews/peanuts under 1500 calories? Golden. </p>
<p>Coco pops, a slice of toast with Nutella, chips and a burger, and super noodles for dinner? Yeah, you might not perform optimally. Not attacking anyone, or their diets though - whatever works for you; works for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Even if you stopped eating for several days I don't think there would be any serious mental side effects until your body started metabolizing muscle and tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>End part is false. There is nothing about being in a caloric deficiency that guarantees using stored energy.</p>
<p>Energy from the adipose tissue can only be accessed when serum insulin is low enough to allow the fat breaking down enzymes to function. Lipoprotien lipase breaks down triglycerides in the blood and passes it into your cells. If activity is low on muscle cells they will not get energy regardless of calorie deficits because the energy simply isn't passing through. Low insulin also allows Hormone Sensitive Lipase to break fats down from inside the adipose and let it access the blood.</p>
<p>This is often called cellular starvation. Cells will simply use less energy, or get it from muscle and bone. Weakened immune system, slower cell repair, lower body temperature, etc. There are plenty of ways you can lower cellular output. It's why people often feel tired and cold when dieting via calorie counting. The body is just lowering output to compensate for the dropped calories.
If you have a lot of body fat you shouldn't feel hungry or tired if energy is getting to the cells, that makes no sense, but it happens a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how do you diet to actually target fat then? Keto? Are there other ways? I’m doing keto right now and it seems to be working but people keep telling me it’s unhealthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keto is one of the diets that works to regulate serum insulin which is why it's so effective at weight loss. The fears over it's health are unfounded in my opinion. They are based on misconceptions about ketoacidosis (this is from T1DM not your diet) and saturated fat (which aside from making no sense, latest analysis shows no health problems from consuming it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who's telling you it's unhealthy? FWIW, I think most people on any kind of restrictive diet hear friends and relatives telling them they need to eat more or that their diet won't work because it's not sustainable.  I'd outright disregard any such comments and politely nod my way out of such conversations.</p>
<p>Getting past that, I'd suggest checking out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_keto_myths_and_concerns" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on r/keto as a starting point.</p></div>		</li>
