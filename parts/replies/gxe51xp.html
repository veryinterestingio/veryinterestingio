			<div class="markdown"><p>Armstrong was testing the fixed acceleration priority control mode of the flight control system and unintentionally over commanded the pull out portion of his ballistic reentry back in to a climb, iirc. Similar in terms of operating envelope but more testing related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about this fixed acceleration mode since most X15 had a throttle, but the <a href="https://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/neil-armstrongs-x-15-flight-over-pasadena-59458462/" target="_blank">real story</a> seems to be that they were testing an MH-96 G-limiter. In order to do the test, they had to change the profile of the flight. This caused them to pitch the nose of the plane up a bit too high during the test gaining enough lift to move up again. This trajectory then sent him on a “bounce” that he had to complete before he could turn around, and then land safely back on the salt flats.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What happens when you enter too shallow isn't really a &quot;skip&quot;, it's just that you don't get deep enough into the atmosphere to shed all the velocity you need to get rid of, and wind up leaving it again for another orbit.</p>
<p>And a &quot;skip reentry&quot; (more properly called a boost-glide) is where you <em>intentionally</em> pull out of the atmosphere before you get too deep, but after you've shed enough velocity to be on a sub-orbital trajectory. It lets you determine your landing point a bit more precisely, and means you don't shed all your velocity in one go (which means you're not subjected to as much heat from compressing the air in front of you). You can even perform multiple &quot;skips&quot; to extend your glide a bit, but you have to be careful because you've only got so much velocity (and for powered craft, ability to change your velocity) and lose some every time.</p>
<p>When you skip a stone, the stone isn't actually <em>entering</em> the water, just ricocheting off it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be.  It's not a straight up &quot;no&quot; but it's a totally different situation.  The atmosphere is very thin at that altitude so there's not much to &quot;skip&quot; off of, but if you're too steep you'll cut inward and if you're too shallow you'll go out again.</p>
<p>Because space is dealing with curves, it's like skipping a stone but you hit only a wave.  You could stop and sink, you could go straight through the wave and &quot;look&quot; like you skipped (what usually happens), or you could get a skip and end up popping up and coming down at a steeper angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know why others said no. Of course it is not exactly like skipping rocks, but at a basic level (as you asked) it can be. The atmosphere can provide lift to the reentry vehicle, which might result in escaping the atmosphere once again. At a different attitude of the capsule will result in more drag, and falling to the surface. </p>
<p>Of course, the capsule could miss reentry due to too narrow an angle, or too high a velocity, but when both of those are sufficient, you could still skip off the atmosphere due to attitude of the capsule, akin to skipping a rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a rock skips on the surface of the lake because there's a distinct boundary and difference in density between the air just above the water and the water itself (about 1000x). Water also doesn't compress, so hitting the surface of the water in a way that doesn't allow it to move out of the way fast enough is basically going to be like hitting a solid surface.</p>
<p>There's actually no real boundary between &quot;space&quot; and &quot;atmosphere&quot;, the density of molecules that make up the atmosphere just gradually increases from nearly zero as you go lower. There's nothing to hit and skip off of, the height considered to be the &quot;edge&quot; of the atmosphere is pretty arbitrary.</p>
<p>Edit: you're definitely right that producing lift due to the attitude of the craft could have an effect. But it's more a matter of going too fast and too high for the drag to slow you to suborbital velocity.</p></div>		</li>
