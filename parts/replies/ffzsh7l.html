			<div class="markdown"><p>Just hijacking to explain why people should <em>not</em> be using cotton swabs at all.</p>
<p>Your ears protect themselves with earwax. It isn't there just to annoy you, it prevents infection. When you start cleaning it away with cotton swabs you (1) damage the anti-microbial environment and (2) introduce damage to the tissue. Together, this means that you are substantially more likely get  a bacterial or fungal outer ear infection. The infection might make you more likely to use cotton swabs, but you will continue to disrupt and slow your bodies attempt to replenish the earwax. It can take a long time for the environment to recover to healthy levels.</p>
<p>Put stuff in your ears at your own risk. See a doctor if you have earwax problems.</p>
<p>Edit: A lot of people are explaining how it has not effected them, or how they think it can be used safely in moderation. This is a common misconception:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1181836/" target="_blank">15–20% of respondents disagreed with the statements that cotton buds can cause infections, wax impaction or perforations</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5812304/" target="_blank">Self-ear cleaning was higher in those who perceived the practice to being beneficial</a>; many people self clean their ears, not just people who produce excess earwax: &quot;The findings of the current study are consistent with others cited in the literature, which report a prevalence of over 90% for self-ear cleaning&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5036291/" target="_blank">Most respondents</a> had poor knowledge of the function of ear wax and the damage to the auditory canal associated with ear self-cleaning. There is thus, the need for public enlightenment on the complications of the practice.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a minor inherited condition where my ears produce excessive earwax, and clearing the excess wax out with cotton tips (gently!) stops it itching and keeps the wax from building up to the point that it interferes with my hearing. I have never gotten an ear infection from swabbing my ears. Your mileage may vary, of course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I got oxycodone ear drops + anti bacterial stuff from the ER.  I had an appointment with my doctor that Monday only made it to Saturday.</p></div>		</li>
