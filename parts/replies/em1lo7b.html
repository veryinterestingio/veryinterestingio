			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is of course doubt; Saturn is big and complicated, and we have very little idea as to the actual fluid dynamics happening within its cloud layers. BUT being able to produce a similar effect in the lab gives us, at the minimum, a plausible explanation. And that's really what gets an astronomer jazzed: finding a plausible explanation.</p></div>		</li>
