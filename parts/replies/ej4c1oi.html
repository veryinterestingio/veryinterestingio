			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes in theory, but one benefit of the random hopping stuff is that in practice, it's a soft cap.
As more and more phones talk to the tower, they're more likely to broadcast at the same time and frequency, causing mixed garbled signals once in a while.  They just retransmit the lost data, but as congestion grows, that happens more often and so everyone's connection gradually gets worse.</p>
<p>The idea is that it's better to let 1000 people have terrible cell service than to give 10 people perfect cell service and the other 990 get nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are limits.</p>
<p>For example classic GSM uses a combination of FDMA (Frequency Divison Multiple Access) - the available bandwidth is split into 200kHz subcarriers - and TDMA (Time Divison Multiple Access) - a subcarrier is divided into 8 time slots (ELI5: a building (available bandwidth) with diffrent rooms (subcarriers) with 8 desks each (time slots)). GSM900 has 124 subcarriers and thus supports at max 992 simultanous calls per cell. Usually each tower only uses a subset of those 124 subcarriers to not interfere with neighboring cells (diffrent companies (cells) can't rent the same rooms). </p>
<p>You can double the number of calls by cutting the data rate in half, but the audio qualtity wil be much worse (make 2 people use the same desk).</p>
<p>To get assigned to a desk you have to go to the manager and ask if one is free. As the managers office hours are quite short, it is very likely that 2 or more people ask for a desk at the same time, which the manager can't handle and you will have to try it again next time (this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet#Slotted_ALOHA" target="_blank">Slotted ALOHA</a> a random acces protocol). Especially  during events/days like New Years Eve the manager will be bombarded by requests  for a desks.</p>
<p>If you make a call, the network guarantees you a certain amount of capacity, even if you're just sitting at your desk in silence. Therfore modern systems (GPRS,UMTS, LTE), which carry mostly (internet) data, use more flexible desk assignments. Instead of asking just for a desk, you will ask for a desk for x minutes. This way more people can use a desk. Modern systems also have other building layouts, but here the desk example meets its limits.</p></div>		</li>
