			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Don't forget that the ISS is in the earth's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere" target="_blank">magnetosphere</a> and mostly shielded from cosmic radiation and solar ejecta - and <em>still has an array of higher cancer chances from the exposure.</em></p>
<p>A space station at a Langrange point or around a planet like Mars with no magnetosphere is gonna need some kind of miracle solution (the current guess seems to be water, but launching that much water into space is completely ignoring the tyranny of the rocket equation.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still no ice sheets or polar caps, though. While lunar ice is indeed confirmed, it is confined solely to the regolith in the current academic knowledge, and that material is abrasive, overheating, and far too high volume to be mined for easy water access.</p>
<p>The space community is full of &quot;could contain water-ice&quot;; &quot;spectra indicates near-pure hydroxyl groups&quot; etc. but no smoking gun, nor any funds to launch a pure fact-finding mission have materialised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would harvesting comets be easier/more cost effective? I know we've just scratched the surface of rendezvousing with a solar object, but in theory the process could be fairy light on fuel if we only have it nudge enough to bring it into a closer approach and do small trajectory changes over many orbits (which yeah that's likely decades, but I imagine our abilities to better maneuver and capture these objects will grow at least linearly if not exponentially over time). It may not be the 100% solution, but it could help to get 10-25% of the water needed for a permanent station.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd think launching that amount of water into space would still be much more economical (at this point in time, with current needs) than launching all the materials needed to set up a moon mining operation, let alone assembling it and getting it running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Total noob question, but isn't one of the Lagrange points shielded from The Sun by The Earth, i.e. behind us, so to speak? Wouldn't it get much less solar radiation then?</del></p>
<p>Nevermind, just checked and I guess the amount of shielding would be roughly negligible due to how much smaller the Earth is than the Sun and how far away the Lagrange point is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're on the right track - this is going outside my area of knowledge, but IIRC the magnetotail of the Earth magnetosphere extends for ~6m KM, which would put specifically L2 (and the James Webb Telescope) comfortably within it.</p>
<p>However, the magnetotail is similar to the exosphere in definition, but far weaker. I doubt it would provide enough protection to justify the placement (permanent occultation and thus lower solar insolation were likely the primary choices for L2 placement, as well as allowing it to orient itself with it's &quot;back to the sun&quot;.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth's magnetic field traps a lot of the solar radiation, at least the part made out of particles in two bands 600-3000 miles and  8000-30000 miles above the Earth.  There's a reason the ISS is not in a higher orbit. Getting any higher would start putting it into the higher radation zone.  The Lagrange Points are about 1 million miles out. They're far outside the protection of the earth's magnetic field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of research that has been done on using an electromagnetic shield, basically an artificial replacement '<em>geo</em>' magnetic field, for the spacecraft. </p>
<p>There's even a patent filed on it:
<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110049303" target="_blank">https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110049303</a></p>
<p>There was also a BBC tv mini-series about future space travel called 'Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets' from 2004 where they used an electromagnetic shield to protect the crew from most solar radiation, it even had it's own aurora. I recommend watching it, it's still good today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we lack the ability.  The electricity requirements are prohibitive.  Even with a large nuclear reactor at the center of the station (which functions in zero gravity - not technology we have currently) we probably would not be able to generate enough electricity to create a field large enough for a station with a diameter sufficiently large enough to simulate gravity comfortably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to chime in on the &quot;zero gravity nuclear reactor&quot; part: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/kilopower/" target="_blank">NASA's Kilopower program</a> is looking good and is designed as a multi-mission kilowatt-scale power plant. Those missions include zero G and vacuum, as well as Mars/Moon surface.</p>
<p>Unfortunately fancy deflector shields are a multi-<em>megawatt</em> problem, so the best we have is still off by three orders of magnitude or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water. Water is good radiation shielding and can be stored in a shell around the station to be used for drinking and whatever else and can be replenished through our waste. The real hurdle is the size of a station that has artificial gravity. The minimal size for a ring large enough to be spun at a safe speed and simulate gravity is HUGE. It’s a construction/money hurdle not a radiation one, we have NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN THE MIDDLE OF CITIES. Radiation shielding is easy old tech bro cmon now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Radiation, contrary to decades of misleading smear campaign, is not inherently toxic the way arsenic is. It's harmful because of the energy it has, which can damage the intricate molecular machineries in our cells. Once the high energy radiation has been absorbed by water molecules, it is completely nullified. The shielding acts like foam mat that absorbs and disperses the energy of the impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the radiation. Water that is hit by beta or gamma radiation will just be ionized and/or gain some kinetic energy, it will shed its kinetic energy as heat by colliding with other molecules and its charge will eventually neutralize (releasing a photon with a lower energy).</p>
<p>Water hit by alpha or neutron radiation, however, can be dangerous. If any of the atoms absorb the neutron or the alpha particle, it would turn into a radioactive isotope which would go on to decay after consumption. Alpha radiation is generally considered safe-ish because it can be stopped by a sheet of paper, but ingesting alpha emitters will absolutely kill you dead. (210-polonium decays with alpha radiation, and look at what it did with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko" target="_blank">Alexander Litvinenko</a>.)</p>
<p>Fortunately, radioactive isotopes of oxygen have a short half life (2 minutes for 15-O, and it's the most stable radioactive oxygen isotope). Also, alpha and neutron radiation are effectively stopped by sheets of metal so atoms of water in the shielding becoming radioactive is not a huge issue. Just keep it in a separate tank for a few minutes before using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Now I’m no SUPER expert, this is my field in college, but when you think of bad harmful radiation contamination on earth it’s radioactive material, material that’s releasing harmful particles out into our bodies and if that material gets into water it can be ingested and release lots of harmful particles into your body. But in space you just have to deal with the particles, not the material. The water absorbs the energy of the radiation particles, there might be extra particles in the water maybe? but they’re harmless without their energy, and the water stays water because the particles don’t have enough energy to break the water apart into something else cause that would be nuclear fission and that just doesn’t happen. So yes it’s safe </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually don't need a ring at all. Just pod/capsule, a counter weight, and a tether connecting them. Spin gravity works just as well without the ring and you can spin at longer distances easier by using a long tether to avoid the disorientation effects or low gravity of small rings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re totally right, another guy had a great comment on here about that too, saying a small group could get launched into orbit and then use the empty rocket fuel pod as a counter weight for artificial gravity on their station, but for whatever reason I was speaking as if there was a larger group of people and it required a larger ship, but you’re right </p></div>		</li>
