			<div class="markdown"><p>Cashback is huge for me.   I've purchased new appliances over the years using only cashback rewards on my cards.</p>
<p>One thing to consider though,  is this only makes sense if you're not carrying a balance and paying interest on the cards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah great point about paying it off regularly, should have mentioned that -_-</p>
<p>And I love cashback/points. Bought new appliances from a store, opened a card with them to cover it, had enough points for a lawnmower (that I needed, too, since we just bought a house and yard to maintain now).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cash back is sure fun, but it comes out of merchant fees -- you would get <em>more</em> cash back if merchants were allowed to charge lower prices on lower fee networks. That's not theoretical, that's how it works in Europe.</p>
<p>But yeah, paying invisible 4% transaction fees to get highly visible 2% cash back is psychologically satisfying in a way that paying 0.5% transaction fees with 0% cash back isn't, even though the net effect is to transfer money from you to the CC company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had the citi double cash card for a few years and really like it. no annual fees, 2% cash back on every purchase. I'm sure the interest rate is garbage, but I've never carried a balance, so I don't really pay attention. I just set up all my monthly bills to go to this card so I can get some free money.</p>
<p>I think if you put more than like $11k/year on the card then other cards with 2.5% cash back, but have an annual fee, become the better deal.</p>
<p>I'm no expert, I did a minimal amount of research and found plenty of people recommending this credit card and signed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the Chase Amazon Visa. it's 5% back on all prime purchases 2% on gas/groceries I think, and 1% on everything else. If you have prime, is a really good deal considering you can buy just about everything on Amazon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could get cards that have categories that have higher % back like the Chase Freedom or Discover IT.  Or you could move between cards every few months to milk sign up bonuses.</p>
<p>It gets kind of high effort if you really want to get deep into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you are only getting 1% and spending about $2000 every few months, that sounds about right. Get a card with a better percentage, or spend more money :)</p>
<p>For example, I have 6% on groceries so if I spend $2000 I would get $120 back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Debit cards are legally allowed to have lower protections but when I tell people this they call me crazy and tell me how fraud on their debit card is treated just as well as fraud on their credit card. I think a lot of banks have decided to protect debit card users on their own to encourage customer loyalty.</p></div>		</li>
