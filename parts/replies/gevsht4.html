			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's close enough for a 5-year old. &quot;Super computer&quot; does not have a strict definition and it has evolved over time. Historically, &quot;super&quot; computers were generally really beefy individual computers. Today, almost anything called a &quot;super computer&quot; has a cluster architecture, but of course not every &quot;computing cluster&quot; is a &quot;super computer&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, its wrong. Well, the definition, like the definition of artificial intelligence, is highly debated. All I know is that supercomputer doesn't need to be a cluster. When Nvidia released the Jetson TX1 package, they brand it as a supercomputer just because it has 1 teraflops of compute. In fact, a high end Nvidia GPU technically classify as a supercomputer (back in 2015 at least).</p></div>		</li>
