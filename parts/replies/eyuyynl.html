<p>Um... how? The only thing i can think of is that it oozes a bit of plastic and creates very small mess. The hotend does not get hotter when you turn it off and if it can take the heat... then nothing will be ruined, except the small puddle of plastic which has the remaining plastic contents of the nozzle and whatever comes out as the extra pressure of the filament balances out (if it is a bowden setup, direct extruder won't push that much stuff out after shutdown). To make this really clear: there is a restore function that will continue printing after power failure.. That would be quite awful feature if there was any change that the hotend is ruined between we get the power back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A hotend takes cold filament on one end, and outputs molten plastic on the other. There's usually a fan cooling part of it, so that the transition zone is as small as possible. You want a very abrupt change from solid to molten. This is accomplished by cooling the upper half, heating the lower one, and having as thin of a connection between both as possible (the heat break)</p>
<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dH7Teid0fem04P1gNfjIBiAge3stOVloqVv6UvB3BW8bVhIm5mPlRsvCsKgw1_1Gr3MoWFeQ59z_wGD5LtlhyEr32A=w900" target="_blank">See this graph</a></p>
<p>So, if you pull the power, the upper half is now cooled less effectively because the fan isn't working anymore, while the lower half is still hot. This can cause the filament to melt in the upper part. And then it can get stuck there.</p>
<p>It's generally not a fatal problem, but it's annoying to have to disassemble it.</p></div>		</li>
