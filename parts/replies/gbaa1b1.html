			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Learned about it in microbiology in college. It’s one of the biggest gimmicks and people fall for it. The only thing antibacterial soap does is lead to antibiotic resistant down the road. You can do tests if you get yourself some agar plates. Put your non washed hands on one plate as a control and use 2 other plates as a normal soap and antibacterial soap test and you’ll see they do the same thing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting. What if you are using soap to wash wounds (fresh piercings, stitch sites, etc)? Is there an argument for antibacterial soap vs regular in that case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I practice family medicine in Nashville. Antibacterial soap in a wound wouldnt make a significant difference over irrigating with normal saline or mild soap and water. Standard practice for most minor low-risk wounds is irrigating with saline. Some people might use some diluted iodine or antiseptic scrub but honestly this is thought to delay wound healing anyway.  And it would just be more effective to throw some Neosporin or take antibiotics if there was risk of infection.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of them just have a bacteria-killing chemical like benzalkonium chloride. It’s not an antibiotic like bacitracin and won’t lead to antibiotic resistance. It’s still not recommended for most circumstances because it disrupts the normal flora on the skin, and normal flora help out-compete pathogens. It’s the sort of thing that should only be used when specifically doctor-recommended for things like caring for someone who is immunocompromised where your own normal flora is a risk to them.</p></div>		</li>
