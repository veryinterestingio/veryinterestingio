			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be hard, but theoretically yes.</p>
<p>For a visual demonstration of the bubbles=white effect, there's a guy on YouTube named &quot;LoftyPursuits,&quot; who makes candy. The way they make white hard candy is they start with clear candy and fold it over and over again to introduce air bubbles which turn it white (video here: <a href="https://youtu.be/BL84pd0D-LA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/BL84pd0D-LA</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily..... Lasers exist. This is the very principle of laser cutting. It doesn't put any mechanical strain in the material, thus this doesn't happen. It may need some polishing in the edge, but won't change colour</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also have to do with fiber alignment. When polymers deform plastically, the chains that they are composed of align, altering the optical properties. It is similar in concept to the fact that amorphous polymers tend to be transparent, while crystalline ones are usually opaque.  As for the loss of color, the stretching of the polymer results in an increased volume, locally diluting the pigments or dyes used to give the plastic its color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the right answer, as plastic bends it changes the polarity of the light that is allowed through. get some polar lenses (3d movie glasses) and bend spme plastic and see how the amount of light changes on the creases</p></div>		</li>
