			<div class="markdown"><p>Old fart here. In the early 1950's Miami had one channel, #4, and network programming was on film, delivered by airmail. I can still remember the singsong teaser they broadcast, &quot;The cable is a-comin' on Ju-ly the first!&quot; but I can't pin down the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broadcast TV channels are similar to broadcast radio frequencies. You want to run a TV station, you apply to the FCC for a channel assignment, and they give you one that isn't used by any other nearby station that could cause interference.</p>
<p>US TV broadcasting began in the VHF band, with channels from 1 to 13 established, but channel 1 was taken away in 1948 and given to another service.</p>
<p>In the 50's the FCC tried to expand the number of channels available by assigning frequencies in the UHF band, which required an add-on converter. The converters didn't work terribly well, and UHF broadcasting didn't get very big.</p>
<p>To put a more specific answer on your question, &quot;You're assigned channel 4&quot; means &quot;You're authorized to radiate a television signal that occupies frequencies from 66 to 72 MHz&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Florida, y'know.</p>
<p>At Christmastime, the two biggest, most garish, kilowatt-expending home decorations were across a street from each other and everybody would drive by to see them. The owners were a Chevy dealer and a Miami mayor: Anthony Abraham and Abe Aronovitz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My memories are from the early 60s. 24 hour programming wasn't a thing yet. At about 1:00 AM after the last show there would be a test pattern, lots of symbols arranged symmetrically with a profile pic of an Indian chief in the center. Not sure, but I think this lasted only a short while before the static.</p></div>		</li>
