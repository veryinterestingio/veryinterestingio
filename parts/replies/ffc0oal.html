			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll see if I can dig up the source. It was mentioned in a documentary I saw a few years ago, so I don't know if I'll be successful finding it again. I do recall that one researcher used a cave as the location they isolated people in.</p>
<p>The v sauce video is an interesting one because he didn't control the lights though. It was just always bright white, wasn't it? Or am I remembering that wrong? And the whole point is that light plays a huge role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several years ago, I read an article about a 60 days experiment where some guy was isolated in a cave completely stripped of sunlight.</p>
<p>The person only extended their day by barely an hour IRCC, your 30-40h thing really seems exagerated.</p>
<p>The only relevant discovery was that their &quot;day&quot; was regularly shifted to a bit later, to a point where he made 1 or 2 complete 24h cycle over the course of the experiment.</p>
<p>Showing how tightly connected we are to the Sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Found an article in the Atlantic that references a couple studies:  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/the-caves-of-forgotten-time/414894/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/the-caves-of-forgotten-time/414894/" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/the-caves-of-forgotten-time/414894/</a></a></p>
<p>Not  sure if it's the same experiment I heard about before, but they  specifically mention the participants had slipped into 30-48 hour  cycles.</p></div>		</li>
