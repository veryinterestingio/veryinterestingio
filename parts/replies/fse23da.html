			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly not supported by the data. Kuru is definitely a prion disease and not caused by toxicity. The kuru strain has been isolated and characterized, see for example <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2581656/" target="_blank">Wadsworth, 2008</a> and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/106/32/13529" target="_blank">Manuelidis, 2009</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured, this would have been 2001, I remember looking into it a little because I was researching how a specific superoxide dismutase could alter its function by replacing copper with manganese. I recall there was some research at the time looking into prion folding in response to certain types of oxidative stress related to SOD mutations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two different things at play here. I'm not aware of any evidence that SOD affects the misfolding of PrP. However, SOD <em>itself</em> can misfold and propagate in a prion-like fashion. Such SOD aggregates appear to play a role in certain forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
