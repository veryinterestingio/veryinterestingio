			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it then that blue jeans today fade so quickly compared to other clothing? Levi's, for example, fade visibly with each wash, whereas I can wash a t-shirt a hundred times before it starts to become obviously faded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indigo doesn't penetrate the fibres. It sticks to it.</p>
<p>Shitty jeans will shed this quickly through wear and washing.</p>
<p>Good denim will remain surprisingly dark for many washings, largely only fading along wear patterns where friction literally <em>scrapes</em> the indigo off the fabric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that the dye used to make blue jeans does not absorb into the fabric's fibers. Instead, it clings to the outside of those fibers. This gives every pair of blue jeans a bit of a unique look that intensifies with wear and wash.</p>
<p>Edit: If anyone is interested in blue jeans, their history, and their future, etc. their is an episode of Jeff Goldblum's new show streaming on Disney Plus that is about denim. It's worth a stream just for Jeff Goldblum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. However, whilst that unique look is cool, I also want jeans that I can wash every few wears without it fading, even if that means I lose the unique look. Do jeans exist that don't fade?</p></div>		</li>
