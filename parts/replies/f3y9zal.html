			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally. The idea behind diets like intermittent fasting, OMAD, and keto is to constantly burn fat to restore your blood sugar levels. A standard high carb 3+ meals a day diet, as has been advised from the 70s even though it was all marketing, will cause your body to wait for new food instead of immediately burning fat. </p>
<p>You can think of it as those diets I mentioned burn fat for energy and turn your food into fat rather than causing a blood sugar spike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically depends on what you mean by optimal performance.  Ultra marathon runners have found significant advantages by switching to keto diets.  Basically you never hit the wall of runing out of glycogen and you dont need to consume sugar while competing.  Your body is burning fat from the get go and is adapted to burning it at rates which can sustain marathon running.  Even at something really low like 5% bf, youd have tens of thousands of fat calories at your disposal.  On the other hand, something like sprinting, HIIT, or weight lifting in the 10-15 rep range might require carbs for optimal performance.  Very low reps or a very quick event would all be creatine mediated.  Mid range would be carbs.  Long endurance will always do better fat adapted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever man, what you said sounds a lot more like what gym bros say than what I said. Calling the contrary bro-science makes no sense. </p>
<p>Your body needs sugar to function. It doesn't have to come from a particular source.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, it's a highly popular fad diet.  </p>
<p>Many people <em>do</em> see benefits because they're thinking about their food. Eating smaller portions of better food is far healthier than a double cheeseburger, large fries, and a 64-ounce sugar drink.</p>
<p>Very people who &quot;are eating keto&quot; have entered ketosis, most not even once.</p>
<p>That's actually a good thing, because actual ketosis should generally be supervised by dietitians or doctors who know about it. Liver and kidney problems are serious risks, can cause or worsen thyroid issues, and if keytone levels are too high you'll die.</p>
<p>While I normally ignore discussions on the topic, I'm chiming in here because enough of these are serious about the questions.</p>
<p>When people are eating a salad (with dressing!!) or eating fruit, then tell me they're on a keto diet I just roll my eyes and ignore them. A single apple or a single banana has enough sugar to disrupt ketosis, and it takes most people 4-6 days deprived of the sugars to get the body to switch gears and enter ketosis and start living off fats.  When I hear people talking about being in keto I regularly ask what their last keytone measurement was, and invariably they won't know.  I'll sometimes offer a test strip when someone seems serious about the topic, I've not yet met anyone who was high enough to be in ketosis.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting can be good for a range of diets.  People on the fad keto diets can be good for getting people to actually think about what they put in their mouths.   But actual ketosis? That's a rarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a deference between things that are hard, and things that are impossible. After Roger Bannister broke the 4 min mile, trainers, athletes, and scientists, started to look into the limits of the human body more seriously. Now almost 70 years later, we have a very good understanding of what is and isn't possible. Take for instance the 2 hour marathon, or these wired articles. <a href="https://www.wired.com/video/watch/why-it-s-almost-impossible-to-ride-a-bike-60-kilometers-in-one-hour" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.wired.com/video/watch/why-it-s-almost-impossible-to-ride-a-bike-60-kilometers-in-one-hour" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/video/watch/why-it-s-almost-impossible-to-ride-a-bike-60-kilometers-in-one-hour</a></a></p>
<p>How the body stores energy is critical to setting new records, and it used extensively by top athletes to do just that.</p></div>		</li>
