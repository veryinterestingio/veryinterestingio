			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the second guy (brakeman) is responsible for the train cars.
If the train is dropping cars off at a siding, he gets off the train and visually watches the rear of the train as they back up, then drops the cars and ties off the air brakes on them so they dont' roll off. In the US there are two people on a train, the brakeman and the engineer. That is required by law right now. in Canada they can have only one person responsible for a train.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Canada what you refer a brakeman is called a Conductor. A brakeman here is when a third person comes on the train or in the yard to help if there is a lot of work to be done (set offs or pick ups etc). Also there is never one man crews in Canada now, it’s always at least a two person crew (engineer and conductor).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In San Francisco, we have Muni (which has an affinity for running people over) and Bart. </p>
<p>Fucking Bart conductors love to stab at the brakes for no reason, sending everyone flying forward, followed by wide-open throttling, sending everyone rolling backwards. </p>
<p>You’ll be cruising along heading into MacArthur station at 60mph when suddenly the conductor panic brakes, slows to a crawl, and then pulses the brakes or throttle for a good minute so you’re never quite sure when you’ll get thrown off-balance. </p>
<p>Then he’ll fucking send it at 70mph, miss the station platform, and awkwardly roll backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Boston, every commuter train has an operator plus one conductor for every other car, or One for every double-decker car.  Then again the T keeps blaming delays on ancient analog switches ...</p>
<p>But what do automated trains do for an obstruction, like a car, downed tree, person on the tracks?  Are you just stuck until someone comes to clear it, every day?  Or is this automation mainly for tunnels or raised tracks where you have more control over the right of way?</p></div>		</li>
