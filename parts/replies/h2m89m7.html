			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The worst part is this the physical task part too. I feel like this is the best possible explanation really for that aspect of everyday household chores. </p>
<p>But for a moment consider this other readers: </p>
<p>You are in a meeting you are leading, and in the middle of listening to someone's question to you, they go off on a tangent about a different project, then return to finish their question but they don't restate it. I'm still lost in thinking about something that tangent reminded me of from last week's emails. &quot;I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?&quot; Cue the room silence and either the person kindly shortening their question or worse &quot;Nevermind, I think I answered it myself. &quot;</p>
<p>In a math class a teacher verbally asks you to do a problem by TELLING you the problem. You ask them to write it down because you are having a hard time following, the teacher looks irritated you can't just hear them say, &quot; 15-x=9&quot; and tell them what x is. </p>
<p>Imagine working in a customer facing role and someone spells a word aloud before you have paper and pen. you try to write down what they said 4 letters ago, but you know they didn't actually say &quot;IREZ&quot; was the whole name, you ask them to repeat it, and then you realize it was just Ramirez and they didn't need to spell it but you were caught so off guard you thought it was more difficult than that, and now you feel like an idiot with them blinking at you. </p>
<p>This is the internal mental struggle-
It's so hard to be constantly pulled away from the thing you are trying to do with all your might by some other thought screaming at you to pay attention to it. It's like being the bride at a wedding where everyone wants to talk to you RIGHT NOW, and not wait for you to come to them. </p>
<p>This is why I think a lot of us end up in shame spirals- we are always trying to do the thing we should be doing, it's pulling on us, but there is always something else gnawing at us too and we just can't do the &quot;right thing&quot; even knowing it is objectively what we should do. The people around us ask, &quot;why didn't you just pay the car registration when the slip came in the mail?&quot; Then we beat ourselves up because we knew we should do what the other person said, but we didn't. That must mean we are lazy, incapable, unthoughtful, selfish, (insert mean adjective) person. And so everytime we fail at something like this it just compounds it more and more. </p>
<p>I don't hate the above phrasing, but another way to put it is that I constantly know what the best use of my time/energy would be if I could make myself just do it- but instead the pull of the 1000 other things I could do is stronger. The amount of sheer will power it takes to do simple tasks can be indescribably immense. </p>
<p>Like in chemistry: the activation energy for a reaction is the amount of energy needed to make a certain chemical change happen.  So having ADHD is like having the activation energy for all the right things increased while all the dopamine producing low effort tasks require less energy to do. </p>
<p>In my world, taking medication is like normalizing the activation energy. Instead of sitting on the couch next to the laundry that needs to be folded scrolling reddit on my phone thinking &quot;I should fold my laundry&quot; but being unable to &quot;just do it&quot; (thanks Shia Labeouf), with meds I just think, &quot;I should fold the laundry&quot; and I do, and it doesn't feel like the mental equivalent of climbing a sand dune. </p>
<p>It is late, this is probably incomprehensible, but I shall revisit it in the morning. :) TBC
Edit: haha I actually did it! ;) Clarifying my points with some additional thoughts. </p>
<p>Additional thought: the flip side of this is when we do get a hyperfocus day on something and knock everything out of the park in an abnormally short time- it can turn into unrealistic expectations from others or from ourselves. Sure, I was able to clean and rearrange 3 whole rooms in one Saturday that one time, but now even emptying the dishwasher can be a struggle. Our life partners can get confused. How can we be both things simultaneously? I can't tell you the number of times I have just thought to myself, &quot;okay so tomorrow is going to be a kickass productive day .&quot; I go to bed and formulate the entire plan of how I will pull it off. The next morning I start on it but then anything I didn't plan for happens and the whole plan is no longer possible inside my head. Then I do nothing instead while beating myself up for not following through on something I promised myself -again. </p>
<p>I hope this helps other people recognize these thought patterns in themselves or the people in their lives. Being aware that the struggle is real and not due to some personal failure of yours is very helpful, but then you have to do all the healing and reprogramming of coming at yourself with compassion and not contempt. It's so so so exhausting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>biggest advice for people with adhd, especially in software engineering/devops/whatever, is to make sure you have a queue of tasks of varying sizes. second biggest is write things down, pick something from the list, do that, and don't needlessly juggle work/obligation tasks in your head. I have a hard time complying with that second one, because I tend to just keep everything in my head, but whenever I feel like I'm getting nothing done I force myself to write the list. I usually don't do 80% of the things on the list because they're low priority garbage, but just writing it to paper &amp; evicting it from my head combined with being able to &quot;see&quot; the tasks helps immensely. Then instead of I need to x,y,z,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h it's &quot;I need to check the list&quot; which is a micro task.</p>
<p>I've found doing a few quick tickets/stories that I am comfortable with gets me switched into work mode and I can then make progress on the longer term projects. It might take until the early afternoon to get rolling, but once I do I'm there to work sometimes for the next two days even.</p>
<p>If I just have longterm projects I get insanely stressed, get nothing done -- not even housework or fun stuff sometimes if I try to force doing the project (imo don't force, do something else for 5-20 minutes then try to do it, or for some reason sitting in front of my tv helps sometimes too), and end up doing them last minute. It also helps to switch to a smaller/other task when you start wandering from the main task. Then you wander back to the main task.</p>
<p>I'm also really productive when something is an emergency or other people are relying on it being done.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is counter-intuitive to managers who just want the one thing done, but the reality is I'll either get only the main thing done in that amount time with insane amounts of stress. Or, in the same or shorter time period, I'll get 10 things done -- including the main thing -- with no stress on my end. Communicating this to managers can be difficult, and with poor management you'll definitely have to argue about stuff and defend yourself constantly until they notice &quot;oh yeah that guy is doing 2x-3x the work of everyone else&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

You just put it in a convenient spot and tell yourself you will remember where you put it.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was diagnosed with (and why it took me so long to be diagnosed).</p>
<p>I’m either completely and utterly absorbed in something, hyper focused for days or weeks which ends up not even mattering in the long run, or I’m just lost and frustrated with where my time is being spent.</p>
<p>I’ve been diagnosed and prescribed. It’s definitely helped, but I still need to be aware of time management and actively not allow myself to go down rabbit holes. It’s cost me a lot of opportunities and relationships unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

The way I've explained it is: When I'm really interested it's like I'm on a bike going down a steep hill with malfunctioning brakes, it's extremely hard to stop. When I'm not too interested it's like I'm wading through a foggy swamp, it's extremely tiring and there is no end in sight.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow thanks. This reply really makes it clear that I most likely have ADHD (and probably OCD. The way you describe it really resonated. I have always been obsessive about things in my life to the point of complete takeover of mind state. I have done DIY more or less non stop over the last 11 years and when I finish something, I can't relax. I don't really know how to relax, I need stimulation. So I do more DIY. For the last year, I've been making electronic music too which has been brilliant for me to obsess over (my bike going down a steep hill) but when it comes to some things (mostly work) that's my foggy swamp. I hope you have got a handle on your conditions and can enjoy life. ✌️</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 36 male in the south of the UK. And in tears reading all these comments... </p>
<p>I KNOW this is what i have (inattentive ADHD). Only recently have I started researching and felt a wave of euphoria as everything I read made complete sense. 15+ years ago, the &quot;naughty kids&quot; were the ones with ADHD, causing problems, distracting other student, getting all the attention. No one cared about a medium-high achiever who never finished work in time and &quot;could do better but needs to stop getting distracted and talking to others in classes&quot;.</p>
<p>I've been to my GP and explained how I feel, that It affects my work in that I'm in a well paid IT job, but struggle to finish projects and tasks, suffer with imposter syndrome, which makes me appear as an over paid lazy fuck to takes too long to do anything. It's killing me... I have good friends and colleagues and just watch they do and ask myself &quot;why can I not do that&quot;. </p>
<p>But there are no services here. My doctor has told there are no adult diagnosis services for me to go to, &quot;It's just your personality&quot;</p>
<p>My only option is to pay for a private diagnosis. And then nothing will likely come of it other than &quot;well now I have a piece of paper saying so&quot;</p>
<p>I found a quote online... That summed up my feelings, but also my fears that it'll get worse.</p>
<p>&quot;
In adults, hyperactivity is often more internalised – resulting in a strong sense of dissatisfaction and restlessness. Again, this can add to feelings of worthlessness, unhappiness and low mood – which if not understand, can result in depression developing
&quot;</p>
<p>I'm assuming many here had loads of different hobbies as a kid,  went 110% on it, wasted money on it, and then moved on to the next thing... Only to grow up and stop getting excited about new things, knowing full well in 2 months time the fad will have passed?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not true. There are services, but they're private. Places like The Priory have adult-adhd services. You can get diagnosed through them and then take the info to your GP. </p>
<p>Man, I should have read to the end of your comment instead of jumping in. I've always wondered if I have adhd too. I WAS one of the naughty and distracting kids in class and my record of achievement has my old reports in it and most teachers said, &quot;disorganised, lacks ability to plan, immature&quot;. And clearly I'm impulsive because I've done it twice writing just this comment.</p>
<p>I actually had some tests done for a neurological issue that I actually have (in remission) and they found &quot;weakness in executive memory&quot;, which literally is a textbook symptom of ADHD. You'd think they would have mentioned that it could be a possibility, but they said it was anxiety. I don't feel anxious!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude are you me?</p>
<p>I really struggled to get anyone to take me seriously so I just paid to have the assessment done privately.</p>
<p>Once you get a diagnosis, you may be able to arrange a shared care agreement with your NHS surgery where the private doctor will be responsible for monitoring you and dosage, but the NHS will do the prescribing.</p>
<p>Yes it’s cost me a fair chunk of cash, but things are actually moving now and the treatment is working.</p>
<p>Please bite the bullet and do it. If you’re like me then you’ll really benefit from it too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK you can self refer for counselling on the NHS. Describe all the negative emotions etc and you should get through. When you get a counsellor explains you think you have ADHD as well and ask for some relevent counselling / CBT. When you get through to the right specialised professional you should find help/support.</p></div>		</li>
