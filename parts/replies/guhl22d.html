			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your age. The older you get, the less sensitive your body becomes to volume changes so your brain sends the thirst signal much later than it should. That's why you see old people with coagulated saliva, dry mouth, muscle cramps and no thirst at all. I'd say you should try to get ahead of thirst by the time you're 50 just to build a habit but it's difficult to pin point an exact cutoff point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for me it isn't. I can't think of a time where I had dry mouth and didn't also feel thirsty, but I can think of <em>loads</em> of times I felt thirsty without any hint of dry mouth. Totally different sensations.</p>
<p>I've never had to think about &quot;where&quot; I've felt thirsty, and I would say it originates from like... under my tongue, in my salivary glands maybe? But it feels more like a mental compulsion, like a tickle or scratch that only cold water can itch, whereas dry mouth is much more blatantly <em>physical</em> and happens in various places in my the mouth and throat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? That's so interesting! </p>
<p>For me thirst is just a desire, a craving, for nice cold water. Just like a strong craving, like you get sometimes for... cookies or pickles or something. I don't feel any physical difference in my mouth. It's all mental for me.</p></div>		</li>

One night my poor bladder couldn't take it and let loose while I was sleeping, on the top rack I might add. This is the story of the only time in my life I pissed the bed.</p></div>		</li>
