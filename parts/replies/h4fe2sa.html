			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is that there are differences between fine sand and coarse sand. Desert sand particles are very fine due to erosion by wind and they don’t work very well for building and reclamation. Seabed sand are more coarse and preferred. That’s why for the construction of the palm islands in Dubai required purchasing sand from abroad despite the UAE is a desert full of sand.   </p>
<p>Not an expert though so cannot provide further details, this is something I had heard from a documentary some time ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think /u/iamalwaysrelevant is asking why we can't take sand from beaches, then replace it with sand from the desert, so that in the end, we still have a beach. </p>
<p>My best guess is that it is simply too expensive. Unless companies are required to repair the ecosystem, they simply take the sand they mine and go, leaving whatever is left to figure itself out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We aren't really running out of sand, we're just running out of sand in the places from which it was traditionally gotten, meaning its more of an economic problem than not actually having it.</p>
<p>Concrete is incredibly bad for the environment anyway, its a huge net producer of CO2, so I wouldn't be surprised if we are pushing for alternative building materials in any case.</p></div>		</li>
