<p>I read somewhere that even thinking about doing things produces endorphins. Hence, you think about it, and your brain feels happy. </p>

<p>Yeah, and then you no longer need to do the thing. You already got the reward, and that's just boring work.</p>
<p>In my 20s, I spent tons of time merely fantasizing about great success I would have. When I occasionally tried to start taking actual steps toward those goals, I quickly became frustrated, and abandoned my course of action, instead opting for something more instantly gratifying, like video games.</p>
<p>I still have those issues, but have improved on them to some extent. Mindfulness helps, chunking (setting small steps as their own goals), and sometimes just kicking my own ass into gear even though my impulses are going against it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree to an extent. I make 3d art. When a client is clear with what they want, it's easier to get the task done.</p>
<p>Having said that, I self motivate for personal work.</p>
<p>There is an awful in between where a client gives a vague description of what they want, and I get an art block. Usually when it's something I'm not super interested in making.</p>
<p>The less interested I am in making an asset, the more a task sheet (or asset list) comes in handy.</p></div>		</li>
