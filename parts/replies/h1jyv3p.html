			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that's necessarily the case. There's some <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/review-1918-pandemic-flu-studies-offers-more-questions-answers" target="_blank">evidence</a> to suggest that the greatest toll of the 1918 flu pandemic was on healthy adults between 20-40, possibly because their relatively high immunocompetence caused a more severe cytokine storm that led to higher rates of mortality. It's concievable that better nutrition and baseline health could exacerbate disease pathology in cases where that pathology originates from a host overreaction, rather than simply the pathogen itself. This might be the case with the 1918 flu.</p>
<p>Also intriguing is the &quot;artificial evolution hypothesis&quot; for 1918 flu, which argues that trench warfare during WW1 provided evolutionary incentives for more pathogenic variants of the flu to emerge, as soldiers with mild disease were more likely to die in the trenches, and those with more severe variants were more likely to be moved back to field hospitals, where onward transmission was more likely. The constant influx of immunologically naive individuals from all the Western world may have provided conditions for this type of peculiar transmission cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that there was a strain of that flu that circulated a generation ago, and people who caught it back then had partial immunity.  </p>
<p>They know the type of that virus, which was a swine flu.  It was H1N1.  CDC says they usually put in protection for H1N1, H3N2, and two Influenza B viruses.  2009 epidemic was H1N1 as well.  1957 and 1968 (Asian and Hong Kong) were H2N2 and H3N2.  2009 was pretty bad, but we know more now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that not all H1N1 viruses are alike. From animal experimemts we know that the 1918 H1N1 is much more virulent and pathogenic than 2009 H1N1 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3029258/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have read, most people that died from the 1918 flu actually died of bacterial pneumonia as a complication after getting the flu. Given that, if you are going back to 1918 you probably don't need to fear getting the flu. Just take an antibiotic back with you to fight of any bacterial infection you might get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's not really reliable statistics on this. Although clearly some fraction of deaths were attributable to secondary infections, it's not clear that's sufficient to provide protection in most cases, especially given that the 1918 flu is suspected of being encephalitic and causing neurological symptoms, as well as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3029258/" target="_blank">replicating in the lower respiratory tract</a>. Bear in mind that modern flu variants still kill tens of thousands of people, despite widespread availability of antibiotics. While definitely a good recommendation for any time traveler, there's clearly a potentially lethal severe disease pathology associated 1918 primary infection, partly due to its unique properties compared to contemporary flu strains.</p></div>		</li>
