			<div class="markdown"><p>Likewise Floki &quot;The Raven&quot; found Iceland by this method. He caged ravens and took them with him on his journey. He would release them and the ravens would fly up high, if they saw land they would fly towards it, and Floki would follow the ravens. If the ravens came back to the boat you were <strong>far</strong> from any land. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're boats as well as their navigation techniques were actually relatively advanced for the time. Many polynesian peoples had entire classes of people just for navigation. And it's been proven to be possible, for more info on this proof look up Thor Heyerdhal. He was a Norwegian man who used the kinds of ships polynesians would have used to cross the Pacific.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TH is underrated. Some of his hypotheses which he stood by pretty stubbornly were unfounded, but hus experimental data were valuable contributions to our knowledge of the feasability of transoceanic travel by societies without sophisticated tools, i.e. people could essentially make boats with reeds, balsa, and palm, lashed together and propelled by rudimentary sails, and colonize vast, remote areas.</p></div>		</li>
