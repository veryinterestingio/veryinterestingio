			<div class="markdown"><p>Centripetal acceleration is v^2 /r.
v is the earths rotational speed at equator (about 460 m/s)
r is earths equatorial radius of ~ 6370km = 6370000 m.</p>
<p>460^2 /6370000 = 0.033 m/s^2
It would increase by about 0.3%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to stop the earth's rotation in order to experience this; just travel to one of the poles. At the poles your rotational velocity is 0 (although you are spinning on your own axis). There is a difference in weight at the ones and at the equator, but it isn't enough to really matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference due to the equatorial bulge alone is approximately 0.7%.  Rotation reduces the apparent gravitational pull at the Equator by a further 0.35% making the total effect &gt;1%.</p></div>		</li>
