<p>The ten seconds is the maximum time the blood takes to being the anesthetic to the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that only answers half the question. You know the brain is very susceptible to it, and that your body can transport it quickly, but you don't know what your brain is actually reacting. I could make really lipophilic Coke Zero and inject it into my bloodstream and it would be transported to the brain in the same manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed that people's brains wont &quot;record&quot; for a while after coming out of anesthesia.</p>
<p>How can we be sure it actually works, vs just paralyzing and erasing memory? That's quite frightening to imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good question, but don't worry, it's very unlikely. Anesthesia is a bit more complex than just &quot;knocking someone out.&quot; Anesthesiologists have looked at brain waves during anesthesia (in fact, there are now machines that monitor EEG during surgery just like they monitor vital signs like heart rate and oxygen levels). What they find is that the waves look similar to brains in a coma, not brains that are awake. They also usually give a cocktail of drugs including opiates which we know block pain even while people are awake. Also, if the patient were just paralyzed but still feeling pain, their heart rate and blood pressure would probably start to go haywire, and the dose of drugs would be adjusted until they came back down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was an early concern after curare and similar paralytics. I don't recall the exact tests that were done, but essentially this was checked for awhile ago. Probably via EEG or some other objective recording device.</p></div>		</li>
