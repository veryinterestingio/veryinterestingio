			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn’t believe that. How does it even happen? I’ve never hunted before but I’m pretty sure you don’t just see “something” that looks like a deer and start blasting randomly, and it was TWO people that were killed. How do you even mistake a 9 year old girl for a deer? Better yet, how the fuck do you mistake a human fucking being for a deer? Do deer walk on 2 feet now? I’m hoping to god that the idiots that shot them have their hunting licenses AND their firearms revoked indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>
