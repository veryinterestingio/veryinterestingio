<p>There's hundreds of thousands of miles of data cable on our ocean floors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've properly identified and described some 42.000 different species of mites. The expectation is that there's likely a million more we haven't. Not a hyperbolic million, an actual million.</p>
<p>Not because they're hard to find but because mites are literally everywhere and there's little advantage in paying people to sort the known ones from the unknown ones.</p>
<p>By and large, the majority of the plants and animals we've properly 'discovered' are the big ones that are hard to miss and the ones that are valuable in one way or another.</p>
<p>Discovering new animals isn't hard. Pick a place that hasn't been picked through with a fine toothed comb, start exploring and you'll likely have a whole bunch of new species by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Deep sea exploration usually finds new species during every trip. Put a piece of top soil under a microscope and there's a good chance you'll find something if you keep looking. It's mostly the easy stuff that's been categorised to there and back again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Discover is a tricky word. If you do the work and can ID, catalog and verify what you see is new then yeah you discovered something... this can take years per discovery. DNA ic speeding this up but still looking for a slight difference between one beatle and another is not trivial! Lots of 'discovery'  happen when researchers go back through catalogs of old samples and find that the original researcher did not know what they had by jut visual inspection.</p></div>		</li>
