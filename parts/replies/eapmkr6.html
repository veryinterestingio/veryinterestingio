			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not why oil makes things slippery. Oil is viscous enough to get between the two surfaces, so that both surfaces are contacting oil instead of each other. Since oil is a liquid, they just slide past each other instead of having friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah OP has half of it backwards. More contact area usually = less slip. The thing about rolling hills might make sense, as it lowers the surface area without catching the opposite surface.</p>
<p>Regardless, the summary of this thread is, &quot;We don't know for sure.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
