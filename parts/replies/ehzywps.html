			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to pull glass pipettes to use as capillary tubes for thin layer chromatography... We would have competitions to see who could pull one the farthest. </p>
<p>One of our older professors saw what we were doing and chuckled. He walked up and held one over the meker burner... rotating it slowly for about 45 seconds. Then he pulled it as fast and as far as he could, stretching it across his chest so his arms were behind him. It measured 2.5 meters even though he was roughly 2 meter tall. We were all lucky to get one 1 meter in length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a glass disposable pippette...  the kind where you can reuse a small rubber bulb, but you toss the glass pipette after use.</p>
<p>So you hold each end of the glass pipette and heat the middle of it over a meker burner until it is very soft. Then you rapidly pull perfectly straight outward with both hands. This draws the barrel of the pipette into a very narrow and thin walled tube. Then you can snap off small sections to use as a capillary tube. This allows you to put a very small 'dot' of the solution onto a TLC stationary phase...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Capillary tubes in TLC are for spotting the TLC plate so it doesn't overload. You only want a small amount of the substance you're analyzing on the plate so the dot you make actually travels and is easy to read when developed. Glass pipettes are usually too thick to use as spotters, so you would have to make them thinner by heating them up over a fire and pulling the glass like taffy. I always used toothpicks for spotting though because it was cheaper and easier, though the results may vary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a picture that compared needles up-close; unused, used once, used a couple times and used a bunch of times. Even after just one use the point was bent. Basically after a few uses the tip looked like a metal frayed knot, it would just tear the skin apart I guess, and then there's the infection risk too (or rather infection guarantee).</p>
<p>This is why they actually <em>hand out</em> needles to heroin addicts, might as well have them kill themselves and others a little more slowly. Want to help a heroin addict? Give them clean, unused  needles. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You give heroin addicts clean needles to use but also offer them drug counselling. It would really suck going to all this effort to help them kick their habit, only for them to die of the HIV they got from re-using old needles. They're going to do it anyway, lets help them do it safely while we help them stop.</p></div>		</li>
