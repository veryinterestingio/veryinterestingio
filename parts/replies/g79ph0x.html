<p>It is intrinsic because operations with higher priority represent repeated versions of operations with lower priority.</p>

<p>But someone could decide to do it the other way round, giving operations that represent repeated simpler operations a lower priority.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Try computing the kinetic energy of an object by multiplying mass and velocity first, before applying the exponent of 2. You won't get an accurate result.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well yes, but that's fine. We'd just write/have written the formula differently:</p>
<p>KE = Â½m(v^(2))</p>
<p>It's still a perfectly workable system, it's just not the one we have. That doesn't make the current one &quot;intrinsic&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related to the question, but on the same topic --</p>
<p>Algebra is a generalized arithmetic. Arithmetic consists of the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising numbers to powers (exponents), and taking roots (radicals). </p>
<p>The way these operations are defined in algebra, there are only three: addition, multiplication, and powers. Subtraction is defined as adding a negative number; division is defined as multiplying by a fraction (reciprocal), and radicals can be represented using fractional exponents. </p>
<p>So all powers and roots have the same priority and are handled in the same step, and since they represent repeated multiplication - which is commutative - can be resolved in any order.</p>
<p>Likewise, all multiplications and divisions have the same priority and can be done in any order.</p>
<p>Same relationship with sums and differences. Division <em>is</em> multiplication, so is commutative; subtraction <em>is</em> addition, and is also commutative.</p>
<p>Tactically, if there is no intrinsic preference for order during each of these (3) priority steps, then choose whatever order you think is easiest. If ease is not a concern, then pick an order arbitrarily like <em>from left to right</em> or alphabetical order or <em>biggest to smallest,</em> it doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>
