			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I reckon either poor circulation on 1 arm or the source of cold air is greater than on 1 side. </p>
<p>Also, u/Sergmanny, I had this problem go away when I started using vertical mouse. Maybe can try both mouse change and doctor visit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! programmer here, I noticed the same thing and after some experimentation I concluded that it's pressure and lack of motion that does it for me.</p>
<p>My current solution is putting less pressure on the wrist(i.e. don't put the whole arms weight on a tiny spot), using something soft to cuddle the wrist and taking the hand off the mouse regularly to move it.</p>
<p>The the a break and move part also works seems to work for cold feet, btw.</p></div>		</li>
