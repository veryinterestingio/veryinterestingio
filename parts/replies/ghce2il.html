<p>Symptoms are not directly related caused by the virus itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not completely accurate. There are many viruses that can directly do damage to e.g. endothelial cells (reoviruses, adenoviruses, etc) , GI epithelial cells (parvoviruses, rotaviruses, etc) , skin epithelial cells (poxviruses, papillomaviruses, etc), neurons (again, parvoviruses, herpesviruses, etc), WBC progenitor cells (again, parvoviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, etc) etc. by causing cell lysis as the virions are released.</p>
<p>As far as how viruses remain undetected, u/eehoe, it depends on the virus. Some integrate into the genome and lay low, like retroviruses. Some form a quasi-genomic state and lay low like herpesviruses. Some infect cells in what are called &quot;immunopriviledged sites&quot; like the CNS, joints, eyes, etc (some paramyxoviruses). Others suppress the immune system, or really try hard to lay low by not replicating as often, like several hepatitis viruses.  A really neat example is some flaviviruses like bovine viral diarrhea and classical swine fever. They can infect a pregnant host (cow or pig), and cause a <em>persistent infection</em> in the unborn fetus if the infection occurs before the fetal immune system has developed. These animals, when born, are like virus factories, until something goes haywire and the virus mutates and kills them. </p>
<p>Some coronaviruses can lay dormant for months, (though it's not well understood how) causing no/mild symptoms, like feline coronaviruses or transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs. With feline coronavirus, that latent inflection can mutate in the host and go completely out of control, causing a severe and deadly disease - feline infectious peritonitis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Covid would follow some of the classic coronaviruses, which for reasons unknown do not cause severe symptoms in a subset of hosts (an age group, for example - like small children, or a species even - like MERS, which causes only mild symptoms in camels but has ~30-50% mortality rate in humans). It's probably beyond the scope of this discussion (and frankly, out of my wheelhouse), but different people's immune system respond to the same agent differently, and the basis is often the balance of T cell/B cell response and the interleukins those cells produce during the response (along the lines of what u/chillermane originally suggested) . Coronaviruses, and their severity, haven't gotten a lot of attention before covid, because 1) common coronaviruses have only caused mild symptoms in humans and 2) the more severe ones like SARS and MERS have had a minor impact on global health. Covid very much took the health care community off guard, but we should have paid more attention to SARS.</p>
<p>Humans unfortunately have short attention spans, though, and the lessons of covid will likely be forgotten by the end of the coming decade.</p>
<p>The prospect of a human coronavirus that behaves like some feline coronaviruses that cause feline infectious peritonitis is in a word, terrifying. It remains to be seen if Covid is such a virus, but that thought is enough to make me want to avoid getting infected as best I can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there some research indicating that initial viral load (in the case of influenza) was highly correlated with the symptom manifestation? IE: You could have an extremely mild case if your initial vial load was low, because your immune system would mount a small reaction and clear it, but if you had a high viral load initially you would have a much worse case because the immune system would have to mount a much larger response to clear the infection? </p>
<p>I don't think this has been replicated with Covid-19 due to the fact that purposely infecting people with Covid (to control for initial infection load would be HUGELY problematic from an ethics standpoint... that being said, it is likely to hold true, so, yet again, another reason to WEAR A MASK.</p>
<p>Edit: Did some searching, couldn't find any data on HID ^50 or MID ^50 for Sars-Cov-2. Anyone who knows otherwise, please feel free to correct me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Median infectious dose to infect 50% of a population.</p>
<p>ID being infectious dose.</p>
<p>HID50 is human infectious dose to infect 50% of a population.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Investigations into the MID of human viruses have typically involved the experimental administration of the virus and the use of dose response data to determine the viral concentration required to infect 50% of the population</p>
