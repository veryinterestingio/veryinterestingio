<p>Nearsightedness needs to be corrected precisely so that objects at infinity are in focus. Each eye may need a different correction and there may be astigmatism as well. Farsightedness just needs to be corrected for a comfortable reading distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is compounded by nearsighted people commonly wearing their glasses basically any time they're not in bed, farsighted will do so specifically when reading things.</p>
<p>So not only  do nearsighted lenses need more precision, they'll often have more security and comfort features e.g. high-index material, anti-glare coating, photochromic treatment, ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works in optical I would just like to point out that not all farsighted people wear reading glasses. You can be farsighted and still need a full time correction for distance vision, and this is in fact the most common correction for someone with hyperopia. </p>
<p>People who can purchase off the shelf reading glasses tend to have Presbyopia not Myopia (near-sighted) or Hyperopia (far-sightedness). As off the shelf readers (and reading glasses in general) have focal points of about 14 inches. Which means that they are 100% useless for wearing for day to day tasks. </p>
<p>The majority of people with Hyperopia must wear their glasses 100% of the time so also have a focal distance of infinity. </p>

<p>As someone who just buys reading glasses off the shelf for my farsightedness why should I not do this?  It is certainly true that my farsightedness expressed itself as very early presbyopia but now I just walk around wearing +1.5 or +2 reading glasses and read books with +3 or +4 reading glasses (and do fine craft work with +5 to +7 correction either with high powered reading glasses or with reading glasses stacked with magnifying lenses).  I can literally buy glasses for $5 at home depot that do what I seem to need.  What am I doing wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what your prescription is. And I’m unwilling to go into much detail without more information. But a general answer would be. You’ve developed Hyperopia overtime (why a lower powered lens allows you to see in your day to day) and also have presbyopia. Likely what you considered presbyopia at the start was simply the beginnings of Hyperopia and now you’ve progress to a state of having both. </p>
<p>The other thing you might be missing out on with simple off the shelf readers is an astigmatism correction. Which can also cause some fuzziness in objects at any range of vision. </p>
<p>But like I said it’s impossible to tell without knowing your prescription.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - perfect vision beyond 20/20 but I was having issues focusing because of the variance between my eyes (they'd &quot;drop&quot; out of focus and I'd have to consciously refocus). My optometrist was awesome and basically fixed it by having glasses carefully calibrated for each eye.</p></div>		</li>
