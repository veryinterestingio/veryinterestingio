<ul>
<li>
<p>Gallic Wars<br />

<li>
<p>Italian Wars<br />
Lost. France becomes the first and only country to ever lose two wars when fighting Italians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wars of Religion<br />
France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirty Years War<br />
France is technically not a participant, but manages to get invaded anyway. Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the other participants started ignoring her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>War of Revolution<br />
Tied. Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as chapeaux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Dutch War<br />
Tied</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War<br />
Lost, but claimed as a tie. Three ties in a row induces deluded Frogophiles the world over to label the period as the height of French military power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>War of the Spanish Succession<br />
Lost. The War also gave the French their first taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved every since.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American Revolution<br />
In a move that will become quite familiar to future Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists saw far more action. This is later known as &quot;de Gaulle Syndrome&quot;, and leads to the Second Rule of French Warfare; &quot;France only wins when America does most of the fighting.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>French Revolution<br />
Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was also French.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Napoleonic Wars<br />
Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for a British footwear designer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Franco-Prussian War<br />
Lost. Germany first plays the role of drunk Frat boy to France's ugly girl home alone on a Saturday night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>World War I<br />
Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the United States [Entering the war late -ed.]. Thousands of French women find out what it's like to not only sleep with a winner, but one who doesn't call her &quot;Fraulein.&quot; Sadly, widespread use of condoms by American forces forestalls any improvement in the French bloodline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>World War II<br />
Lost. Conquered French liberated by the United States and Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>War in Indochina<br />
Lost. French forces plead sickness; take to bed with the Dien Bien Flu</p>
</li>
<li>Algerian Rebellion<br />
Lost. Loss marks the first defeat of a western army by a Non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First Rule of Muslim Warfare; &quot;We can always beat the French.&quot; This rule is identical to the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, English, Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese and Esquimaux.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comedic value of your comment is questionable, facts are debatable, and you give zero context.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prior to the Gallic Wars, in 400 B.C. the Gauls were the victims of the first recorded genocide in European history at the hands of future Romans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charlemagne saved Europe from the invading Islamic hordes (sorry Spain).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 French kings have sat on the English throne. No English king has ever sat on the French throne.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Colonists had no means of definitively defeating the Redcoats. Without French aid victory was quite literally <em>impossible</em>. The Colonists could not give chase at sea to claim victory, so the British would have returned repeatedly until they won. The French Navy won the American Revolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the French Revolution, France was attacked by the Holy Roman Empire, the British, the Prussians, the Russians, the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the Ottoman Empire, all in a 10 year period. The army mainly consisted of boys and men aged 12-30 years old, and fought in some of the worst living conditions any army had endured in history. Not only did the French win this war, but also ended up expanding French territory. The young pissants who entered the war emerged as steely professionals of war and would go on to form Napoleon's Grande Armee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The British stopped Napoleon, thus allowing feudal systems and slavery to continue prospering in the East for another century, and stopping the advance of modern secularity, justice, education, and infrastructure for all of Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WW1 France hosts the most horrific and tragic brutality humanity has ever experienced, is mocked for not wanting to throw men over the top in a stale-mate after 3 years of fighting at home. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>France loses more men in one battle than the U.S. has in all wars combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>France loses more men in one day the the U.S. has in the entire War on Terrorism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U.S. claims savior status despite showing up with no technology, no vehicles, no experience, old weapons. Army is entirely outfitted by the French and relegated to quiet sectors while the French confront the Germans at the real battlefields of the war. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U.S. prosperity, standard of living, defenses, and culture boom are entirely funded by European blood. Zero fucks given, along with zero acknowledgement by the people, ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WW2 France is mocked for not wanting to lose <em>another</em> entire generation of men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>France warns the U.S. about Vietnam. Ignored and mocked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>France warns the U.S. about Iraq and Afghanistan. Ignored and mocked.</p>
</li>
<li>U.S. population has never experienced war (war with yourself doesn't count), never experienced invasion by a major power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jokes are fun. Perpetuating stupid stereotypes is poor taste at best, ignorant and bigoted at worst. The French people alive during these times adore Americans and give thanks for all that they have helped with. Being Top Dog and continuing to put down your closest ally is pathetic imo.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of misrepresentation of facts, the US joined the war after several incidents of German submarines sinking American civilian ships and when Germany offered to fund and help Mexico invade America. That's a de facto act of war, but it sounds like your bias will allow you to continue to blindly see the US swooping in for a final curb stomp to get all the glory and a say in post-war European affairs.</p>
<p>It's possible that the US would've remained neutral throughout the war if not for the Zimmerman Telegram, but since in your words &quot;nobody gives a fuck about North America&quot; and &quot;the British were hiding on their island,&quot; I'm sure France would've been fine without their aid and the war would've still ended in November 1918.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment, even if humouristic, drives me nauseus. How can a sensed man say that the French waited for the American to arrive to win WWI?  The French Army in 1918 was probably the most powerfull army the world had seen since the Grande Armée and only the Wehrmacht came close to its power since then. It drives me crazy to see that people without any historical knowledge dare say that the French didn't win WWI, it was probably their greatest victory.</p>
<p>I see that the anglophone world is slowly but surely destroying French history with historians lying about the history of a country which dominated Europe almost unchallenged for centuries and who conquered most of the world in its history.</p>
<p>I'm deeply sadened that the French government seems to be destroying this legacy too, only teaching children about the collaboration in WWII and not about the Free French who liberated North Africa, Italy, France and invaded Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>I fear that in 20 years from now the glorious history of this country will be laughed at by countries whose history can't even come close to compete with the achievements of the French nation over the last millenia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During World War I, the French Army mutinied and refused to attack anymore</p>
<p>Not exactly. There have been mutiny on both side since 1915 and it did not stopped the fighting at all. In fact it had a rather small impact on the conflict. Massive offensive happenned in 1916-1917 (battle of Verdun or of the &quot;chemin des dames&quot; which is the French pendant of the battle of the somme for the british). Moreover other armies lead important offensive as well (1917: Battle of Vimy by the Canadians).
The coming of the US on the battlefront mostly coincides with a strategic mistake made by the German army. After winning another battle on the Chemin des Dames, Ludendorf aimed for Paris with the operation Friedensturm.
Unfortunately the germam Army got stopped at the Battle of the Marne and surrounded as they did not secured their supply chain. Allied forces used this to their advantage and took 35000 prisonners.
Also regarding tanks: they were not brought by the US. English were the first to use them and French quickly followed with the F17 produced by renault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me offer a few counter-arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>France completely dominated the entire European continent during the Napoleonic Wars. It took a massive coalition of European powers to stop them. Nations like Venice, who had stood for over 1000 years, were completely dismantled by Napoleon. Discounting dependents and conquered countries, France was basically at war alone against nearly all the European powers at different stages of the war.</li>
<li>The Franco-Prussian War was a part of the Napoleonic Wars. France had been fighting nearly all of Europe several times over and Prussia was the &quot;rising power&quot; under Otto von Bismarck. Prussia's military had a discipline and leadership possibly not witnessed in history since.</li>
<li>France was on the winning side of WW1 (if such a war can have any &quot;winners&quot;). </li>
<li>French only surrendered when Germany took Paris, not when Belgium was lost.</li>
<li>France, like all the other &quot;Imperialist colonizers&quot; struggled to maintain control of their colonies. The UK lost control of (or &quot;de-colonized&quot;) most of their colonies during the same era.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your first point. </p>
<p>Your second point - that the Franco-Prussian War was part of the Napoleonic Wars - is absurd. The Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 with the Congress of Vienna. The Franco Prussian War was fought 55 years later by the grand-grandchildren of the soldiers who fought Napoleon, for completely different reasons, by two very different polities. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>France was on the winning side of WW1 (if such a war can have any &quot;winners&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, but that's beside the point. Their army decided to spend a year sitting out the war. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>French only surrendered when Germany took Paris, not when Belgium was lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough, I could have been more clear on that. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>France, like all the other &quot;Imperialist colonizers&quot; struggled to maintain control of their colonies. The UK lost control of (or &quot;de-colonized&quot;) most of their colonies during the same era.</p>

<p>I don't recall the British, French, Germans, Belgians, or any other colonial power losing a stand-up war to their colonists in the way the French did. </p></div>		</li>
