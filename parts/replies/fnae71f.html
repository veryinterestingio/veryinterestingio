Thank You!
My sinuses kill me.  98% of the time when I have a headache, it’s my sinuses.<br />
It does not help that I have a severely deviated septum and I’m terrified to have surgery on my nose. I’ve seen &amp; heard way to many horror stories about botched nose jobs.  I keep Afrin(nasal spray) DayQuil &amp; Vick’s around the house just for this. Excedrin Migraine helps sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

Once I learned the likely cause of the migraines and took anti inflammatory medicine instead of loads of tylenol it helped a ton! That along with my usual allergy meds.</p></div>		</li>
