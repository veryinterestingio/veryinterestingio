			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, here at 5300ft altitude in the winter at 12% relative humidity the snow and ice literally sublimates like dry ice, does not make what it's on wet first or turn to slush at all on its way to evaporating.  The ice evaporates without transition to liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only water that does this. But not every substance can do this.
Also Air pressure also plays a factor in addition to temperature. </p>
