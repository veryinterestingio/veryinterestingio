			<div class="markdown"><p>Can the websites force you to turn off the &quot;don't show what sticker I have on me&quot; option? Like adblockers. Some websites don't allow you to access their content if you don't turn it off. Defeats the whole purpose.</p>
<p>Is a similar workaround possible?</p>
<p>Some websites don't even give you the option to decline cookies nowadays...</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for clarifying about cookies, can someone please answer the first question?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you want to be able to log into things, cookies are part of that.</p>
<p>But cookies themselves are fine, it’s just when they’re abused it’s a problem. Third party cookies should never be necessary - if your bank is authenticating with a third party, for example, then the information needed can be passed with the first request</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cookies are stored on your computer, so no website can force you to accept them - most browsers have an option to disable cookies. But bear in mind that while l blocking cookies entirely may break some functionality ... for example, you generally won't be able to log in with cookies disabled, because the cookie is used to store your session token. You might want to download an addon such as <a href="https://privacybadger.org/" target="_blank">privacy badger</a> instead.</p></div>		</li>
