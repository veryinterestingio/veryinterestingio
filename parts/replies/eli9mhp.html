			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just during replication - DNA has an &quot;idle&quot; half-life of 521 years, give or take - that means that after 521 years 50% of the nucleotide bonds have degenerated / are broken. If you go back to your half-life equation, that gives an approximate rate of decay of \~3.7-e6 per day; given the estimated 3 billion nucleotides, that means that your body repairs \~2K base pairs per day per cell.</p>

<p>Of course, the contents of the nucleus aren't exactly idle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eat adequate green vegetables and meat. (Folic acid and vitamin B12) Have decent protein in your diet as well. Inner cell machinery repairs these defects. </p>
<p>Avoiding the damage in the first place is even more important. So avoid UV light, radiation (radon), smoking, cured meats/nitrates, and pollution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means that they have a non-zero chance to decay at any moment, and this chance is so that by year 521, 50% of them will have decayed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK they will follow normal statistical decay patterns - each bond has a trivial chance to randomly decay each moment, but that adds up over longer time frames</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you aren't familiar with radioactive decay, and your question has been responded. </p>
<p>The same concept of decay and it's equations are widely used on radioactive isotopes too, in case you are curious on how they calculate how long would it take for nuclear waste to decay to non radioactive isotopes, as they obviously don't wait 50 thousand years for 99% decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Each</strong> <strong>cell</strong> gets in the region of 10000-100000 damage events <strong>per day</strong>. They've all got to be correctly repaired, or they lead to mutation, and potentially cell death.</p>
<p>(see <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(17\)30005-3.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjMg7-ixeThAhWQQRUIHQsEDvAQFjABegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw21rBSWNcibPaCDJzxLL8f9" target="_blank">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</a>, figure 1) </p>
<p>Every time a mutation doesn't lead to cell death, its a potential cancerous mutation.</p>
<p>A normal cell is about 3-5 distinct cancerous mutations from becoming a tumour (these have to be 'complementary' mutations). </p>
<p>You want to read something really fun, see Martincorena et al. 2015 (behind a paywall), where they looked at a section of 1 cm x 1 cm eyelid skin tissue to identify mutations from sun damage. Spoiler: It's not good. It's scary <em>even as a cancer researcher</em>, what cumulative sun damage does to your cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for adding the source, that’s a really cool fact!</p>
<p>It’s kinda like my favourite fact to throw out:</p>
<p>Which is brighter: a hydrogen bomb detonated against your eyeball, or a supernova from the same distance we are from the sun?</p>
<p>The supernova. By <strong>9 orders of magnitude</strong>. The supernova would be 1 billion times brighter!</p>
