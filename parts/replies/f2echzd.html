			<div class="markdown"><p>Individual water molecules are ephemeral things anyway. A cup of water isn't a cup of H2O, but an equilibrium between H2O, H+, OH-, H3O+, with protons leaving and joining all the time. It's torn apart by chemical processes, formed by others. If there were some magical way to tag an individual water molecule, it probably wouldn't last very long, on a human time scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually interestingly enough we can approximately tag individual molecules using isotopes of water. We can use isotopes like deuterium, which is a hydrogen molecule with a neutron, as an measure of water turnover in the body. That’s one way we analyze renal (kidney) function in the body. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23128907/" target="_blank">See this paper</a> for a real example of how it’s used in the context of sport doping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing you can track is the isotope. I can’t think of a way to track which O a particular D was attached to at what time. I suppose you could make water molecules of DT-18O and mix them with regular H2O and then look for HDO, HTO etc. Someone must have done that experiment already, if it’s possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really what they're saying, water is made up of Oxygen and Hydrogen, but you can't necessarily think of it as being a number of individual molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, when someone like Neil deGrasse Tyson talks about water going through your body that went through Socrates' body, he specifically says &quot;atoms&quot; and not necessarily &quot;molecules&quot;. So there is a bit of distinction I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photosynthesis is (as far as I know) the only biological process that splits water oxidatively, but water molecules are frequently broken apart in other biological reactions. In fact, I'd be surprised if hydrolysis isn't the most common biological reaction. Almost all catabolic reactions occur through hydrolysis, and therefore involve the (non-redox) transfer of an oxygen atom from water to another molecule. That oxygen atom will, given enough time, eventually end up as part of a carbon dioxide or water molecule.</p>
<p>Outside of the biosphere, oxygen can pass between water and various minerals (mostly carbonates and silicates, and iron and aluminum oxides might also be significant) in aqueous solution. These processes don't change the amount of water on Earth, since the H2O terms cancel out in the final equations (e.g. see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate%E2%80%93silicate_cycle" target="_blank">silicate weathering</a>), but they do involve transfers of oxygen atoms between water and other compounds.</p>
<p>However, some <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%285%2F6%281.665+*+10%5E13+mol%2F%28year%29%29%283000+years%29%29+%2F+%28%281.37*10%5E24+ml+*+1g%2Fml%2F%28molar+mass+of+water%29%29%29+*+100%25" target="_blank">very, very rough calculations</a> suggest that all carbonate burial doesn't take much oxygen out of the water cycle. In the 3000-year residence time of water in the ocean, not even a thousandth of a percent of the oxygen molecules in ocean water are buried. (I took the rate of carbonate burial from the IPCC via Wikipedia, and the volume of the ocean from the source linked from XKCD. 5/6 represents the probability that an oxygen atom from water in bicarbonate will end up in calcium carbonate, based on stoichiometry.) The carbon flux of photosynthesis, however, is 1000 times larger than that to carbonate burial, so biology may have a greater effect. The stoichiometry between fixed carbon dioxide and split water molecules in phytosynthesis, however, is complicated (it depends on the efficiency of the ATP synthase in chloroplasts), and I wouldn't even know where to begin with estimating the number of hydrolysis and condensation reactions that occur in the biosphere per year. Perhaps someone else can give that a try.</p></div>		</li>
