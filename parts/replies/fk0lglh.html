			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told to think of a balloon expanding. If you draw dots on a balloon and blow it up the distance between the dots increases because 'more balloon' fills the space. Also, the big bang created the balloon, it didn't expand into a preexisting balloon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what we're not exactly sure of. If I remember correctly, it's suspected that dark matter might be responsible for the expansion, but I'm not sure if that's still (or ever was, I could be wrong) the current theory for why it's happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The balloon is a metaphor. Think of it as nothing. You can have more of nothing because there is no cost.
Matter doesn’t stretch but is gravitationally bound, so only matter that is too far apart from other matter to ‘communicate’ (at the speed of light) will move apart due to expansion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to that, more and more parts of the universe will end up in the part that &quot;moves away&quot; from us fast than light and will thus be inaccessible from us in any known physical way.</p>
<p>So if the universe will keep expanding at a fixed rate, then eventually, we will be left with just the matter that is close enough such that gravity can hold it together. Everything else vanishes from any access or visibility. A dark, cold ball of matter in nothingness.</p>
<p>To further cheer everyone up: If you manage to built a spaceship that keeps accelerating by some energy source, you might be able to experience a lot of this before your human life ends :) Only 1g of constant acceleration is enough to see all but the most long-lasting stars burn out.</p>
<p>Edit: Thinking about it, we would probably not be left with a ball of matter. The matter that is going to be held together by gravity (at least our galaxy) is enough to form a black hole when tidal forces have converted enough rotational energy into photons (via heat). So at some point, we have a huge black hole alone in nothingness. This black hole will shrink due to Hawking radiation, shooting all kinds of particles into space. Since they move away radially from the only object in that Hubble volume, they will eventually leave it and be the only particle in their Hubble volume.<br />
So what we will eventually have will be single particles, alone in nothingness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because if you keep accelerating at 1g, which is around 10 m/s^2, you reach relativistic speeds surprisingly swiftly (speed of light: approx. 300 000 km/s, so you get to half the speed of light in approx. 30 000 ks, which is just around 1 year). When you approach the speed of light, whatever happens in the referential of reference you started from will become asymptotically slower (Like in the referential of a photon, it arrives at its target at the exact same moment it was emitted). So if u get towards these speeds, you will see the universe until real real far into the future!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that he's referring to how time appears to slow down when you approach lightspeed. If you're going fast enough, even a human could outlive several stars. The 1g is likely the only human-limiting factor. Accelerating at 1g would feel like you were standing on Earth, but after enough time you'd be going lightspeed. Accelerate too fast and you become a human slushie, but honestly 1g is still a bit low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would this be any different if instead of space expanding, every particle in the universe was actually shrinking? Including the things (like light) that we use to measure distance. Or if time were speeding up relative to the speed of light so that distance measurements were coming back larger? Or if the speed of light were not a constant, but instead was slowly decreasing thus making our measurements of distances increase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It couldn't be just one of those things, because fundamental constants interact in ways that we could tell if just the speed of light were changing.</p>
<p>But yes, in some sense &quot;space is expanding&quot; would be indistinguishable from &quot;everything is shrinking&quot;, provided it was shrinking in precisely the right way.</p>
<p>Basically it comes down to Occam's Razor. It's a much simpler explanation to say space is expanding than to say all the fundamental constants are changing just right to make it seem like space is expanding.</p></div>		</li>
