<p>Depends on which dissolved ions you are talking about specifically, but rainwater and rivers washing over the rocks of the continental crust do provide the highest overall flux of dissolved ions to the oceans and the highest amount of many particular salts, including sodium Na⁺, the second largest salt component in the oceans. </p>

<p>Pretty much yeah. To be clear, the other hugely important supplier of salts to the oceans which you’re getting at is through hydrothermal vent systems which exist on the flank of mid ocean ridges. This is where seawater seeks down through fractured rock of the oceanic crust, becomes superheated as it gets closer to magma chambers in the crust, then rises and vents back out into the oceans. There are a whole spectrum of seafloor ‘smokers’ with different temperatures of vented water and different dissolved ionic species supplied to the oceans, but none of them are volcanoes themselves, and where magma does erupt into the seafloor at volcanoes, it does not seem to alter the seawater chemistry. </p>
<p>Hydrothermal vent fields exist along the flanks of spreading ridges, where they are close enough to magma chambers that percolating water in the crust can become superheated and undergo many chemical reactions (these systems both supply and remove various salts from the oceans); but they are also far enough away from the ridge axis (where all the volcanic fissures are) that the oceanic crust formed there has had a chance to cool and fracture so that the seawater may percolate deep enough to become significantly heated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It only takes 70m years to circulate all the oceans water thru this system. </p>

<p>In fact, scientists estimate that the entire volume of the worlds oceans gets cycled through the hydrothermal vent systems at mid-ocean ridges in just 10-20 million years, <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/feature/history-hydrothermal-vents/impacts/chemistry.html" target="_blank">source</a>, which only serves to make your point about the importance of these systems more emphatic.</p></div>		</li>
