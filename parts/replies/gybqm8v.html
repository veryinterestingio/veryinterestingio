			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even crazier than that! Even euv is too wide a marker tip for some things. So what they do is draw a line, then move over a little and draw another line. Where the lines overlap is a little darker and thinner than the marker tip (you move over by less than the width of the marker). Sometimes you have to do this multiple times to get a dark enough overlapping line. This is called multi patterning.</p>
<p>But! It's even crazier than that. At the risk of leaving eli5 territory, the marker isn't perfectly flat, it's more like a wave (but also not a wave, quantum physics is wack). So every time you draw a line, it's darker in some places and lighter in others. Because they act like waves sometimes, if two markers overlap, they interfere with each other (like how waves in water can get bigger or smaller when they hit depending on if the high or low parts line up or not). Of course, because of quantum physics it's a little weirder than that but close enough. What this means it's that you can't draw the line you want, you have to draw a different line that will look like the line you want after the waves all interact.</p>
<p>Lithography is so freaking cool. Like some of the most extreme, on the edge of human understanding of physics and chemistry, wacky awesomeness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Explained very well. I wasn't thinking about that part of it. The hitting a sphere of liquid tin while it's in free fall is the part that just astonishes me, and makes me feel like I'm 5 again learning about something I could never have imagined</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you there. I still remember exactly when I first learned about that part, still blows my mind. Every time I feel like I can't be any more surprised, one of my circuits friends tells me something new and absurd.</p>
<p>Another fun one: SSDs have a real problem with electrons teleporting out of the cells and wandering off. Like, WTF physics, stop being so weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your correct, but the latest 5nm and smaller process is EUV. That's why there is such a shortage of electronics, everyone wants 5nm but there are only 2 companies that can make it via EUV. IBM's 2nm also requires EUV.
It's also the far more interesting light source</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shortage isn't due to lack of EUV, there's a lot of reasons why. It's mostly the record demand and covid impacting supply chains. There was also a drought in Taiwan that was causing issues, and some Samsung fabs in Texas shut down for about a month due to those blizzards. </p>
<p>EUV rollout has not really been delayed, it's just takes a while to ramp to high volume on new nodes. Even if ASML could crank out litho machines faster, TSMC and Samsung would still need to build more fabs to install them in, that doesn't happen overnight no matter how much money you throw at it.</p></div>		</li>
