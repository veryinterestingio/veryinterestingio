			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Where I used to work we had a repair room that had a big vent hood for pulling fumes out if the room. The door to the room had a 2 foot square grill in it. If you closed the door and put a price of cardboard over the grill, you couldn't open the door. No matter how hard you pulled on the door. We'd do this to co-workers as a prank. The only way for them to get out was to shut down the vent hood so the pressure would stabilize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also allows you to do some pretty remarkable things with vacuum fixturing.</p>
<p>A normal shopvac can usually pull a bit more than 2psi worth of static suction.  If you have some kind of scheme to spread that out over an area, you can do everything from holding down sheet materials for cutting, to pulling on/lifting flat surfaces, to shaping plastic sheets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment reminded me of something I hadn't thought of since seeing it. There was an episode of Mythbusters where they tested the strength of a single shopvac's pressure, distributed over larger and larger areas. <em>Spoilers: By the end of the episode they lifted a car.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds about right.  My back of the envelope math says you'd need around 20 square feet of surface to pull that off, but that' what -- 4'x5'?  The roof of an appropriately sized sedan should work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pretty cool when you realize you're basically using the weight of the air to lift things--the shopvac's not taking any of that load; the walls of your pressure vessel are &amp; the force is supplied by the weight of the air!</p></div>		</li>
