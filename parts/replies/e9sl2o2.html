			<div class="markdown"><p>The greatest single act that we can do is to quit fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Think about it, it takes millions of years for a few thousand trees to turn into a barrel of oil. All that Co2 they absorbed is released in a few hours of burning gasoline. Multiply that by millions of barrels a day and that is how much CO2 we are pumping into the atmosphere every single day. Each day we pump about 10,000 years of sequestered co2 into our air and it acts as a blanket that warms the planet. </p>
<p>What political moron could possibly think we can do that for as long as we wish?</p>
<p>Here's another little factoid. We as humans can not live in air that is at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and also at 99% humidity. We can't live in that because we stop perspiring. If we can't perspire, we overheat in about an hour. That means that if we let things get hot enough, the electrical demand for A/C will skyrocket along with the cost of electricity. The poor will die by the thousands even here in America.</p></div>		</li>
