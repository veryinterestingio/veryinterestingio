			<div class="markdown"><p>ooooh, thankyou, for once i think i actually understand it! especially thankyou for the energy density/pressure clarification down the bottom, that makes a lot of sense</p>
<p>that element of not being diluted is absolutely <em>BIZARRE</em> though!! what the hell is going on!! i feel like that should break some kind of conservation law???? aaaaahhh</p>
<p>actually on that note, the other thing is, as the expansion rate of the universe increases to faster-than-light speeds, how does that not destroy information? does it just do the black hole trick of redshifting it to undetectable levels, or does it actually, so to speak, &quot;create space&quot; faster than any emitted light can travel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conservation of energy is only guaranteed when the universe is static over time. This is a consequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem" target="_blank">Noether's theorem</a>. In general relativity, energy doesn't have to be conserved because the universe expands and therefore changes over time.</p>
<p>You can see this with the much more mundane example of redshift. Light from distant galaxies is redshifted as the space it passes through stetches, and redshifted light has lower energy, but that energy doesn't go anywhere. It's just lost.</p>
<p>In simple terms, yes, the expansion of the universe creates space. I'm not sure if matter moving outside the cosmic horizon counts as information loss because that matter still exists out there somewhere, but regardless, conservation of information is a rule of quantum physics, not general relativity. This is why the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox" target="_blank">black hole information paradox</a> is a thing. Going strictly by relativity, black holes destroy information because they are featureless, and despite several claimed resolutions, we can't <em>really</em> resolve it without a working theory of quantum gravity.</p></div>		</li>
