<p>If you were to spin an object in a vacuum with sufficient angular velocity, would the electrons be hurled off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat question, but I don't think so.  In terms of physics microscopically, i.e. take a block of material and spin it, what you're describing would be achieved by changing the momentum of the constituent particles of the matter, i.e. the electrons to expel them outward.  Someone correct me if i'm wrong here, I only have expertise in solid state physics, but I'm pretty sure this analysis would be applicable for molecular and atomic (i.e. compound or pure substance), matter in any phase (solid, liquid, gas, plasma).</p>
<p>However, since the protons are orders of magnitude heavier than the electrons, they would be affected much more greatly and tend to be removed from the matter at lower velocities by the same degree since momentum is directly proportional to mass. </p>
<p>Moreover, the &quot;bonding&quot; (used loosely because I also reference plasma earlier which includes a number of &quot;unbonded&quot; electrons) or electrostatic interaction between electrons and most nuclei is quite a bit stronger of a force than you're likely to achieve in terms of angular momentum on an electron.  </p>
<p>In another sense you are totally correct.  Imagine adding thermal energy to an atom or molecule under the kinetic theory of matter (search this term if you want more info).  By heating something, you're adding energy in the form of vibrations and rotation, the sum of the two is equal to the total heat you've added.  If you were to take a molecule or atom individually and spin it, you would essentially be adding thermal energy to it.  In turn, these vibrations will excite electrons within the atom.  If the electrons absorb energy from the phonons (thermal vibrations, another helpful term to learn more), they may reach an excited state sufficient to overcome the work function.  In other words, on a technical level you are absolutely right that spinning matter can eject electrons.</p></div>		</li>
