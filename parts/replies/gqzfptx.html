			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an example, though not exactly of minor being &quot;happy&quot;, and not that of a chord either but rather a scale.</p>
<p>In Carnatic music (south Indian classical), the default scale (like how the major scale is considered 'default' in Western, because it's usually the first scale taught) is more minor sounding (for people familiar with Western music: it's actually more phrygian sounding. The scale is root, minor second, major third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, minor sixth, major seventh and octave.) The reason for this is simply that this scale has both big and small gaps between successive notes (for musicians: it has half-step , whole step and minor third intervals), so singing this scale is the best way for a beginner to familiarise themselves with singing successive notes no matter what the distance of the gap between them is.</p>
<p>(Important note: this is only the default scale in Carnatic music, not Hindustani (north Indian classical). The two styles of music are very different, though they may seem similar to Western ears as they are both melodic styles of music while Western music is a harmonic style.)</p>
<p>However, because this scale is considered the default, the presence of the minor second and minor sixth scale degrees, which may sound very sad and melancholy to Western ears (as they aren't used as much in Western music except to convey those emotions), doesn't necessarily convey the same emotions to someone who has listened to Carnatic music. They seem almost normal and convey different emotions, but not necessarily sadness. Similarly, major scale degrees need not necessarily sound happy.</p>
<p>Despite this, people may still interpret some songs in major vs minor keys in Indian styles of music similar to how Western ears would as well. This is because both Indian and Western music by some coincidence use the same 12 notes in similar ratios to make music, so they have similar ideas of what is considered dissonant and what isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard something similar called the Byzantine Scale once I believe. I love the sound of phyrigian and phyrigian dominant, but putting the major seven and flat 2 together creates three chromatic notes which I thought was odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not coincidence, it's math. A perfect fifth above the tonic vibrates at 3/2 the frequency. If you move up in 5ths, you produce all 12 semitones before repeating. I know there are musical traditions that embrace more semitones and chromaticism, but there's a very natural, mathematical reason to base a musical system around 12 semitones and what we call the church modes (which ionian and phrygian are both examples of).</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that when using exactly 3:2 in this manner, the final result is slightly off of 7 octaves above the root note. This discrepancy is called the pythagorean comma. Here's a cool visualization of the discrepancy <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PythagoreanTuningGeometric.png" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PythagoreanTuningGeometric.png</a> . Basically the construction of a 12 note system based off of the circle of fifths is a <em>very</em> convenient fiction, and there are different approaches to smoothing out the difference. In Western music, this is addressed by well-temperament, an approach of modifying the values in the 12 note scale such that most chords will sound in tune in most keys. You can customize your scale to make certain chords sound closer to ideal.</p></div>		</li>
