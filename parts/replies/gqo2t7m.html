<p>That's what evolution did to mitochondria for eukaryotic organisms like us.</p>
<p>Not to mention all the other actual bacteria we harbor symbiotically for digestion, etc.  nature is pretty metal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have energy on the wrong side there. It takes CO2 and energy and gives O2 in exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well it does also supply energy in the form of molecular bonds though right? That's obviously what OP means here, producing biomass that can be used as energy source.</p>
<p>(solar) energy + CO2 --&gt; biomass + O2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually CO2 has nothing to do with releasing O2. CO2 is used only in the Dark phase (Calvin cycle - it also doesn't require solar energy), and from CO2 we get glucose. O2 is obtained from H2O thanks to the solar energy: H2O ---(solar energy)--- 1/2O2 + 2H+ + 2 electrons. 2H+ and 2 electrons are used further to produce ATP, ATP is used to produce glucose by combining 3 CO2 in the earlier mentioned Calvin cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there some other oxygen sink? Or, somewhere else for half the carbon to come from?</p>
<p>The sides don't balance without O2 coming from CO2. Glucose is C6H12O6. So, we need 6CO2 to get enough carbon and 6H2O for enough H. That is 18 Oxygen, 6 of which go to glucose. 12 O leftover and only 6 could come from water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really streching it here on the ELI5 here:)
But honestly, I never realized that water was also primarily involved in photosynthesis, so good to learn something new! I guess that's also where all the -H groups are coming from in sugars?</p>
<p>Still I'd say to keep it ELI5, or just eli-not a chemist:
Sunlight + CO2 + water --&gt; biomass + O2</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I see your point but I'm literally a chemist and interpreted it as OP meaning it as a means of producing O2. You're right though, the difference is beside the point of both the question and my initial answer.</p></div>		</li>
