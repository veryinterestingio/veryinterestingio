			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is basically just long term memory, of which flies have none. Their behavior can't be altered by outside stimulus. Even an infant will remember that a hot stove hurts the first time they burn their hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I talk about pseudosentient animal-people all the time. Most don’t use logical cognitive faculties to process information and arrive to conclusions. They merely exhibit a matrix of potential reactions in relation to external stimuli.
But this is the type of shit that has gotten me banned from this terrible website multiple times. People hate reality. They just want to feel good. Which is why they aren’t people at all, only animals.</p>
<p>I am the autonomous sentient entity.</p>
<p>Those of their kind are not long for this world.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Can find and process fuel from a variety of sources found in the environment  </li>

<li>Can survive in a wide range of environmental conditions  </li>
<li>Has limbs for manipulating  </li>
<li>Can cling to almost any surface  </li>
