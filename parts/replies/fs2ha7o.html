			<div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely depends on so many factors that there is no way to generalize. An example to illustrate: Douglas fir (<em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>) is a fast-growing and excellent timber tree, and lumber companies attempted for decades to introduce it to Peru, Chile, and other areas in S. America. There are environmental conditions (soil structure, air temperature, seasonal length, elevation, etc.) in the Andes that <em>seem</em> ideal for growing Doug fir. What were the results?</p>
<p>The plantations failed, utterly, over many decades. Every effort brought beautifully sterile seeds and pampered seedlings to S. America where they failed to thrive and died before even reaching the tree-equivalent of adolescence. Why? Because Doug firs are <em>obligate</em> ectomycorrhizal (EM) trees, and they can't grow without their symbiotic fungal life-partners. When this was discovered in the mid-20th C., plantations were formed on the principle of importing seedlings <em>and soil inoculum</em>. This has resulted in healthy Doug fir plantations, and also the introduction of a number of biological invasions in Argentina and Chile (including by Doug fir and its fungal partners). </p>
<p>I know it's an unsatisfying answer, but there is just no way to generalize. If you take trees to the Southern Hemisphere (or to the Eastern Hemisphere) and find similar temperature, precipitation, elevation, and aspect characteristics as the home range, a given tree might &quot;know&quot; to drop its leaves (if it does that sort of thing). But it is more likely to die or fail to thrive, establish, and spread for far more reasons than simple abiological environmental factors. Thus, ecology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, you did an excellent job at explaining that! There were a couple of things I had no idea about, but that whole response was both detailed and simple enough for me to understand (and remain fascinated!).</p></div>		</li>
