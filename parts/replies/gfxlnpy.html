			<div class="markdown"><p>This is at the crux of the issue.  It is hard to prove a negative especially at the scale at which COVID19 vaccines will be put into use.  </p>
<p>Scientifically, we would expect what we've seen side effects in the trials to cover the short term side-effects.  Long term ones would not be seen here, but it is hard to predict what they would be.  Importantly, we don't know if these side effects would happen from a normal virus infection with COVID, so delineating those will be difficult.  Unfortunatley, the only way to know for sure is time (years).  I am not sure anyone wants to wait that long for a COVID vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mRNA of the S (spike) contained in a lipid (fat) vesicle decays after a short time, but not before the lipid carrier particle takes the mRNA inside of the cell (cytoplasm where there are ribosomes, not nucleus where there is DNA). Once in the cytoplasm,  S mRNA attaches to ribosomes  so the cell now can make S protein that gets to the cell surface or is broken into protein pieces. (Remember learning the central dogma--DNA to mRNA to protein).  S protein from the short life of the mRNA vaccine can remain as part of cells for several days. Exposure of a lipid carrier holding mRNA for S protein stimulates the immune response to mount a defense against the foreign S protein material. When the immunized person breaths in the circulating virus, the vaccinated person's primed immune system attacks the S protein on the real virus to prevent it from binding to cells as required to make more virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why most researches and doctors would like to see more data, but aren't really concerned. The only longer term potentially frequent serious adverse event would be antibody dependent enhancement has been ruled out definitively. </p>
<p>At this point not vaccinating as many ppl as possible against a disease with more than 0.2% mortality rate and high long term morbidity is far more harmful than even rare potential side effects, even if they are later discovered (as long as they are rarer than 0.1%).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibody Dependent Enhansement (ADE) is a phenomenon where having a certain antibody against a pathogen helps it invade cells, rather than blocking the infection. It can be caused by a vaccine like with formalin inactivated RSV vaccine (not in use), or natural immunity, like with Dengue viruses. It's fairly rare, but ALL vaccines have to be tested to make sure they don't induce ADE, because that would be very harmful. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would qualify as &quot;long term&quot; in this case, when Covid-19 was discovered just early this year?
There is nothing truly long term, but here is what I could find:

<p>The above article is pretty comprehensive, and talks about limitations too. Anyways, mortality rate of over 0.2% with modern medicine and high morbidity rate... Yeah I'll take the vaccine, thanks.</p></div>		</li>
