			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll reply here to not make a top level post, but your comment touches on something that I think a lot of people mis-understand about pain. It's not all just about tolerance, a lot of it has to do with just simply how much pain an individual actually experiences.</p>
<p>Two people could get say, slapped across the face, in the exact same way, with the exact same force and one person might shrug it off while the other starts bawling. But the person who shrugs it off shouldn't be assumed to have a higher pain -tolerance-; they simply might have just not felt the sensation of being slapped to the same level of pain as the person who cried did. </p>
<p>If the seemingly tough person were slapped hard enough that they -felt- the same level of pain as the seemingly weaker person, they would likely cry as well.</p>
<p>Now, pain tolerance is a thing and it can be learned over time. And if a person just naturally doesn't feel a strong pain -response- to most things, they might seem to have a lot of pain tolerance. (Conjecture from here on) But it's actually likely that people who feel very strong pain responses are the ones with more pain tolerance. They have to develop that skill because they experience a lot more pain. They might still react strongly to sudden pain, like stubbing a toe, but can deal with chronic pain so well that other people might not even realize they are in pain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A genetic disorder I have means I am always masking at least some level of constant joint pain. Most people don't realize, even if they see me every day. </p>
<p>Tell someone you have a headache, and they'll be sympathetic and offer to get you a Tylenol. Telling someone your whole body hurts, all of the time and there's nothing they or anyone else can do about it makes people really uncomfortable. </p>
<p>So you learn to hide it. It just makes things easier. </p>
<p>And when you're getting a massive tattoo, or your blood drawn, or dental work with no numbing because Novocaine doesn't work on you and you don't have insurance to pay for the gas; people ask how you can stand it without flinching. </p>
<p>I've just had a lot of practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also live in chronic pain and I had no idea I was as good at hiding it as I am. People can't tell I am in pain from the way I move or function. I have to actively tell people I am in pain. </p>
<p>Which I don't do unless it's really bad or I can't do something without risk of injuring myself further. People can't fix it, I am used to it so why mention it? &quot;I am in pain&quot; is a default state for me, and people don't know what to do with that. </p>
<p>...the downside to having so much practice is that my body doesn't hurt when maybe it should. I had a cat bite at work (I work in a shelter) and it was bad enough that my boss gave me some first aid for it. It left some scars too but honestly? Didn't hurt. Which I actually said because someone commented on how it looked and they looked at me funny. </p>
<p>So sometimes I don't know if I should be treating something as serious because I am so use to seriously fucked up levels of pain. Which has its perks, I can function when maybe I shouldn't be.... But again. Maybe I shouldn't be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta this here.  I used to have major dental issues that included what I considered 10/10 pain.  I think it's not just that you feel less.  </p>
<p>I had a filling last week where the Novicaine wouldn't kick in at all (not the first time, but worst in a while) and the drilling hit an 8/10 or 9/10.  The dentist kept wanting to stop, but it was downright bearable compared to when I had an abscess tooth that spiked so bad I couldn't form the will to stand.  I <em>hate</em> dentists... but the pain.  I'd rather drilling without numbing than walking in the door again.</p>
<p>I'm sure <em>actual</em> variant feelings of pain are a thing, but there's a lot to be said for just getting used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How stong the sensory input is vs how strong you react to that input.</p>
<p>Some people's bodies put out a stronger response to the same injury compared to someone else's.</p>
<p>Some people are so used to pain that they can better handle the same level pain response as compared to someone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also a mental state.<br />
You can train yourself to endure huge amounts of pain, and also the sensitiveness to pain(and touch/other stimuli) can be trained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definately agree that mental state can affect pain tolerance. Anecdote time - Worst pain I've ever had was during labour. I coped better when I stayed calm and focused inside my own head. The moments I got distracted or frightened, suddenly I couldn't cope with the pain anymore. If you accept a pain and don't fear it, it might not hurt as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional anecdote: I have endometriosis and have learned to deal with debilitating uterine pain on a monthly basis. I have developed a high pain tolerance. Labor and delivery weren’t a big deal. In fact, I didn’t realize I was in labor for a long time. People keep telling me, “oh, you’ll know when it’s real labor and not Braxton Hicks.” I almost delivered my twins at school and my singleton at home. </p>
<p>Point being: pain, labor and otherwise, is an oddly and uniquely individual thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. As a multiple sclerosis &amp; cluster headache sufferer (shoutout /r/clusterheads - we give birth through our fucking faces repeatedly), I've learned to manage pain like a tank. Haven't taken standard painkillers in years. Ripped the lens off my eye once and managed to deal with it in a fairly dignified manner, lol. Took tramadol for maybe 5 days. Meditation techniques help the most, for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can add on and tweak the part where you talked about the hot plate. When you are in pain like that you don't consciously think to pull your hand away.</p>
<p>The signal doesn't actually go to your brain yet, it goes to your spine and back to your arm telling it to move. That's a reflex. The reason you don't feel pain right away is that the signals have not yet reached your brain to be perceived as pain because that pathway is much longer in comparison to the reflex path.</p></div>		</li>
