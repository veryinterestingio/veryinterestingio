			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the teens who did the “Icy Hot on your junk” challenge can tell you ONLY use it on parts of your body that have thick skin or a layer of muscle or fat.</p>
<p>I was never that dumb but did put some on my knee and hop boy, if it’s like that but on your junk...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i once had really bad chiggers and i put this bug bite cooling cream (same effect as icy hot) all up and down both legs. oh god it was horrible. that’s wayyyy too much surface area and my legs felt like they were frost bitten, but trying to wash it off didn’t work either and they were so sensitive that even the bed sheets made me feel like i was dying. but at least i wasn’t itchy anymore?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. Pain is felt on UN mylenated fibres. Heat and cold are received on mylenated fibres. This means pain is less important. Heat and cold can kill you. Pain is information of damage already dealt. Heat, cold, friction, pressure, and movement all travel faster and are more important therefore inhibiting the pain reception at the spinal cord level. This is all described in Melzak and Wall's 'Gate control theory of pain'</p></div>		</li>
