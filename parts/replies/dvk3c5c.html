<blockquote>
<p>By nature, lower sound frequencies carry more energy than higher ones, so as distance increases, higher frequencies are not able to be heard as well because they lose the energy to propagate sound waves much earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound waves of the same amplitude but higher frequency actually carry more energy. The intensity of sound increases with wave amplitude AND frequency.</p>
<p>The reason why lower-frequency waves propagate further than higher frequencies in a typical situation, is because the attenuation of sound in a medium is a function of its frequency, and higher frequencies are typically more heavily diminished before they reach the listener.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the poster above was simplifying it a lot, to the point of being misleading. One ear isn't neccessarily receiving more &quot;reflected&quot; or &quot;direct&quot; sound. Instead both ears are receiving a mix of both.</p>
<p>A sound wave that reaches you from a certain direction will reach both of you ears with or without a delay inbetween. It will also hit the twirly bits of your ear and reflect from there, into your ear with a delay. It will also hit your shoulders and reflect with a different delay, etc.</p>
<p>In the end what you hear is a whole collection of sound waves. The modifying of these direct and reflected waves, reaching each of your ears, is knows as a Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF). The brain has the ability to decode the series of sound waves, using the inverse of this function, to estimate the exact direction that the sound originated from, in a 3D space.</p>
<p>Bonus: You can use a generic HRTF algorithm to simulate the positioning of sound in space, to make 3D audio for headphones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe part of the answer also is that we aren't able to determine if a sound is above or below us nearly as well as we are able to determine the direction it is to us. If I recall correctly some species of hawks I believe it is have offset ears (one higher then the other) to help with that fact as it allows them to better determine the elevation of the sound as well as the direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add that we're actually not that good at it. If you try having someone dangling their keys in front of you when you're blindfolded, you'll often miss by quite a lot vertically if you try to point to it, so we really should add a third ear for proper triangulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lower frequencies do not carry more energy they just have smaller attenuation constant in air. Altough lower frequencies need more energy in order to be heard by human ear due to the non-constant frequency response of the ear. That is why subwoofers eat all that power.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does the brain need to learn this or do we are able to do this (well) from the start? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both, actually.  There was a recent research paper that covered the plasticity of hearing localization.  The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/science/ears-shape-hearing.html" target="_blank">layman's write-up is here</a> (paper itself <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/03/05/JNEUROSCI.2530-17.2018" target="_blank">here</a>).  The researchers inserted a bit of silicone into the concha (the bowl-shaped piece of your ear) that drastically alters how up/down information is encoded as it enters the ear canal.  </p>
<p>Immediately after inserted, the subjects lost the ability to distinguish vertical (up/down) localization, but as time passed with the inserts in place, their ability to distinguish this returned to normal.</p>
<p>However, when we hear, we use several other cues used for localization:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ITD - Interaural time difference, or the time taken for a sound that first reaches one ear until it reaches the other ear.  This is - obviously - dependent on the distance between your ears, and is important for lateral (left/right) localization - for instance arrival times coming from 45 degrees left are going to be different from sounds coming from 90 degrees left.(Side note: When I say left/right, it's in reality an intersection of a sphere surrounding the head with identical arrival times, so ITD alone can't tell you whether something is coming from 45 degrees horizontal left or 45 degrees vertical left)</li>
<li>ILD - Interaural level difference.  When sound propagates, it follows an inverse square law, where sound drops off by 6.02 dB for each doubling of distance.  This behavior of sound, combined with head shadowing (that the head attenuates different frequencies in different ways when a sound passes from left to right) - for things that are in the extreme nearfield, it can also play a role in localization - such as when someone is whispering in one ear.</li>
<li>However, as stated in the ITD point, the ITD and ILD will not allow us to distinguish whether a sound is coming from the front, above or the rear. To help us with that, there are a few other mechanisms, such as the anatomical transfer function (or head-related transfer function), where the size and shape of your head, ears and body alters the spectrum of sound in (unique to you) ways that provides additional cues to the localization of sound</li>
<li>Dynamic binaural cues: When you listen to anything, you're not sitting still - you're making adjustments to your position - these movements subtly change the sound as it reaches your ears, both with regards to ITD and ILD, and due to the anatomical transfer function, also the spectra of sound as it reaches your ears, and these changes improve your localization accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a bunch of other cues we use to determine both direction and proximity, and if you're interested in a starting point, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_localization" target="_blank">Wikipedia article on Sound localization</a> is a more than decent starting point for learning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No learning is necessary, this is all an innate trait that is part of the low-level processing of sound in our brain.  There are particular structures in your brain that are specifically wired to pick up sound level and sound timing differences, and another wired to pick up the distortions produced by your ears, head, and shoulders.  These structures are shared by all mammals people have looked at (birds have structures that do this too, but they are different structures).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think that is accurate. We may have the tools to comprehend the relationship between sound and space, but I believe newborns need to learn how the different stimuli correlate. Visual references also affect how we perceive sound in space, so it isn’t exactly hardwired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While some of it is an innate trait, what you're saying is not entirely accurate.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/science/ears-shape-hearing.html" target="_blank">This story</a> goes into some detail about the plasticity of hearing localization. Summary: By deliberately altering the test subject's HRTF through a silicone insert in the concha, researchers take away the subjects ability to perform vertical localization. However, with the insert in place over a period of several weeks, the test subjects' vertical localization ability returned.</p>
<p>From an anatomical standpoint, this also makes all the sense in the world, as the anatomical transfer function changes throughout life - your torso, head and ears grow as you mature into adulthood - your ears <a href="http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/tmp/surveys/bigears.pdf" target="_blank">apparently continue growing through your entire life</a>, which means there <em>must</em> be some plasticity, otherwise your ability to localize sound would vary greatly with age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an innate human ability. I'm not sure of anything that would cause a human not to have this ability, short of hearing loss in one ear or both. </p>
<p>That being said, like most anything else you can  improve this ability with practice. </p></div>		</li>
