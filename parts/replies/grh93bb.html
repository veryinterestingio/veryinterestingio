			<div class="markdown"><p>Computer parts wearing out usually do not result in gradual slowdowns. The exception may be having bad sectors on a hard drive, but it's a bit of an outlier and will have very specific effects (like near-total freeze for a few minutes while the OS tries and tries and tries reading the same sector to no avail, then back to normal speed when it gives up).</p>
<p>RAM wearing out (which usually takes decades rather than years) will result in instabilities rather than slowdowns. SSDs wearing out will prevent from writing to a cell - but again it's something that hardly ever happens on your average general user machine...</p>
<p>The most likely &quot;physical&quot; culprit to slowdowns is simply dust accumulation limiting the airflow, leading to higher temperatures, leading to the system underclocking itself to remain at acceptable temperatures.</p>
<p>Physical failures creating a general feeling of sluggishness is extremely uncommon, if not virtually unheard of.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly, I was quite surprised when OP mentioned it as one of the usual reasons for slowdowns. While RAM modules wearing out and developing errors is certainly something that does happen, it really does not happen all that often, not anymore at least. And as you said it causes instabilites rather than slowdowns.</p>
<p>Similarly with CPU degradation, it does happen, but unless you're running overclocked, it usually takes a damn long time to become noticable. I have an i5-2500 (non-K) system that's nearly 10 years old (and heavily used for most of it) and last time I checked it could still hit its rated turbo clocks quite easily, though it might be drawing a bit more voltage doing so nowadays. But even with a relatively badly degraded CPU losing ~200-300MHz to its turbo clockspeeds would only account for single-digit % reduction for most CPUs from the last decade. Not something an &quot;average Joe&quot; would notice in his spreadsheets, I think.</p>
<p>What does happen a lot however, is HDD failures, especially the 2.5&quot; laptop ones, I've had so many of those, and I've been only &quot;really&quot; into computers for little more than a decade. SSDs are much more reliable from my experience, but of course they have their rated max number of read/write cycles before they fail, which again will usually take a damn long time to achieve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it doesn't work at all like that. It's digital electronics composed of almost entirely solid state components that either work in their entirety or they fail outright. The closet thing you can get to wearing out is burning through all the overprovisioned NAND flash that an SSD uses for wear leveling. NAND flash has a finite number of write/erase cycles before it wears out due to the degredation of the insulating layer around the floating gates that NAND flash is made from(<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_trap_flash" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_trap_flash</a>) the SSDs ability to distribute writes and reads over many chips begins to degrade and it begins to slow since reading/writing in parallel to multiple flash chips is integral to SSD performance.</p>
<p>That being said modern SSDs made from v-nand(vertical nand) are rated for multiple petabytes(1000terabytes) of endurance. This is largely because you can use older transistors that are bigger since your building your chip in 3d instead of just 2d. The fact that the transistors are bigger doesn't really matter if you're stacking them instead of putting them side by side and bigger transistors have more insulation that takes longer to degrade. </p>
<p>RAM can also degrade instead of dying outright but that causes random system stability issues and crashes not a slow down.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making a clear cause and effect relationship like that between failure rates and &quot;getting slower with age&quot; is only technically correct, which's got to be the most annoying kind of correct.</p>
<p>Yes, of course solid-state does wear out over time, just like anything, and yes, degradation can in fact cause slowdowns, but it's not as quick of a process as you might think it is. And it's by far not the most common, nor the biggest factor in case of your average Joe's computer &quot;slowing down&quot;.</p>
<p>A CPU or a GPU can degrade from years of very extensive use, which can cause it to not be able to achieve the kind of clockspeeds it used to when it was new. Though unless you're running it overclocked, it will take a really long time for it to degrade enough to cause a noticable slowdown, I mean more than a decade, if not two. Same thing applies to RAM, though degraded RAM will cause stability issues and data corruption rather than slowdowns. SSDs can also degrade, but again that would require a lot of write/erase cycles, and will take many years with &quot;typical desktop use&quot;.</p>
<p>When an average Joe tells you his computer has slowed down, there are many reasons that are <strong>way</strong> more likely than silicon degradation, for example: his system's become bloated as sh*t with tons of useless apps running in the background, his mechanical hard drive is failing or accumulation of dust on the radiators and thermal compound going bad cause the CPU to stop itself from reaching turbo speeds, or even thermal-throttle (downclock itself) because of high temperatures.</p>
<p>With the vast majority of those ~10-year-old computers that have become unusably slow, all they need is an SSD, a RAM upgrade, a fresh install of Windows, and a deep clean (with new thermal paste application) to literally come to life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on for those that do replace the thermal paste - avoid the tendency of using too much paste. You need surprisingly little and if you put too much it's likely to dry out and age quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general guidance is to follow the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace HDD with SSD if you have a HDD (bad/slow HDDs often indicated by the disk usage consistently being &gt; 85% for a few minutes or longer) this has the advantage of also significantly improving boot times which gives people the feeling of being faster.</li>
<li>If you often have \~ &gt; 3 programs open or &gt; 6 tabs open at once, you need more than 4GB of RAM (also called memory sometimes). (Check memory from task manager if it is regularly above 85%, consider an upgrade)</li>
<li>Look at the OS, couple of things to check, first of all, number of startup programs, there are usually very few which are required/recommended, i.e. disable adobe updater, it will run when you run the adobe suite. Secondly, check that you don't have a bunch of programs running that you aren't using (e.g. steam if you are a gamer, make sure applications, like spotify, slack, java update, onedrive, skype etc aren't enabled if you don't use them regularly (Task manager &gt; Startup). In general don't disable things that you don't know what they do if you are not tech savvy, etc. synaptics touch is for your laptop trackpad, if you disable this, it may stop you from being able to use your laptop from your trackpad etc.4 opt.) </li>
<li>Check for external influences, overheating if stuffed in closed cupboard and dusty. Laptops can be prone to this anytime after 1.5-2 years of ownership. Normally you will get an increase of fans (either speed or frequency). This can be checked by tools such as CPUz but if you aren't comfortable with changing a CPU, chances are at this stage you should be talking to an IT technician before you make assumptions on this.<br />
General (probably fits in around 3-4): Check CPU, Mem, Disk, Network in task manager (Ctrl + Alt + Delete). If one of these is significantly high, give it a bit of time to run unhindered. If still a nuisance after \~2-4ish hours, it may indicate an issue with (CPU - Bad program, Underpowered CPU, Memory - If less than 4GB, just upgrade, if a program is taking &gt;60% resources, try reinstalling program, maybe reinstall windows (normally faster/easier than diagnosing actual issue), disk - if antimalware or system, let it run for a bit, otherwise follow advice 1, if still issues, identify bad program, reinstall/reimage OS, network - check what you should have from your plan, typically one of (2Mbps, 8Mbps, 20Mbps, 50Mbps, 100Mbps, Anything greater (why you complaining homie, us Aussies have 3rd world internet, lend a hand) if you see single programs (bar torrents/game programs (while updating) using more than this or your download &lt; 8Mbps (note that this is different from MBps, 8Mbps = 1MBps, = 1MB/s = 8Mb/s [note the capital B]), then contact your internet service provider to see if any issues (normal protocol is to restart 1) attached devices, 2) router, 3) modem (if you have one, a router/modem is often referred to as the same thing). If you are experiencing intermittent connection, ask them about latency and jitter, these will affect things like voice apps and gaming especially even if download speed is fine. </li>
</ol>
<p>If any issues, talk to IT professionals, for most upgrades, we normally charge 1hr + parts or 2-3hrs + parts if it requires an OS migration (i.e. computer is that far gone that we need to reinstall everything). General price guides - $100 - $200 AUD for up to 1TB upgrade to SSD (parts only). And RAM ($50-$100 AUD) for 8GB of RAM (memory).</p>
<p>Regarding actual CPU speed, if you are doing anything less than video/maybe photo editing and i5, i3 (current generation - important [i3 from 7 years ago are pretty sub standard these days and an i3 from now can outperform the i7's from yonder years)) are more than enough. Pentium and celeron I wouldn't recommend to anyone but the lightest of users. It's just not worth it when you have solid NUCs for $350 such as <a href="https://www.umart.com.au/Intel-NUC-BOXNUC8I5BEH-Barebone-Kit---8th-Gen-Core-i5_55409G.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.umart.com.au/Intel-NUC-BOXNUC8I5BEH-Barebone-Kit---8th-Gen-Core-i5\_55409G.html" target="_blank">https://www.umart.com.au/Intel-NUC-BOXNUC8I5BEH-Barebone-Kit---8th-Gen-Core-i5\_55409G.html</a></a> (Plus HDD + Ram costs).With AMD processors, I haven't been following as much, I'll have to succeed to other reddit users with their expertise, I am far further into software development than IT repairs these days.</p>
<p>Also as mentioned in another thread:<br />
The number of installed programs doesn't usually matter (unless your storage is near full). What matters is the currently running programs, try to stop the amount of auto starting programs. And sometimes, you just have to refresh your PC (reinstall the OS) which is valid IT advice. I do mine approx every 2 years, used to be less but as I rely on my PC more, and moving general storage elsewhere, it is becoming less and less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are forgetting an important part that is often the cause of massive slowdowns for computer after 5-6 years: CPU heat. Sometimes it's just dust in the fans, but very often the thermal paste itself slowly melted and got out of there. It happens on video game consoles pretty often too, and without proper thermal paste the CPU reach high level of temperature that get past a certain threshold and begin to throttle its speed. Replacing thermal paste caused slow old computers to come back as good as new multiple times in my life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yip my brother operates high end graphics rendering machines and he cleans and redoes the thermal paste on all his CPUs and GPUs once a year.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, I never even though about this! Is there any way to check whether this light be happening without actually removing the CPU and replacongy the thermal paste?
