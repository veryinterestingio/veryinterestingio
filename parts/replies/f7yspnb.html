			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally an ANC earbud that has a good seal with your ear (i.e. seals your ear from the outside world) should work better than a headphone. </p>
<p>However, there are a lot of variables.  If the earphone's housing is perforated then the headphone might work better.  If the headphone has really good ANC performance, it should work better. </p>
<p>Look for earphones or headphones that claim around 30dB or more of noise cancellation if you are looking for good performance these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I have noise cancelling earbuds and turn them on but do not use them to play music, I could reduce some hearing damage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes. </p>
<p>It really depends on what the noise is and how you're being exposed to it.  But if you want to use earbuds just to block noise, use foam earplugs instead.  They're more effective and you won't be sad if they fall in a storm drain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a reason that active noise cancellation was designed in the first place. It was both difficult to communicate and dangerously loud for tank commanders and helicopter pilots.</p></div>		</li>
