			<div class="markdown"><p>My eyes do this too. They sort of fall open when I’m sleeping. I first found out because someone told me when I was a kid that my eyes were open while I was sleeping. I think they open half way. Sometimes I dream about objects that are right in front of my vision. I’ve told people about this thinking if they were creative, they’d put on a puppet show in front of my face while I’m sleeping to make me dream about something specific. No one ever has though...that I know of.</p></div>		</li>
