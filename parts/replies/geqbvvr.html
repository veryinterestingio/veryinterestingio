			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to remember that there is a difference between ‘size’ and ‘mass’. A small, but dense star can have a greater gravitational pull around it than a larger less dense star. The English language confuses largeness with ‘massiveness’. Sometimes they coincide. Sometimes they don’t.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted though that systems that end up with a neutron star (or a gas giant, or a brown dwarf or whatever else) <em>do</em> tend to evolve along different timelines with different stages or at least as far as we can tell so far.</p>
<p>The size and mass of a star or stars are highly correlated to the type of system the star finds itself in. Even though it is an old saw, there are almost certainly some causal factors beyond the more obvious correlations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that astrophysicists sometimes use &quot;size&quot; to mean &quot;mass&quot; when talking to the public. Granted this is often when they're referring to black holes where the two terms actually <em>can</em> be used interchangeably, but most people don't know why they can be used interchangeably and end up misapplying it to stars and planets. However, there are also cases where I've heard an astrophysicist use a term referring to size, such as &quot;bigger&quot; or &quot;smaller&quot;, when talking about the mass of stars and planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also because along the main sequence, mass and radius are correlated M~R^0.8 (M&lt;Msun) and M~R^0.53 (M&gt;Msun). So for the common description of a star (that of one on the main sequence) using the terms interchangeably is ok. Planets also have a mass radius relation for each form, Rocky, gaseous etc. But the scatter is enormous so I wouldn’t use the terms interchangeably there. But for main sequence stars where they spend 80% of their lifetime this is fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean with few exceptions more massive stars (in the same stage of life comparing. A blue supergiant to a red supergiant clearly isn't logical) are also larger.</p>
<p>Of course the are exceptions like neutron stars (but they will also have destroyed a bunch of their planets in their supernova so the logic holds) and WR stars (which shed a bunch of their outer layers so god knows what that did to their planets)</p>
<p>Of course once you start mixing in the various different life paths of a star this get messier still. But I don't think the initial answer was inaccurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That matter was never going to end up in the main star.  If it didn't coalesce into a brown dwarf, it would have been blown out of the system by the stellar wind generated when the main star started fusion in its core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not unheard of for stars to form as binaries, either widely separated with their own warped accretion discs or together with a shared circumbinary disc, it’s not impossible to have a star-brown dwarf binary, it’s purely a matter of how fast each object can accrete before their accretion is either suppressed as you say, or how much mass is available to be accreted.</p></div>		</li>
