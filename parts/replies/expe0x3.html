<p>Film restoration also includes a lot of other improvements.  Defect removals (mold, scratches, dirt, etc), modern color correction as well as brightness &amp; contrast adjustments, stabilization, sharpness improvement, grain reduction (especially important the higher the resolution you re-digitize at), and flicker reduction among other things.</p>
<p>These improvements are where the vast amount of costs come from in the process.</p>

<p>If the 'Master Print' gets damaged or scratched, it causes some major problems. Ha, of course, the DVD I have was from 2002, or around there, and they didn't bother to CGI out the scratch or anything. </p>
<p>There are other movies I've seen with scratches in the final, DVD version, but of course I can't remember any others right now!</p></div>		</li>

Most digital movies are still shot using less than 4k resolution cameras. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the few movies made with an 8k digital camera finally getting us close to 35mm film equivalent resolution on digital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup old movies shot on film can be released at higher resolutions now, assuming the master print is still intact, by taking higher quality scans of the actual film. But all those movies from the start of the digital revolution are stuck at whatever resolution they were shot at.   You will never get a proper high resolution release of them as the information for those extra pixels does not exist.  You might get upscaled  versions, but the extra pixles would be interpolated from the original film, though a released upscaled version would probably be better then what your TV would do automatically.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It really didn't. The only reason why old film looks pretty good is thanks to the digital restorations, without that the actual raw analog film doesn't look very impressive at all and is full of artifacts (grain, dirt, scratches, etc.).</p>
<p>Composition of analog film was also pretty terrible, when you watch something like Star Wars in it's original form you can spot tons of artifacts, spaceships that are transparent in parts they shouldn't be, borders around visual elements where things were copy&amp;pasted together and so on.</p>
<p>The crystal clear look you get on a modern Bluray or in the cinema only exists thanks to everything going digital, analog cinema never looked that good.</p></div>		</li>

I know that the original Star Wars is one of them, but I'm not sure if that went through to the '90s or not. But part of the reason for a lack of BluRay release could be related to not having source material available of a sufficient quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, wall of text incoming!</p>
<p>The excuse that many original negatives have deteriorated due to <a href="https://www.nfsa.gov.au/preservation/preservation-glossary/vinegar-syndrome" target="_blank">vinegar syndrome</a> (or a number of other issues with the composition of the original film stock, particularly cost-cutting measures regarding the production of film stocks that were popular in certain eras) is a big issue, but it isn't completely sufficient to explain a lack of HD releases for a fair share of older films.</p>
<p>Obviously, using the original camera negative (the film that was in the camera that shot the scene) is going to give you the highest quality for a transfer if it's still in decent shape, but most mid-to-high budget films from the past have first-generation interpositives (also known as master positives, which are the first transfer from the original negatives that were generally used for the film prints that went out to theaters) that still exist in decent quality. There's an initial quality drop of up to 40% in that process, so the interpositive stock is usually the highest quality film stock available so that as much quality is retained in the process as possible. Interpositives have been used for many transfers of films that have lost or damaged original negatives, such as the original Mad Max, and they can look good (or even great) at 2K or 1080p when done correctly (sometimes better than poorly handled transfers from the original negatives), but the quality loss is usually quite apparent at 4K.</p>
<p>As I'm not in the motion picture industry, I have to guess that the reason for a lack of Blu-ray releases for certain films is more likely due to a downswing in physical media sales. I say this because, although they aren't going to be up to the quality of more recent scans, most initial DVD releases of films from major studios came from 1080p or 2K digital scans of whatever source material was seen as most convenient; sometimes the studios made sure to do things at the best quality from the most original source, other times they found a film print (possibly multiple generations away from the negative) to scan digitally for the DVD transfer. There are numerous instances of (especially circa 2006-2008) Blu-ray discs being made from these (sometimes) questionable, outdated transfers, but that has become less prevalent and most of those transfers are only available in HD via digital distribution.</p>
<p>TL;DR: There are usually other sources at high enough quality for good Blu-ray releases, but some studios are buying into the &quot;physical media is dead&quot; meme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're 100% correct here and the OP you've responded to isn't giving accurate info.</p>
<p>Grain size and general lens shittiness back in the day. Those are huge limiting factors on resolution, and the effective resolution of most older film movies is really not much more than HD.</p>
<p>You can scan the negatives at 8K all you want, but put it this way: if you scanned at 8K, resized down to HD, and resized back to 8K...it wouldn't look much different from the original 8K scan you did. The reason is that the effective resolution isn't anywhere near 8K or even 4K.</p>
<p>I work in film as a visual effects supervisor, so I'm the guy in charge of pixel fucking. Even with today's best cameras from RED or ARRI and the best prime lenses money can buy, I still have yet to see any 8K plates come across my desk that look even remotely close to pixel-perfect at 100% size.</p>
<p>They've definitely passed 4K effective rez though now, which again means that if I take their 8K plate, shrink it to 4K, and then resize back to 8K...it does actually look worse than the original 8K plate.</p>
<p>BUT if you were to go back and re-scan a movie like JJ Abram's first Star Trek, or one of Chris Nolan's or Tarantino's more recent projects, those were all shot on film with pretty recent top-of-the-line lenses, and those would definitely be worthy of a 4K or 8K scan. Especially any of the scenes shot on 70mm film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it was inaccurate, though I agree that sentence is poorly worded as it (wrongly) emphasises the &quot;film doesn't have resolution&quot; rather than the &quot;in the same sense as digitally shot movies&quot; bit, which was the actually important bit of the sentence. Alas, most people who are complaining seem to have only read the first four words of that sentence.</p>
<p>I've tried rewording it but honestly it's hard to do without inserting a whole extra paragraph of explanation. Since there are several highly upvoted corrections, and the statement isn't technically wrong in the first place, just ambiguous, I've decided to leave it as is.</p></div>		</li>
