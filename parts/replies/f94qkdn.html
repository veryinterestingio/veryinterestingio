			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically,  this usually works because you have hit an “edge case” - something happened that the programmer didn’t account for and now the software can’t recover or get back to “normal”. A reset starts everything over such that whatever caused the edge case is long forgotten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't so much of it forcing the code to run from the beginning again that fixes it.</p>
<p>With a lot of software, it is programmed to store information about its state. Sometimes, this state can be filled with bad data or be put in a state that the software doesn't know what to do. All you are doing is resetting the state held by the software when you restart the software.</p>
<p>For example, your router, it might accidentally assign two machines with the same internal IP address, which causes issues due to the state in the router has now been corrupted with bad data. Or your ISP might be constantly sending a repeating packet to your IP address, where resetting your modem would release that IP address and get your modem to request a new IP address from your ISP, causing that repeating packet to be ignored.</p></div>		</li>
