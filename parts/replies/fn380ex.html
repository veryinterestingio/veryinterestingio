			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the data (the video) get copied from the originator? Is there some algorithm that determines that this piece of data is frequently requested it and it should be replicated here, here and here? What happens when there is an edit? How does that get &quot;pushed&quot; to all the data centres that have a cached local copy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the spirit of the original reply, it would be like having a dedicated janitor come empty the shared sharpeners at the end of each row. The people in the row don't know when or how the resource is made available, just that when they look for it (i.e. a movie's files) they find the resource is available, because someone outside their row (Netflix server admins, or the janitor in my example) has determined the maintenance and upkeep schedule for the resource.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not know specifically what methodology Netflix uses, but the options are either the content provider (Netflix/reddit etc) can push the data/content to these data centers/delivery network hubs of all their changes (edits as you stated) or these hubs pull the content on demand.</p>
<p>Each of these methodologies have their own advantages/disadvantages and the content providers come up with the algorithm that best suits and the agreements they made with these delivery network hubs.</p>
<p>Things to consider in making those decisions can be, the vitality/affordability of staying close to real-time of all the changes, size of these uploads, band width costs, content demand from certain geographical locations etc. hopefully someone who does for a living can answer better that me the intricacies that go into these decisions.</p>
<p>To answer your last question '<em>How does that get &quot;pushed&quot; to all the data centres that have a cached local copy?</em>' - the content provider knows the locations of all these data centers and going back to my original analogy, if the sharper needs to be updated/replaced/deleted, they know where they are located and based on demand &amp; need, they get updated.</p></div>		</li>
