			<div class="markdown"><p>More technically, it’s a buffer, a solution that likes to hold pH relatively constant. It’s pH might be slightly acidic (like 6.4) but it will stay right there in the presence of strong bases or strong acids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, so it not only neutralizes acids but bases. I suppose the pH of saliva in it self doesn’t have a lot to do with its ability to buffer which is where I was confused. It has more to do with the fact that it has a buffer system in it where the weak acid/base will react with bases and the conjugate base/acid will react with acids. Apparently saliva has carbonic acid as its weak acid and bicarbonate as its conjugate base.</p></div>		</li>
