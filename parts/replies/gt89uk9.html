			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is what I was gonna say. There are things like extractive that come from the source (like raspberry natural flavor will have raspberry in it), but there are also things like carriers, emulsifiers, preservatives. I work in the food industry, there’s a lot of weird shit like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with that. The hidden issue being that some things do hurt us but they are constantly swept under the rug for as long as possible because they help rake in tons of money. One of the emulsifiers was partially hydrogenated oil, which contained harmful trans-fat as a by product. (and was pabeled as GRAS until they realized it wasn't) In the USA, you can list 0g trans fat on your nutrition label if the amount per serving is under 0.5g, but you are also allowed to make a serving size as small as you want to accomodate that. I was spreading the word on that for years before anything got done about it, and it's still somewhat in use today, as well as replaced with another vague emulsifer with questionable sources that also results in trans fat lmao.  It's a crooked system, so you only stand to benefit from scanning the ingredients list of things before you eat them.</p></div>		</li>
