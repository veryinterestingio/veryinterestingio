It's the same for using a mono-phasic birth control instead of tri-phasic to keep female driven hormones even instead of up and down up and down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To double piggy back - the PHYSIOLOGICAL anxiety is not necessarily “caused” by lack of serotonin, though it may make it more likely. </p>
<p>Anxiety has a huge, huge, HUGE psychological/ thought process and behavioural component. Those processes and behaviours may be helped or hindered by serotonin, or other neurotransmitters/chemistry. But the reverse is also true. Behaviours such as exercise can affect serotonin levels...but that alone doesn’t cure anxiety.</p>
<p>Though god, I wish I hadn’t been a fucking dumb teen, and just started taking the meds when I needed them, instead of thinking I needed to be “strongggggg” or “do it myselfffff”.</p>
<p>Fuck I want to punch old me in the face sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no... all human emotions exist as chemical reactions in the brain. We're far enough into the science that we know this, just not far enough to the point where we completely understand it yet. </p>
<p>It's not just that these meds affect chemical levels, they affect how the body creates those chemicals and then also how the body reacts to those chemicals.</p>
<p>Just keep that in mind when you get frustrated, depressed, or anxious... Is this <em>me</em> feeling those things, or is my body simply having a chemical reaction that I have no control over?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they aren't meant for people with bi-polar which has its own set of issues. We're specifically discussing anxiety and that is what I'm going with. When you keep a steady stream of chemical-x then that's stabilising the issue at hand so the person who is suffering anxiety doesn't have spikes.</p>
<p>I'm down to discuss various bi-polar treatments somewhere, though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow it is awesome how knowledgeble you are about this subject! Please ignore my question if you don't feel like answering, I will just forget I asked. But: how do these drugs changing the reception of serotonin signalling to drugs that increase serotonin expulsion. I am extremely uneducated about this, but from what I understand, drugs like MDMA do pretty much that: release the storage of serotonin (and the depletion leads to the depressive hangover some time pater). If dosed well (lower than drug users do I reckon) could these drugs also provide useful in treatin serotonin related mental health problems such as anxiety or depression?</p>
<p>Super broad question, lots of wrong underlying assumptions and many (faulty) simplifications in the above, but I would love to hear an informed insight on the effects of these drugs and their potential medical use. And the gut as an influence on our well being is such an interesting (relatively novel?) Phenomenon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks and I know right, all of this is so interesting for so many reasons. And don't worry about feeling uneducated, even people who study this stuff usually feel confused and intimidated by its complexity.</p>
<p>Anyways, you are exactly right about MDMA releasing serotonin and having clinical applications in some contexts (for example, MDMA is currently used as a treatment for PTSD, partly because of its effect on serotonin). The name for this kind of drug is an SRA (serotonin-releasing agent), and you can read more about them here (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_releasing_agent" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin\_releasing\_agent" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin\_releasing\_agent</a></a>). As a picture to have in mind: if you imagine brain cell A passing a signal to brain cell B, these drugs pull serotonin out of brain cell A (leading to more serotonin the space between A and B). On the other hand, serotonin reuptake inhibitors just allow more serotonin to stay in the space longer (by preventing it from being pulled back up into A, while A is still releasing a normal amount of serotonin into the space).</p>
<p>And you are also right in thinking that these drugs might have clinical potential, which is why they are currently being researched as treatments for things like stimulant dependence, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Some examples of SRAs that have been used clinically or are being studied for clinical use are the antidepressant AET (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Ethyltryptamine" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Ethyltryptamine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-Ethyltryptamine</a></a>), the antidepressant indeloxazine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeloxazine" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeloxazine" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeloxazine</a></a>), and a drug called UWA-101 that has been researched for Parkinson's disease (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWA-101" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWA-101" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWA-101</a></a>). The last drug is pretty interesting based on what you said since its structure is extremely similar to that of MDMA. (Google image &quot;MDMA chemical structure&quot; and then &quot;UWA-101 chemical structure&quot; if you want to see how similar they are).</p>
<p>The main problem with using serotonin-releasing agents clinically so far has been finding effective drugs that are simultaneously 1) safe for your brain, 2) not very euphoric or recreationally useful, and 3) safe for your body. To the best of my knowledge, most SRAs that were used clinically (having properties both 1 and 2) were later found to have things like side effects on the heart and potential for severe immune reactions, etc. And another problem would be that mixing SSRIs with SRAs could lead to serotonin syndrome (basically having too much serotonin signaling in your brain and body). There is still a lot of research going on though, so maybe future SRAs will be used for anxiety and depression as you mention.</p></div>		</li>
