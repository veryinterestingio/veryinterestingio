			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating, thank you.
So some subtypes of Salmonella naturally live in the gut biome of chickens. When you expose the particular antigens to another part of the chicken (like muscle) it is recognized as an infection.
That chicken will then kill off those subtypes, knocking them out of the gut biome.
But as all the other Salmonella serovars can remain in the gut biome, the chicken can still have a rather normal/healthy digestive tract.</p>
<p>It sounds so silly now that until today, I thought vaccines only applied to viruses. Nevertheless the parallels are fascinating to me. Flu vaccine for instance. The antigen is inoculated in muscle tissue; this protects against a later attack in the upper respiratory system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, so aside from mostly Salmonella serovar Pullorum and Salmonella serovar Gallinarum - the Salmonella serovars are harmless to birds and can live as commensal bacteria in the poultry gut. But it is important to realize that vaccination against Salmonella is a preventive measure: vaccinate to minimize the chance of the Salmonella serovar colonizing the gut. If the gut is already colonized with whatever Salmonella serovar, vaccination is less effective or even completely useless. </p>
<p>Commercial poultry producers are always aiming to avoid any colonization of Salmonella (whatever serovar) in their flocks. But especially in broiler flocks, we see exotic serovars now and again. They are not a big issue for the birds nor for food safety, but processing plants hate these flocks anyway: the machinery gets contaminated with the Salmonella and will contaminate all other processed meat for up to 3 days. The meat will test positive for Salmonella and figuring out the exact serovars takes a couple of days - not what you want in fresh meat production chain.</p>
<p>You also adres an important point in vaccination strategy: the route of exposure to the antigen. As you can imagine, using attenuated live vaccines use the 'natural way' of triggering the immune system, making use of all the (by the way fascinating) different aspects of the immune system. From IgA local immunity to antibody production in the blood (IgG, called IgY in birds), cell-mediated responses. Everything. An injection with a killed vaccine is actually somewhat.. simple compared to the live attenuated ones. It just triggers IgG antibody production. </p>
<p>For some diseases in poultry, giving a live attenuated vaccine a single time, provides a way better protection than 2 injections with inactivated vaccines. A great example of this is the widely used vaccination against Infectious Bronchitis Virus, coincidentally a corona-virus (completely different type than COVID-19, but still they are both respiratory viruses).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, new question for you. Is there any reason American consumers are not asking for an EU style Salmonella control program?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would seem like a simple question, but it is quite complex. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>US is a heavily integrated market with a few big companies having a lot of power over legislators. Salmonella programs can cost a lot of money, especially if you have a high prevalence already (all the companies know the extent of their Salmonella issues). If corporate says no, there are no major control programs. Especially if you have a lot of farms that are contaminated with Salmonella for a longer period of time - it will cost tens of thousands USD per house to clean it from Salmonella. And then there is the issue of housing: in the EU most poultry houses are full concrete structures. That makes biosecurity quite effective. In the US (especially in states with hotter climates) poultry is kept on relatively simple buildings on the open ground (no flooring). This makes cleaning a potential Salmonella contamination nearly impossible. So all in all, it would mean a massive price increase if consumers started to demand Salmonella control. It would also greatly expose the US market from producers in South America.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is allowed to disinfect chicken meat in the US (not allowed in the EU): washing with chlorinated water. This is especially done to remove fecal remains from the carcasses (a.k.a. reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter) This is actually a big trade issue for export from the US to the EU. The washing itself is not the problem, the product is theoreticallyu fine, but the fact that it is needed to meet FDA or EU standards raises concerns. Personally, I think it is also the 'I will sue you for 35.000.000 USD if i get food poisoning' culture in the US that makes the giant poultry producers over-concerned, reaching for this kind of measures. </p>
</li>
<li>If you just cook the meat properly, all Salmonella is killed and the meat is perfectly safe to eat. (And kitchen hygiene is important of course).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that costs money and we Americans love money more than the lawsuits from dead people</p>
<p>We also pay off politicians to ensure we get more money and we’ll a few dead people is fine really. I mean look at how we’re handling the coronavirus. We literally are killing people and everyone is “fine” with it</p></div>		</li>

<p>Case fatality Salmonellosis (EU): 0,19%
Case fatality Salmonellosis (US): 0,50%</p>
<p>But the big issue with the numbers here is probably underreporting of cases with mild symptoms in the US. If healthcare is free/cheap, you probably go to the doctor a bit sooner with diarrhea / nausea.</p></div>		</li>
