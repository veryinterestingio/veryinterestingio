			<div class="markdown"><p>Ejectable black boxes don't really make sense for  commercial aircraft without ejector seats to initiate. Pilots will always try and recover right up until impact so a pilot initiatied system won't work as no one &quot;gives up&quot; and an automated system will almost certainly won't work as many crashes occur with no untoward events prior to impact (CFIT etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah basically the only time a pilot isn't trying to avoid slamming into something right up until the moment of impact is because they're unconscious or it's deliberate. Also if you allowed someone to dump the recorder, that also means someone with malicious intent could jettison the recorder before going on a suicide run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As if the presence of a recorder means anything to them anyway? Its curious how many posts in this thread somehow link a pilot ditching a plane to the same pilot wishing to cover his tracks.  Why would they care in the least about that?  The exact down to the inch location  of the 9/11 planes was known up to the point they crashed.... Why would the highjackers have cared either way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little ranty, but certainly accurate. But you left out Air France where the plane DID real-time transmit telemetry and, as a result, they found the black box (as well as the shark bait.)</p>
<p>Malaysia was odd because the pilot apparently turned off any such reporting, which will always be possible because if the reporting box catches fire, the pilot must have a way to cut power.  Even a real-time reporting system would have (likely) been disabled in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pilot turned off the transponder. They didn’t turn off the CVR and FDR. Those just weren’t located, probably because they went to the bottom of the ocean. </p>
<p>There’s no commercial plane in which you cut off all power in mid air. Every flight surface in a modern plane is controlled either directly electronically or via hydraulics. Turn off all the power to the whole plane and the the thing becomes a rock.</p>
<p>The Air France example is already covered by my comment. All planes transmit “telemetry” which is how they know where to look for the black box. They didn’t broadcast the CVR or FDR data. That’s what they located because they knew where to look from their transponder. </p>
<p>The black box they almost always find so real time transmission, which is what OP was about isn’t necessary.</p></div>		</li>
