			<div class="markdown"><p>The corrosion problem has been solved already. There are steel alloys that with the right reactivity of the salt only dissolve 0.25mm per year if hot. This has been shown in experiments. A lot of the proposed molten salt reactors are going to swap out the core every few years. Nuscale will work with their core 7 years before replacing it, Thorcon will do 4, Moltex (a plutonium msr) is doing molten salt in a fuelrod type assembly and will switch them out once sufficiently depleted.</p>
<p>This switch out of cores allows plants to be updated much more quickly in the future. Its new technology innovations and improvements are going to be made and required therefore being able to replace cores without a lot of labor and downtime is a very big advantage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All four loops including their heat exchangers and pumps are constructed of SUS316Ti, a standard stainless steel. This largely eliminates galvanic corrosion. Most molten salt designs envision using a low chromium, high nickel specialty steel called Alloy N for the surfaces contacting the fluoride salts. But after the MSRE, ORNL did a series of experiments with stainless steel and fluorides salts. Some of these tests ran for 45,000 hours (5 plus years). The tests showed that, provided the salt was free of impurities and maintained in a reducing condition, the effective SUS316 corrosion rate was about 0.025 mm/year.15 In other words, an extra 1 mm thickess is worth about 40 years. SUS316 is much more radiation resistant than high nickel alloys.</p>

<p>&quot;corrosion attack on HASTELLOY® N alloy in molten fluoride salts at temperatures up to 1300°F (704°C), <strong>was less than one mil per year&quot;</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Please note:</p>
<p>A mil is a measurement that equals one-thousandth of an inch, or 0.001 inch. One mil also equals 0.0254 mm (millimeter). Thus a mil is not the same thickness as a millimeter. The term &quot;mil&quot; is not an abbreviation but a unit of measure.</p>

<p><strong>Tellurium and neutron embrittlement and cracking of the Hastelloy-n was mitigated by the addition of a small amount of niobium.</strong></p>

<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>As a result of these studies, we have found that Hastelloy N exposed
in salt containing metal tellurides such as Li Te and Cr Te undergoes
grain boundary embrittlement like that observed in the MSRE. The
embrittlement is a function of the chemical activity of tellurium
associated with the telluride. The degree of embrittlement can be
reduced by alloying additions to the Hastelloy N. The addition of 1 to
2 at. % Nb significantly reduces embrittlement</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>We have found that if the U(IV)/U(III) ratio in fuel salt is kept
below about 60, embrittlement is essentially prevented when CrTel.266
is used as the source of tellurium.</p>

<p>data shows that niobium improves the resistance of Hastelloy N to irradiation embrittlement</p>
<p>page 31</p>
<p>Our findings suggest very strongly that a molten-salt reactor could be constructed of 1 - to 2%-Nb-modified Hastelloy N and operated very satisfactorily at 650°C.</p>
