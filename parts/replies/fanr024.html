			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep..   just like this intense itching that hasn't let up in 3 weeks drove me nuts enough to go to the dr and find out that my liver enzymes are ridiculously high (and no idea yet why).  It is there to tell me that something is wrong.  Had it not bothered me, I have no other symptoms and would have passed it off.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately though, now that I know something is wrong, I still can't just turn it off..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To illustrate, one of the symptoms of leprousy is the innability to feel pain and is how they loose toes and such.  They invented a device that would sense when they were hurting themselves and emit an anoying sound to replace pain.  The thing is, it doesn't do much good and the patients keep hurting themselves anyway.  Why?  Because it annoys them so they TURN IT OFF.  </p>
<p>If we could just turn off pain, we would, and we would hurt ourselves because of it.</p></div>		</li>
