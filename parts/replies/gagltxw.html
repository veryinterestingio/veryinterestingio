			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly. However I should say that it is more of an indirect relationship. Your immune system and it’s cells can’t detect exactly how much of a pathogen is in the body. They just know it’s there, causing damage, and needs to be removed. It’s an ongoing war in your body and your cells don’t know how much it’s facing, it just keeps fighting for you until it’s gone (success) or fails (you die). However, if the viral load is low in your body, your immune cells can dispose of the virus much quicker than if there was a lot. Therefore late stage, more problematic symptoms never arise. </p>
<p>It’s important to note that just because someone is “asymptomatic” doesn’t mean there aren’t any symptoms. Sure you don’t express any visible symptoms or illness, but the damage in your body is certainly still present and growing. I feel like that’s one massive miscommunication the governments of the world have failed to clarify. In any pathogenic infection, there is always collateral damage to the host tissue. It certainly is inevitable. Sure, your body’s physiology isn’t stupid and there are mechanisms to minimize this damage, but its definitely present and can take a toll if the virus persists.</p></div>		</li>
