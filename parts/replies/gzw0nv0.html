<p>Or an easy path to economic development for your country, eg. exploration and extraction of natural resources. Manufacturing and industrial processing too, but those are more variable in terms of how much funding they get. Shit that keeps people alive and shit that is needed to build electronics or power engines, that’s where the money goes. </p>
<p>Your general point about trying to track blue whales hits the nail on the head though. Just because we have x/y/z technologies, doesn’t mean it gets applied to the more academic pursuits in marine biology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As the husband of a medical researcher I can assure that you can have research that is relevant to human medicine and still be starving for grants. The last grant that my wife applied for about 8% of applications were funded.</p></div>		</li>
