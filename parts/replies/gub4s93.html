			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel it anytime I see an orchestra or marching band perform live. The combination of vibrational sounds hits me like a tidal wave, and more times than not it brings me to tears. I always get super embarrassed about it and try to cover my emotional outburst. It's intense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the reasons why I prefer live versions of my favorite songs. The orchestral version is just so.....alive. It’s almost like a powerful entity that captures me and dances with me through the song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite intense for me as well. I used to play violin in my high school’s orchestra (we were actually quite good looking back at old recordings of performances).</p>
<p>I remember at the end of the final movement of Tchaikovsky’s 4th Symphony I had a particularly intense reaction. During the final sixtuplets (I think) I had a crazy intense full body sensation.</p>
<p>My vision went black for a moment and I saw stars (which I thought was something only seen in cartoons. there were 9 stars, much like the ones you would see in the night sky ordered in a perfect 3x3 grid). The only sensation I could reasonably compare it to was that of an orgasm, but this was much more intense than that or anything I’ve experienced before or since.</p>
<p>Never mentioned this too anyone since it was quite a bizarre experience, but I do remember that was when I truly fell in love with music (I was 16).</p>
<p>never got a recording of when we played, but here’s the piece <a href="https://youtu.be/A0nlu_cBuJQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/A0nlu_cBuJQ</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;I feel tingles while listening to Lana Del Rey and the Interstellar soundtrack. Is this ASMR?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no. What you're feeling is Frisson, shivers or goosebumps derived from music and/or film.
Please submit any and all Frisson related content to /r/frisson!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>woah. there really is a subreddit for everything.</p>
<p>i thought getting chills when i hear the hardest-hitting part of a song was just an extreme emotional response, since i am an extremely emotional person. apparently it's biological. TIL.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Our emotions are connected to our hypothalamus, so during periods of intense emotion we sometimes experience goosebumps or shivers as they have triggered the production of adrenalin in our blood. </p>
