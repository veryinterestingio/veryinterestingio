			<div class="markdown"><p>While this addresses part of OP's question very well, it is missing something - why are red, yellow, and blue taught as the primary colors in schools? The answer, perhaps unsatisfactorily, is just that it's a historical tradition, and not even a very good one at that! <a href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2010/02/color-wheel-part-1.html" target="_blank">James Gurney's posts on color and the color wheel</a> summarize the history and touch on the fact that some modern painters use 6 or even 10 primary colors in their work. The assignment of primary colors as far as pigment mixing for painting goes is <em>almost</em> but not totally arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We see yellow when both the red and green receptors in our eyes are stimulated. A yellow paint therefore is reflecting light which stimulates both our red and green receptors, which means it is absorbing light which would stimulate our blue receptors. Blue paint does the opposite by absorbing red and green light. But blue is much closer to green than to red on the electromagnetic spectrum, so blue paint is much better at absorbing red light than green. By mixing them together, the blue paint's strong red-absorption cancels out the yellow paint's red-reflection, and the yellow paint's strong blue-absorption cancels out the blue paint's blue-reflection.</p>
<p>Because the blue paint's green-absorption is not as strong as its red-absorption, all that's left after mixing is a surplus of green-reflection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the risk of being off-topic, it's pretty much the same reason why you were probably taught the tongue map (or taste map). They're both heavily tied to sensory perception, which makes them important topics to learn. But if we're being honest, it's hard to teach anything in depth at that age, and something like the senses needs to be heavily simplified. So a lot of curricula decide for the simple (though possibly wrong) explanations.</p>
<p>That said, primary color systems are somewhat 'arbitrary' in that they really require more context, while the tongue map is just plain false.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because it is easier to mix subtractive colors than additive colors. Most kids have access to red/yellow/blue paint, markers, playdough, etc. Not many have access to separate RGB light-sources to make a hand-on demonstration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point made by the previous commenter isn't about subtractive colour being taught and not additive, it's about the fact that the subtractive primary colours are taught as red, yellow, and blue, but that's incorrect and the real subtractive primaries are yellow, cyan, and magenta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do additive mixing easily by spinning something with red, green and blue colours. </p>
<p>I remember in primary school we had to make a cardboard disk, colour in  red, green and blue sections which we then had to stick a pencil trough and spin around in our hands. And we would see the colours vanish to some off-white. </p>
<p>It was quite a striking visual effect.  (I remember painting a spinning top soon after)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically one should think of RGB starting from a blank screen (black) and building up to white, whereas CMYK starts with a blank page (white) and adds up to black.</p></div>		</li>
