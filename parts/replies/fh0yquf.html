			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is exactly where I'm having an issue deciphering the two. Look at your example of SI cover athletes-- this issue of not understanding regression to the mean has caused a false perception. There are countless examples where scientists not understanding regression to the mean has lead to false conclusions or has attempted to invalidate entire bodies of research.</p>
<p>I suppose the issue for me is that if one did understand regression toward the mean in a gambling situation, would that ever work to one's advantage? And if it did, how would that <em>not</em> look like the Gambler's Fallacy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Regression to the Mean cannot help you in gambling. The probability of the next 20 flips coming up heads is exactly the same as the probability of the last 20 flips coming up heads. That is precisely what I meant by Regression to the Mean being an <em>explanatory</em> idea. It is applied after the fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way to use either is in competitive gambling, poker or the like.  You figure out your opponents' superstitions and better read their hands.  Do they believe they are due for a win after several losses and are willing to play on less?  You can exploit that. Or after several wins in a row, sometimes someone can project an image of invincibility.  However, you can expect them to have a standard distribution of hands after several wins (as such on average they will be doing worse than they have been doing, but not worse than average) and should bet expecting them to have such, and exploit those expecting otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another explanation.
20 heads in a row. 20/0. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gamblers fallacy: If we do another 20 rolls I expect 20/20, so I'll see tails now. </p>
</li>
<li>Regression towards the mean: if we do another million rolls I expect to have 500020/500000. Still an absolute+20 heads, but who even cares about such a small number.</li>
