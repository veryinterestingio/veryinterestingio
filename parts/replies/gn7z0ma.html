			<div class="markdown"><p>The ship of Theseus is a thought experiment. You can’t use the ship of Theseus as an answer when it itself needs to be answered first. The ship of Theseus is a better analogy to the question “are you still you?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t happen. Neurogenesis occurs in two places only. The hippocampus, where the new neurons may be involved in forming new memories, and the olfactory bulb, where they are replacing neurons which die due to exposure to the things you smell. Long-term memories aren’t sustained by any sort of neuronal turnover. If any glia people want to come in with a caveat, that’s welcome.</p></div>		</li>
