			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think a potter would agree with you here. A continuously powered wheel requires a different set of skills to a kickwheel, which is different again to a momentum wheel that you drive intermittently with a stick, all of which are very different to the wheels of the early medieval period in Europe which seem to have been used more like a turntable than a wheel. And, of course, pottery was pinch and coil built for much longer than the wheel has been around. It doesn't compare to hammers or axes.</p></div>		</li>
