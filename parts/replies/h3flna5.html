			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a perfect analogy but the best I could think of for an ELI5.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say they are more complicated and sophisticated, but we don't know since it's closed sourced.</p>
<p>What's important to understand is that Linux is not just an operating system for hobbyists and computer enthusiasts, it's a huge project with tons of investors, Microsoft being one of the biggest ones (alongside Intel, Huawei, Samsung, IBM, Google, Nvidia, AMD and others)</p>
<p>It powers most of the internet, used in most smartphones, used by research projects, robotics, manufacturing, scientific research, space exploration, supercomputers etc.</p>
<p>The main reason why not many games are available for it is that most desktop users who play video games use Windows, and because of that for most publishers it's not worth it to pay for a Linux release and continuous support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Microsoft software is not more complex or sophisticated.  If anything, it's the opposite.  Open-source software taken as a whole, is a much more complex ecosystem because of all the people contributing to so many different aspects of it.  Even Microsoft has some full-time open source developers on their payroll.  Most major software companies do.</p>
<p>One thing that Microsoft does do very well is backwards compatibility.  Linux and other open-source projects are reluctant to make breaking changes but they will do it if it makes the software significantly better.  Microsoft pretty much doesn't do this.  If they need new features, their approach is often to add a new, better layer on top of the old while leaving the old software intact.</p>
<p>This is a little hard to ELI5, but maybe I can stretch the language analogy a little.  Many open source projects are willing to change the language they use, even if it makes the old language incomprehensible or confusing to modern speakers.  Think Shakespeare or even Chaucer.  They didn't have a lot of very useful words we use today, like &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;software&quot;, &quot;cheeseburger&quot;, etc.  Reading software using the old language may require a translator to read it to you (emulation) or to write a translated copy (maintenance).</p>
<p>Microsoft will keep the old language around, even if it means that Windows needs to &quot;speak&quot; both languages.  This is responsible for a lot of the bloat that Windows is notorious for.  This is also part of why game developers are more willing to support Windows.  They make most of their money early in the life of the game, but they can make a small amount of money for a long time as long as the game will continue to run on gamers' computers.  Any cost spent on maintaining the game (translating it into new languages) cuts into that margin.  A game built on Windows can almost be left entirely alone, maybe they fix some bugs, but Windows updates won't (usually) break anything.</p>
<p>Neither approach is wrong, just different answers to the same problems.  We want new shiny features in our software, and sometimes that means the languages that our computers speak need to change slightly.</p>
<p>Just an anecdote about how far Microsoft will go to maintain backwards compatibility:  When the first Sim City game came out, there was a bug in Windows that meant a program could &quot;release&quot; a memory location but still continue to read from that memory later.  Sim City accidentally did exactly that. Because of the bug in Windows, this mostly didn't break things, and the game ran fine.  However, when Microsoft fixed their bug it made Sim City crash consistently.  Microsoft &quot;fixed&quot; this by checking Sim City was running on the PC, and reintroducing the wrong behavior only in that special case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why I love Microsoft.</p>
<p>and </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year_problem#Occurrences" target="_blank">Microsoft Excel has, since its earliest versions, incorrectly considered 1900 to be a leap year, and therefore that February 29 comes between February 28 and March 1 of that year. The bug originated from Lotus 1-2-3, and was purposely implemented in Excel for the purpose of backward compatibility.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>This is misleading.  Linux (the kernel) will not make breaking changes if users are affected.  There are many incidents where changes were reverted because they would cause regressions.  However this is to the external API of Linux.  Internally there is no such regulation and everything is up for change.  This can cause problems for out of tree code kernel code, but such code should be in the kernel and if it was then it would be updated to be unaffected by the changes.  The not breaking userland code is a key rule in Linux kernel development .</p>
<p>Userland changes are strictly speaking not Linux though the word is used to mean both the kernel and the wider Linux?GNU system which complicates things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>[Edit: Yes, big money investment can get you some success, in the form of good marketing so there are customers for a revenue-sustainable ecosystem, and paying for talented developers' time, and to fund various industry or creative partnerships. But it's not really true that only proprietary stuff attracts the level of investment in order to be high-quality. (See Vulkan for an example of a high-caliber graphics API, which is all open-source and very high-quality, competitive with DirectX 12 (the proprietary MS graphics API).) And &quot;complexity&quot; is a bad thing in computer software, all else being equal. Simpler code with the same reliability and output is considered better code.]</p>
<p>Not necessarily, no. Lots of private companies spend a lot of money and on-the-clock/on-the-payroll employee time writing code for the Linux kernel, or sponsoring/supporting Linux Oses like Ubuntu. Valve is sponsoring work on Proton/DXVK and so on. Ubuntu is also funded by a multimillionaire (Mark Shuttleworth). [Edit to add: There is a whole industry consortium around the Vulkan graphics API, which is an open competitor to Microsoft's DirectX and Apple's Metal. Vulkan is competitive with both for performance.]</p>
<p>The &quot;complex&quot; example in the previous comment would not be Windows itself, it would be a complex game. Let's say it was a game that used obscure features of, say DirectX, or used them in a really weird or advanced way that 99% of other games don't. (Simple and obvious uses of DirectX (well supported by Proton), or highly optimized and tweaked, but custom and weird uses of DirectX (more likely to be not supported correctly by Proton.)) So, the folks reverse-engineering DirectX for Proton/Linux compatibility haven't run into that uncommon edge case before, and they never had a way to test for that weird use of DirectX before, so they didn't make that work. Someone reports the issue to the Proton/DXVK people and they try to fix it.</p>
<p>(A side note: Complexity in computer code is considered bad, all else being equal. If you could do the same thing simply, it would be better. &quot;Complexity&quot; is literally used as a technical term, meaning a program's difficulty of computation -- more complexity leads to slower execution times. More complexity means worse performance, basically. And a simpler API is easier to use, so any complexity of <em>design</em> that can be streamlined away while still providing what developers want/need is a good thing.)</p>
<p>Compatibility is hard because some of Microsoft's APIs <em>aren't well-documented</em> on Microsoft's part. Proprietary code is meant to throw roadblocks in the way of copycat implementations or competitiors. But being obscure and proprietary does not necessarily mean better or more sophisticated. On the contrary, it lets a bad piece of code go unscrutinized by a wider public, and there is an argument to be had that it is likely to be poorer quality given the same feature set, and more likely to have bugs. Though big bucks do help making advanced features... Eventually it usually gets to the point where implementing a given feature is a well-understood problem among programmers, at which point open source should be able to outshine it on a quality basis, ideally. (As an open-source fan myself.) And private companies are less likely to fund open-source entertainment software like DirectX than Microsoft is, given that MS runs a games platform they can make money off of.</p>
<p>So gaming support does lag on Linux, because there's not much of a stuffy business case to paying developers to do gaming code in open source. (Valve is an exception; They have made some moderately-sized bets on Linux being a viable gaming platform, probably so as to get out from under the MS/Apple taxes... The status quo where gamers have to pay MS or Apple for an OS, just to realistically play games on Valve's Steam platform. Not quite so true now with Proton, though having Windows is still the official way to play virtually all games on Steam.) Also: Graphics hardware support on Linux is a bit relevant to enterprise, sort of, so there is at least some hardware support (drivers and general purpose graphics API code, not alwa) for GPUs paid for by AMD and NVidia and Intel themselves.</p></div>		</li>
