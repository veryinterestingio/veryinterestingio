			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think the company will charge a higher rate. I’m unsure how drone insurance is calculated. I know for a car using your insurance will raise your rates. </p>
<p>Look into actuaries. They are the people who spend their lives calculating how much of a risk someone is so insurance companies can set rates for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using your insurance does not increase your rates. If you cause an accident and get a ticket for it, that will up your rate even though it was a fender bender and you pay for everything yourself. Also, I was involved in a 6 car pile up and the at fault driver's insurance said there was not enough money in the at fault's policy and I would have to claim on my insurance. I used my own insurance with no increase. Its dependent on your driving record and what type of vehicle you have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic math behind this is: If 17 people pay $60 to insure a drone, and one of them looses their drone, they got paid $1020 and spend $1000, so they made $20 bucks. In reality, they have to pay their people and so on, so they'll calculate probably with 20-25 people insuring per drone that is actually lost.</p>
<p>Insurance is more or less a guessing/betting game. The insurer bets you each year you will not loose your drone. If you do, they pay you $940 (netto of the the $1000 you get minus the $60 you paid them as premium), if you don't loose it, you pay them $60 (the premium you already paid).</p>
<p>An insurer knows they will loose some bets, so they bet enough people that, on average, they come out on top. It's a bit like a casino, where the house has an edge. Sure, some people will win while gambling, and some people will call on insurance. Most loose at the casino and do not use the insurance. Except that in insurance, you bet a lot of people, so they loose little, and protect those who need the insurance from a big loss.</p>
<p>In gambling, it's easy to exactly determine the chances for every outcome, so it's also easy to set the house edge. In insurance, you need to factor in many, many things that have no clear rules or chances, and that you need to guess from data gathered on the past. That is where the actuaries /u/Radthereptile mentioned come in. Their job is it to calculate the best guess as to the actual risk so the insurance can set it's rates right. Too high, and people won't want to insure, or go to a competitor. But too low, and you don't make enough money to pay out the claims and your own costs.</p>
<p>Car insurance is the only one I know of that directly includes your behaviour in your rates, by reducing the rates for people driving accident free for a long time and raising it again for people who have an accident, basically saying past accident free driving is a good indicator for a low risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a misconception about how insurers make money. Most insurers want the amount they take in premiums to be roughly the same amount they pay out in claims. In fact in car insurance, which is a very competitive market, many insurers pay out more than they collect. Why? Because the difference between premiums and claims is not how insurers make money.</p>
<p>Insurance companies make money by investing the money they're sitting on. Suppose over a year a company collects a £billion in premiums and pays out a £billion in claims. Imagine all the money they could make investing part of that during the year. This is how banks make money.</p>
<p>In fact insurance policies are basically like a massive shared bank account between you and every other customer. The only difference is you can only withdraw from the account if you suffer a loss, and you may only withdraw the value of that loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the country, there is probably a national insurance claim register, where every insurance company will register the claims you have made. More claims means more scrutiny. May also mean higher rates.</p>
<p>To the point where, let's say you have claimed for several other expensive things recently and then claim your drone was lost at sea, an investigator may start checking your social media for drone images.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's why insurances refuse to cover risks where everyone might trigger at the same time. Pandemics is a recent example.</p>
<p>But most of the time it doesn't happen all at once. Assurances sell policies on many different things, like homes, car, phones, corporate buildings, etc... So, sometimes they don't predict the rates correctly, and sometimes the risks change, but on average they make it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also why pre-existing exclusions exist. For example, disability insurance... a lot of people try to sign up when they know they’re having a baby or surgery, but pre-ex kicks in so people can’t spend $20 to get $5000.</p></div>		</li>
