			<div class="markdown"><p>Also like to point out, a decimal of any repeating number can be described as (the repeating portion)/(a number of 9's equal to the length of repeating digits followed by 0's equal to how far into the decimal it is). So 14.512487487487 = 14512/1000 + .487/999, or 487/999000. This allows for the proof of .9999... being = 1.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was very unwilling to admit that one for a long time.</p>
<p>For anyone unfamiliar, .999... (the nines just keep repeating forever) doesn't merely round up to one. IT IS ONE. They're not roughly the same, they're exactly the same number, just two different ways of writing it.</p>
<p>There's a huge wiki article on this with multiple proofs but the most intuitive proof for me was to realize that .333... (3 repeating) is 1/3 and we all know that 3 thirds is one, thus 3 times .333... = .999.... which therefore is exactly equal to one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one that really clicked for me is that if two numbers A and B aren't equal, then if you subtract them you should get some number C that is not equal to 0.</p>
<p>However, 1 - 0.999... is 0.000... </p>
<p>In other words, there is no &quot;digit&quot; of C that is not 0. Thus, 1 and 0.999... are equal. As are 1.5 and 1.49999... etc. or anything like that.</p>
<hr />
<p>edit: Okay I'm still getting confused replies on this and I have other things I need to do with my day than explain the same handful of concepts over and over.</p>
<p>First: yes this is not the full proof. I didn't write it all out because this is an eli5 post. I'll write the full thing out in a second.</p>
<p>Second, yes this only holds for real numbers. But I don't think its unreasonable to just explain for the reals and not infinitesimals (which are <em>not</em> a generally applicable idea anyway and in no way invalidate results constrained to the reals). I swear some of you have watched a couple youtube videos and maybe a wikipedia article and now think you &quot;know&quot; that certain concepts defined on the reals are &quot;wrong&quot;. Y'all need to learn about some group theory.</p>
<p>Third, limits only apply for functions where you are describing its behavior as it approaches some value. In practice, limits are only used for functions that are ill-defined at <em>exactly</em> the value you are approaching as a limit. If the function is well-defined at that point you can still use limits to demonstrate the idea of them, but in practice you would just plug that number directly into the function and get a result. In either case, 0.999... is a single value and is not &quot;approaching&quot; anything.</p>
<p>Okay, here's the &quot;full&quot; proof (I'm not going all the way back to defining characteristics of real numbers like continuity and all that, but I don't think anyone who would actually know to be pedantic there would argue that what I'm saying is wrong anyway)</p>
<p>Let A = 1 and B = 0.999... (infinitely repeating 9s)</p>
<p>Without loss of generality assume A &gt; B (i.e. the same proof could just be re-written swapping A and B if A &lt; B instead)</p>
<p>Let C = A - B</p>
<p>Since we are assuming A &gt; B, C is some non-zero positive number. Since C &gt; 0, that means there must exist some D such that C &gt;= D &gt; 0. Let D = C up to its first non-zero digit, be 1 at that same location, and 0 elsewhere. This strictly means C &gt;= D. Then D = 0.000... 1000... 0...</p>
<p>Since D &lt;= C, then </p>
<p>D &lt;= A - B</p>
<p>D + B &lt;= A</p>
<p>Plugging the values in we get</p>
<p>0.000...1000...000... + 0.9999... = 1.000...0999...</p>
<p>However</p>
<p>1.000...0999... &lt;= 1 is a contradiction</p>
<p>Thus since C &gt;= D, C + B must also be greater than 1. This is a contradiction. Thus our initial assumption that C is non-zero cannot be true, and so A - B = 0 which means that A = B</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the one-third analogy because it's very accessible.  </p>
<p>The issue is that many people view 0.9999.... as having a &quot;final 9&quot; at the end, just very very many digits in. Because we're not used to thinking in terms of infinity, this sort of thinking is very abstract and counterintuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This proof doesn't work. I'm not saying the result is wrong, but if someone is unsure that 0.999... = 1, they would be just as unsure that 0.333... = 1/3. Thus, your proof is using circular reasoning.</p>
<p>There are alternative proofs that don't require this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always hated the proof .999... = 1. The entire point of writing all those 9s is to show that you're infinitely close without ever touching. It's usually the limitations involved in writing things out in decimal format that are used as proof, which to me is just rounding off errors created by the decimal format. For example, 0.333... is not equal to 1/3. It's a limitation of the system that we can't ever round it to anything but 3 with a remainder, and get infinitely close.</p>
<p>Edit. Ill try once more for all the people trying to correct me. 0.333... is theoretically two different numbers to me. It could be someone writing literally infinite 3s. this is what the number ''should&quot; be and would multiply to 0.999... but it could also be representing a third, because a third will leave another 3 at the end and an increasingly small remainder. This untypably small remainder would be the difference between 0.999... and 1. That's why proofs irk me, they always show the former number, but it needs to exist the other way for high level mathematics to function properly</p>
<p>Sleep wins out xD. Later all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, you can't rationally write out .9 repeating. With .1-.8 repeating, you get 1/9-8/9, so .9 repeating = 9/9 or 1. You could call it an irrational number, but it isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically OP asked how do we know pi never repeats.</p>
<p>It is because pi is irrational. And irrational numbers (eventually) don't repeat their decimals. (A number that ends is just a number that has repeating 0s at the end, ex. 1.5 = 1.50000....)</p>
<p>The first part (pi is irrational) is very hard to proof in an ELI5 way, and I haven't tried. Though perhaphs other commenters can.</p>
<p>The second part (all irraitonals numbers don't repeat) is proved in my comment. Basically I give an algorithm where if you give me a number that <em>does</em> repeat, I will give you the fraction (i.e. ratio) that is equal to that number, and so the number you gave me was rational. This is the same as showing that if a number is irrational then it can't have a repeating decimal (snce if it did we could use our proof above to show it was rational and numbers can't be both rational and irrational at the same time).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think something isn't quite clicking for me with your example. The final result you got is</p>
<p>x = (145124874.874874... - 145124.874874...) / (10^(7) - 10^(4)). </p>
<p>Based on your definition of an irrational number, a rational number is therefore one that can be represented by two integers, right? So we would need to simplify the result you got (cancelling the decimals, as you said) which gives us our integer/integer of </p>
<p>x =  144979750 / 1000</p>
<p>Which <em>should</em> equal 14.5124874874874... But x results in 144979.750, which is not our original number, even if we got the decimal to the right place.</p>
<p>Given that nobody else seems to have pointed it out, I think there's something I'm misunderstanding, wrongly assuming, or maybe there's a step I'm missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about this definition? Rather than pi, I will use the ratio &quot;Phi&quot;, or also known as the golden ratio.</p>
<p>The number goes as such: 1.61803... etc. </p>
<p>How it is calculated demonstrates why it is irrational:</p>
<p>phi = 1 + 1/(1+1/(1+1/1+ ....))). As you can tell, the very definition of that number is an infinite recursion of the same fraction, and you can never run out of adding another &quot;(1+1/...)&quot;, so as you can tell, phi is much easier to understand as irrational.</p></div>		</li>
