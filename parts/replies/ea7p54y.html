			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably a dumb question, but is there a lab test or something you can take to know if you're missing the right mix of ingredients for the cookies? Or is it only you tell the chef (doc) the cookies taste off and they keep altering the ingredients (SSRIs and such) till you say it taste better now? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not as simple as that, depression is more than just too low serotonin levels. Anti depressants are just somewhat correlated with increased motivation and better mood, it doesn't work for some people and a lot of trial and error is needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm bipolar so it's like having a switch you can't (always) control.</p>
<p>Sometimes someone else can flick it.</p>
<p>Like I was stuck in bed one time, and a mate came round to drop something off. He tidied my kitchen and brought me spliffs and coffee in bed. Totally cured.</p>
<p>Well, until next time, but you take what you can get, right?  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May be important to stress that <em>everyone</em> has these sort of moments, but many people are able to correct the recipe, or adjust the ingredients. Some of us continue to have trouble, and some of us might find the changes tolerable, even if others see that we are clearly eating charred cookies or chopped kale.</p>
<p>The drugs aren’t meant to magically make everything all right, but to help us recognize that kale  does not make a decent cookie, and maybe some changes are in order. </p></div>		</li>
