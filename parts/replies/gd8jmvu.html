<p>ETA More info here about how hyphae (the little filaments in the soil that terrestrial fungi use for respiration) perform gas exchange: <a href="https://sciencing.com/mycelia-microbiology-16448.html" target="_blank">https://sciencing.com/mycelia-microbiology-16448.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, yes, but fungi have a much much slower metabolism than animals, they need less oxygen. Many many sea organisms require a source of O2, and they do just fine underwater. </p>
<p>I would argue that the method of distributing spores is just poorly suited to being underwater; fruiting bodies seem 'designed' to make use of wind currents and gravity to distribute spores, and they're limited by their need to attach to a surface.</p></div>		</li>
