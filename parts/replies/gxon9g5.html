<p>So one of the things that might seem weird but it's entirely possible to be overweight, even obese, and be anorexic (losing weight so fast that you become malnourished).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also possible to get plenty to eat and be malnourished from lack of proper nutrients. I can never remember if this story is actually true or not but I heard about a pair of hunters/trappers who starved themselves by eating nothing but rabbit meat for a time. It lacked some essential stuff they needed, and they didn’t supplement by trying to eat any of the organs or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not anorexia though, that is simply called being malnourished. Anorexia is a mental illness with the horrible side effect of starvation and malnutrition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>David Blaine did something similar, and he talked about it on the Joe Rogan podcast. I think it was for like 44 days and it was really fascinating. IIRC after he ended the fast, they had to slowly reintroduce food under doctor supervision because the shock of eating food again could actually kill you after fasting for so long.</p>
<p>Sorry I can't find the link right now but I'm sure you could find it with a bit of looking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Recovering anorexic/bulimic checkin' in.
If you don't eat for a week or more and then suddenly eat as normal again you will get a huge spike in insulin, plus a major electrolyte &quot;reshuffle&quot; (that's the eli5 my doctor gave me)</p>
<p>It can quickly lead to seizures and heart failure. As in, within 10 minutes of eating. </p>
<p>I once didn't eat for 8 days and then ended up binging on junk food. Suddenly my heart was racing faster than ever, I passed out and had a seizure. Unfortunately I was home alone, I was <em>very</em> luckily I survived and woke up to get help. That was a massive wake up call for me. </p>
<p>Fasting has become a very popular thing recently but a lot of people don't realise how dangerous it can be. Also for a fair amount of people it will trigger eating disorder habits. As a teen I was anorexic and could go days and days eating under ~800cals.
As an adult if I do that for more than 5 days my brain switches to an absolute uncontrollable urge to binge, then of course purge because eating so much all at once is horrendous. </p>
<p>Malnutrition or drastic food restriction followed by over eating triggers insulin spikes and electrolyte imbalances which puts a lot of pressure on the heart, and body as a whole. Not fun. </p>
<p>I've been 6 months restriction/binge/purge free this month! I am the heaviest I have ever been but maaaaan I am feeling better for it. I eat a range of colourful healthy foods every day now, and am starting to hear my bodies signals for &quot;hungry&quot; and &quot;full&quot; again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need electrolytes.  Vitamins are desirable but not required.  If you do vitamins you have to ensure they do not cause you to break the fast with additives.  </p>
<p>It's healthier to fast for a few days than calorie restrict at a deficit for weeks on end oddly enough.</p>

<p>Warning: don't just stop eating.  You have to know what you are doing.  A fair amount to learn before doing it for more than a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand what you went through.  The thing about fasts is it begins days or even weeks before you get to the day you stop eating and at least a week after you begin to refeed.  Refeading properly is crucial to avoiding refeading syndrome after more than a few days.</p>
<p>It's more mental than anything else to avoid binging, but it can be done.  I'm not saying you are weak or anything. Not at all. It's hard to suddenly to stop doing something you've done your entire life.</p>
<p>Fasting is not just about fat loss.  The autophagy is beneficial as long as you are not low on fat store or have some health condition.</p></div>		</li>
