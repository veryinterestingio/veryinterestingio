			<div class="markdown"><p>Having read all these replies and watching innumerable videos on &quot;singing for beginners&quot;, here are my questions: <em>Why</em> does it matter how the air is forced over/around/through the vocal cords? <em>How</em> does singing &quot;from the diaphragm&quot; make it easier on your vocal cords? The air all comes from the same place (the lungs).... (I breathe from the diaphragm naturally, so understand the concept); I just don't understand how breathing one way vs. another way impacts the vocal cords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find most “singing for beginner” videos preach a sub-optimal version of diaphragmatic breathing. I mean, all breathing is technically diaphragmatic — if your diaphragm isn’t moving your lungs aren’t taking air in.  Because singing involves a ton of involuntary muscles and requires efficiency (to avoid injury/fatigue), cueing larger muscle groups can help keep those smaller involuntary muscles from getting in the way of said efficiency. For instance, if I’m cueing my pelvic floor to drop and expand to make room for my viscera to move while my diaphragm lowers and allows the fullest possible breath, I’m probably NOT overworking with my scalenes or mastoids which could easily prevent supple, free movement of the larynx. The larynx has to be able to move freely — up and down, tilting, whatever is necessary — to allow full adduction of the cords without excess tension.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m a craftsman not a pedagogue, so this explanation is a combination of what I remember about the physiological reality combined with what I actually find helpful in the moment. A teacher can tell me to engage my crico-arytenoids all day but it does fuck all for my technique, whereas telling me to imagine my airway is springy and supple like marshmallows (or whatever) allows my brain to make necessary adjustments based on my own subjective experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that makes sense: leave room for the vocal cords to move freely. So, basically: don't tense your throat/jaw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All breathing isn't diaphragmic. You have diaphragmic breathing, thoracic breathing (using the intercostal muscles between/beneath the rib cage) and clavicular breathing (expanding lungs by raising your shoulders).</p>
<p>You'll learn about these methods of breathing in both first aid and security training (for different reasons).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Speech and language pathologist here.  First off to make what I'm gonna say abit more relatable: what is the voice (and singning)?  The voice is mainly air - air that sounds. Voice is <em>not</em> the result of muscle activity primarily. Of course you need to close the vocal folds  towards each other with muscles (adduction, using lateral cricoarytenoid  and inter arytenoids) to create the possibility for them too vibrate , however this muscle work  isn't what <em>causes</em> the vocal folds to vibrate: again it is the <em>air</em> from below the air pipe that causes them to vibrate!  </p>
<p>This means that the <em>air pressure</em> from below in the air pipe has to reach a certain  threshold value to separate the closed vocal folds - preferably <em>steady</em> airflow to maintain periodicity in the vibration. When this happens and the air makes the vocal folds separate from each other, this causes in return a negative pressure (due to the internal structure -histology- of the vocal folds) which in return cause the vocal folds get sucked <em>back towards each other</em> until they make a contact - which creates the sound. Voilà, a full period of vocal fold closure and opening.  </p>
<p>Why then is it important how air is being pushed on the vocal folds from below? As said, if the airflow is steady, the vibrations (voice-periodicity) becomes steady. Using the abdominal muscles (mainly abdominis rectus, transversus and obliquus) is the most efficient way for us to both increase pressure <em>and</em> keep the airflow steady!  </p>
<p>This steady and strong airflow which we achieve most effectively with deep-breathing  meaning that the vocal folds don't need to compensate for insufficiencies in the airflow. They don't need to use additional muscle work to compensate - which they shouldn't, since voice is air - not muscle work.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually not sure that it's that easy.  Trying to activate the right muscles while *not* tensing your stomach, using your tongue muscle, constricting your throat, jutting your chin, or any number of other defense-mechanisms requires a lot of practice and really needs a trainer.  (One of my personal problems is tightening my brow)  I have some training, but really, it's just enough to know that this is not something I will ever make money with :)</p>
<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> Nice description about maintaining the expansion against the exhale.  My trainer had me doing the 12 Days of Christmas on a single breath.  Never quite made 12.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh absolutely — it’s not easy, but at the same time really good singing is <em>simple</em> in the way that true efficiency is simple. Getting there is another story, and a good teacher is indispensable in that process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I know the prevalent image is of the fat lady with the horns, but we are much more similar to high level golfers in terms of the immense control over fine motor skills and efficiency and precision of the production of power.  Plus art. I’ve sung for a lot of people who had no exposure to live opera — my parents are solidly blue collar, most of my family is lower middle class, I’ve sung at events for local businesses who want to support art but don’t know much about it — and invariably people come up to me and say “I didn’t understand it, but it made me feel something in a way I didn’t know a voice could do”. It’s just different when it’s live, like listening to a recording of a pipe organ or a drum corps vs feeling it vibrate through your whole body in person.</p></div>		</li>
