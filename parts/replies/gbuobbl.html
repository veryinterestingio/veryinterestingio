			<div class="markdown"><p>Mummies were so plentiful, they were ground down and sold as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummia" target="_blank">nostrums in the 1100s</a>. They were also used to make paint, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy_brown" target="_blank">mummy brown</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Misremembered the dates for the medicines with the paint. The paint was around in Victorian times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suspect this would be sped up significantly also.  Once you know something is possible it lends to figuring out how it is possible.  And the application may be completely novel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point.  By cutting open a CPU (and destroying several in the process), they'd be able to see that it has visible structures right down to the resolution limit of their microscopes and beyond.  Which might prompt the thought, &quot;whoever built this had to be able to see what they were doing.  There must be a better kind of microscope.&quot;</p>
<p>... but the secret of the electron microscope follows from the invention of the television, and that technology is not in an iPhone.  Give them an iPhone plus a tube TV, though, and they'd jump up two tech levels in a decade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 1920 it was totally possible to send a beam of electrons. The TV was invented in the late 1920s, after all. CRTs have been around since the late 1800s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube#History" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube#History</a></p>
<p>The first electron microscopes were created in 1931. It is entirely plausible that given a pressing need, one could have been invented years earlier. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope#History" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_microscope#History</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to that element of wanting to know: &quot;We have here nearly impossible feat of technology and it could open so many doors to us if we just had better microscopes.&quot; I'd think that then they would have pointed some serious research to electron microscopy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Issue is <em>knowing</em> they need better microscopes. The device is non-functional, all they know is that these particular parts have <em>some</em> important purpose (just going by the number and nature of its connections), but they don't know what or how. Likely they'd destroy the integrated circuit trying to extract it from the packaging because they don't know what's there. Even if they did extract it intact... pretty sure it would just look like a chip of solid metal to them. It might have a surface pattern that could tip them off to the micro-structure, but I doubt it. At least not without being treated first (and they'd have to know how to treat it).</p></div>		</li>
