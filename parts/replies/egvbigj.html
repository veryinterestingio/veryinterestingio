			<div class="markdown"><p>There is psychological research that suggests people in cities are more open to strangers and more inclined to help people they don't know ... up to a certain threshold (300,000 people? i forgot). Beyond that it becomes too much. People are overwhelmed by the amount of potential social interactions and tend to withdraw.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I intentionally avoid people in my god forsaken town of 10K souls, and yet I still find everything I do/wear get talked about by people I have never spoken to.</p>
<p>People that know me and are more involved in village life find themselves bombarded with questions whenever they go to the market or stuff.</p>
<p>I wish I lived in a city where I could be invisible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has always been a theory of mine. I live in a city that’s right about at the threshold you used as an example. We’re generally outgoing to everyone including tourists.</p>
<p>Whenever I go to NYC, for example, the people don’t willing volunteer info or to just say hi. If they did, it would be exhausting. However, I’ve found that if I ask someone for directions or information they’re generally happy to help. I think it’s just rationing your human interactions as a matter of self-preservation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its more by region than country the divide would in theory be further south closer around the southern portion of north America</p>
<p>also keep in mind the vast majority of north Americans are of European descent as they settled and immigrated over the last few hundred years, basically starting a civilization on a new game+ file staring out with multiple millennia worth of cultural and technical development of primarily western Europeans</p></div>		</li>
