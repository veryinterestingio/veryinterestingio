			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question, and I'll share what I know as an amateur blacksmith less a metallurgist. </p>
<p>TLDR: Yes the oxidation should slow down if it's in contact with virgin material if an alloy mixed for rust inhibition, similar to aluminum or titanium.</p>
<p>Steel alloys are typically blends of materials and these days they tend to be very consistent. The different elements attached together at specific places and in different amounts depending on the alloy. When the billet is formed, the impurities, excess of some ingredients, are pushed out and you're left with the consistent block of raw stock. </p>
<p>This is in contrast to the smelting of yore. I have run Japanese, Viking, and Archimedean furnaces and the alloy, or bloom, is inconsistent and all over the place. So you might get iron, mild, high carbon, and tool steel all in a little block of 5&quot;x5&quot;. This is actually very useful for blacksmithing but not for many industrial processes. </p>
<p>Your success depends is on how you make your stuff. IF you just mill (cut into) billet, or block, material, you're going to have a consistent material across every surface. With SS, that's probably good enough if you can ignore some surface discoloration and oxidation. Carbide cutting tools are so hard, I doubt they really deposit material and tend to fail completely or are replaced before failure. And the chromium is something like 30% of the mix. </p>
<p>IF you forge the SS, be it drop forging with dies or hand forging, you can expect a change in raw material since it's being worked in a big way, at least on the surface. You have to work the face to remove the materials that could cause problems, physically removing material or chemically (passivation) though mostly for customer satisfaction. These parts are like your cold/hot drip forged wrenches and tools and hand forged knives.</p>
<p>Not alot of people I'm familiar with hand forged SS, but I've seen lots of eating utensils made from it and you have to treat it like cast iron because there's lots of iron from the anvil and hammer worked into the surface. Typically the utensil is polished as best as possible but has to be treated like it isn't SS. Even SS knives are testy, mostly because they are thin enough you can't loose too much material without failure. But again, probably the biggest thing is customer satisfaction, no one wants a rusty fork or knife.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm sure I'm missing out on lots of information, but I've been thinking about this alot since seeing the question, and I think chromium oxide is less important than passivation and surface treatment. I understand SS is SS because of chromium, vandium, molybdenum etc additives, but the surface treatment is why it doesn't rust visibly even if it is oxidising. It's the presence of elemental iron on the surface and in the matrix that's more the issue that what you tried to mixed it with doing it's job. </p>
<p>I guess I think about the exceptions to the rule too. Straight carbon steel will stain less if it's clean, atmospheric oxygen alone isn't enough to make it severely oxidise in a time frame meaningful to most humans. Plenty of hand tools look great if hung in clean shop even for a hundred years. I mean, the Mastermyr chest had working drill bits and files 1000 years after being forgotten in a bog. Even here in nasty northern Minnesota, mild steel hand rails 60 years old are going strong even covered in salty slop if used in the summer. </p>
<p>I see the point of the additives helping in more extreme environments, but I still feel like even in those applications, it's just buying time since the iron content will still go eventually, and we don't make stuff as thick as we used to, looking at you pre victorian wrought iron anchor chain. </p>
<p>I'm just interested in blacksmithing and simple machining, SS hasn't really crossed my path much other than talking to other smiths about forging it, which is generally a bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is not a lot to think about: it's all about the surface. Is the surface protected with a coating of oil, paint, plastic (powder coating) or etc. Is the stainless mirror polished (exceptional corrosion resistance) vs grain finish (weak resistance). Has the surface been scratched, if so how deep? And what temperature is it stored at (hot = fast corrosion, cold = slow corrosion).  </p>
<p>To clarify Stainless Steel &quot;rusting&quot;. The primary ingredients of Stainless Steel are iron&amp;carbon, chromium and nickel. A common grade of Stainless used to be called 18-4 which references its chromium-nickel content. Higher grades of Stainless also have molybdenum and sometimes vanadium too but these are exotic alloys for performance. &quot;Rust&quot; is iron oxide (oxised iron), and Stainless Steel doesn't give up free iron particles to Rust without a fight. If you really want to understand the chemistry of Stainless you should understand the crystal structures of austenite and martensite.  </p>
<p>I don't know much about blacksmithing but I understand why you wouldn't blacksmith with Stainless. Stainless is a pain to weld because of its thermal properties. It doesn't conduct heat much so parts where you've welded will warp if you don't properly sequence your fabrication. Stainless is also be a pain to Machine because it's so hard.</p></div>		</li>
