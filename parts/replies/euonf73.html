			<div class="markdown"><p>There was also a lens in the front of the zapper barrel that focused the light on a sensor, so it was more accurate.  But yes, there would have been a very distinct signal indicating a hit as the gun detected dark light dark in a particular timing. </p>
<p>Incidentally, I was able to clearly see the screen going dark and then displaying only the duck frozen at the spot where the trigger was pulled.  I wasn't even aware that some people couldn't see that happen, if that's true.  It didn't even seem to be happening all that fast, if my memory is correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Once you know how it works, you can definitely see it happen with your own two eyes. It's not all that fast. Otherwise you just kinda think it's a part of the game to make more &quot;impact&quot; from the gunshot. You can't, however, discern one duck from another, you just briefly see the squares flash on screen then go away.</p></div>		</li>
