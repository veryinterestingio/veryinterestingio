			<div class="markdown"><p>If you like these and want more I highly highly recommend the book, The outer limits of reason by Noson Yanofsky. It‚Äôs one of my favorites and it dives into not just math but linguistic paradoxes, philosophical paradoxes, and all the the hard problems. It has some very technical chapters and some that a toddler could understand and it is genuinely pretty funny (although I‚Äôm a huge nerd so my opinion may be biased).</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are more numbers between 0 and 1 (The Real Numbers) than there are Integer numbers (The Natural Numbers).</p>
<p>They're both infinitely large, but between 0 and 1 is a larger infinity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well what really bakes my noodle is whether there is any infinity of a size between those two infinities.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here we get very quickly to the OPs &quot;unsolved math problems&quot; question.
the technical term for &quot;size of infinity&quot; is cardinality.
so the question is, is there any set of numbers with cardinality between the cardinality of the integers and the cardinality of the real numbers?
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cantor believed the answer is no but Goedel believed the answer is yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not accurate. How do you define an uncountably infinite sum? The correct answer is that such a sum is not defined (at least not conventionally; you could of course define any uncountable sum to be infinity. However, that is not a useful definition).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A hotel opens with infinite numbered rooms, numbered starting with room 1 and counting upward infinitely, through the whole numbers.</p>
<p>An infinite number of guests, each numbered 1 and counting upward in the same way shows up.</p>
<p>Can the hotel assign a room to every guest? Sure, each guest gets the room number corresponding to their guest number.</p>
<p>But what if another infinite number of guests show up, also with the same numbers 1 and counting upward? Can the hotel assign rooms then?</p>
<p>As it turns out, yes. Just ask the first infinite group to stay in the room number double their guest number, and then ask the second infinite group to stay in the room number double their guest number minus one.</p>
<p>If a group of guests with infinite positive and negative integers shows up, that hotel can still accommodate them, too, with another rule set. Those groups, whose numbers can be mapped to whole numbers, are known as countably infinite.</p>
<p>And even if a countably infinite set of countably infinite groups of guests come to that hotel, that hotel can accommodate every guest in every group with their own unique rooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the example i like use to try and explain the difference between countably and uncountably infinite to my friends who've never studied it (source have a B.S in Mathematics).
Its one of my favorite concepts in Mathematics and im  super eager to explain it to people when the opportunity to see if i can make them go &quot;...woah&quot;
Cause trying to explain &quot;for ever number in the set you can cardinally assign it to a Natural Number&quot;  tends to loose people fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps, infinity isn't a number. It's basically the concept of something getting so big that we can't keep track of it. So maybe a &quot;bigger&quot; infinity is less useful to think about than a &quot;faster&quot; infinity. Like if you add every whole number, you'll get to infinity. But if you add up the square of every whole number, you'll get there a lot faster. </p>
<p>For me as an engineer, I mostly think of infinity as &quot;what happens with this function as you plug really really big numbers into it?&quot;</p>
<p>In the case of a simple equation like y = X, you just get a really really big number. For something like y = 1/X, you get a really small number, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speed of divergence (limits) is a different concept than the size (cardinality) of an infinity. Consider this thought experiment: I start at 0, and start counting up the positive integers in order. No matter how wildly large your number is, given enough time I will get there. Now consider I want to do the same for decimal points between 0 and 1. So I start with 0.1, then 0.01, then 0.001 and each time I keep adding another 0 before the 1. I'll never even get through all the 0's, since I can always add another, so if you pick 0.2 no matter how long I spend I'll just be constantly adding 0's before the 1 forever so I'll never reach it.</p>
<p>In the specific example you gave, it turns out that the amount of squares is exactly the same as the amount of whole numbers. Consider that if you take all the squares and apply the square root, you get exactly the set of whole numbers, so they must be the same size.</p></div>		</li>
