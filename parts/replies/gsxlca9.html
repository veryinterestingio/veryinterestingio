			<div class="markdown"><p>Fwiw, not all kosher wine is flash pasteurized (Mevushal).</p>
<p>There's actually a market for fine kosher wine, but most of it isn't Mevushal.  The rub of that is if a non-Jew opens/serves the wine it's no longer kosher.  Mevushal wines, however, are unaffected if a non-Jew serves it, which is why they're more commonly served at restaurants and events.</p>
<p>Separately, a lot of kosher, Mevushal wine--especially the most well-known brands--aren't made from thel vitis vinifera grape varieties we usually associate with wine like Chardonnay, Cab, Pinot Noir, etc.  They're often made from vitis labrusca grapes that taste more... like... what we think of when we think about grape flavoring.  Stuff like Concord, Catawba, Niagara.  And a lot of people think that tastes like shit compares to the wine they'd usually drink instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peanut oil definitely varies by region and quality - refined peanut oil at my local store is a little more pricey than other typical cooking oils (vegetable oil, pure/refined olive oil, etc), but not crazy expensive.  The nice unrefined peanut oil is pricey, but again, you wouldn't be using that to cook, you'd be using a little drizzle to finish off a dish - like you would with extra virgin olive oil or a nice toasted sesame oil, etc.</p>
<p>I've personally never cooked with almond oil (or even noticed it on a shelf!), but a quick look online shows that it is significantly more expensive than other cooking oils.  Interesting.  Maybe it's on a big trend? Avocado oil was way expensive when it was trendy a few years ago, and now the price locally has dropped so that it's only a couple bucks higher than other cooking oils, though still fairly pricey.</p>
<p>Personally, I always keep a couple of cheap oils on hand, picking up whatever's on sale at the store when I need to refresh (usually vegetable, canola, safflower, or non-virgin olive; coconut is also nice to keep a jar of), and I keep a couple of nicer finishing oils in my cupboard (extra-virgin, sesame, pumpkin seed, hazelnut, etc.) for dishes that could use a little extra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always used unrefined peanut oil to cook with. Simply because publix and such never seemed to have refined. So usually 13-14 dollars a bottle. Picking up on sale doesn't really work for me. Ill never really finish a bottle before they expire.</p>
<p>I live in a condo, so need to minimize smoke, so I go for the highest smoke/neutral I could. I guess I should switch to canola.</p></div>		</li>
