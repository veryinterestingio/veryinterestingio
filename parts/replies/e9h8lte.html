			<div class="markdown"><p>Bosch's was also crappy. It would constantly fire on the jobsite. I had it fire on me 4 times the first day got it. Then they recalled them because it was too sensitive for dust/humidity.</p>
<p>Basically if the house was being drywalled, it was the rainy season, or demo was going on...the stop would fire. It was more dangerous</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I'm not out to ruin Bosch's reputation, but that was the first generation. I know they released a second-gen, but I have not tried it or looked into it at all. I'm sure any issues have been solved by now. I like Bosch overall, they make quality products. But every company has &quot;their product&quot; and Bosch saws are high up on the list of good ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sawstop guy tried to license his tech to all the major tablesaw manufacturers and no one bit, so he founded a company and starting making saws. Then the companies that refused to work out a deal with him started making their own saws, so he defended his patent aggressively. I, for one, don’t blame him. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It does require replacement of the braking cartridge ($90+/-) and the blade.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it doesn't. It destroys the blade and requires replacement of the brake cartridge. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>No, it wasn't. It was invented in 1999 by Steven Gass, a patent lawyer who was also a woodworker. He's from Oregon and has no affiliation with the University of Idaho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not correct.  The stop cartridge and blade are destroyed. Both are replaceable.  It's a pretty amazing system.  </p>
<p>Our shop blows a cartridge about once a year. Not due to fingers but rather other mistakes like forgetting to disable the safety system when cutting certain materials that are prone to deploying the stop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. If we were really explaining it to a five year old I'd have left it at conductivity. </p>
<p>Although you could just say the saw blade works like a touchscreen. If a finger gets close the saw reacts, just like the display of a phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It uses radio transmissions to power the pen and sense the location. The powering the pen part is important for the pressure sensitivity and tilt detection. It's basically a grid of wires that can both send power/allow the pen to tell where it is as well as receive the information back from the stylus. (Older versions required the pen to be battery powered).</p>
<p>There's other type of graphics tablets though, some capacitance, some resistance, some optical and some older cases even used an array of microphones and a speaker in the drawing pen.</p>
<p>There's also tabletted that combine the radio/magnetic part that works with pens with a capacitance based touchscreen that works with fingers, so you can zoom in or move the design on the tablet.</p></div>		</li>
