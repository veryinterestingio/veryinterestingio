			<div class="markdown"><p>Splices are the strongest ways of joining ropes (though they aren't usually considered knots), but they still weaken the rope. Anything other than pure rope in a straight line is going to be weaker, which is what the person you replied to is saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't aware there was a &quot;popular belief&quot; about the strength of ropes that get tied in knots.  Seems more like just something people don't think about in general, unless there is some anti-science knot group out there that won't let experts tell them that knots aren't actually flat.</p></div>		</li>
