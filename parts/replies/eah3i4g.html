			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just 'not' horny.  It can swing all the way to repulsed by the idea of it.  But that goes away pretty fast.  Ever seen the joke about dudes busting a nut while masturbating and then closing out browser windows and feeling disgusted?  That post coital mental state is what causes that feeling.  It is very much a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different for everyone. Some say epiphany levels of clairty where everything jusr kinda clicks, decisions become easier remember things easier etc etc</p>
<p>Some people become utterly repulsed by sex like it becomes a thing you need tl get away from like you hate that you did it at all. Even if you are absolutely adoringly in love with the other person</p>
<p>Personally theres a sudden cessation of sensory input. Then weirdly enough my brain for lack of a better phrase, takes refuge in conversations ive had recently. And i play out how they coulda gone different. And by the end of it for better or worse i feel reassured in who i am. All in all it happens in a fraction of a second, but that hormone cocktail does weird things to your brain. Sometimes foe better, sometimes for worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s almost like a reset button. Pretty much any stress, anger, or really anything kinda goes away. And after you have a really clear state of mind. It’s why a lot of guys will pop one off before doing anything important, like before a test, job interview, or a simple decision.</p></div>		</li>
