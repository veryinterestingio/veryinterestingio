			<div class="markdown"><p>My question as well. Is it past the break-even point? Or does produce more pollution and require more energy than what some other fuel (plus treating the stock if that is something that would need to be done anyway) would anyway? </p>
<p>I know when alternative production methods are in their infancy, that can be expected, so if that is the case currently, what are the prospects of it being cost/pollution effective?</p></div>		</li>
