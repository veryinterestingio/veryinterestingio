			<div class="markdown"><p>And yes folks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3ruxchwaY&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank">crows</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFXU7o0fYII&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank">ravens</a> can talk.</p>
<p>Crows are also known to be able to pass on or at least each other crows something new.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/animals-ecology/crows-social-skills-recognize-human-faces-0423532/" target="_blank">The researchers returned to the park with their masks on. The birds present at the original trapping remembered which masks corresponded to capturing—and they passed this information to their young and other crows. All the crows responded to the sight of a researcher wearing a trapping mask by immediately mobbing the individual and shrieking.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Octopodes are AFAIK not quite comparable to dolphins, elephants, apes, corvids or parrots. They are just really good at solving puzzles, but I don't think they handle it in the abstract way the others can do.</p></div>		</li>
