			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I take medication and I used to dry-swallow them a lot, after a while whenever I had a pill in my hand I’d salivate. I stopped doing when I learned it could cause issues and the reaction disappeared pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's still classical conditioning. It's a conditioned response directly activated by the intended stimuli. </p>
<p>You could make the conditioning last longer by continuing the sequence of bell&gt;darkness but when the process is broken you'll immediately start to lose the conditioning just like any other unwarranted stimuli response.</p>
<p>Priming is a bit different. Priming is where a reaction to a stimulus alters the reaction/behavior/thoughts to stimuli in the future. It's more like if you just got angry at someone from an argument then meet a stranger, your primed negative feelings from the first altercation will supposedly make you feel more negative to that stranger than you otherwise would. Whereas if you just had a great day and were to meet that same stranger, you'd be more likely to view them positiviely because of your happy priming from your great day. </p>
<p>Priming is more mood thoughts and behavior being <em>tainted</em> from something previous. Priming just kinda steers you towards acting differently. It doesn't achieve a particular conditioned response, and its effectiveness is debated. </p>
<p>Conditioning is achieving a specific conditioned response to a particular stimuli that was not present before. Like pavlovs dog. Ring a bell then give the dog food, the dog learns to expect food when he hears a bell and starts to salivate as a response. Before conditioning, the dog wouldn't salivate from hearing a bell. After conditioning, the dog will salivate from hearing the bell. The salivating is the conditioned response to hearing the bell.  This conditioning WILL fade over time if the bell is rung and food is not presented, until the conditioned response no longer happens after the stimuli of the bell - just like the example above with a bell&gt;dark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conditioning doesn't have to be permanent. Even the famous dogs in Pavlov's experiments stopped salivating at the sound of a bell that didn't result in food, after &quot;a while&quot;.</p>
<p>Though, that &quot;a while&quot; can be a long time, depending on a few factors such as how strongly the two stimuli were paired, and how often the conditioned stimuli is presented without the unconditioned stimuli. Ie, how often a bell is chimed without presenting dog food. Or how often a white rat is presented without the corresponding hammer striking metal directly behind the baby's head (even after a month, while the response was lessened, the response was still there).</p>
<p>But, this does contradict Jasonxhx's statement that &quot;it doesn't last long&quot;; it <em>can</em> last a lifetime if the two stimuli are paired with enough intensity, and if the paired stimuli are presented every so often afterwards. Ie, it only took a few more of the original procedures to get the baby to start crying at the sight of the mouse again.</p>
<p>Search this page <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-psychology/chapter/reading-processes-in-classical-conditioning/" target="_blank"><a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-psychology/chapter/reading-processes-in-classical-conditioning/" target="_blank">https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wmopen-psychology/chapter/reading-processes-in-classical-conditioning/</a></a> for the following quote and read the surrounding text for more information on extinction: &quot;The behavior of Pavlov’s dogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov called spontaneous recovery&quot;</p>
<p>As for priming: that tends to deal with pairing high-level concepts, whereas conditioning deals with pairing simple perceptual stimuli to natural biological responses. Priming might pair &quot;banana&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; for example, such that if you see the word &quot;banana&quot; you'll be more likely to select the word &quot;yellow&quot; from a list more quickly, even if a banana is never shown and even if the colour is never shown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off of this, if you were to hear the ding, but the lights stopped turning off over and over, the effect would also go away. It’s necessary for the thing to actually happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can’t really do it by thinking about it.</p>
<p>The thought itself would need to be an extremely strong stimulus and/or elicit an extremely powerful emotion. The intensity of that thought is also tied to how much your concentrating on it.</p>
<p>This all comes down to causing extinction of the trained response faster than if it was a physical stimulus eliciting the trained the response.</p></div>		</li>
