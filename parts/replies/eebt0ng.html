			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, Geisha are still “a thing”.  Their numbers have decreased tremendously, but they are still around and have active associations you can contact to rent them for events and stuff.  Maiko in Kyoto are a popular tourist attraction, assuming you can tell them from the tourists dressed as them.  You can check out lots of pictures of this collar, neck, and makeup arrangement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but they’re not at all like they were in the past. I’m assuming geishas of today choose to become so, geishas of the past were usually sold to geisha houses as children by poor parents and never had their own homes to go to. They worked to pay off their purchase price and were not allowed to love. It’s more like a tourist attraction these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not entirely certain how that has to do with their makeup and clothing though.  My point was more you can go to Japan and see the features you mentioned first hand today, they aren’t just historical records.  While the industry has changed, it has been contiguous and the traditions followed today are largely the same as in the past, especially appearance.</p></div>		</li>
