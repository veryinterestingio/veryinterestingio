			<div class="markdown"><p>I only partially agree with you. It's almost always a mix of both genetics and environmental cues. Hence if you transplant Northern Hemisphere deciduous trees to the Southern Hemisphere, they still lose their leaves as winter approaches. They lose their leaves at different points towards winter, because of their genes are responding to different environmental cues.</p></div>		</li>

Lots of things appear highly genetically determined when you have a narrow band of environmental variations, but look very environmentally determined when you have more extreme environmental variation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure these people actually disagree. It's usually a given that living things respond to their environment, so when people say it's genetic they don't mean the tree is going to drop its leaves the same time no matter what's going on around it. The tree doesn't have a clock so it needs some environmental cue for that to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can see this with every species of plant, too. The exact time plants come out and the time they bud depends on a variety of factors: the species (aka the genes), the temperature of the air and/or soil, and the light. Everything has to be right for them to leaf out/sprout or go dormant. This is why people trying to grow vegetables or certain flowers in colder zones have to start their seedlings indoors - the 'growing season' isn't as long as wherever the plant is native.</p>
<p><strong>As far as the OP's question, a deciduous tree that is hardy enough to survive the winter (and the actual transplant) will go dormant so long as it gets the right environmental triggers. It doesn't matter if it previously never got those triggers because it lived in Florida.</strong></p>
<p>An easy group of plants to see this with is houseplants. People often don't know the right 'triggers' to get their plant to bloom (cactus, succulents, orchids, etc.), and their plant will go <em>years</em> without blooming. Then, suddenly the person moves the plant to a better location/starts watering it correctly/gives it fertilizer/etc. and it blooms. It doesn't matter the plant never bloomed before.</p>
<p>To take a specific example, the Christmas Cactus requires the following conditions to bloom: 12 hours of darkness for 1-2 months, temperatures between 50-55 F (don't let it freeze!), little water (basically, you're faking the winter of its native, tropical land). During this time, buds begin to form. Once they form, you take it inside to a draft-free, indirectly sunny area. Slowly increase the watering and make sure it has humidity. Mess any of these things up, and your plant won't bloom. On the other hand, if you know how to make it bloom, you can make it bloom whenever you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that raw distance isn't necessarily a good measure of weather-similarity, especially if we're talking about stuff near the various whorls of the polar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream" target="_blank">jet stream</a> and mountainous or coastal terrain.</p>
<p>For example, the distance between the equator and New York is less than the distance between the equator and Paris, but New York is still colder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what would happen if someone transplanted a tree from Australia to a similar climate in the US even though our seasons would be opposite (winter when they have summer)?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presuming you could actually do the transplant without killing the tree in the first place, the tree would simply adjust to the season. If you did something extreme - like put a tree while it was flowering right into the dead of winter, the shock might kill it. But that would be a dumb time to transplant it anyway - typically you want to transplant plants either right before they form buds or soon after they go dormant. So, if you transplanted a tree in February (Australian fall/American spring), it would be fine. It *might* take a year to get back in sync, though, and have a lackluster season in the meantime. Now, going the other way (spring to fall) would be harder, you're forcing it to skip a season of growth, so there's probably more potential that it won't make it. I'd guess you'd need to really need to watch it and give if it food to survive the long winter you're forcing it through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  Any idea if this has been done before?  When that other person said that (at least in part) the growth season is genetic, that was pretty crazy.  Never heard of that before.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info.</p></div>		</li>
