<p>It was funny because they clearly wanted to keep it simple, but they still dole out an S+ or O-.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my school in Brazil, we had</p>
<p>“A” = atingiu [os objetivos] = achieved [the goals]</p>
<p>“AP” = atingiu parcialmente [os objetivos] = partially achieved [the goals]</p>
<p>“NA” = não atingiu [os objetivos] = did not achieve [the goals]  </p>
<p>Each teacher would either give one grade to the whole quarter, or would make a list of concepts we were expected to understand and graded each of them. It was just for feedback, though, since at the end of every year the teachers would all form a council, go over each student, and vote on whether they think the student should be promoted to the next year.</p></div>		</li>
