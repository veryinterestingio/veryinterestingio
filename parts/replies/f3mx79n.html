<p>&quot;A new, dodecagonal (12-sided) design of coin was introduced on 28 March 2017&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find them quite convenient though. Every single coin we have feels very different to the others. You could pick up a 50p and you'll never confuse it with a 20p. Same with a 2p and a 10p or a 1p and a 5p. Those are the closest ones we have. If you're confusing a 5p with a Â£2 something is going really wrong. In comparison I find myself looking at euros/cents more closely, though I concede I'm not as used to the currency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The old pound coins were absolute bastards. Have memories of trying to pay for parking and it took me 5 minutes due to rejected possible counterfeits. Makes you wonder why the banks weren't proactively trying to take them out of circulation.</p>
<p>Thanks God for the new coin design and parking apps.</p>
<p>The euro coins have the issue with high number of varying designs between the different issuers. And of course our lack of familiarity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nah, 50 pence is slightly awkward, 20 pence I really don't notice isn't round, pound coin is round enough not to matter.</p>
<p>Edit - take your upvote and run before I start throwing shurikens :-)</p></div>		</li>
