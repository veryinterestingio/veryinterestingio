			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be, but I'm not sure. As a kid I got car sick easily (but I think that's because of the smell of the car). For awhile (like 10+ years) I haven't been in cars regularly and somehow it is a bit better now. So I'm not sure whether it is acclimatisation through repeated experience or just the getting older part that explains it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Likely both do. Vestibular system, commonly theorised thought to be responsible for motion sickness, declines with age, especially past forty, which could explain the reduced sensitivity alongside repeated experience.</p></div>		</li>
