			<div class="markdown"><p>Tremors just suck period but good explanation though I'm wondering as an adult if he would have said &quot;we have no idea, just live with it. If your family really wants to know they can check for some stuff in an autopsy&quot;; that tends to be most neurological answers I find. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense and fair point. I will say though at least you are lucky enough to have treatment options unlike about 40% of tremor suffers.  </p>
<p>Edit: Because I'm getting positive votes I should expand here a little in case other people are interested in why I don't think the OP's response is without warrant.  While it sounds &quot;benign&quot; it's really just a recently approved (like 2016) non-surgical thalamotomy which is basically &quot;we destroy part of the brain and hope it works; if bad things happen non-recoverable&quot; whereas (just my non-medical opinion a person who suffers from tremors) I feel most people, this guy included, would be better off trying deep brain stimulation (DBS) first (as it's not destructive) and only go with a thalamotomy (or it's ultrasound equiv) if that fails given the downsize risk is lower.  A thalamotomy is still a thalamotomy and while sure you eliminate the surgical side effects doing it via ultrasound it doesn't change the tissue destruction which can have it's own set of issues which is a reason why DBS is still the preferred second or third line treatment (with a thalamotomy being second to last); I see no reason why focused ultrasound will change this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m pretty young so I’m scared of it becoming worse in the future. Don’t really know what’s causing my tremors but it’s nice to know that there’s treatment for similar problems </p></div>		</li>
