			<div class="markdown"><p>In Iraq circa 2005 or so, our supply lines weren't really as reliable as they were later on. If you broke a boot back then, you better hope you're either Shaquille O'Neill or a 14 year old schoolgirl, cuz those were the only fucking sizes they had in the PX. Good luck getting them from your company, either. You'd have to hike to outer Mongolia and fight the ghost of Genghis Khan to steal a pair of size 10.5 or 11 boots back then. </p>
<p>It was so bad, I wore the same pair of boots for two years, 16 months of that in theater. They looked fuckin' horrible, but nobody gave me any trouble about it. Went to the promotion board with them and my 1sg looked at 'em and was like, &quot;Jesus fuck, SPC T_WRX! Those things look awful! Size 11, huh?&quot; and he didn't say a word else. Wasn't shit he could do about it, either. </p>
<p>I've still got 'em to this day. They look every bit as villainous as they did then. They don't smell great, and there's a number of holes and suspicious looking stains all over. </p>
<p>ETA) I'd like to thank whoever hooked me up with Reddit silver for a story about my crusty ass boots. I always thought it might be for one of my short stories or many hilarious comments, but no. Rusty fucking boots, lmao.</p>
<p>Anyway, as promised, here's photos of my boots. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was there in in 05 and 06 too and remember that well, had to get a friend to ship a pair of boots to me. Received a pair of those high speed Oakley boots and they felt like slippers in comparison.
Also, we received a new kid in our company that was on suicide watch from the day he arrived. He only had a pair of running shoes. Spoiled my plan to steal his boots. He slept on a cot in the CP. While I was on radio watch I pryed, turned out his wife who was from Norway screwed Jody, jacked his entire bank account right after receiving his reup bonus 50-60k and jumped back across the pond. Since she had POA wasn’t shit he could do. And he had to serve out the six year re enlistment. So the suicide thing was an attempt to fast track out. Not sure what happened but I imagine he is in jail somewhere in Norway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wear size 16s, this is my every day fight trying to find shoes.  I can always find sneakers but dress shoes?  Fuck no. Nothing that's comfortable or decent looking.  Hiking boots?  Rarely.  I got lucky a few years ago and found some mislabed size 16 merrells that were mistakenly put in a size 14 box.  I felt like I hit the fucking shoe jackpot.  </p>
<p>I've been looking for some actual ruck boots for long hikes because my mid length merrells aren't supportive enough for my shitty ankles and bad knees. Found a few but need to save up, I can't easily justify $150 on boots I'm only gonna wear a few times a month at best.  </p>
<p>I have shoes and work boots exactly like the boots you've described.  We're on different ends of the shit we put them through, but I feel your pain just the same.  I have a (formerly) nice pair of dress shoes with leather soles and everything that are so shitty I can't wear them now, and I wore a goddamn hole in the leather.  <a href="https://imgur.com/L2q3p6O.jpg" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/L2q3p6O.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is the fix for this and for all longer laces in the boots...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tie stop knots at the end of the laces (4 in total).  IF you are STILL WORRIED you can burn the knot but I've never had this issue.  Now tie up your laces normally, BUT pull the laces all the way to the knots til you have just 2 big loops and no other loose ends.  Tuck these into your boots.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Its how I did it in the army.  Never had an issue again.  No issues untying and getting knots.  No need for double knots, no loose mess.</p></div>		</li>
