			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just 7, it'd be for every digit.</p>
<p>The full conjecture is that pi is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number" target="_blank">normal</a>, which is a bit stronger than what's stated above. If a number is normal, this means that if you look at the first N numbers in the decimal expansion, where N is very big, about 1/10th of those numbers will be 7. And also about 1/100 of the strings of length 2 will be &quot;71&quot;. And 1/1000 of the strings of length 3 will be &quot;710&quot;. So if you write down a specific string of length k, you'd expect that string to make up 1/10^k of your sample.</p>
<p>We know that <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_everywhere" target="_blank">almost every</a> real number is normal. This means that the set of numbers which aren't normal has length zero. In spite of this result, we don't have any good techniques to check if a given real number is normal.</p>
<p>Edit: One other detail about the definition of normal numbers. What I wrote in the first paragraph was specific to base 10, but really a normal number should have the property described in the first paragraph in every base. So if you write a normal number in base b and you have a string of length k, that string will make up 1/b^k of the decimal expansion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it’s not a proof, but we are pretty sure pi is normal, right? Like if we took a statistical approach and sampled sections of the decimal expansion, it would look like 10% are 7s?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is specific to certain irrational numbers, one of which is pi, but not specific to 7. There is nothing special about 7. We also don't know about the other digits. The larger question is how to proven that a given number like pi is what is called a &quot;(base 10) normal number&quot;, i.e. to prove the stronger statement that every k-digit block you can think of occurs with frequency 10^(-k) within the base-10-expansion of pi.</p>
<p>(And again, there is nothing special about 10 here. One can ask if pi and similar numbers are normal with respect to any other base and the answer is unknown as well. If we knew how to prove the base-10-case we'd probably also have a good idea on how to go about the other cases and vice versa, they are probably all equally difficult to prove)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, that'd be pretty crazy if it were specific to 7. Like, yep we can prove there's an infinite number of 0s, 1s, 2s... Only the digit 7 eludes us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(some people are confused)
Infinite doesn't mean that all numbers 0-9 will be present forever. It just means that there will never stop being numbers ranging from 0-9. It could eventually be 0123012340123450123456 on repeat for 10 trillion digits OR for an infinite amount of digits there after, which in that case then 7 8 AND 9 would be finite in the infinite decimal. </p>
<p>If something is infinite with multiple variables the variables will always be a chance, but the chance has strict rules. So technically all of the numbers except for 2 of them out of 0-9 could be finite as long as it doesn't end in a constant number or pattern rendering pi as rational instead of irrational.</p>
<p>The reason we can't know is because it's never ending, so a single 7 could appear billions upon trillions upon gazillions of numbers down the line, but the fact we're proving or disproving is that it is and always will be a COULD. It could or could not. Forever.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Small correction: We know it can't repeat 0123012340123450123456 forever. If it did, that would imply that π is rational and we already know it is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my memory of old Calculus classes, I understand there are different types of infinities -- but in this situation, would asking &quot;are there an infinite number of 7's in pi&quot; the same as asking &quot;Does pi eventually end in all 7's?&quot;</p>
<p>Or are we talking about different infinities here?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  Nevermind, I just realized you probably meant an infinite number of 7's throughout the expansion, not an infinite number of consecutive 7's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If pi is normal, then for any given number, there is a string of 7s that long in pi (i.e. There is no &quot;longest&quot; string of 7s). This is a reasonable definition for there existing an infinite number of 7s in a row. This does not imply that pi &quot;ends&quot; with an infinite string of sevens, and the same is true for all other digits. Infinity is wierd. </p></div>		</li>
