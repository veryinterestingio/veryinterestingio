			<div class="markdown"><p>And for the ones that are available by prescription, there are related reasons why they're not just freely available, as mentioned in your last paragraph.  Lithium is another one that has to be monitored closely.</p>
<p>There's the idea of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_index" target="_blank">therapeutic index</a> which is basically the ratio of a dangerous dose to a therapeutically effective dose.  For some things, the proper effective dose varies quite a bit from one person to another, and over time, but also the range between effective and dangerous can be relatively thin.</p>
<p>In psychiatric, there's another level to it that some of them build up gradually over time, and need gradual reduction.  Even for the ones that aren't directly too physiologically dangerous, playing with your own dosing can cause potentially problematic mood swings and mental issues.</p>
<p>Most of us just aren't well suited to calculate and monitor our own dosing, especially for something that alters your mind and mood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antipsychotic withdrawal is also severely understated. After 300mg Seroquel/day for years (as a bipolar-2 mood stabiliser), I relatively slowly came off with medical supervision, and yet it was still absurdly brutal. The rebound insomnia was so crippling I was unable to sleep at all for days (which later became 3-4 hrs/night), I lost my appetite, developed OCD, kept finding patterns in things and becoming majorly paranoid for no reason, was extraordinarily upregulated constantly, it all felt as if someone was secretly slipping me speed and acid all the time. Up to six months later I still had severe insomnia, and even to this day, <em>three years later</em>, sleeping is <em>still</em> not as easy as it was.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair even psychiatrists can't exactly predict the outcomes of a lot of drugs. Everyone is slightly different, I find most SSRIs work great on my depression; but I haven't found anything that treats my anxiety. I wanted to try a non stimulant ADHD drug because obviously stimulant + anxiety don't mix very well. But the only one available in my country is an MRI and he didn't want to risk serotonin syndrome (I'd have tried it since it effects norepinephrine and not serotonin; but I'm not about to argue with a doctor).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is different, this is not medical advice, just some broad statements and some personal ones.</p>
<p>Stimulant medication can definitely treat anxiety in ADHD people. It's a bit paradoxical, but somehow it can slow you down and make you calmer. Could take a while to get used to them though.</p>
<p>That said, the standard stimulants did only make me personally <em>more</em> anxious. Wellbutrin (bupropion) is a non-stimulant that can be very helpful in ADHD. I ended up with modafinil after a long search. I'm not sure if that one's technically a stimulant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to emphasize what was said here. If you have ADHD and you take the correct dose then you should be calmer and less anxious. That is what happened with me. The dosage depends on your brain chemistry and there will be a dose that should work. I tried building up like the doctor suggested I and I felt wired at a relatively low dose, so I went back to the starting dose. Rule of thumb is start low and go slow. It should be a gentle quieting of the mind-like going into your calmest moment rather than feeling a rush to do EVERYTHING (which is nothing like what is depicted in films or by the media-and also nothing like what a neurotypical person would experience on the same medication).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue this thought</p>
<p>Aside from dosing with lithium theres also issues with drug interactions and other side effects. Imagine taking a vitamin and then not being able to eat large amounts of salt, or having to be careful about how much sunlight and heat you get or monitoring your water intake. Lithium has a risk of toxicity so routine blood draws are necessary. You cant take ibuprofen while on it or you are at an increased risk for toxicity. Supplements just arent as dangerous and using these drugs is serious and needs to be treated seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what was said above:</p>
<p>Neurons (the cells) in the brain communicate with each other with neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, etc.) The synapse is tiny amount of space between the cells. When a cells wants to send a signal, it will release neurotransmitters into the synapse which then bind to other cells to convey the signal. These neurotransmitters then are sucked back into (this is called reuptake) the cell that released them. </p>
<p>Cocaine works by blocking the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine causing them to repeatedly bind and rebind, sending the signal over and over. There’s also a protein that floats around the synapse that breaks down neurotransmitters. Since the neurotransmitters can’t be reuptaked by the cell, the protein breaks down more neurotransmitters than it’s supposed to. This causes the worse feelings between highs as your baseline is lower than it normally is and causes more needed for the same effects because the baseline is lower and needs more to reach the same level of high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MDMA causes your brain to dump nearly all it's serotonin. (This is what causes the massive empathy and euphoria) The lack of serotonin is what you are feeling. Without supplements like 5-HTP (a serotonin precursor your body metabolizes into serotonin) it can take a week to feel &quot;normal&quot; again and up to a month for your serotonin levels to fully restore. Highly recommend reading about proper mdma supplement if you are going to use it to help with stuff like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the simpler way to put it is that your neurons only have a set amount of these neurotransmitters and when you take a drug that forces the release of many of them all at once you are left with a recovery period until your brain can produce more. MDMA has a reputation for having a comedown that can last a day or more, but for me, it was definitely the easiest comedown. Way smoother and quicker than most amphetamines</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically your brain is having a hard time making dopamine, which is a large part of what causes your ADHD. Your meds (probably vyvanse or adderall, or stratera which is a non-stimulant, usually prescribed for patients with bipolar/schizphrenic symptoms) increase your dopamine output to match usual levels and your brain can concentrate normally and isn’t seeking it in a maladaptive way. </p>
<p>ADHD meds are prescribed because the benefits usually &gt; the risk, which is very low even compared to other types of prescription meds. There are no links to long term dependency found, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's different for ADHDers, because it's treating a chronic shortage of neurotransmitters. For one thing, you are at least taking them under the supervision of a medical professional. If you're concerned, your prescribing doctor can talk to you about the risks and benefits particular to you. Don't stop taking them just on the basis of a thing you read on the internet!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first paragraph is exactly why you wouldn't even want just a bottle of serotonin.</p>
<p>The lay understanding of neurotransmitters is way, way off. The chemical imbalance theory oversimplifying things to the point of misrepresentation. It's not as simple as &quot;my brain needs dopamine&quot; or serotonin.</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters are what neurons use to communicate with each other. Specific neurons or groups of neurons firing in sync in specific patterns are what constitute different thoughts and feelings so changing specific neural activity is the goal. Blanket &quot;ramp every neuron that uses dopamine to communicate to the max&quot; is not going to produce the results people seem to think, it's not a specific enough intervention given neural pathways can overlap or use the same neurotransmitter while communicating completely different sets of signals. Drugs fuck people up while making them also feel good for a reason</p>

<p>Thank you for saying this! I definitely don't have a degree in neuroscience, and when I bring up this issue I'm worried I'll come across as anti-pyschiatry, which I'm not.</p>
<p>I think &quot;you have a chemical imbalance&quot; has simply become shorthand for &quot;it's not your fault, you can't just be expected to pull yourself up by the bootstraps, and you may benefit from medication,&quot; and subsequently everyone's forgotten that it has little scientific merit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't actually answer the question, though. The reason you can't just pop down to the pharmacy and get a bottle of dopamine, serotonin, etc. is because taking those chemicals directly won't do anything. They won't cross the brain blood barrier, or they'll be broken down before they can reach the brain. </p>
<p>You have to take a substance that either causes your body to produce more, or changes how your body handles those chemicals (such as blocking reuptake)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, if you could just tell your brain cells to communicate some more dopamine when they normally wouldn't, you would end up building up a tolerance, your receptors won't do the thing as well and you will need more dopamine to do the thing, this is pretty much what some drugs do in the first place.</p>
<p>Theoretically if we could influence the brain to that degree we might be able to &quot;fix&quot; neuroreceptors to remove tolerance. </p>
<p>For example, CBD receptors slowly retract into their cells as they are used and become less sensitive. After about 4 weeks of using cannabis they are fully retracted and you have maxxed out your tolerance. You can always go 4 weeks without using to return them to normal, but theoretically if we could just force them to extend again every time you got high would be like your first time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately some drugs do permanent damage to receptors or have other insane complications, so this is still basically sci-fi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just addiction, but serious toxicities. Dopamine gets metabolized into some seriously toxic substances. Your brain is good at dealing with these substances in the context of normal activity in your neurons and synapses, but pouring dopamine into random places in your brain is a recipe for destruction. </p>
<p>This might be one of the reasons that giving Parkinson’s patients dopamine precursor drugs tends to accelerate their decline.</p></div>		</li>
