			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, initial testing was for people who were symptomatic and very sick. It's important to account for that in the models. As more people who are lower acuity or asymptomatic get tests, the positive rate is going to go down because it was artificially high initially from a biased sample (even though that bias was intentional).</p>
<p>Bayesian methods can create estimators on population prevalence, and feeding hospitalization rates and other data into the model will help greatly with accurate estimates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is likely a bit of everything, I would imagine.  There is too much politicization going on where one side paints a picture of increased infection rate and points at policies of the administration and the other defends their position attributing it to increases in testing numbers and how broadly we can test (only symptomatic earlier and including asymptomatic now).  I would expect there is an increase in infection due to more open policy and we can likely attribute some of the increase in numbers to improved testing availability.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've tried to explain this to people and have gotten responses like they're only going to the hospital because they tested positive. </p>
<p>Um no, thats not how it works. If you get tested positive and go to a hospital, if you're bp, heart rate, temperature and breathing are fine, you're not being admitted. They sending you home.</p></div>		</li>

It's shocking that we do not have hospitals reporting the number of patients they are treating for COVID instead of those in the hospital that are positive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't treat COVID in patients who have less severe symptoms. That would be a meaningless metric. I've seen patients coming in with asthma flares because of a URI and were found to be COVID positive. Unless they're intubated, you really provide supportive care and treat the asthma flare. COVID could cause COPD or CHF exacerbations. Again, if it's the COPD or CHF driving their symptoms, you treat that. If they come up to the ICU, then we start to throw the kitchen sink at them in the hopes of shortening their ventilator dependence, LOS, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nobody is getting admitted to the hospital right now unless they really need it.</p>
<p>I caught the flu (probably at a doctor's office) last week. I am immunosuppressed. Still not admitted to the hospital (thankfully), because unless I get viral pneumonia, I'm better off at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't admit you even if you got viral pneumonia. If you got viral pneumonia and became acutely ill, e.g. imminent respiratory failure, severe volume depletion, septic shock, etc., then I would admit you for treatment. Otherwise there's no point to admitting you to a hospital. We use clinical decision tools like the CURB-65 to help determine this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Drs and nurses are being run ragged (I can say from experience since some family is in that practice) they are not going to have someone who isn't having dangerous symptoms admitted. If they did it would be more dangerous for all involved and take up a bed needed to save someone who can't survive on their own.</p></div>		</li>
