The actual place you would weigh the least is the top of Huascaran, a mountain in Peru, according to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/grl.50838" target="_blank">this paper</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24068-gravity-map-reveals-earths-extremes/" target="_blank">Hirt‚Äôs model</a> pinpoints unexpected locations with more extreme differences. Mount Nevado Huascar√°n in Peru has the lowest gravitational acceleration, at 9.7639 m/s2, while the highest is at the surface of the Arctic Ocean, at 9.8337 m/s2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So interestingly there is a ((9.8337 - 9.7639) / 9.7639) * 100 = 0.71488 % difference between the furthest extremes.</p>
<p>So if you weighed yourself <em>(on a scale that displayed weight in kg)</em> on Mount Nevado it would show 100.0 kg, <del>you'd weigh</del> it would then show 100.7 kg if you did the same on the Arctic Ocean, and you'd also feel heavier. Your mass wouldn't change though, and would be somewhere between those two values <em>(in actual kg)</em>, if the scale was calibrated to the earths average gravitational constant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if you weighed 100 kg on Mount Nevado, you'd weigh 100.715 kg on the Arctic Ocean, or about 715 grams heavier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pedantic correction. If one were 100 kg <em>massive</em> on Mount Nevado, they'd be 100 kg <em>massive</em> on the Arctic ocean.</p>
<p>If one <em>weighed</em> 1000 <strong>N</strong> on Mount Nevado, then their <strong>mass</strong> would be 1000 N/9.7639 m‚Ä¢s^(‚Äì2) ‚âà 102.42 kg. They'd weigh 102.42 kg √ó 9.8337 m‚Ä¢s^(‚Äì2) = 1007.15 N.</p>
<p>Mass is an intrinsic property of matter, and is the resistance of an object to a change in its state of rest or constant  motion, also commonly called inertia. </p>
<p>Weight is the <strong>force</strong> exerted on an object due to its presence within a gravitational field, and its magnitude is proportional to the mass of the object. </p>
<p>It isn't a subtle difference: the units for both differ, too. The former is in kilograms, the latter is in newtons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should have read your comment before I posed my question üòï</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn his science fiction novel ‚ÄúArtemis‚Äù Andy Weir makes the case that Kenya‚Äôs only natural resource, the equator, makes it the ideal location for a space port to supply the lunar colony. As such, the Kenyan government was able to parlay that resource and combine it with tax breaks to compel companies wanting to work in space. </p>
<p>Is an equatorial location a big enough benefit for launch companies to leave the US at this point, or is the practical difference negligible with existing infrastructure?‚Äù</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer here doesn‚Äôt have as much to do with gravity as it does velocity. Launching from the equator you can use all the rotational velocity of the equator to help gain the velocity needed to maintain an orbit. Whereas, a launch from higher/lower latitude you would need to use more energy to do so because of a lower initial velocity from a spot on the globe that doesn‚Äôt rotate as quickly. Think of it like a bike tire where the outer edge represents the equator.</p>
<p>Whether this is a huge benefit or not I‚Äôm not sure.</p>
<p>Big Edit: A launch from the equator is equal to having ~463 m/s (rotation of the earth at equator) subtracted from the velocity you need to reach low earth orbit ~7,800 m/s. 45 degrees latitude is more extreme than the US has it with launches from Florida, but it takes that number down to ~328 m/s. So to reach orbit it‚Äôs a 2% difference between the two, but the real kicker is how you want to orbit the planet. </p>
<p>Going to orbit the most efficient way possible from the equator results in an orbit directly around the equator (think of a hula hoop around the planet). The same process from a higher latitude of 45N results in the same orbital shape, but it becomes ‚Äútilted‚Äù and the hula hoop ranges from the 45N to 45S. Going between these two orbits is where it starts to get really wasteful with fuel, but we don‚Äôt necessarily want equatorial orbits for everything.</p>
<p>So again, yes it does matter, but there are way more factors independent of orbital needs that contribute to a choice in location so the tax breaks would probably be a bigger incentive for the companies rather than the orbital velocity benefit. </p>
<p>This is way simplified and generalized, but it‚Äôs fairly accurate and I hope it helps! It was fun for me to think about this morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, rotational velocity rather than gravity is the main benefit. But to answer your question: countries that can do this already do.</p>
<p>The ESA launches from Kourou in French Guiana - exactly because of its proximity to the equator. The USA built their launch site in Florida for the same reason (it's useful to be on the east coast so you can launch over water and that is as close to the equator as you can go on the continental US).
They may have opted for an even more southern location if they were willing to use one of the Island territories but there the trump card was politics. Part of how Kennedy got the moon mission through congress was scattering parts of it over many states, thus those states representatives would have an incentive to support it: jobs back home.
With parts built all over the US that all had to be shipped to one place, staying continental allowed them to use trucks.
This is also why mission control is in Houston Texas rather than at the launch site: to keep Texas on board.</p>
<p>Russia chose Baikonur not because it's well placed: they have no well placed territories, it's just the best of a bad bunch.</p>
<p>China is the only major space fairing country that launches over a populated area: other countries tend to avoid dropping spent rocket stages on their citizens houses.</p>
<p>South Africa may hold the record for worst chosen launch site of all. They out their launch site at Cape point: the furthest point you can get from the equator in the country (actually second furthest, Cape Agulhas is further south but this was unknown at the time - the signs at Cape point still falsely claim it's the southern-most point in Africa). And it's on the west coast: though that is less of a factor as it's on a jutting peninsula so launches are still over water. St Lucia would have been much better being the closest town to the equator on the east coast. On the other hand it's a truly unique ecosystem: the only place on earth where hippos and Nile crocodiles live in salt water. So maybe there is benefit in not having used it. Either way, Cape point was the worst possible choice. This is probably at least part of why the south African space program don't launch their own rockets anymore. The satellites they do send up (mostly weather research) now gets outsourced to other countries and the space program primarily spends it's time on terrestrial astronomy projects like MeerKAT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All you people with your low gravity, here in the far north gravity is 9.8253 m/s\^2. </p>
<p>Of course, the only real difference is that you round g ‚âà 9.83. </p>
<p>I use this as an excuse to always round g  ‚âà 9.8, because standard gravity is 9.807 and in the rest of the country they round to 9.82, but that's just wrong so either it's 9.81 or 9.83 however all you need to do is go like 1 degree south for the gravity to flip to 9.82, so might as well just round it to 9.8 </p>

<p>I just got the cords from long click on Google Maps, then it says in the results Gravity. I didn't even notice it's given in a very weird unit since the 9825 matched, but it's in mGal, one Gal (galileo) is 0.01¬†m/s2 so a milliGal is 10\^-5 m/s\^2 and 982507.8 mGal /10\^5 = 9.825 m/s\^2</p></div>		</li>
