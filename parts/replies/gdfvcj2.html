			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the first point, our mucous membranes are filled with enzymes called ribonucleases specifically because we don’t want RNA from the outside world getting into our bodies (as it could be a virus!). </p>
<p>Injection gets around (some of) our normal anti-viral safeguards. </p>

<p>Some viruses even encode ribonuclease inhibitors to suppress this defense mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did take my typhoid vaccine orally, and polio is/used to be delivered the same way, so it works for some formulations of vaccines.</p>
<p>However, others are too fragile to endure stomach acid. This is why some oral medications have a special acid-resistant coating on them and “DO NOT CHEW” on the instructions!  But it doesn’t work for all of them. Typhoid is foodborne, so it makes sense that it would survive the stomach.</p>
<p>Edit: the oral polio vaccine was discontinued in the US in 2000, but oral typhoid was still in use here as of April 2019</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, if the coating is acid resistant, how will the pill have any effect? Wouldn't it just get pooped out fairly intact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you took the oral typhoid vaccine, the Ty21a, then that's a live-attenuated bacterial vaccine. It actually has very very weak live Salmonella bacteria in it, and not RNA.</p>
<p>If you took the oral Polio vaccine, although it is a virus, it still is the live-attenuated type, so no mRNA there, but actual weak polio virus. The other polio vaccine is the killed virus type(named Salk), which has bits of dead virus there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The RNA is usually encapsulated within the virus so it is &quot;hidden.&quot; Additionally, you could have so much viral RNA that the defenses are overwhelmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This only concerns free RNA. Viruses have their RNA (or DNA) protected on the inside.</p>
<p>The ribonuclease can't reach the genetic material to degrade it.</p>
<p>The vaccine in the other hand contains the free RNA template (that has the code to make one specific shapes of the viruses outside proteins). It's not protected at all against those enzymes.</p>
<p>To degrade the whole virus you'd need stuff like protease that destroy the proteins of the outside of the virus, but protease have much more specificity than those RNA degrading enzymes. There's only 16 ways of connecting the 4 RNA components.</p>
<p>There's however more than 400 ways of connecting two amino acids. So one enzyme can't fit all in that case if it can't find an exposed region to split that protein string.</p>
<p>Not to mention that RNA is very unstable already just in solution.</p></div>		</li>
