<p>Is this where malt in beer comes from? I'm assuming yes, since they use the seed parts of various plants to increase malt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Malted grains are allowed to sprout and grow a tiny amount before being heat treated to stop it. This process activates the enzymes that start turning starch into sugars, and it’s these sugars that yeast consume to turn wort into beer. Different malts are characterized by sugar content and degree of roasting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, malt is half-germinated barley. The grain germinates then it’s dried in hot air to stop germination. Starch is now sugar. Yeast likes it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it still starch until the mashing (soaking malt in hot water) process? The malting just activates the enzymes that will convert starch to maltose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EXACTLY YES.  It's where they get the term malt or malted grain.  Basically you trick the seed into thinking it's growing time, and once the reaction starts you kill the germite by roasting it lightly.  Then the brewery will do what's called a mash to finish the conversion of starches in the seeds to sugars.  That makes the backbone of your beer and gives the sugar content that will later be turned into alcohol via fermentation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other way around. Malt and malted grain came first. The word dates back to at leas Old English. The sugar maltose is the main sugar in malt, and was named after malt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone's saying the seed wont get very far without nutrients, which is absolutely true, but I can tell you that mung beans, at least, have enough stored in the seed
for the sprout to become a full foot long/tall plant with a couple of leaves, all grown in just water in the pencil well of a school table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeds need more than just water to grow. Germination itself requires oxygen and an optimum temperature for the enzymes to work properly. Leaving a seed in a puddle of water wouldn't provide the seed enough oxygen; doesn't grow. Besides, during growth the plant requires nutrients, which are provided in soil and not in just water.
Maybe leaving the seed in a puddle of water would still stimulate gibberellins idk, but the seed still won't grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature, oxygen, and water are the main things that allow a seed to germinate. Oxygen is actively used in the mitochondria (which I think you know but I want to say it anyway) and provides the main source of energy for the growing seeds until the leaves are formed. This causes the release of giberellins and the repression of abscisic acid (acts in seed dormancy). This allows germination to actually start, in addition to dormancy-breaking signals other than giberellins. The seeds will germinate, but without sufficient nutrients they will be unable to form chlorophyll or other pigments and they'll just bleach and die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but it'll still need nutrients from the soil to survive and grow.</p>
<p>Fun experiment you can try: take an acorn, wrap it in paper towel, soak the paper towel in water, and let it sit for a week or two. The acorn will sprout and have roots coming out of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all seeds are released from the parent plant in a dormant state. Some seeds do not have dormancy but require germination cues. These are distinct from dormancy breaking cues. Germination cues include water, temperature, oxygen and light and smoke.  While dormancy breaking cues are generally considered to be a pre cursor to germination cues. Dormancy breaking cues include heat (heat plays a big role in legumes, as most legumes have water impermeable seed coats, heat raptures the water gap, allowing the seed to hydrate) and after ripening ( fluctuations in temperature that stimulate embryo growth inside the seed) and GA ( while this isn't technically a dormancy breaking cue, adding gibberellic acid will speed up embryo growth in species with underdeveloped embryos).
So if a seed is released in a non dormant state, it still requires the right combination of temperature and water to germinate at the very least, seed biologists measure this trait as hydrothermal time, and seeds will be able to germinate under a range of temperature and water treatments, but will have a preferred regime referred to as optimal germination conditions. </p>
<p>One further, but minor correction. Dormant seeds do metabolize, but because they do so at such a low level that we currently can not measure it. If seeds did not metabolize, they should live forever, but the lifespan of seeds ranges considerably, from very long lived species (like some legumes) to very short lived seeds (think orchids). The current thinking is that legumes are so long lived because their internal tissues remain dry ( as I mentioned they have a water imperial seed coat) so internal tissues are in a &quot;glassy &quot; state  resulting in a lot slower reactions and less reactions. </p>
<p>Seed longevity is an active area of research as we currently have no good way of predicting when seeds in seed banks will die, besides continually germinating the seeds. One technology that had emerged recently is the measurement of oxygen consumption of a single seed, with the think that if oxygen consumption suddendly crashes, the seed is dying. Do this frequently enough and we should be able to pick up patterns to predict that crash. </p>
<p>I just finished my PhD in  seed biology. Love this shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Corn is from poaceae family, so not really. I say glassy meaning the internal seed tissues of dry seeds is close to a solid, but not quite. The glassy phase while seeds are dry reduce reaction speed potentially limiting DNA damage during storage. </p></div>		</li>
