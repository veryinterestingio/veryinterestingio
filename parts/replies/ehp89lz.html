			<div class="markdown"><p>Its misleading to think of those avalanches in the same way snow avalanches occur however. Sand &quot;avalanches&quot; are never* large enough to be dangerous. Snow can form different layers with different densities and cohesions that can build up to a dangerous instability, whereas sand will slide almost immediately after reaching its angle of repose.</p>
<p>^(*I put an asterisk here because I'm not ruling out that there was one freak accident somewhere where someone managed to accidentally bury themselves when climbing up a very large and loose dune slip face, but its practically impossible)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fair, but they are (1) both called avalanches and (2) are both basically just alternative names for grain flows with the different behavior driven by the differences in material properties (i.e. internal friction angle, cohesiveness, etc) and the relative size of the features involved that others have pointed out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the equivalent of a &quot;point-release avalanche&quot; in snow. Sand cannot form the necessary structures to produce a &quot;slab avalanche&quot; which is the type that usually transports a lot more material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunes <em>do</em> have a different source of danger, though: since they migrate, they may migrate right over the top of vegetation, causing an air-filled cavity just beneath the surface. If you are unlucky, you might fall through the surface into the cavity and be buried by sand.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not nearly.  A sand dune is basically just a pile of loose material, whereas a snow-covered mountain is an immovable piece of rock with a bunch of snow that's partially adhered to the mountain and partially adhered to itself.  All loose piles of materials have what's called an angle of repose, which is the angle that sand will take if you dump out a bucket of it.  At that angle, there's no need to worry  about an avelanche, because gravity and friction balance  out.</p>
<p>So an&quot;avalanche&quot; on a sand dune, it is really just a small &quot;correction&quot; to bring the sides of the dune back to the angle of repose.  They can get a little bit off, because sand particles are rough, and can lock together, but they never build up a huge amount of mass.</p>
<p>Snow, on the other hand, can freeze together.  This means that it can build up at angles way different from its angle of repose.  Ice, however can crack, and snow packs can lose their adhesion to the mountain beneath them.  Suddenly, you have millions of pounds of snow and ice with nothing supporting it.  The shape of the mountain beneath the snow can also amplify the avelanche, acting like a funnel or a slide to concentrate its effects onto a smaller area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well could it be possible that's only because sand dunes are almost always dry? I'd imagine wet sand has different cohesive behavior and could be potentially dangerous like snow once they dry, but that just almost never happens in current Earth environment.</p></div>		</li>
