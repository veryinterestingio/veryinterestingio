			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has ever died from lack of sleep. It's well demonstrated that sleep deprivation isn't healthy, but it doesn't kill you. The longest a person has ever stayed awake was 11 days, and he was back to normal after resting a couple of days. </p>
<p>Some people hear about &quot;Fatal Familial Insomnia&quot;, and assume that it's a condition where a lack of sleep kills the victim. It's actually a prion disease that eats away at the brain, causing both insomnia and eventual death, but that is correlation, not causation.</p>
<p>They cover this topic in a lot of college psych and bio courses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same way that no one has died of getting shot. </p>
<p>After a 2-3 days without sleep and beyond, people start to hallucinate, stop making good decisions, your immune system crashes, etc. </p>
<p>At some point, your body just decides to sleep, either for a moment at a time or just flops down and sleeps wherever you may lay. </p>
<p>If you force yourself to stay awake, somehow, past this point, we don't really know what happens, but it's pretty clear that things get worse and worse. Like you said, the record is 11 days, and that's an extreme outlier. </p>
<p>So what would happen if we could prevent someone sleeping for 2 weeks? 3? Would they be able to stay alive without constant medical intervention and help? Would they eventually go so paranoid that they off themselves? </p>
<p>So no, a few days without sleep won't kill you, directly. And your body has ways to prevent you from going any longer than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone hasnt died from it directly, but even getting as far as 6-7 hours of sleep has a huge negative imoact on your health. Just to show an example when we push the clock forward 1 hour the heart attack rate goes up by 21% and the reverse when its pushed 1 hour back. Havent myself read theese studies but i heard it on a joe rogan podcast with a sleep scientist(??)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean Dr Mathew Walker, the researcher who ignored results of 4 million people showing the lowest mortality rate was associated with 7 hours of sleep, no more and no less? The guy who omitted outlying data on graphs that didn't fit his conclusion?</p></div>		</li>
