<p>Vital D production will still occur and you wouldn’t become deficient at lets say 35, diet and synthesis of Vit D will still occurs...</p>
<p>Edit: So for people also living in Arizona and Florida it would be advised to use sunscreen for prolonged activities in the sun depending on the UV </p>
<p>Also Queensland in Australia never drops low enough in UV to not use sunscreen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Floridian here: My dermatologist recommended avoiding the sun between 10-4, iirc.  Either that or 10-6, likely till 4 though.  So I ran a lot between 8:15-9:45am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand this is true.  Twenty minutes outside should be more than enough exposure to produce vitamin D. In addition the sunscreen isn’t going to stop this process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the glass, but it's usually true in an modern office with lots of glass but not at home.</p>
<p>Some glass blocks UV, some doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it that sunscreen wouldn't stop the process? The whole point of it is to block the UV light which we use to produce vitamin D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A. Sunblock isn’t blocking 100% of the rays
B. Sunscreen is rarely applied correctly, you need almost approximately 40-50 mls (about the size of a shot glass) to effectively cover your body
C. Sunscreen actually has to be reapplied every couple hours for effective use
D. You don’t actually need to make much vitamin D everyday, it’s fat soluble so you have quite a bit stored.</p>
<p>So all in all, sunscreen use will not make you vitamin D deficient</p></div>		</li>
