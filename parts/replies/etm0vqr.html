			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a tiny mole on my right eyebrow, and it frequently produces insanely long eyebrow hairs. I've pulled one that was 5&quot; long. That only happened when I had long hair though. Having hair that constantly touched my face distracted me from its growth. Now it'll reach the edge of the eyebrow and it's got to go immediately.</p></div>		</li>
