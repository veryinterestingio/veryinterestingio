			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easier to visualize it as an intersection of a sphere with a plane.</p>
<p>When we look at that intersection from above, we will see a circle.</p>
<p>If we look at the intersection from the plane's surface, we will see a line.</p>
<p>There are lots of these intersections and we are viewing from far away and at an angle, giving us this ring-like shape instead.</p>
<p>We can create other shapes, more natural to visualize, such as a hemisphere too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also produce a hemisphere, as seen in<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/TNT_detonation_on_Kahoolawe_Island_during_Operation_Sailoir_Hat%2C_sjot_Bravo%2C_1965.jpg" target="_blank"> this picture</a></p>
<p>In <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Castle_Union.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a> it has formed rings (due to the different layers of pressure/moisture in the atmosphere) but you can clearly see the literal sphere of influence the shockwave had when forming these clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's nigh off-topic. But that's an incredible photo.</p>
<p>I have never seen a nuclear explosion from that perspective before, I've always felt like it's just a dome of fire and death coming from a single point. But that really paints it more as an actual explosion, rather than something esoteric in nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can create a hemisphere too, and sometimes the temperature goes back up pretty quickly causing the dew to appear then vanish.  Look at the footage of the Crossroad Baker shot - you see the entire scene instantly clouded, then the cloud raising up like a curtain to reveal  a wall of suspended water - an enormous splash, falling towards the ships, and an entire battleship on end. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar, yeah. In both cases you get water droplets from pressure changes. Lenticular clouds are formed from topography dew point suppression, whereas Wilson Clouds are man(bomb) made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your detailed explanation. A question: you say this is due to pressure difference, but I am not sure how to approach this thinking, as I am unsure if pressure is meaningfully defined in such a sudden change. Is there any way to clarify this property?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you stretch a slinky spring out and you kinda punch it instead of wiggle it, you will see a shockwave go 'through' it. The compressed part will travel down the slinky pretty fast and either side of the compressed part will be a stretched part. I think this is kinda how pressure/ sound waves travel through air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think of a sine wave, the clouds form in the trough. Pressure waves are different but if you measure the density and plot it you get a sine wave. There's effectively one shockwave so it's like a standing wave with the low pressure areas forming the clouds due to the adibatic cooling.</p></div>		</li>
