<p>Two computers sit at the kitchen table. One makes a fanart drawing of a character and shows it to the other. The other says &quot;That's pretty good but I know you can do better. Here's how to make a better picture.&quot; and explains what it needs to do better. The first computer draws a better picture and hands it to the other. They do this many times over until the computer judging says &quot;Wow! That's a good drawing! It's so good I can't tell if its the original or the copy!&quot;, and then they hang it on their refrigerator so the user can see it.</p></div>		</li>
