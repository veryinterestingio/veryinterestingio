			<div class="markdown"><p>So, theoretically, if the cold months exceed 6 months, mosquitoes could be eradicated from a region?</p>
<p>Let's say it snows from November to April. Here in my part of Canada, we get like 1 or 2 days of snow in April.</p>
<p>What I'm really asking is, can I kill all mosquitoes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because mosquitos can migrate, too. For mosquitos to be eradicated they would have to be killed everywhere. Also mosquito are an important part of the food chain,  eradicating mosquitoes probably means a big loss in diversity, and an ecosystem collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be mistaken, but I recall reading that they actually aren't all that important to the food chain, on top of the fact that they are only in most food chains due to humans accidentally spreading them everywhere. To remove them would only be to fix a past mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That must be some specific mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The North of Scandinavia has a ridiculous amount of mosquitoes and winters very often last more than 6 months. The time from eggs being laid until they are mosquitoes again (evolved from larvae) is probably around 11 months. Would guess that eggs survive from maybe 9 months or such from being laid until they hatch after the winter.</p></div>		</li>
