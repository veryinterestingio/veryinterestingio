			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually did research on this at university using Kepler eclipsing binary data, paper [here] (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154..250L/abstract" target="_blank">https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154..250L/abstract</a>). When you do periodicity analysis of the brightness of a binary system over time, ignoring the moments of eclipse, starspots can be significant enough to dim the star at intervals indicating the rotation rates of the stars.
This period is actually somewhat offset from the rotation rate due to most starspots appearing in latitudes away from the equator, and in stars different latitudes have different rotation periods. When accounting for that, most systems looked at have stellar rotation periods matching the orbital period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a good question! Typically these fluid bodies are differentially rotating so the concept of having a particular rotation rate becomes problematic. However, in a number of these cases (Sun-like stars, and gas giant planets) the deep interior (and the bulk of the mass) is actually rotating as solid body rotation. The problem then is how to see it. One way is to look at the largescale dipole magnetic field and observe its rotation rate (in general it will not be aligned with the rotation axis but in most cases will rotate with the deep interior).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't collision the end state of all systems that do not drift apart? Orbits lose energy slowly through the release of gravitational waves, so over hundreds of trillions of years (if not timescales orders of magnitude larger), orbits decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets a little weird because it depends on assumptions made in the statement! You are correct that you get inspiral from gravitational waves which would be an extraordinarily slow process for most planets.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you had a star that lasts an infinite length of time then you would have to assume that the star has an infinite fuel (unphysical but that is the price for infinite lifetime) which then could balance with the tidal dissipation.</p>
<p>Neither of these are really very physical situations (basically due to the assumption of infinite time)! The reality is that equilibrium states are only temporary and the end result will be ejection or collision.</p></div>		</li>
