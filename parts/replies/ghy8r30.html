			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but if something went wrong, like a payment being delayed, there is usually noone there to check the payroll was run successfully or to receive the calls from staff wondering where their paycheck is. And not many (or no) support staff working at the bank or the payroll software provider to iron out any issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if there's a problem on Saturday, you will call the payroll office and no one will be there to pick up the phone.  Better to pay you on Friday or Monday.</p>
<p>Most banks are only open short hours on Saturday and closed Sunday, so the payroll office would have limited ability to contact the bank to correct such a problem, so again, wait until Monday or pay out on Friday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re missing the point of the question. I run payroll at my company. I have to have it submitted to the payroll company by 4 pm the day before payday. If payday is a holiday I’d have to submit payroll an extra day early. There should be no reason why after I submit payroll that funds couldn’t be dispersed to employee accounts on a weekend or holiday. At that point everything should be automated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly. Everyone is putting in a wrong narrative about &quot;lead days&quot; and &quot;the payroll company doing it&quot;. </p>
<p>Banks just don't pay pre-authorized payments or direct deposits on weekends for pay, it's just how it is. Nothing to do with the 3rd party payroll processor. Ask them (banks) to start doing that and they start including Saturday as a business day and banks have changed their entire ethos. </p>
<p>As personally, you make the request that's a lot easier to facilitate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the case but it’s because your employer is submitting their payroll early. At my company payday is Friday. I submit payroll on the Thursday before. If payday is a holiday, like it was this past week with New Year’s Day, then I would have to submit payroll on Wednesday. Employees would be paid early. </p>
<p>The original question, I believe, is why can’t banks disperse payments on a holiday or weekend? There’s no reason why automatic bank transfers can’t take place on a holiday or weekend. There’s nothing that would need human interaction at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Payroll usually needs to go through internal approvals in order to process the payments. Can involve multiple teams within a company (payroll, accounting, tax, treasury) depending on the size of the company that probably are not in the office during weekend. There is also the added delay if a company uses a third party such as ADP that actually pays the employees i.e. company sends/approves payroll on the 28th to ADP who then takes a day or two to process on their end. There are also limitations depending on how the payroll payments themselves are processed. Paying someone via wire for example can be instantaneous, but also is an expensive option for both the sender and recipient (banks are awesome that way). Most payroll payments, at least in the US are paid via ACH method these days which is a lot cheaper but slower than wire payments. Also, most banks do not process payments over the weeken. Even if a company wanted to pay someone during the weekend and did say process payment on a Saturday, recipient would not get their payment until the the banks are open. Sending bank may be open and is able to send a payment out, but if recipient bank isn't open...recipient will only get their payment once their bank is open for business.
Information above is mostly US based and restricted to corporations. Cannot speak to areas such as retail and service where there is more variation in schedules and smaller businesses involved. US banking technology is a bit outdated compared to other developed countries...which shouldn't be too much of a surprise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wires are risky and require much more control so they are expensive. They aren’t intended for small scale stuff. Also ACH transactions go through the FED, which is closed on non-banking days. That’s why nothing happens on the weekend. Even banks that are open are just using a provisional credit system until the next banking day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is answer. I’m the US most companies distribute payroll via ACH so it is contingent on the FED being open. For your transferring money other protocols are being used such as bank to bank direct payments or credit card networks. When I use Venmo I can send money to a person instantly but if I want to withdraw the money it takes 3 days because they ACH it to my bank account.</p></div>		</li>
