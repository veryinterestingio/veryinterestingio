			<div class="markdown"><p>And some people experience a medical phenomenon called sexually linked sneezing, though it hasn't been thoroughly studied since even the most significant cases don't impact quality of life, and because it's underreported due to embarrassment. Basically it seems to be that brains can just end up wired that way.</p>
<p>If I lay on my back, close my eyes, and ruminate on an imaginary scenario with a subversive sexual/romantic dynamic, I usually sneeze within 10 seconds of starting. The sneeze, while pleasurable in and of itself, is quite the jarring interuption to my sexual train of thought and the general headspace.</p>
<p>Interestingly it turns out that sex and romance in real life doesn't cause me to sneeze, but considering that physical, visual, and auditory stimuli always seemed to interfere with the reflex, I wasn't too surprised. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>
