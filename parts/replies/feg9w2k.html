			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the 90s in the UK there were tons of debt consolidation companies, I dunno what happened to them but there would be like 10 atv ads a day 'are you in over you're head with multiple debts? Can't keep up with all your repayments? Why not consolidate all those debts into one easy monthly payment!!' my niece did it at the time and they gave her a check instead of sending seperate checks to the companies she owed money and she just out it in her bank and blew it lol she ended up having to declare bankruptcy.  Seemed inevitable loaning people money who aren't good with money in that fashion would backfire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This lax approach to lending in the 90s and 00s is a big part of what led up to the 2008 financial crisis. What was happening was that people were getting way more relaxed about lending practices across the board because smaller lenders realized they could package a bunch of these really shitty loans together with loans that were merely kind of bad and sell them to bigger banks and investors, who accepted that a certain percentage of the loans would not be repaid but wanted the higher interest rates. Now this wasn't a super big deal until people started doing it with mortgages, and that's where shit got crazy. People were lending insane amounts of money in mortgages to people who really couldn't afford the debt by using interest free periods and stuff like that. The packages of mortgage debt ended up entering huge swaths of the US economy, and several institutions collapsed or nearly collapsed when a large proportion of these mortgages started going into default.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often the money made off of investments outpaces the interest on the debt acquired making those investments.</p>
<p>If you can buy a house for cash or get a 30-yr loan with 4% interest, get the loan every time. Put that cash into the market where it'll get an average return of about 7%. Use the interest on the market returns to pay the mortgage and you'll have a house and way more cash in the end. </p>
<p>Is the same reason that the US national debt isn't a big problem. The interest on the national debt is lower than inflation, so defecit spending is actually cheaper than just paying cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do many companies operate on debt and just make payments? And these places they are borrowing from, are they fine with lending so much because they get payments from many different sources? Like how does anyone have money with it moving so much. Won't there just always be outstanding debts in the never ending cycle until a company sells all it's assests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. As long as the bank or whoever you’re loaning from has confidence you’re able to make the payments, they’re willing to loan you money forever. They’re getting a consistent return on their investment, so why stop? If they ever had doubts about your ability to pay off the debts, they’d either sell your debt to someone else or call it in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most companies operate on debt because the debt is cheaper than their return.</p>
<p>The lemonade stand analogy is fitting here.</p>
<p>Let's say you and your competitor each want to open a lemonade stand. Lets assume you have $5,000 cash, and you dont want to assume any debt. Let's also assume that you can double your money in a year by selling lemonade. You go and spend $5,000 on all the things you need to run your lemonade stand, and at the end of the year you have $10,000 cash. You've made $5,000, a healthy 100% return on your investment. </p>
<p>Now, let's say your competitor has access to the same lemonade market you do, but instead of using their own money, they go to a bank and get a loan of $50,000. This loan will cost them 10% interest this year, and let's say the whole loan is due in a single payment at the end of the year of $55,000 (for ease of calculation.) Your competitor spends the $50,000 they borrowed on all the things they'll need to operate their lemonade stand, and at the end of the year they have $100,000. They pay the bank the $55,000 they owe for the loan, and now they have $45,000 in pure profit left over, so they have $40,000 more than you.</p>
<p>The return on investment is the same, minus the interest, but since your competitor had access to more money, they now have more money to show for their time.</p>
<p>And the bank is happy with the return they got because the bank gets to participate in fractional lending meaning they can lend more money than they actually have in their possession, so their cash over cash return on investment is a lot higher than the 10% interest rate they charged you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can borrow money at a low interest rate, you can use it to make more money. Say you can take out a loan for like 2% interest. If you are sure you can get a return on investment of 5%, you are basically getting 3% of the borrowed amount for free. The lenders really don't care how much debt you're in as long as you're making your payments on time and in the amount requested. Further, when it comes to corporate debt, debt holders are prioritized above everyone else im terms of getting paid if the company goes bankrupt. Say you buy a car and have $5000 of debt that you don't pay. If the bank can repossess and resell your car for $4500, they didn't really lose much money. It's the same with a company. The debt holders can reclaim company assets in s bankruptcy situation too.</p></div>		</li>
