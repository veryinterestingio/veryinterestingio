			<div class="markdown"><p>While sunlight has indeed something to do with vitamin D, the vitamin plays no roles on our sleep. It is synthetized in our skin after a series of reactions, in which one of them needs sun exposure to occur.</p>
<p>I think what you're trying to say is melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep-wake cicles, and its synthesis is regulated   by our exposure to sunlight (actually, sunlight supresses it).</p></div>		</li>
