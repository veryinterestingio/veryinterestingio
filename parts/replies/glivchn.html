			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, all materials can flexes before getting bent. The smaller the rod the more it can flex before it really bend. It is mostly based on the rod diameter. Let's say you need 100 times the diameter for the bend radius. a 1&quot; mean 100&quot; radius. A 1&quot; cable containing a bunch of 0.1&quot; strands, you take the strands, not the cable, so 0.1&quot; times 100 is 10&quot; bend radius, which mean a simple 20&quot; diameter pulley will keep it into the elastic region and not create any permanant bent, so will not disform the strand, so no bond breakage. If it would be a 1&quot; rod, it would need a 200&quot;, or near 17 foot wide pulley !</p>
<p>If you need even tighter bents, you can get a cable made of even smaller strands, which, in theory, will allow an even smaller pulley to be used without any damage.</p>
<p>Take glass for example. A glass rod break with almost no bending. Take an optical fiber. It is so small that you can almost make a knot in it before it break! This show the importance of using small strands when you need flexibility!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why are chains preferred to cables for things like stage rigging? The metal in the chain links isn't being made to flex?</p>
<p>I get that chains are easier to store, but surely cables have an advantage of having so many strands? With a chain, if one link breaks, it could be a disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chains are much easier to connect and disconnect at arbitrary lengths, and you can tell at a glance if the connection is solid. Chains also break down and store more cleanly than coiled cable, and chains will never fray and stab you in the hand like cable does.</p>
<p>Just a couple thoughts...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cables are safe enough so long as you inspect them properly and look after them. </p>
<p>Chains are also pretty hard to kill. Their advantage is that the metal doesn’t flex when you bend the chain so you’re not constantly fatigue loading it with every run over the drum. (Again, not a major provided you don’t put a cable over a pulley under the recommended minimum diameter)</p>
<p>I suspect the main reason though is that you can run chain through a smaller diameter winch and store it in a bucket or bag under the winch instead of needing a large pulley and headroom can be a big deal in theaters</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider is that chains don't store energy along the whole length of chain, unlike a cable. So if a chain <em>does</em> break, it's much less likely to decapitate someone.</p></div>		</li>
