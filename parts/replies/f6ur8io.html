			<div class="markdown"><p>Which alcohols are you using as modifiers for surfactants? I use all kinds as humectants, preservative boosters, water binders, anti-freeze, and solvents, but I’m having trouble thinking of ones that might be good as thickeners and skin feel modifiers. I’m always on the lookout for more, even though I must have 100+ in my inventory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never seen fatty alcohols used as thickeners for foamy, bubbly, lathery surfactants, except lotions used as cleansers or “no shampoo” hair cleansers, which are just conditioners. Using a fatty alcohol would create an opaque product, and the pearlizers and thickeners with which I’m familiar include esters. Are there some with fatty alcohols? (I should clarify I write about and teach cosmetic formulating, so I’m familiar with a lot of ingredients, but always eager to hear about more.)</p></div>		</li>
