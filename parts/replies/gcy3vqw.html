For rimfire cartridges -<br />
22 Short - .222&quot;<br />
22 LR     - .223&quot;<br />
22 Mag   - .224&quot;    </p>
<p>.22 caliber centerfire cartridges are even more confusing<br />
.218 Bee<br />
.219 Zipper<br />
.220 Swift<br />
.221 Fireball<br />
.222 Remington<br />
.223 Remington/5.56 NATO - same cartridge, different specs<br />
.224 Weatherby<br />
.225 Winchester<br />
and 22 Hornet all fire .224&quot; projectiles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cartridges are ignited by something called a primer- an impact-sensitive substance contained within a (usually) brass pocket. When this primer is hit by the gun's firing pin, that is what sets the cartridge off.</p>
<p>There are two common ways to hold the primer. One is in a ring shape within the outer rim of a cartridge, ergo &quot;rimfire&quot;. This is cheap to manufacture, but the brass body of the cartridge is permanently deformed when fired. The other way is within a separate pocket for the primer that's mechanically fixed in the center of the cartridge's brass body. This arrangement is called &quot;centerfire&quot; and it's more expensive to manufacture, but the spent primer bodies can be removed and the brass can be reused in making new cartridges.</p></div>		</li>

For the most part you can shoot .223 in a 5.56 gun, but typically not the other way around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot more to it than diameter of the bullet itself. I'm not super well versed on the technicalities of the subject (would appreciate anyone jumping in to correct if I say something wrong), but the basic way to sum it up is that the common .22 Long Rifle cartridge just doesn't have the same kinetic energy as a 5.56 round - their bullets have similar diameters but that's just about all that's the same. 5.56 has a much longer, larger case, which means it has more propellant &gt;!not exactly accurate to call it gunpowder, true gunpowder stopped being used in most firearms, but it fills the same purpose!&lt;. The 5.56 round also has an entirely different shaped bullet. So it's fired with much more energy and it has different aerodynamic qualities to keep that kinetic energy over longer distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that makes sense. I don't need the white sheet. In the same way a 9mm pistol bullet is &quot;bigger&quot; than a 5.56, it isn't really at all. Faster, harder, stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can tl;dr it as </p>
<p>“.22lr is a generally smaller, slower projectile compared to .223/5.56. .223/5.56 being much faster create greater wounds, and the projectile construction is generally better suited for stopping medium game or humans” </p>
<p>Your overall idea is correct tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just real quick, “stopping power” is a myth. The closest you can come to is “hydrostatic shock”. </p>
<p>.22lr is generally used for Olympic competitions and stuff due to cost and controllability. Those are generally focused on target acquisition and accuracy, not actually killing people. </p>
<p>.223/5.56 move fast enough to create greater wounds, and generally have heavier projectiles or better constructed speciality projectiles like hollowpoints or penetrator tips. </p>
<p>.22lr is closer to pistol caliber than intermediate caliber like .223/5.56.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>.22lr ammo typically is a 40 grain round nose bullet with a muzzle velocity of around 1000 feet per second or less. A 5.56 nato 62 grain bullet with a muzzle velocity of 3200 feet per second. It's a physics thing called &quot;energy&quot; or knock down power. Speed kills. Bullets hit with tremendous energy and either tumble, mushroom or fragment depending on the design.  This causes massive cavitation and shock that a .22lr just does not do. Look at some youtube videos with 5.56 on ballistics gel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This touches on something in ballistics that many don't realize or fail to see. </p>
<p>Same gun + different ammo + differing distances = massively different results. </p>
<p>I have a friend that hunts deer and uses a .300 win mag. For a couple years he was frustrated that he wasn't dropping the deer and had to track them for hundreds or thousands of yards to find his kill, if he found it at all. </p>
<p>Turns out he was using .300 win mag ballistic silver tip ammunition. While those rounds offer more precision and knockdown power over long distances, he was typically shooting sub-200 yard shots. The rounds, at that distance, were just moving too fast and had no expanded cavitation so it would just travel straight through the deer with minimal blood loss and the deer was able to run much further before dying.</p>
<p>Those rounds are marketed as having more knockdown power, but they typically fail to mention that that's over longer distances, so he believed that he had a better chance of a humane kill even though the opposite was true at the distances that he was shooting.</p></div>		</li>
