<li>There’s a thing in high rise buildings for hot water circulation called a flow and return line. Basically these pipe lines move the water around as necessary. </li>
<li>The reason for this is the temperature of hot water can never drop below a certain temperature (60*c, I’m not sure about Fahrenheit) because if it does it is the perfect breeding ground for diseases to grow such as legionnaires and cholera. </li>
<li>The volume of water stored in the pipe lines of high rise buildings is so great that a flow and return line is necessary for two reasons, 1) so people aren’t waiting for 20 minutes to get hot water and 2) to prevent those diseases from growing. In the case of your home, the temperature in your hot water heater is so great that the diseases don’t have the opportunity to grow and the length of the pipes in your home aren’t long enough (especially in comparison to a high rise) to warrant worrying about the diseases growing in them. The heat is lost quite quickly in your hot water pipes in your average home and the breeding temperature is quite specific. </li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helped in some way and wasn’t too hard too convoluted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be prohibitively expensive at the scale of most large buildings.  Large office buildings may have hundreds of individual bathrooms, and large residential towers may have 300, 500, or even more dwellings.</p>
<p>They install several large boilers and circulation pumps. As water temperature drops in portions of the system the pumps push fresh hot water around, and push the warm water that has cooled somewhat back to a boiler to warm back up. Everyone gets hot water quickly because the line from the hot mains to the faucet is fairly short, and there is little waste because the cooled water (which is still quite warm) gets put back into another water heater so most of the heat stays in the system. The exact number of units depends on how rapidly users pull water at peak hours, such as during morning showers. A large building may have 5 or 6 or 10 boilers, far cheaper than 300+ small water heaters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually it's because the hot water pipe runs in a loop, and the water in the pipe is always moving regardless of whether anybody is using the water or not. This requires a little bit of energy to keep the water flowing at all times, but you're then guaranteed that the water in every part of the pipe is hot, and so people have instant access to hot water (only the very short pipe from the main pipe to the tap needs to be flushed out). If you do this, generally you'd have the pipes insulated a bit so that the heat isn't all lost into the surrounding parts of the building. You can get this done in any building, even houses, but it costs a little more obviously as you need more pipes and some way of keeping it moving.</p></div>		</li>
