			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this: an atom is gold because of the number of protons in it. (More or fewer protons, and it changes to a different element.) With even only 79 protons, there’s just no way to make it lighter than water (two protons for hydrogen and about the mass of 16 protons for the protons and neutrons in normal water, for a total of about 18.)</p>
<p>I’m also assuming that your talking about a solid mass (or liquid gold) not floating in water. If you made a boat out of gold leaf, for example, it still might be able to float...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hell, I know engineers who had to design, build, and test concrete canoes in university and would only pass the course if they worked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even removing a neutron from Au-197 (the isotope that all-natural gold on earth is made of) you get Au-196 that has a half-life of 6.2 days.</p>
<p>Even adding neutron would be a problem and AU-198 has a half-life of 2.7 days. Au-197 is the only stable gold isotope.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you remove 26 neutrons and get Au-171 the half-life is 30 microseconds. Au-171 is the element in the wiki article  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_gold" target="_blank">Isotopes_of_gold</a> with the fewest neutrons with halflife tested in labs.</p>
<p>After 79 half-lives 1 mole of gold would decay to 1 atom and for a half-life of 30 microseconds that time is 0.002s So if you removed 28 neutrons from 1 mole of gold atoms all would have decayed in a lot less then a hundred of a  second and you would no longer have any gold. The released energy would be enough to vaporize the block that was gold and is not another unsuitable element. </p>
<p>If a calculate correctly just the initial decay of 1 mole of Au-171 releases the same amount of energy as 45 tonnes of exploding TNT. So we talk about energy release more than any conventional weapon. Half of that would be released in the first 30 microseconds. The gold will have become a very large dirty bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to my knowledge. You can add neutrons by shooting them at atom. Almost all atoms after iron is the periodic table was created when they was by neutrons when start exploded in supernovas.</p>
<p>Depending on the speed of the neutron and what isotope you hit the result might be a reflected or absorbed by the core or the core get split into two. </p>
<p>All will happen in a nuclear reactor. Some atoms reflect the neutron and is used to control the reaction like how heavy water slow down neutron in some reactor. Other absorbe them like uranium-238  that is transmuted to plutonium-239 that is used in nuclear weapons is made. Some like Uranium-235 is split ad release a lot of energy.</p>
<p>To the besot of my knowledge there is not way to remove neutrons except for natural radioactive decay.</p></div>		</li>
