			<div class="markdown"><p>Rub burns hurt a lot for a couple reasons. Skin has a lot of nerves, because we use it for feeling our environment. Many of these nerve endings are very close to the surface. Because abrasive/rubbing injuries (like a carpet burn) cover a lot of surface area on the skin, a lot of nerves are activated, so you’ll get a big surge of pain. Also friction generates heat, which activates more pain receptors. Connective tissue isn’t hugely implicated here. </p>
<p>If you’re thinking of the arm twisting burn trick everyone’s older brother subjected them to in middle school tho, I’d imagine connective tissue could play more of a role. Nerves don’t like their environment being shifted around. The connective tissue between skin and lower layers of tissue (and connecting skin to itself) could lead to tension in the skin when the skin is pulled, leading to activation of pain receptors. Also, the skin is being pulled very quickly and very hard against itself, which will lead to pain independent from the tension caused by connective tissue.</p></div>		</li>
