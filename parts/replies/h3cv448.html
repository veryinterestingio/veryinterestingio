Everything you said is very accurate as far as I can tell, and the philosophizing about how we usually teach (most things but especially science) in bite-sized chunks full of simplifications and generalizations is near and dear to me. I had several conversations with professors about this approach during my undergrad and while the good ones mentioned it in class, it usually doesnt settle in very well. The standard pedagogical model here is useful, but it can also be misleading for some students. </p>
<p>To OP, others have mentioned the energy density issue. Also note that in one day, the average human synthesizes roughly 50-70 kg of ATP - and consumes that same amount in various cellular processes. Storing ATP is less practical than waiting for the mitochondria to make more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good lord, I have taken so many biochem courses and tests at this point, and this is one of the most illustrative phrases I've ever heard. Kudos!</p></div>		</li>
