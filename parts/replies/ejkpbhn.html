			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to un-grad student it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In quantum electrodynamics the particles we call electrons and positrons are the states described by the quantum field in the limit of negligible interactions (i.e. when the particle is too far from any other particles for any significant interaction to occur). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Electrons&quot; and &quot;positrons&quot; are names of things that aren't actually discrete spacial entities we're used to, like tennis balls or marbles. Instead, they are extended in space. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this limit the particles are described by the free field states (a.k.a. Fock states). This is a fancy way to say that, according to this &quot;picture&quot;, speaking about electrons and positrons only makes sense if there is nothing else in the universe (i.e., electrons and positrons -and anything else, really- are not balls).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of a marble on your living room floor, you can think of the whole floor as a &quot;marble field&quot; where a &quot;marble&quot; might have more of a probability of existing in one place than another. Instead of &quot;the marble is by the couch&quot; it's &quot;the marble is most likely near the couch and less likely near the door, but we won't know until we go to check for a marble.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, when interactions become significant the states of the quantum field are perturbed away from the free field states. We can calculate this with perturbation theory, to calculate scattering probabilities, but we don't actually know what the states are. So in the annihilation process it isn't really the case that there is one electron and one positron present because the state of the quantum field cannot simply be described as an electron state and a positron state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things get complicated when you're not just dealing with a marble field, but also a toy car field and a lego field all at once on the floor. We use estimates to make calculations about what all the toys are doing and whether or not they're bumping into each other, but they're not 100% accurate because things are too complicated. There aren't discrete &quot;marble over here&quot; and &quot;train over here&quot; measurements in the big jumbled up living room floor state.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you insist in calling this &quot;electrons&quot; and &quot;positrons&quot;, however, I don't believe there is a theoretical limit on the distance. But bear in mind that in quantum mechanics particles are not point-like; instead, they are &quot;distributed in space&quot; according to the wavefunction, so saying where they are is problematic (because they are in many places at the same time, according to the wavefunction).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There isn't a maximum distance for which the marbles and trains interact, since they're all over the living room floor at one time. There's just more likely and less likely places. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this scenario wouldn’t the interaction occur then where <if> one was observe a specific space at the correct time such that a marble and car were present ‘by the couch’ than interaction occurs?</p>
<p>Isn’t the ‘no maximum distance’ then just a weird way to describe uncertainty of position and not actually saying anything about the actual distance between marbles and cars an interaction occurs?</p>
<p>I’m having trouble understanding why the field described is anything other than a map of potential marble and car locations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, quantum size particles like an electron are better described as a probability of being in any one place/state, due to quantum uncertainty. We tend to think that there is one ultimate precise calculation, but there are calculations that show if verifiably isnt. As a TL;DR for the rest of it: Distance really doesn't make sense at this scale, and they can be (more or less) arbitrarily close or far away from each other before annihilating, but we can predict how often that'll happen with some advanced physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there anything known about the actual process of annihilation?</p>
<p>I mean, what precisely happens? It's obviously not 2 balls hitting each other and going <em>poof</em> so is it instead, what, 2 waves cancelling each other out? 2 things that experience attraction and then I don't know, absorbing something? Reacting somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both simultaneously just cease to exist.  Whether you view it as a particle of wave, there's nothing there but ordinary empty space.</p>
<p>The annihilation produces energy as gamma radiation, as per E=MC^2.  For a single particle pair, this would be difficult to even observe without instruments, because an electron has such a tiny mass.  </p>
<p>However, a nuclear bomb only loses a few grams of mass as energy.   </p>
<p>1 gram (500mg antimatter contacting normal air) is the equivalent of  21 kilotons of nuclear bomb, which is a modern &quot;big one&quot;.  </p>
<p>What would happen if you had a 500mg rock of antimatter magnetically suspended in a vacuum, and then opened a valve to let in some air, in nanoseconds the first few annihilations will begin and pulverize the rock, propelling antimatter dust out at very high speed.</p>
<p>This will drastically increase the contact of antimatter and normal matter, regardless of state.  So in nano or picoseconds it will all annihilate.</p>
<p>So you have a nanosecond where you've got terajoules of gamma radiation traveling outwards from a small radius.  It is so dense it will vaporize anything solid or liquid in the immediate vicinity, and the atmospheric absorption of gamma means it will be stopped, should mostly in hundreds of meters.  But that will heat the air past the the where it glows with <em>visible</em> light. </p>
<p>That is a nuclear &quot;fireball&quot; of vaporized lab and superheated air.</p>
<p>The heated air creates very high pressures that move outward at the speed of sound.  The overpressure will destroy things over a much larger radius.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is it always gamma radiation and not say xrays? Is it because the energy released is always of such a large quantity (due to the masses involved?) Does it have to be one photon / what if the energy is split across multiple photons? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And often this is completely reasonable. If we knock two billiard balls together we can look at mechanical waves, electromagnetic interaction of individual atoms, Lennard-Jones potentials or various other models of what's going on. Is there anything like that for annihilation?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just in the same way you can nullify two opposite charges in a battery, you can nullify two opposite charges in a particle and it's corresponding &quot;negative&quot; version</p>

<p>An imbalance of charges in a battery has nothing to do with a matter anti matter particle pair. There you even out the imbalance by moving charges over to the other reservoir. The particles don't annihilate to produce photons.</p></div>		</li>
