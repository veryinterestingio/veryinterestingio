			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;technologies that have come to replace it&quot; is mostly Javascript and HTML/CSS getting beefed up in the graphics department so fancy animated stuff and web games don't need flash anymore. Those run in a &quot;sandbox&quot; and cannot affect your actual operating system, while Flash and Java (the Java-Java not Javascript, they are completely unrelated) had the same running permissions and access as a program installed on your PC. The most visible change is that now the only way to get files out of a webpage is by &quot;downloading&quot; it even if it was created locally. It used to be that Flash/Java could write files directly to your PC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically the Javascript sandbox can be escaped by the likes of rowhammer, no sandbox is perfect.</p>
<p>Javascript engines limit functionality for security purposes for this reason, for example timing is deliberately imprecise. But that can only help against known escapes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flash and Java Applets run on the approach of &quot;Allow everything as a base, and limit it afterwards&quot;</p>
<p>Browsers nowadays operate on &quot;Do not allow anything, and open up more later.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most have focused on narrower capabilities.  Just presenting a video or running an interactive element that stays completely inside the browser.  These things work just as well in the sandbox provided by browsers.  The dangerous capabilities, like accessing local files, just aren't present in Flash replacements because there is no safe way to do them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The engineers thought ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be cool if Flash apps could look at files on the local drive‚Äù..</p>
<p>It was the same with some of the first versions of Windows that had internet- MS engineers thought ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be cool if you could just email a script, and have it run when the recipient opened the email?‚Äù</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, engineers were screaming bloody murder from the first second... but marketing wanted flashy shit, so they paid for flashy shit to be made, and for stuff to make the flashy shit happen.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, they called the shit to make the most flashy one of them just that: Flash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's maybe better to say &quot;The thing that makes it powerful also makes it dangerous&quot; which is a pretty common correlation in computing. The more control you give a program the more it can do, but the harder it is to keep it from doing something you don't want it to do. </p>
<p>That's why it's dangerous to run a program as administrator but also people do it all the time because some programs need that power to function. It kind of comes down to how much you trust the program you're running, and flash is scary because it could run on any website you go on and you shouldn't trust every website you go to.</p></div>		</li>
