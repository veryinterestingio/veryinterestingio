			<div class="markdown"><p>I have rarely given up on a historical novel halfway through. I’ve read every word of Jean Auel’s Children of the Earth series and am probably qualified to kill, butcher, skin, and cure a full-grown mammoth after all of that wordy descriptiveness.</p>
<p>But damn if I didn’t put down Pillars at about 2/3 of the way through. I had to google the ending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I’ve read it twice; really good book, and you will appreciate cathedrals so much more. There is a sequel that is also great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By Ken Follett? I own that book but haven't read it. I thought it was mostly theological and it has sat on a shelf for years. I did enjoy his other books.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's architectural and socioeconomic. Not at all theological. I mean the priory is economically critical to the town and constructing the cathedral so you do get some religion and politics but no one sits down for theological discourses. It's more along the lines of the Earl of Badguyton undercutting wages to deprive the cathedral project of workers and getting the Bishop to transfer it to him so the Prior and the master Mason cook up a plan to whip up volunteers to work part time on the cathedral in penance for their sins. It's religion as part of medieval life not philosophical theology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then I must've misjudged it. I'll bring it with me on the road next week and see if I can find some spare time to finally get around to reading it. Or next audiobook purchase. Thank you, I appreciate your explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same - but I took it on vacation as I felt bad buying a new book when I have a whole 'to read' stack, and I seriously couldn't put it down. Read the whole thing in 10 days. Then came home and got a 7 day free trial to binge the miniseries on Starz. (also really good!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got it from my grandfather after he saw my other Follett Books on the shelf several years ago. When I get home I'll dig it out and put it in my bag for next week.</p></div>		</li>
