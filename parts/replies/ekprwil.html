			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes people can be allergic to other people's bodily fluids.</p>
<p>Cat hair allergy isn't actually a hair allergy, but allergy to proteins from that cats saliva.</p>
<p>In humans allergies to male semen for example is a pretty well known, if rare, condition.</p>
<p>Otherwise no, you can't infect someone with an allergy by just transfering an allergic persons blood or saliva to another person.</p>
<p>It is however a possibility, an very rare one, for an allergy to be transferred during a bone marrow transplant: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3342348/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3342348/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I always love when a medical professional answers like this... it lends a little humor, expresses how palpable the future of the idea is, and shows that there hasn't been a shortage of thought put into trying to solve the puzzle.</p></div>		</li>
