			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. But also as other people mentioned, no shows are a well studied event and there is an entire market for standby tickets to fill those seats and double dip on the ticket prices. </p>
<p>The thing that most people don't realize is that business travel is a huge part of the industry. For a business, a few grand either way is 100% worth it if you need someone there. It's kind of the same justification for Premium and Business class. Most pleasure travelers don't care but when you get on a plane at 7pm, fly overnight and need to be in a meeting at 9am in a clean suit and impress a client only to hop back on a plane and go home that night, you want that extra space, the better food, and the services that those higher tiers provide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is crazy, business travelers make up the bulk of their bottom line. They honestly don't care too much about pleasure travelers because at any given time they make up a tiny fraction of their customers.</p>
<p>Just go to any major hub Sunday night or Monday morning. They tend to be mad houses and they're all business travelers. Same with Thursday night or Friday. It's so frequent that there are flights between some major cities where passengers and crew get to know each other because they do the trip every week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Hundreds, probably getting close to thousands of flights I've taken in my life, and on two of them was I travelling for pleasure. </p>
<p>Most businesses are happy to pay 2-3k to book last minute flights, because having a representative in a meeting can make or break deals worth hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really a &quot;guaranteed supply&quot;. If there are less wealthy travellers who urgently need to be somewhere, less economy travellers will be bumped from the flight. The <del>bank</del> airline always wins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll layer on another scenario too where they don't even have to rely on last-minute overpriced tickets. </p>
<p>You buy a $1,000 ticket to Shanghai from Sacramento. The airline is making $100 in profit on the ticket.   Imagine it's 1PM in Sacramento.  You have a connecting flight in San Francisco at 6PM to Shanghai.  It's the last flight from San Francisco to Shanghai today.   If they can't get you onto the Sacramento to San Francisco flight right now they'll have to pay to put you in a hotel overnight in San Francisco and pay you a meal voucher. This would cost them let's say $200.   If this happens your ticket ended up not making $100 in profit but costing them $100 in losses. </p>
<p>So they'll offer $100 to someone connecting in SFO to Denver to fly direct them directly to Denver from Sacramento on a smaller plane that isn't full.  &quot;What a deal as a customer! I get $100, I arrive earlier and there is no connection!&quot;   </p>
<p>It's a great deal for the airline too they converted a potential $100 loss into a break even fare.   They also got to still oversell the Sacramento to San Fran flight while last-second moving a passenger to a non-full flight.  So they still made some profit on that fare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup for all the complaining about airlines, they are truly masters of 4d Tetris making sure every flight is as full as possible and people get from a to b no matter how complicated.</p>
<p>I remember being on a flight that got delayed to a point where I was going to miss my connection. They had agents standing outside baggage claim scanning people's tickets as they came out. Everyone who was at risk to mis their flight was handed a new ticket that was already set up. I didn't even break stride on the way through</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WOW that makes sense. This happened while I was on vacation, they asked for volunteers and someone said yes and got $600 of credit or whatever it was. Had to wait about 8 hours later. I was going to go for it but it would have messed up a portion of the plans.</p></div>		</li>
