			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the smaller ones are automatically regrown by the body. Not in the same positions, (entirely new vessel pathways will be grown) but every cell will eventually end up hooked back up to the vascular system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a new word for me today, thank you.</p>
<p>Angiogenesis.  Vein creation.  Amazing.</p>
<p>Edit:  <em>vessel</em> creation, per the correction below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is quite remarkable that in numerous cases if you properly put two tissues close together the organism will find a way to connect them to a certain extent.</p>
<p>You can do this with vein grafting (as we discussed below) in bypass surgery, but there is also an equivalent in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting" target="_blank">horticulture</a>. You can propagate plants by taking branches from another, genetically compatible plant, and joining them together. The branch will fuse into The plant will eventually remodel and will have, e.g. one type of fruit on one side and another type of fruit on the other. Just like those human grafts, this is asexual (your child won't have a vein graft if you had one).</p></div>		</li>
