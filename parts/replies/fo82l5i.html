			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny thing is I'm from Singapore and we have no seasons other than Monsoon but there's still a concept of flu season.</p>
<p>I'm suspecting that the seasons do play a part but not directly.</p>
<p>E.g. I suppose in winter, people stay indoors more, meaning it's easier to spread at home and then to workplace and vice versa?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A major way viruses spread is someone coughs on their hand then touches the pole the whole down the stairs to the rail way. Now that railway pole handle is covered in virus particles. When the temperatures are cool, the virus can live longer on that pole, allowing for more people to touch it and then spread it farther. Warmer temps denature or breakdown virus’ quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold air tends to be dry.  When a person coughs or sneezes into dry air, the droplets form an aerosol more quickly because the dry air has the capacity to take on moisture.  This means the smaller droplets float in the air.  If the air were humid and could not take on more moisture, the droplets fall to the ground.  Many climates are cold and dry in winter, warm and humid in summer.  Long story short, it’s likely less about temperature and more about how temperature relates to humidity.  I design HVAC systems for a living and have been involved with many hospital projects.  This is one reason we humidify hospitals, to reduce airborne transmission. The other is to keep people’s mucous membranes moistened which is another big factor in the body’s ability to block infection at the door so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sunlight is a big factor, possibly above temperature, for two different reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>Sunlight damages or destroys viruses, much how it damages our skin, thus reducing survival times. </li>
<li>Vitamin D plays a large role in immune response. During the winter, essentially everybody living far enough from the equator is vitamin-D deficient, so have weakened immune responses.</li>
