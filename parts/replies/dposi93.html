			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool, thank you. I grew up in a super rural area and while I dont miss a lot of it, I <strong>do</strong> miss the stuff like bird watching and wandering around in the woods discovering cool stuff in nature and pretending to be Grizzly Adams or that kid in &quot;My Side of the Mountain&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big reason is because humans are predators, prey animals don't just hang around predators freely like a Disney movie. And different birds will attack each other for getting too close all the time. Not to mention you usually can't actually see the animals that aren't tolerating each other. But regarding this post, I was once able to get quite close to a wild deer by following the &quot;rules&quot; you could say (I photograph animals). I approached extremely slowly, stopped often, and never looked it in the eye. I also approached diagonally instead of going straight toward it. It was wary but kept on grazing. If you just walk towards it while staring that makes you look like a predator or aggressive in some way, if another animal did that the deer would probably run away from it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who grew up so far in the woods it may as well have been another country:</p>
<p>If you learn to feel the &quot;mood&quot; of the animals, you can pretty comfortably approach them, and some of the larger, more intelligent animals are sometimes curious enough to check you out, too. There were herds of deer where I lived that would let me walk with them, and sometimes even pet them. (I wouldn't recommend it. Ideal viewing distance for wild deer is at least 15-20 feet. They're often not completely sanitary up close)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans also stare impolitely.  You can get much closer to animals if you don't turn your head to look directly at them...and, as you note, if you angle your path to go around them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lately I've taken up going to the park and observing the crows that live there - it fascinates me how you can see behavioural patterns and complex thinking if you just take the time to observe.</p>
<p>Edit: the city has tried to eradicate this crow community and failed &quot;due to the birds recognizing the faces of city employees&quot;. It's so cool.</p></div>		</li>
