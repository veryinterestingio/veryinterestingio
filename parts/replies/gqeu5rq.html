			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it doesn't have to take that long, but there's little motivation to improve it. </p>
<p>Cable would be the easiest to make faster, by basically putting a cable modem in there so you can ask for a chunk of video and immediately get a keyframe instead of just waiting for the next keyframe.</p>
<p>For something like satellite TV, the receiver would have to be MUCH more expensive, as you'd have to make a new receiver that listens to all the channels simultaneously, and buffers everything since the last keyframe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you actually need to listen to every channel, or could you build one that listens selectively to just a few others? Say, one or two channels to either side of the one currently being displayed. (though I'm sure somebody could come up with an adaptive prediction algorithm way better than that.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For cable, a lot of the delay comes from the MPEG-2 standard for video compression and delivery. To display anything, you need to collect some metadata and wait for a video frame to arrive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, MPEG video relies on key frames, the algorithm canâ€™t even begin to show a picture until the next key frame is broadcast, which can vary by as much a a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>
