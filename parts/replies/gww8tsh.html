<p>That mainly applies to mRNA, while most noncoding RNAs are not polyadenylated.</p>
<p>It just so happens that the coronavirus genome in many ways acts like an mRNA - it's translated into protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mRNA in the Covid vaccine contains (as far as I understand) nucleotide sequences which codes for the the antigenic portion(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 cell surface spike protein. This protein is what binds to the ACE2 receptors on our cell surfaces and mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into our cells. </p>
<p>Many different antibodies are made for a single pathogen, with different antibodies targeting different parts/structures, allowing for better recognition and creating a fail-safe of sorts. After phagocytosing (engulfing) an infected cell, phagocytic immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, etc...) &quot;chop up&quot; the pathogen and present certain pieces on their cell surfaces; these cells are referred to as antigen present cells (APC). APC interact with naive T cells via an immunological synapse (the cells bind to each other in a fancy/specific way), and the T cell absorbs the antigen from the APC. </p>
<p>After this, the T cell will do some fancy internal stuff to modify its DNA to produce a protein that will bind to its new antigen. Then it starts dividing, like a lot. Some of the T cells produced become effector T cells (antibody producers), and others will become memory T cells (long term antigen detection). Its actually more complicated than this, and would involve an explanation of humoral vs cell-mediated immunity. This comment is already long enough. </p>
<p>Vaccines are essentially a shortcut to antibody production, and we make them safe by either deactivating (killing) the pathogen before injection, or in the case of mRNA vaccines, introducing antigens which do not directly cause damage  AND allow for easier antibody binding.
The reason for the poly-A tail is to prevent RNases from degrading the vaccine mRNA.</p>
<p>From there it just comes down to good ole' cellular machinery, our ribosomes use the vaccine mRNA to make a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It probably gets some sugar tags added to it in the Golgi apparatus, and then it's voodoo'd up to the cell membrane and eventually presented on the cell surface by our regular cells. Then those phagocytic immune cells come along, recognize the antigen as foreign, and the aforementioned immune cascade begins. There are also a BUNCH of innate immune cells patrolling our bodies at all times, so this process might be a bit faster if the Covid vaccine mRNA, contained in small fat blobs called liposomes, are directly absorbed (endo- or phagocytosed) by immune cells capable of being APC. This might actually be what happens, I'm too lazy to read the papers.</p>
<p>TLDR; Immune system complex, Covid vaccine work real gud.</p>
<p>Edits n stuff</p>
<p>More stuff:</p>
<p>One of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 can even infect us, or any other human-borne virus for that matter, is the fact that their genome codes for the addition of a 5' G-cap and 3' poly-A tail to the mRNA produced from transcription of the viral DNA. Virtually all eukaryotes have these features on their mRNA, and without these features the mRNA would be enzymatically degraded very quickly.</p>
<p>More more stuff: </p>
<p>Just read a paper for my Cell &amp; Molecular class that made this even more complicated! Specifically pertaining to mRNA, there are post-transcriptional modifications to mRNA that either illicit or suppress human immune responses. These modifications are myriad, and their combinations make this topic extremely complex. Essentially, bacterial mRNA doesn't have the same modifications as (most) eukaryotic mRNA, and different toll-like receptors (TLRs) on immune cells recognize different modification motifs; think of it like a friend vs. foe barcode. It seems like many human viruses contain post-transcriptional mRNA modifications similar to human mRNA, allowing them to evade at least one of our immunostimulatory mechanisms. I suppose this makes sense, seeing as their genetic code is made using human cellular machinery. This isn't much help in understanding the effectiveness of the current SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. This is just an example of the background research used to investigate the mechanism and efficacious implementation of mRNA based vaccines.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to the scientist responsible for this research, Dr. Katalin Kariko. Her story is tragic yet inspiring, involving a bout with cancer, the subsequent loss of her prestigious position at UPENN, and her selfless decision to continue her research for a FRACTION of the salary she rightly deserved. We truly do stand on the shoulders of giants. Respect âœŠ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the virus genome wasn't itself similar to an mRNA, this method should still work. Any virus needs to make mRNA to get the cell's ribosomes to make the viral proteins. So you can still just make a vaccine with part of that mRNA sequence, the part that codes for something recognizable on the surface of the virus.</p></div>		</li>
