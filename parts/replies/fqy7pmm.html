			<div class="markdown"><p>How accurate are the &quot;ride reports&quot; and forecasts you saw earlier? Does it pretty much give you a map of where to expect turbulence or just let you know when to be alert for the tiny bumps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly just where to be alert, a lot of the reason we can be more accurate is visual clues in cloud layers and feeling the tiny bumps. You‚Äôll notice we aren‚Äôt nearly as good at predicting it at night for this exact reason!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also an app called ATC where you can hear the pilots. I've heard a pilot call in severe turbulence before and then the atc person advise the other planes that were landing.</p>
<p>Edit: actually to correct that. I don't know if they so much called it in or were just like saying it to the atc person. Maybe there is some electronic way they actually do it. I don't know. That's my only knowledge üòÇ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LiveATC(dot)net is the website! It can go either way, if it‚Äôs light or moderate we are usually just kind of complaining and asking to go to a different altitude or route so we can get out of it. If it‚Äôs severe or extreme then it‚Äôs both a warning and a ‚Äúget us the heck out of here before someone gets hurt‚Äù! The plane can take the turbulence just fine, even in cases of extreme turbulence where things as crazy as ceiling panels falling down can happen, the planes structure is designed to handle it though!</p></div>		</li>
