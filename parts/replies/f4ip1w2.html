			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Here's an article in the <em>International Journal of Preventive Medicine</em> called &quot;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309636/" target="_blank">Vitamin and Mineral Supplements: Do We Really Need Them?</a>&quot;  </p>
<p>Key conclusion in the abstract: &quot;The results of large-scale randomized trials show that, for the majority of the population, there is no overall benefit from taking MVM supplements. Indeed, some studies have shown increased risk of cancers in relation to using certain vitamins.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For women who may or are seeking to become pregnant prenatal vitamins are absolutely a good idea, and medically recommended for good reason. Some birth defects can develop when a mother has a nutrient deficiency (like neural tube defects). A number of these can develop in the first trimester, <em>before a woman even knows she is pregnant.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently things like folic acid sure actually really important during pregnancy, I think it was during neural tube formation. Obgyns definitely recommend prenatal vitamins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not entirely true. Vitamin D for example has shown to have several beneficial anti-inflammatory properties for different diseases. There’s also large disagreement on what a good level is and what’s considered “deficient”.</p>
<p>I agree that if you’re healthy and aren’t having issues then supplements probably aren’t necessary but a blanket statement that they’re just wasteful for everyone that doesn’t have rickets or a blood level below  20 ng/ml isn’t correct.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is recommended for all IBD patients regardless of deficiency. There are also several studies showing benefits of B12 supplementation and a lot of people ARE deficient in B12.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. It's one of those things that people spout out and they think they sound smart but are mostly just ill-informed.</p>
<p>I can take magnesium to help me sleep and poop like a mofo. D helps in various ways and, as you said, may not be deficiency-related. Zinc helped with my acne growing up. These are proven effects.</p></div>		</li>
