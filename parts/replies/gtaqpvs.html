			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it easier or cheaper? I’d be in favor of government offices closing one day during the week to be open one weekend day. No difference in ease or cost. Alternatively, close early every Wednesday, open half a day on Saturday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the DMV is constantly reaching out to other branches of government, tax departments, courthouses, even doctors offices. These places aren’t usually open on weekends. So it doesn’t make sense to open the DMV on Saturday if they can’t connect with other people they need to provide the services people expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even then they may have some branches with extended hours. Maybe a couple branches in a geographic area will have evening hours a couple days a week (or perhaps different branches will have on different days of the week), or Saturday hours, etc. It may not be the one closest to you, but it's technically there if you're willing to go a little farther.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They still interact with the back-end which is the bulk of the office. The front counter at a bank is a couple of tellers, but the back-end is the people who are running bigger transactions, managing accounts, etc. </p>
<p>If the back-end is already open, it doesn't cost the bank much to also keep the front end open to serve smaller clients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably closer to the real answer.  It's mostly convenient to the company to have everyone working at the same time.  Less payroll, fewer employees, slightly less overhead.</p>
<p>I'm sure that for every hour of increased operating hour is a tremendous amount of expense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're right. And my bank is definitely open Saturdays, maybe (idk) Sundays. I think a better answer would have explained how the world has slowly changed from a slow, patient world into one where everything is expected to happen as quickly as possible. Bank hours have slowly been changing to meet our changing expectations of when they should be open and as we put selective pressure on banks to do so, but in the 60s people simply accepted that they would need to go to the bank before Friday afternoon (and employers were more accomidating about these things, too, before ATMs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately Covid has been the perfect excuse to slip back into those old, shitty hours. They claim to be closing early to &quot;sanitize&quot;, but they just fuck off and leave.</p>
<p>The previously 24/7 grocery stores now open at 7AM and close at 11PM. It will take years before they ever consider going back to 24/7. Too much money being saved not having to deal with the public for that 3rd shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not quite as large orders as OP described happen at the post office but I’ve definitely worked in offices and seen how much physical mail some of them send. It’s literally hand carts full of boxes of mail that go out regularly, often with staff physically taking it to the nearest post office. Far more than any individual is doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a guy that worked at USPS in the back doing distribution logistics.  He worked mostly overnight.  The counter service is completely separate from actual distribution.</p>
<p>So OP's question still remains valid and these claims that counter service works &quot;business hours&quot; because of corporate business doesn't make sense.  Counter service folks aren't dealing with corporate accounts.  Counter service is specifically there to deal with Joe Average customers and Joe Average is generally stuck working their own &quot;business hour&quot; job.</p></div>		</li>
