			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually the rear is where you have the least traction for the majority of the time… that’s why people will deliberately use sandbags in the bed to increase traction. Seems like bad design to choose driven wheels based on the assumption the driver will always be towing or have a half ton of rocks in the bed. Not saying you’re wrong, but I’d doubt that was a factor in the design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be a “poor design” now, but when trucks were initially designed and built, people used them for an actual purpose. Some “trucks” and SUVs have moved over to FWD primarily. Honda is an example of this with  the CR-V, Ridgeline, Element. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this exactly. I live in a rural, mountainous, snowy area, and every third vehicle on the road is a truck. They're all being used for heavy work. I've pulled trees out of the ground, pulled dozens of vehicles out of snowy ditches, and hauled literally tons of wood, wood pellets, stones, fill, topsoil, manure, mulch, trash, and construction materials either in the bed or on a trailer. A FWD truck would be unable/unsafe to compete these tasks, especially when towing. The force of the trailer down on the hitch causes the front wheels to lift, like a see saw. So when you need the most traction for pulling someone out of a ditch, the weight of the load would reduce your traction, instead of increasing it like it does in a RWD system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but I feel like that’s aside from the original question as to why rear wheels are primarily the driven wheels. I’d argue that weight distribution wasn’t a big design consideration. The much more likely answer is that driving the rear wheels is quite a bit more simple, design wise, than driving the front wheels, especially on a 4x4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the purpose of a truck though... to haul things.  </p>
<p>Most people who own trucks will happily work with okay performance unloaded, in exchange for good performance when loaded.  I don't need extreme traction in my truck to drive around town picking up groceries.  But when I'm pulling a boat up a wet launch ramp, you bet your ass I want as much traction as I can get.</p></div>		</li>
