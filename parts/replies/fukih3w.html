			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok this is interesting. I learned the same about the towels as a kid in the UK, except that I have never heard of a pole with blue. If you Google 'barber pole uk' they're mostly just red and white. </p>
<p>Another user posted a different theory from Wikipedia so maybe the towels idea is an urban legend, but I never realised there were different coloured versions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I missed that article posted by another user, but I remember someone from either Rick's Restorations or Pawn Stars talking about the towels thing, and I like to think that is what really happened. </p>
<p>Either way, I guess the general idea is that it's an homage to what represented barbers back then, whether it's the towels or some other symbolism. </p>
<p>Also, I wonder if other countries have other colors in theirs as well?</p></div>		</li>
