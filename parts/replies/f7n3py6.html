			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I think in Europe it's beneficial for cars to be small as &quot;real estate&quot; space is smaller, not enough parking spots, etc.
I know in Greece most of the villages have roads that are only big enough for 2 small cars. Even if a big car or truck is conceivable in other ways, you'd be a complete dick if you're taking up the whole road.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I rode on a lot of southern European countryside, and many roads are hardly wide enough for a single car. But it works since the traffic isn't too heavy, and if two cars meet, they each steer off the road a bit...</p></div>		</li>

My sister pays more for her new Skoda Karoq with 1.6 liter engine and Euro6 than I do with my old Nissan Primera with a 1.8 liter engine and Euro 3 or 4, because theirs is taxed based on emission and mine based on engine displacement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. </p>
<p>At highway speeds up to a point larger engines can be more efficient, barring technology like turbochargers etc. </p>
<p>Smaller engines produce less power and thus require higher engine speeds and higher gearing to drive the vehicle at faster speeds. </p>
<p>Something with high torque at 1000 rpm has the potential to use much less fuel at 70 mph than something that needs to spin at 5000 rpm for the same speed. </p>
<p>Other factors are very important though such as turbochargers, gearing, vehicle size and weight etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuel consumption correlates closer to vehicle weight than anything. Aerodynamic drag is next. Engine size hasn't much to do with it, other than larger engines weigh more. More cylinders have a bit more internal friction, but I'm not sure that's a large factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, I think this is more of a cultural thing in the USA. If you want to be comfortable while commuting a long distance at high speed, your best bet is probably some German saloon car, like a series 5 BMW or a Mercedes... They have various engine options, but there's usually some 2.0l turbo diesel, and some ~3.0 turbo diesel option, which are generally the most popular (150-300hp and loads of torque...).</p></div>		</li>
