			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, there is evidence to support the idea that it arose independently in gorillas and chimps</p>

<p>This would of course mean that the common ancestor of all species must have used some other form of locomotion, one hypothesis (an alternative to the &quot;brachiator&quot; hypothesis) is that it was a more arboreal cautious climber </p>

<p>It's not that they've lost these traits it's that our lineage didn't evolve them.</p>

<p>Excellent idea (insight). Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean we once had &quot;hands&quot; for feet like other primates and then evolved our current feet for walking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We likely evolved from ancestors that get around a lot like gibbons and orangutans. And yeah that included opposable toe-thumbs. The human foot is extremely specialized for bipedal walking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>more like we once had feet for hands, and evolved our current long dextrous fingers for brachiating (swinging from branch to branch)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct, the prehensile grasping toe that you're referring to is actually quite pronounced in Ardipithecus ramidus and visible in a transitive state in the later Australopithecus fossil assemblages. You can track the relative evolution of bipedalism using this trait in tandem with a set of others including the orientation of the foramen magnum in the skull and the width of the pelvic opening for example.</p></div>		</li>
