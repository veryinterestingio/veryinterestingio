			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to take exception to your two eye analysis.  Two eyes does not guarantee binocular vision.  Lots of prey animals have their eyes on opposite sides of their heads.  This allows for very small to no binocular vision.  The thinking is this was an evolutionary trade off between field of view and <strong>better</strong>   depth perception.  </p>
<p>I say better because 3d perception is not just based on binocular vision.  Motion parallax, perspective along with other visual cues all contribute to 3d perception.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree to that, though the evolution of TWO eyes has come from depth-perception.</p>
<p>The distancing of the eyes to the sides, and thus having a wider field of view OVER the depth perception has occured because of prey-animals who solely rely on &quot;noticing anthing attacking from any side and just running away&quot; as a survival tactic needed to see more and don't care about how far away that hunter is.</p>
<p>Yes, Motion parallax allows for pseudo-depth-perception but ONLY if you know how big and fast that thing actually is, otherwise you cannot judge the parallax.</p>
<p>Bottom line: depth-perception first, then came the split into &quot;I need the depth perception = forward facing eyes&quot; vs &quot;I need to see the freaks with depth perception no matter where they jump me from = field of vision&quot; guys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The evolution of vision is believed to to driven by the &quot;arms race&quot; between predator and prey. This evolution was much more gradual. I don't think the fossil records supports your claim two eyes came with binocular vision.   </p>

<p>Edit:
I was looking for the PBS program that covered vision and came across this instead which goes a much deeper dive into the evolution of vision. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're just making an assertion here with no evidence.  As far as I am aware, there is no reason to believe that binocular vision evolved first.  Furthermore, eyes have evolved many times independently across animals, and it's very unlikely that all of these cases progressed in the exact same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a much more parsimonious explanation that takes into account the fact that even animals/zooids living in 2d environments have multiple eyes, with no need of depth perception at all. </p>
<p>Also, recall that early animals had at least 3 eyes, and even primitive vertebrates retained a trinocular optical system. Seemingly would've been more energy efficient to make the midline eye wider, and lose the lateral eyes, no? </p>
<p>Noâ€”because an animal with two eyes can still see if one gets gouged out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Signal travel shortest this way&quot;...</p>
<p>Not necessarily.  You'll find that the optic nerve travels all the way to the back of the brain.  Also, the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>It's very much as if the brain was lifted out, rotated 180 degrees, and replaced.  If we turned the brain around (back facing front), the left side of the brain would control left body, right/right, and optic nerves could be much shorter.</p>
<p>I'd love to find the common ancestor that had its brain in &quot;right way forward&quot;, and find out why turning it the current way was best for survival.  Perhaps it was &quot;just the way it happened&quot;, concurrent with a survival adaptation but not itself necessary.  Meh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it is about &quot;the shortest way possible&quot; regarding WHERE IN THE BRAIN REGION, but imagine your eyes having to send the signal to your butt, where your brain is located (in that hypothetical situation). It would travel longer to down there and take even more time. The development of the brain has happened in stages itself, and the human frontal lobe is something you barely find anywhere else. The core functionality, the things that need fast reaction time are close to the spine. That's most likely why they are arranged like that. All &quot;higher order functions&quot; wrap around that in sequence of developing (iirc, but I would love to be corrected on that if I am wrong).</p>
<p>Why the brain has developed one over is a good question which I can't answer. But most likely it has given some advantage over the ones who didn't.</p>
<p>And as I explained before, if you took the brain out and arranged it like you proposed, you'd have the shortest way to the optical nerve, but ALL OTHER MOBILITY PATHWAYS and ESSENTIAL body movement which are SO MUCH MORE reliant on speed, would be traveling across the brain.</p>
<p>I actually think that the eyes were connected to the most central brain part at the end of the spine, and it grew more distant over the course of the evolution, because evolution and time proved that the extra distance wasn't something critically bad. While, obviously, the center of the brain has not been moving away from the central nervous system (spine) towards the eyes.</p>
<p>So, I hope to have answered the question in your last paragraph (&quot;THE one ancestor with &quot;the right forward brain&quot; does not exist, but it happened step by step) except for the question regarding the cross-over of the brain halves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the bigger advantage of having the eyes, ears and nose in the same area is that it makes it easier to use your senses in conjunction. Imagine if your nose was on your back. If you smelled something interesting like prey you would have to turn around in order to try and see it, then turn back around to try and smell it again, etc. The orientation of the sensory organs means that animals are almost always looking in the same direction that the thing are smelling or listening to is.</p></div>		</li>
