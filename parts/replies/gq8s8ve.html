			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back onto this, I have both examples in my wife's family. Her uncle was a competitive bodybuilder, her dad and grandpa basically did manual labor their whole lives (concrete/block, electrical).</p>
<p>At about 70-years-old, her lanky semi-out-of-shape looking grandpa could throw her uncle around like a ragdoll without breaking a sweat. He had just an asinine amount of strength and you would never think it based on looks. Her dad was the same way, fairly slim, doesn't look strong at all, but he's functionally strong as shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, to chime in a little</p>
<p>Body builders focuses more on the aesthetic side while the manual labor people focuses more on the functional/efficiency side.</p>
<p>That's why time and time again we can hear about how bodybuilders loses out on a competition of practical strength against manual labor worker.</p></div>		</li>
