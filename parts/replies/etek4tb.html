			<div class="markdown"><p>bear in mind that it can also vary depending on what you’re taking it for! zoloft/sertraline is one of those SSRIs that comes with the whole adjustment period warning for those taking it to combat depression or whatever, but for some reason it also seems to work for women taking it to combat pmdd—in this case, there’s almost no adjustment period because it’s taken for about a week every month during the pre-menstrual phase. ie take it for a week, then stop once the period starts, then take it again the next month before the period comes, and so on. for some reason, this seems to work even though it appears to sort of contradict the adjustment period needed for depression scenarios. point is, meds can be very individualistic in their efficacy and side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been on paxil for 10 years and recently switched to a combination of Effexor and Wellbutrin. The paxil worked great but I realized from my shitty love life that for the past several years I've been unable to really care about or love anyone I've dated. Helen Fisher is an anthropologist that writes a lot about how SSRIs may have this affect and actually cause people to fall out of love with their SOs. So I'm trying the Effexor as an experiment to see if maybe another drug works better for me. I'm 6-7 months in now and feel pretty much the same as I did on Paxil.</p>
<p>The Wellbutrin was added because SSRIs make me really tired and need a nap almost daily. It's definitely helped with that. Wellbutrin raises your levels of dopamine instead of serotonin so it does seem to make me more alert and need less sleep. Also causes a bit of insomnia though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took Zoloft when I was 16. It made me totally dead, but my trauma was still very fresh so I think that had a lot to do with it. I didn’t take it for more than a few months.</p>
<p>I’m 21 now and have been on Lexapro since Sept of last year and it has truly helped me without making me feel like a zombie, but my emotions do feel a little dampened. I’m not sure how to explain — I just feel like there’s more space between me and my emotions, rather than feeling totally enveloped by them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take cymbalta for my fibromyalgia but it helps with my other problems too and honestly even with it being kind of weird feeling muted, it's also such a damn relief not being so overwhelmed by my emotions for whatever one comes up or my worst ones.</p>
<p>I don't get the complaints for people saying they don't like so-and-so med because they don't feel as much and it's just.... You guys liked being a mess? I get it's weird but same time we kind of felt everything probably way more strongly than we should have in the first place. They're not magic happy pills either.</p>
<p>I've taken some meds before though that have made me feel worse, and ones that have made me pretty manic and anxious and I noped off those so fast (I don't remember what they were anymore though) and for awhile gave up on them since bad experience. Was surprised the cymbalta worked so well and is a good twofer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm Bipolar II and was taking a mood stabilizer and antidepressant for 12+ years and I never realized HOW zombified I was on them until my Dr. and I decided to wean me off the antidepressant. I started feeling emotions WAY too strongly for the first time in a decade. I was crying at Hallmark commercials (I used to never cry at anything), getting emotional in the middle of the day, etc. It was very disruptive and confusing. While I didn't want to fully stifle the emotions again, my Doc and I decided to add a super low dose of Cymbalta (an SNRI) to my mood stabilizer, which I've found helped control the extreme emotions but hasn't zombified me.</p></div>		</li>
