			<div class="markdown"><p>The common cold is usually caused by a species of virus called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus" target="_blank">Rhinovirus</a>. There are four known types of human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) that are related to SARS-CoV-2 but produce very mild symptoms very similar to rhinovirus infections and are responsible for about 20% of the colds we get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read very good answers here, but just to clarify: <strong>COVID-19</strong> is a <em>disease</em> caused by one specific coronavirus called <strong><em>SARS-CoV-2.</em></strong> The <strong>common cold</strong> is also a <em>disease</em>, caused by a number of <strong><em>different viruses</em></strong>, including rhinoviruses and other coronaviruses. The <strong>flu</strong> is yet another <em>disease</em>, caused by <strong><em>Influenza viruses</em></strong>. <strong>SARS</strong> (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) was also a <em>disease</em> caused by <strong><em>SARS-CoV</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>symptoms</strong> of these diseases, especially in mild forms, are often very similar and difficult to discriminate, that is why it is important to do swabs and serological tests to define the causative agent.</p>
<p>Another way to say it is that COVID-19 can have flu-like symptoms, or cold-like symptoms. Unfortunately all diseases take on an incredibly wide range of symptoms and manifestations in different individuals, so it is often difficult do define the root cause.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the difference between the terms, the disease and the causative agents.</p>
<p>A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will prevent COVID-19.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Covid-19 lacks sneezing as a symptom (and transmission route), where that is a major symptom for the cold.</p>
<p>That said, the cold is caused by as many as 200 different viruses, each of which cause the same group of <em>MILD</em> symptoms to spread. I think we would not call COVID-19 a cold, because while in some people it is mild, in others it is a very serious illness, where a cold is a mild condition.</p></div>		</li>
