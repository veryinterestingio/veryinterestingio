			<div class="markdown"><p>Effectively, this is equivalent to asking: if you had the steel block held up by a hook, would the hook lose its 'hookiness' and drop the block eventually?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Magnets don't have power in the sense of being some kind of battery which expends juice when it attracts something. Think of it more like gravity - the bridge and the earth are still going to attract each other for the duration of their existences; the bridge isn't going to 'run out of gravity' one day and drift off into the sky.</p>
<p>If you damage the magnet somehow - if it rusts, for example - then the damaged parts of the magnet might not be magnetic (or as strongly magnetic), and thus the overall strength of the magnet would drop. But that requires that an actual change - the damage - be made to the original magnet. Likewise, an iron hook is stronger than the same iron hook after heavily rusting. That's not an inherent change in the original hook's ability to hold things up due strictly to ageing; it's changing the hook into a different, less capable form. Coat the hook in rustproofing, and prevent any other kind of damage to it (including the chemical processes mentioned elsewhere in the thread), and it'll hold up the same weight forever. So will your magnet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, the analogy to gravity makes more sense, even they are not identical. I wouldn't expect the sun to stop pulling any time soon...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure this is a good analogy. Magnets do lose strength over time even if you just let them sit unperturbed. There is a temperature dependent probability for the spin of the electron to flip, accumulate enough flips and the magnetic domains will not be aligned anymore to give a macroscopic magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same with gravity though. Anything radiates heat (or at least Hawking radiation in the case of black holes) and thus constantly loses mass. Even massive bodies tend to leak mass, too. In the long term, effects like proton decay (if it exists) or quantum tunneling can disassemble the rest. A strongly localized gravitational field cannot exist forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. I wonder if that would count as 'damage' or not...</p>
<p>...nah, you're probably right. Although I'd be interested to know what the usual dropoff rate is per year or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnets only seem weird because they are macroscopic. But the same force is basically holding up the entire bridge. It's what holds electrons to atoms, lets atoms form molecules, and creates structures from molecules. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no it's not. magnetism is intrinsic to angular momentum. bonding is a largely electric effect. magnetism has little to do with holding a material together</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought magnetism and electricity were intertwined as the electromagnetic force?</p></div>		</li>
