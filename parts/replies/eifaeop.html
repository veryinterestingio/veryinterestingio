			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for the question. I too fondly remember the excitement of &quot;running into&quot; interesting websites and nuggets of information online. The web of today is too big to support that kind of browsing and discovery. There is so much choice and algorithms have taken over the process of curating that world for us. Even if algorithms capture some of that spontaneity (and I think we'll get better at it ... there is even a whole substream of research on recommender systems focused on fostering serendipity in online recommendations), I doubt it'll feel the same because the algorithms will be run by commercial interests. I am note hopeful for your dream.
But I think we can still do more so we aren't being passive about how we use them. We can be more deliberate of our choices and my hope is that we will find a better middle ground.</p></div>		</li>
