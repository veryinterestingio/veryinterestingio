			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what happened to me recently. Got a splinter that went in real deep. I tried to dig it out, but no luck. The next day my finger was a little red, I noticed it was white in the middle where I had just barely been able to see the splinter before. I squeezed my finger and a bit of pus came out like a pimple. </p>
<p>I kept absent mindedly squeezing it and eventually I must have hit the perfect angle because the splinter just slipped right out! All of a sudden my finger didn't hurt anymore. I hit it with some hand sanitizer and called it a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something similar happened to me with picking up a broken glass bowl. Weirdly enough my glass sliver never formed puss. It stayed there for almost a year! It left a tiny bump in my finger tip that I often played with. A year or so later while playing with it I did what I'd tried many times before which was squeeze it like a pimple and it slowly emerged from my finger in one smooth sprout. </p>
<p>Most. Satisfying. Day. Of. My. Life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had some teeny glass shards in the back of my hand after a car accident, eventually worked itself out but I had a little bubble on the back of my hand for the longest time. No puss or anything ever came out of it that I saw. One day it just looked like it was deflated, then disappeared over a few days (still have a little crater scar though).</p>
<p>I assume it &quot;popped&quot; while I was busy doing something and didn't notice.</p>
<p>/edit: I knew there was glass in there because at the ER they were picking it out with some tweezers, and tried to flush it out w/ some liquid (lidocaine? whatever it was I didn't feel a thing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had something vaguely similar. Stepped outside without shoes on, stepped right on a stick, and had a spike of wood go like a full inch into my foot. Holy fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck did it hurt. The nurse wanted to cut me open with a scalpel and anesthetic and shit, but I said 'fuck that' and got some drawing ointment.</p>
<p>Next day, I had this round, circular hole in my foot that was clean and just... oily. I pressed down on the sides of it and a solid 6x 3 mm cone of wood spike erupted out of the hole in my foot and I felt instant relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a metal splinter that was pretty deep and I couldn't dig out.  It was in my hand fir several years and I would occasionally put pressure on just the right spot and remember it was there.  Many years, probably around 7 or so, I noticed a dark line that looked like a splinter.   I clipped the skin covering it with finger nail clippers and the splinter was just a rusty bit of metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My body likes holding on. Every splinter I wasn’t able to get out right away would just get enveloped by a thick callus. I usually end up needing to cut it out. At that point since it’s all just callus it doesn’t even really hurt.</p></div>		</li>
