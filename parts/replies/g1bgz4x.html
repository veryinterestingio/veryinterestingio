			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. I would love to see some reports about this. My wife for example NEVER stops scrolling Facebook(mostly the videos). If she has a free she almost always has her phone in hand and is on FB. I often wonder, is she bored, addicted, or what.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it has to do with FB videos only being a few minutes long. It's like a quick Dopamine rush that makes you happy. People are able to watch 20 videos that are 4 min in length much easier than watch 1 80 min video that has all the same content in it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people with short attention spans. I have a lot of trouble watching a 1 hour TV show but can sit there and watch 10-20 min YouTube videos all night long. Most of the short videos on Youtube/FB/etc have a bunch of content packed in them where are a TV show will have dull moments that you will lose interest in. </p>
<p>When my GF is over we can sit there and watch 2-3 movies in a night or a bunch of TV episodes but when she is not here, I will just scroll Reddit or watch YouTube. It took me 3 weeks to finish the TitanFall 2 campaign which is 6-7 hours of gameplay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sadly, catering to people with short attention spans creates more people with short attention spans. Barring people with medical conditions, attention span is more about habit than anything else.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to the effect that it has on the brain, social media is addictive both physically and psychologically. According to a new study by Harvard University, self-disclosure on social networking sites lights up the same part of the brain that also ignites when taking an addictive substance</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A neuroscientist, Dr. Andrew Huberman, described this old study from the 60's (when medical ethics were are little fuzzier) in which patients had electrodes placed in their brain. The electrodes stimulated different parts of the brain that could trigger happiness, arousal, hunger, satisfaction, or whatever else. The patients had the ability to trigger those electrodes.</p>
<p>The scientists found that the electrodes that were by far the most stimulated: mild frustration. My takeaway: we are angry monkeys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While they described the feeling as “mild frustration” the actual area of the brain being triggered was theorized to be one that pushes people to overcome fears and work past boundaries, to show courage essentially. The conclusion should not be that we enjoy to be angry or frustrated, but that we get a great deal of satisfaction out of achieving tough goals despite the frustration and effort associated with them. </p>

<p>Not the one born in 1975 then? Do you have any links to publications related to that study? I thought this had never really be done in humans, i.e. placing invasive electrodes just to see what's there (or were these for a medical reason?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works on the principle of intermittent reinforcement. I can't remember the exact reasoning, but receiving a reward intermittently or randomly is the best way to condition a certain behavior and makes it more difficult to unlearn that behavior. Receiving a reward every time has less significant effects.</p></div>		</li>
