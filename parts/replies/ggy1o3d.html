			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, interesting read. So assuming it's around 50%, how do researchers explain this in simple terms? I still don't quite understand what makes it more transmissible than the other strains that remained more or less unremarkable to the public</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's several mutations in the spike protein, some in the receptor binding domain, the business end of the Spike that docks with the ACE2 receptor and hacks into cells.</p>
<p>Of these, N501Y seems to be the mutation that's most important, makes the Spike stick more strongly to ACE2. Interestingly, they modified a virus with the mutated Spike, with just the N501Y mutation, and it infected mouse cells 2x as fast as the original version. </p>
<p>The same mutation also popped up in South Africa, and they're blaming it on a big increase in infections there (during summer). They call it 501.V2. It seems to be more contagious, though this isn't as clear as B.1.1.7 in the UK. </p>
<p>And there's also a deletion of a couple of amino acids at the side of the Spike in the UK variant as well (Delta 70 / Delta 69), this was first seen to appear in an immune compromised patient who was ill with COVID-19 for several months before they died, the mutation appeared after they were treated with convalescent plasma. This mutation evolved to evade antibodies (they call it an Escape Mutation). </p>
<p>The Deletion mutation also causes a false negative for the Spike gene on some RT-PCR machines, that's how they realised B.1.1.7 was increasing. This is also a handy way of tracking its progress.</p>
<p>So the increased infectiousness might be due to a combination of mutations, each on its own has little or no effect.</p>
<p>A bit like Thanos and the Infinity Stones.</p>
<p>Here's a paper about the South African mutation, 501.V2 (N501Y).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the infection rate of this new strain to give a bit of an idea as to how infectious it is: South Africa went from about 2000 - 3000 infections/day, to around 14 000 reported infections in one day only about 2/3 days after the new strain was first reported.</p>
<p>Now, whether this is directly related to the new strain, I don't know. But there seems to be some correlation from what I can gather. This isn't good, since South Africa could barely manage to pay a nearly R300 mil (~$20mil) deposit to COVAX to POTENTIALLY secure around 1.7mil doses of vaccine (which equates to about 3% of the population). </p>
<p>South Africa is screwed in that regard, and can't afford a second hard lockdown because the economy is already in shambles and would surely collapse.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note: there are experts on viral genomics who have serious doubts about the claims of increased transmissibility. The increase in this lineage could easily be random chance. There are regions where it has been introduced, but it has not taken over, cutting against increased transmissibility.</p></div>		</li>
