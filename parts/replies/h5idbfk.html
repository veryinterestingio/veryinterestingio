<p>Lots of details on the how and why of big kabooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd recommend &quot;The curve of binding energy&quot;.   </p>
<p>It's an incredible book, with a ton of information and cool stories on the development of the atomic bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The YouTuber Scott Manley has a really good series on the development and mechanics of nuclear weapons. It's detailed enough without being too technical, though I have a maths background so I'm not the best judge of that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for the recommendation - I just watched that series; he's great and your description is bang on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is this also related to fusion in stars? as stars age, the elements get heavier thus less net energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's why stars go <del>nova</del> supernova. When they run out of hydrogen, they begin fusing heavier elements until they reach iron. Iron does not produce any energy when fused, thus resulting in a loss of fusion pressure in the core and causing it to collapse in on itself due to gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a minor correction: You described a <em>super</em>nova, a nova is a distinct phenomenon where a white dwarf accumulates hydrogen from another star in a multi-star system, which then ignites and gets blasted away. Under different circumstances this can also lead to a type 1a supernova, where the whole white dwarf gets blown up because it becomes heavy enough to surpass the Chandrasekhar limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why exactly is iron the limit? Is this the case for any star regardless of composition and mass? What is it about iron that causes it to not release any energy? Sorry I've always been curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are just general observations about fusion of relatively light nuclei, so it also applies in stars. That being said, there isn't much tritium in stars, so DT fusion isn't such a big deal for stellar nucleosynthesis.</p></div>		</li>
