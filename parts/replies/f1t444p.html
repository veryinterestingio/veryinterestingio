<p>From the moment a massless object pops into existence it is moving at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity#General_relativity" target="_blank">General Relativity predicts it</a>.  A part of that prediction is the <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gravitational-waves/en/" target="_blank">existence of gravitational waves</a>, which have recently been directly measured by the gravitational observatories that form <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu" target="_blank">LIGO</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They detected gravitational waves and the time of it reaching us coincides with light iirc. So if over a distance of <del>hundred of thousands of light years</del>, the gravity and light both reach us at the same time, think its safe to say its the same speed</p>
<p>EDIT:  <a href="https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/ask-ethan-why-do-gravitational-waves-travel-exactly-at-the-speed-of-light-c60ae2656e32" target="_blank">But the greatest confirmation that the speed of gravity equals the speed of light comes from the 2017 observation of a kilonova: the inspiral and merger of two neutron stars. A spectacular example of multi-messenger astronomy, a gravitational wave signal arrived first, recorded in both the LIGO and Virgo detectors. Then, 1.7 seconds later, the first electromagnetic (light) signal arrived: the high-energy gamma rays from the explosive cataclysm. Because this event took place some 130 million light-years away, and the gravitational and light signals arrived with less than a two second difference between them, we can constrain the possible departure of the speed of gravity from the speed of light. We now know, based on this, that they differ by less than 1 part in 10ยนโต, or less than one quadrillionth of the actual speed of light.</a></p>
<p>Pretty neat huh? Some might say pfft on ligo because its such an expensive project that can only detect the strongest of gravitational wave. Definitely unable to use to find/confirm the inexistence of the 9th planet, but surprise, we used it to finally prove the speed of gravity waves</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a newbie question - I'm assuming that the 1.7 seconds between gravitational wave hitting first, then electromagnetic wave hitting, is down to the margin of experimental error of the detector?  It doesn't represent a true phenomenon where the gravity wave actually did move faster than light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid question time: if light follows spacetime as it is bent by heavy bodies and is bent as a result, does that mean that gravity waves also are bent by gravity? </p>
<p>I believe LIGO can determine the angle the waves arrive to it, was it the same as that of EM radiation of the event?</p></div>		</li>
