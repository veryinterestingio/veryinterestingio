<p>Nintendo is the only company that doesn't. They make a profit off every console sold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add what someone else mentioned regarding they can make it up elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Licensing Fees - Studios pay a fee to make games for a console. They literally make money on every game sold. </li>
<li>Controllers, accessories, peripherals - high profit margin. You think a controller costs them $60 to make? Also, 3rd party producers again pay a licensing fee to make accessories for a console</li>
<li>Online Fees - Xbox Live, Sony Plus, etc. All pretty much pure profit simply to enable the gamer to play online</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further add: Modern Consoles also use Systems-on-a-chip, which is drastically cheaper to implement than individual components at mass production scales, vs discrete gpus and CPUs. </p>
<p>This is why in the case of the original Xbox and PS3/PS2, both Sony and Microsoft were both taking massive losses on the hardware, because they couldn't use the Systems-on-a-chip manufacturing. The Xbox and PS3/PS2, at launch, used discrete GPUS and CPUs. </p>
<p>In the case of the PS3/PS2, once die shrinks were available, they became able to integrate them together, removing additional overhead and cost.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for this. Just looked this up and learned something new today! The article I read mentioned something about lower IC yield. Can you explain what that means?</p></div>		</li>

<p>But on PC, you don't need to pay just to go online to play games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why doesn't microsoft just mass produce a PC capable of playing xbox one quality games? I guess microsoft already sell the xbox. but why doesn't like Lenovo do that, make a computer that is so popular that it sells hundreds of millions and game makers start making drivers specifically for that pc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're making the mistake of assuming PC gamers want a PC that's like a console. They don't. That's why they don't play on consoles in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the PC will still be an open platform, and the software will still run on other PCs. If you want to make games that is exclusive to that PC, then it's not a PC anymore, it's a game console, and it loses what makes a PC useful in the first place. </p>
<p>Game makers don't make drivers. Drivers are basically tells a computer how to work with a piece of hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A gaming console is pretty much a computer with a different OS that only plays games. So basically, that is already a thing we do. the point of having a pc is having exactly the specs you need for your tasks. if you want to game, have a game pc, if you need to work, build a strong workload station. There isn’t going to be one ubiquitous PC that all pc gamers flock to, it’s just not the way the pc market works. With consoles we get three choices because the market has become a bit of an oligopoly where there are 3 products to chose from, sony microsoft or nintendo... pc parts exist to be compatible with many other parts and components specifically so we can upgrade and part out as needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A gaming console is EXACTLY a computer. Even the lowly Atari 2600 used a CPU that was nearly identical* to the ones used in the leading 8-bit home computers of the day.</p>
<p>*It used a 6507, a cheaper version of the 6502 with fewer address lines.</p></div>		</li>
