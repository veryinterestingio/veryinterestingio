<p>The air in your lungs that cant be used for oxygen transport is called 'dead space' which is also the name of one of one of the best videogames of all time, set on a mining ship in space, where asphyxiation is a constant risk...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you even have to open your mouth? I was under the impression that your respiratory system was always open to the outside because it's connected to your nasal passages which are pretty much always open to some degree. Wouldn't the pressure just quickly escape through your nose even if you kept your mouth closed?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you've ever dived down in a swimming pool, you probably did this without knowing, or else air would quickly escape through your nose. (Or simply holding your breath will also cause this, now that I think about it). This is also why scuba divers are instructed to hum as perform an emergency ascent, so that the passageway remains open to prevent the lungs from over-expanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proof on the pressure difference being able to rupture your lungs, even with your mouth shut?</p>
<p>I'm familiar with depressurization from divers causing such problems, but not in airplanes. Not doubting you, but I've never heard of such a case, and would be interested to read about it.</p></div>		</li>
