<p>Studies on the effects of diet on acne vulgaris have shown that occurrence of acne is lower in rural and non-industrialized areas than in Western populations [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884775/#CIT0023" target="_blank">23</a>  Among approximately 1300 subjects, no cases of acne were reported  Cordain <em>et al</em>. suggested that the absence of acne in these societies may have been a direct consequence of their diets [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884775/#CIT0014" target="_blank">14</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884775/#CIT0024" target="_blank">24</a>]. Both populations subsist on low glycemic load diets devoid of Western refined foods such as cereals, chips, cookies and bread</p>
<p>Kaymak <em>et al</em>. investigated the relationship between acne and glycemic load and index, insulin sensitivity and blood plasma levels of IGF-1 [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884775/#CIT0033" target="_blank">33</a>]. <strong>It has been demonstrated that in the serum of acne patients, higher IGF-1 levels and significantly lower IGFBP-3 levels occurred in comparison to healthy patients. Moreover, as assessed on the basis of an intake questionnaire, acne patient's diet had a significantly higher glycemic index than healthy patient's diet</strong> [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4884775/#CIT0020" target="_blank">20</a>].</p>
<p>The authors emphasized the importance of diet leading to hyperinsulinemia and indicated that it may be a risk factor in the development of acne by affecting proliferation of epidermis in hair follicle, hyperkeratinization and androgen controlled sebum secretion</p>
<p>Thank you! I personally already Follow a low-GI Diet (The studies are so far and away on this for general health), but the report makes a very compelling case for omitting dairy, and there is very little reason to   consume it when more healthy substitutes exist.</p></div>		</li>
