			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as an insomniac partner to someone who snores, I do eventually tune out my husbands snoring and can fall asleep despite the logs he saws, but if my brain is still too wired it is <em>the most grating sound I've ever heard</em>. If I'm having a hard time sleeping and then he starts snoring, hes getting an elbow in the ribs until he rolls back to his side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because while it‚Äôs ‚Äúconstant‚Äù it‚Äôs not repetitive enough or frequent enough to immediately be tuned out. If you listen to someone snore, the tone will change and the rate will change. This takes longer to block out as the sound changes just enough for your brain to recognize it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's not repetitive to them. Your brain automatically ties the sound to the breathing. But your partner has no reference to tie the autonomic process of their breathing to the sound they're hearing. And the often uneven sounds of snoring become grating to the ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. Do people actually tune out the sound of their heartbeat?? I hear it 24/7. I even try and make it mimic the sound of whatever music I'm listening to. It lulls me to sleep. </p>
<p>Hell, I <em>feel</em> the pulsing down my limbs all the time too. I assumed it was an everyone problem...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that this could be a blood pressure or heart issue. It's also entirely possible that this could be a relatively benign nervous system issue with your brain. When is the last time you had your BP checked?</p>
<p>Might at least be worth swinging by a place with an automatic blood pressure machine, just to check.</p></div>		</li>
