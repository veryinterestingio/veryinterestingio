<p>And this is what makes SP so special. Matt and Trey don't give a fuck about anything, really. Whereas most everyone else has an agenda that requires giving a fuck about many things, people's feelings included.</p>
<p>Edit as many people don't really understand how things work.</p>
<p>Matt and Trey don't give a fuck. They showed up to the emmy's on acid wearing dresses, and then proceeded to do press spots. The people they must work with (CC, FCC, MPAA, etc.) Are the people giving a fuck. Everything they've touched, there has been a tooth and nail fight to push the envelope.</p>
<p>The episodes that are no longer available, decisions made by the people who own merchandising rights to SP, which I believe are CC, Viacom and now maybe Hulu, but I'm not 100%.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>In truth the specialness of South Park is a network that continues to fund the production of the show despite the consequences of the content of the show.</li>
<li>It's not that Matt and Trey don't give a  fuck, it's that Comedy Central doesn't give a fuck.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDIT: Additional Comments-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To clarify, it's not special to have a show where the creators don't give a fuck, there are lots of shows that would get away with South Park level content, if they could. </li>
<li>What is special is how much Comedy Central lets them get away with. </li>
<li>All the comments about times when CC did give a fuck are beside the point. </li>
<li>Again the point is that the reason South Park is unique is because CC lets the show get away with much more than many other shows get away with.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Matt and Trey had offers to move to a major network when South Park first got huge. They turned down a lot of money because of the freedom they had at Comedy Central. It's a great relationship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they come across as having no agenda because they often lampoon the common viewpoints of their audience. But it's not like they are some other worldly beings totally immune to bias.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, South Park's implicit ideology is basically a form of conservativism. Not the weird stuff that the American political right is into, but, but instead it's the sentiment of &quot;giving a damn about wanting to change things is what makes you wrong&quot;.</p>
<p>It's the 90s &quot;history is over&quot; mentality, but instead of treating that as a matter of fact it treats it as the only desirable thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She is pretty obnoxious and detached from reality, the George Clooney speech they mocked in <em>The Smug</em> was not even as bad as some stuff she has said. Taking credit for the Civil Rights movement etc. Talking about Hollywood as a shining star showing the rest of the world how it's future will be. General up her own ass type stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's be honest though, SNL doesn't go nearly as far as South Park. South Park has an episode where they joke about a Boy Scout leader taking naked pictures of them and an entire episode dedicated to Oprah Winfrey having a talking asshole and vagina. I don't think SNL, or many other shows, would go as far as South Park does.</p>
<p>Hell, they made an entire episode where Britney Spears walked around with half her head missing as a result of her blowing her brains out and even spent like half an episode calling Tom Cruise gay (and a &quot;banned&quot; episode that continues that jokes).</p>
<p>South Park is a completely other level of &quot;go fuck yourself&quot; type parody while SNL (sometimes) does it in a friendly way. Few shows even come close to how fucked South Park can be.</p></div>		</li>
