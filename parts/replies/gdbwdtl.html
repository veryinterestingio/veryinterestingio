			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists who were scheduled to do observations, after the first cable broke, just don't get to do those observations. It's unfortunate, but this is what generally happens when observation time is lost at any telescope, due to broken equipment or bad weather or anything else. They can propose to do those observations in the future (at whatever telescope), whenever their target would be visible again.</p>
<p>Archived data from past observations will remain available for future scientists. It looks like any student or other scientist who wanted to do new observations will not get to do them - certainly not any time soon. Students who wanted to do new observations will have to reconsider their projects and try to make use of existing data.</p>
<p>The Arecibo Observatory is owned by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF). Most of the annual operating budget comes from the NSF (for ionosphere and astronomy) and NASA (for Solar System). The observatory is operated under a cooperative agreement by the University of Central Florida, Yang Enterprises Inc., and Universidad Ana G. Mendez.</p>
<p>Since the NSF owns the site, they are legally responsible for it. Rebuilding the telescope would take hundreds of millions of dollars, which the NSF (or NASA) can't easily find in their annual budget without eliminating many things elsewhere. So rebuilding the telescope probably would require a separate appropriation from Congress, specifically for this purpose. If not, the NSF is responsible for cleaning up and closing down the site.</p>
