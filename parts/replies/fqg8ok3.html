<p>For instance, a flight going east is probably 25% or so quicker (and less expensive) than the same flight going west.</p>

<p>Anyone that's ever done a coast to coast flight in the US knows this very well...</p>
<p>Going west is at least an hour longer than going east. With good jet streams I've had flights as short as 4 hours from LAX to MCO, and as long as 6 hours in the air going MCO to LAX. (I like to look out window the whole flight, we were lined up for hours with the runway at LAX, kind of surprised me that there wasn't any course adjustments, just all the sudden going down and there's the runway. So it wasn't excess traffic)</p></div>		</li>
