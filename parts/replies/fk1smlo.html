<p>Just want to really emphasise this. We're 99.99% sure that nothing can go faster than light, it just <strong>appears</strong> to because it's moving away from us (or we're moving away from <em>it</em>) faster than the &quot;updated&quot; light can reach us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, dark energy.  What is dark energy? The stuff causing the expansion of the universe. Yes, that is a circular definition, the truth is we just don't really know why the universe is expanding, just that there's a whole lot of energy out there we can't explain or account for.</p></div>		</li>
