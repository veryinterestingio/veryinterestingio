			<div class="markdown"><p>On Kodiak Island, in Alaska, they have their own independent grid. Traditionally it’s been all diesel powered, but they’re now transitioning to wind power. The cool thing though, is they have a massive flywheel in a vacuum chamber as a battery replacement to maintain power during low-wind times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_storage_power_system" target="_blank">here's</a> some generic info. I personally find it amazing that flywheels are competitive today, it seems like such an old technology and that friction would inevitably outweigh any savings, but they're totally viable in some niche scenarios, especially because they can kick in virtually instantly, fast enough to take over from grid power for electronic equipment. Flywheels are ideal in situations where you're going to have very frequent fluctuations, as they can move from taking energy from the grid to providing energy to the grid almost instantly. They're also not great at long term (multi-day) storage, as friction losses do mount, but they're ideal complements for predictably unreliable power, like solar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know any details but among like 12 backup generators and a natural gas turbine plant our hospital also has rotary backup power supplies that fill the gap between the grid falling offline and the generators coming up to speed. Just giant flywheels that are being turned 24/7 so they’re instantly ready to turn generators until the diesel genseta can react in ~30 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, very. There is a small hydro-electric plant on the island as well, but now between that, wind turbines, and a series of batteries and flywheels, they’re very very close to 100% renewable. That’s not net renewable either, it’s truly 10% renewable, because they’re not tied into a bigger grid to sell their excess renewable power to or to purchase power from in low wind times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel is very common in power grids simply due to how quickly you can get it running at capacity. It works great to restart a power plant, assist with peak power, or provide backup or emergency power. It is expensive compared to gas, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, which is why the eventual goal of places like Tasmania who have just reached 100% renewable energy is to reach 200% so they don’t have to use other power during peak hours and still be able to sell it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As do many people but they cost a lot more, so a lot of places sell the remaining and buy back or use natural gas when they can’t meet needs. Eventually we’ll get more and more energy storage (molten salt, fly wheels, water pumps/gravity, batteries... batteries being the least ideal as they require tons of mining for rare metals) but for now the race is to claim 100% and a lot of people will fall back on “net” numbers, once more people meet that standard there will be a new push for “really 100%”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The usage of an international grid means that, if you can supply large amounts of power over a distance, you could potentially share production depending on how much energy is being produced where. IE Netherlands having met 100% of their power, selling excess to Germany, and then vice versa.</p></div>		</li>
