			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh I hated nursing (and I’m about to start the process over again ?) but I probably would have been a great wet nurse. I stopped nursing my 1 year old right around his first birthday and didn’t stop lactating until I was several months into my next pregnancy, Probably about 8-9 months later. I’m terrified it will never stop after I stop nursing this baby since he will almost definitely be our last.</p></div>		</li>
