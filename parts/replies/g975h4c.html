			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a bicycle shop for a number of years and was confused by accessories (cargo racks mostly) only coming with one washer per bolt. Does it go on the bolt side or the nut side?! One side is aluminum, the other is steel but has the bigger hole and needed the extra surface area more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They go on the nut side. A washer does what OP is saying but sometimes they're also there to keep paint from getting scratched during assembly and to class up the way the nut looks. They also keep you from over tightening and crushing tubes or cutting drill holes out, the edge of the nut becomes like a blade under too much torque.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because OP asked why things are designed with washers, not how do you rig something up when you have the wrong fastener. You can chisel wood with a flathead screwdriver, but that's not the purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Changing the thickness of the washer is a perfectly valid way to manage the accumulation of tolerances to ensure the threads are loaded properly. If you don't like this answer, don't get on a plane.</p></div>		</li>
