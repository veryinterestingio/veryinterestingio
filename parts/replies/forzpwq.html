			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn’t just another coronavirus, it was MERS, which is very closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (SARS, MERS, AND SARS-CoV-2 are triplets with very similar sequences and modes of action).  Several other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were similarly jump-started because of their MERS or SARS experience.  </p>
<p>I doubt the Oxford group is “months” ahead - they’re actually a few weeks behind their first clinical trials compared to a half-dozen others, but they’re apparently able to use their prior safety data to scale up a little faster than some others. Advantages from that may be lost in manufacturing or a dozen other points. </p>
<p>In any case, the more potentially good, safe, protective vaccines get into trials, the better. If it means we end up with half a dozen options, that would be great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the article they were able to prove efficacy for the MERS vaccome and then scale it up to a million doses, so that bodes well.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccine I read about may not even have efficacy, I think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are still similarities, such the type of DNA/RNA, processes that may have worked in the past. . . .   They just got lucky.  If this was not a corona type virus, they would be behind.</p></div>		</li>
