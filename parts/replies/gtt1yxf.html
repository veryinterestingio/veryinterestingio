<p>This makes fire about half the age of plants  </p>

<p>Isn't plants also ~480 mil years old? With &quot;wood&quot; first appear around ~420 mil years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Land plants, yes - sea based plants like algae are much older (pretty hard to set fire to them though, no matter how much oxygen...). I should have specified that, thanks for adding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's fun about that is that as far as we can tell, fire didn't exist  in the universe before then. It's unlikely but possible that those  initial flames on Earth were the first flames in existence.<br />
Earth is  generally considered a &quot;water planet&quot;, but it should really be called  the &quot;fire planet&quot; since it's the only example we know of for now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it could happen on another planet with the right levels of oxygen in the air. But so far, <a href="https://astronomy.com/magazine/ask-astro/2016/05/is-there-fire" target="_blank">fire on Earth is the only known fire in the universe</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that within a fairly narrow definition of fire though?  Iron metal exposed to fluorine gas will create a flame in the absence of oxygen, for one example.  Another would be the reaction of a fuel and an oxygen-containing oxidizer in the absence of molecular oxygen, for example sugar and potassium nitrate.  I'm not claiming these events are likely outside of Earth, but there can certainly be other exothermic fuel-oxidizer reactions that generate heat and light.</p></div>		</li>
