			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, fluoride mouthwash has less fluoride than toothpaste. Do not use it after brushing your teeth as you're just diluting the fluoride in your mouth. Don't wash your mouth out with water either, just spit out the excess toothpaste (&quot;spit don't rinse&quot;).</p>
<p>If you're going to use mouthwash, use it at another time of day.</p></div>		</li>
