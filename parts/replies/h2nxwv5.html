<p>Fun fact #2: asphalt is near 100% recyclable.  Just lift it up and heat it enough and the liquid will flow freely again and the whole mix can then be reapplied.</p>

<p>Practical Engineering did a video about that: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKFaC5RYbEM" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKFaC5RYbEM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKFaC5RYbEM</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>The asphalt actually remains liquid and gradually flows downward as it ages, exposing the rock aggregate and shifting the surface profile from what starts as flat to more pebbly.</p>

<p>Also, this is why newly paved asphalt roads are such a deep black color, and why they fade to gray over time.  The liquid bitumen/tar initially covers the gray gravel rock and pools between pieces of rock.  With time, it &quot;flows&quot; down, leaving the gray gravel rocks exposed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should be.  You can use any color rocks you want, but the tar will always be black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This will also hugely depend on the the local aggregates.  In western mass, the local aggregates are dark grey, so the roads always reflect that.  In eastern mass, it’s mostly granite, so 6 months after replacing, the roads are very light colored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a fun fact: asphalt roads don’t cure like concrete does. They just cool down and become <del>less</del> more viscous. That’s the reason <em>why</em> they’re so recyclable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do I misunderstand how viscosity works? More viscous = flows easier. Water is more viscous than molasses. When asphalt cools, it flows more slowly than when it was hot, no?</p></div>		</li>
