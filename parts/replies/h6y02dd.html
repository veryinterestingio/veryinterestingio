When we return samples we keep them in nitrogen filled cabinets inside cleanrooms and limit the types of materials that the samples come into contact with.  NASA initially tested lunar samples for extraterrestrial microbes, but stopped after the first few missions. NASA and ESA are developing plans for how to test martian samples for extraterrestrial microbes.
