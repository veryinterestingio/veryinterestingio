			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be possible, by pure chance (or perhaps futuristic guidance), to remove all memory cells that are auto immune, thus giving the body a time without them?</p>
<p>Then, if the creation of the auto-immunity was just a fluke of a failure, perhaps the next time it comes up, it can be filtered by normal biological processes?</p>
<p>Is this something that could, in theory, be used in the future to treat auto-immune diseases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but it would probably be easier to remove the lymphoid stem cells from the bone marrow. We can already do that with bone marrow transplants.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://acaai.org/news/great-disappearing-act-bone-marrow-receiver-cured-allergy" target="_blank">case reports</a> of people being cured of allergies after a bone marrow transplant. There are also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/bmt2010150" target="_blank">case reports</a> of the opposite - people receiving allergies after a bone marrow transplant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a transplant like this would not purge the already existing memory cells, as far as I understand it.</p>
<p>I don't recall the life expectancy of memory cells, is it short enough that they'll purge on their own after such a transplant? If not, would we not need some form of controlled purging of memory cells to remove the symptoms, after removing the cause?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure this answer is entirely accurate. Or at least not the full story. By roughly the age of 40 people no longer produce significant numbers of new T cells. Similarly, older people don’t produce many new B cells. Yet when these populations get sick with measles, it doesn’t affect their allergies. I would be more inclined to believe that naive and effector lymphocytes, which are less susceptible to measles than memory lymphocytes, are surviving the infection and later proliferating when they come into contact with their specific epitope, such as an allergen.</p></div>		</li>
