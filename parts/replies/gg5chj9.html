<p>Don't drink beer (or any alcohol really), but lots of other fatty foods.  </p>
<p>Have had a beer belly since I was a kid, in spite of being skinny otherwise.  </p>
<p>Most likely Indian genetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a nice track from ~200lbs to ~175lbs a year ago because I wanted to look good in the wedding photos. We had to postpone the reception and everything by a year plus.. and my motivation for the healthier lifestyle is shot. Luckily, I'm only back to ~180 right now.. after going up to 185 for a bit. </p>
<p>No beer though, just fatty rich foods I made for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely correct.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590626/" target="_blank">Regular alcohol consumption leads to increased angiogenesis</a>, the creation of new blood vessels within and around tissues. &quot; One of the variables analyzed was the expression of vascular endothelial  growth factor (VEGF)—a growth factor that promotes blood vessel  formation (i.e., is proangiogenic) and enhances tumor vascularization.  The study found that exposure to 0.25 g/kg ethanol per day for 9 days  resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in tumor volume as well as a 3.9-fold  increase in the expression of VEGF mRNA in the tumor cells and a  2.1-fold increase in the amount of the blood vessels in the tumor (i.e.,  intratumoral vascular volume) compared with control embryos. &quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7091270_Alcohol_linked_to_enhanced_angiogenesis_in_rat_model_of_choroidal_neovascularization" target="_blank">Multiple papers back this, this being another one that <em>also</em> analyzes the increase in esters that contribute to organ disease from alcoholism.</a> &quot; The oxidative metabolism of alcohol is minimal or absent in the eye, so  that ethanol is metabolized via a nonoxidative pathway to form fatty  acid ethyl esters (FAEE). Fatty acid ethyl ester synthase (FAEES) was  purified from the choroid of Brown Norway (BN) rats. The purified  protein. . . BN rats on a regular diet were fed  alcohol for 10 weeks. Control rats were fed water with a regular diet  and pair-fed control rats were fed regular diet, water and glucose. We  found that FAEES activity was increased 4.0-fold in the choroid of  alcohol-treated rats compared with controls. The amount of ethyl esters  produced in the choroid of 10 week alcohol-fed rats was 7.4-fold more  than rats fed alcohol for 1 week.  &quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3844681/" target="_blank">Increased vasculature allows for greater amounts of adipose tissue storage.</a> It is believed that enhanced angiogenesis, ie increasing bloodflow to certain areas, may cause increased adipose tissue (fat) distribution in those areas. &quot; The growth and function of tissues is critically dependent on their  vascularization. Adipose tissue is capable of expanding many-fold during  adulthood, therefore requiring the formation of new vasculature to  supply growing and proliferating adipocytes. The expansion of the  vasculature in adipose tissue occurs through angiogenesis, where new  blood vessels develop from those pre-existing within the tissue.  Inappropriate angiogenesis may underlie adipose tissue dysfunction in  obesity, which in turn increases type-2 diabetes risk. &quot;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So while I don't believe there is any <em>direct proof</em> that alcohol consumption <em>absolutely</em> 1:1 causes fat increases in the belly, it is entirely a possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What? If you only view each study one at a time without keeping the larger logical argument in mind I guess I could see how you might think that. But if you look at the simple argument formed by linking them together, it’s all very relevant:</p>
<p>Alcoholism contributes to angiogenesis. Angiogenesis has a potential link to fat distribution. </p>
<p>He didn’t quote the third study properly to make his point, maybe that’s your issue. Read the third study in full. Like he said, there’s nothing decisive there but it does support the possibility.</p></div>		</li>
