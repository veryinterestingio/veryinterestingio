			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Perhaps that is a semantic point, though.  Viruses have their way of reproducing by invading a host cell and rewiring it to create duplicates of itself.  By 'dead', I believe they mean that it won't be able to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this they also have to do more than just 'break' the virus and inject it. That is a really good way to half-way commit and trick people into they are immune.</p>
<p>It leaves out a very obvious thing to everyone whose played plague inc. . . what if it mutates? Look at the flu virus there is a reason every year we need an updated shot. So they do a hybrid shot which if all goes well protects not only against the exact make-up of the virus but also possible mutations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 components to your immune system: the innate and adaptive. The innate just travels around and freaks out at everything it doesn't recognize. It doesn't matter if it's the common cold or anthrax. (slight exaggeration, since it does matter if it's bacterial or viral). It's going to react the same way. These are responsible for fever, phlegm, swelling, etc. These happen within hours of being infected. The end goal here isn't to kill the infection. It's to fight until your adaptive cells can bring reinforcements.</p>
<p>You also have an adaptive immune system. These are (primarily) your T and B cells, which take time. They have to 'study' the infection, find a good way to kill it, and then mass produce the antibodies. This can take anywhere from hours (if you've already made antibodies to it before and just need to mass produce them) or days-weeks (if it's something brand new).</p>
<p>The &quot;information&quot; is stored in your B cells that can mass produce  specific antibodies when they encounter the antigen that they were made to fight. If they can't (either they don't recognize it or maybe the B cells died off and you lost immunity to that disease), then your body has to make new cells to create antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Measles is a particularly nasty virus because it can reset the immume system. It wipes out memory B cells which are normally extremely long lived and would recognise and fight infections the body has already survived.  often people survive the measles infection and then secondary infections kill them.</p></div>		</li>
