<p>I used this same analogy to explain a car's fuel consumption.  Walking a mile is not difficult (for the person I was addressing), but sprinting a mile might kill them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with this analogy is that none of this is about lifespan. Once your CPU has been rated to be an i7 instead of an i3, it can run at its high frequency for many, many years. It's more the initial imperfections in the manufacturing process limits the max frequency. Or, if there were few of them, it's heat, but you can use a better cooling system to prevent that.</p></div>		</li>
