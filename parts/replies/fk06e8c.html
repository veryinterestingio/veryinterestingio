			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think there's another layer to it, though - that people use oil prices as an indicator of economic growth (for the reasons you mentioned), and since people are always looking for the next recession, they interpret a drop in price as proof that the economy is slowing down.  This can end up fulfilling its own prophecy, if people start (for example) cutting back on investment or selling stock because they think we're at the beginning of a recession.  And if the reason those people think we're at the beginning of a recession is that oil prices have dropped, a drop in oil price can then cause a real drop in economic activity.</p></div>		</li>
