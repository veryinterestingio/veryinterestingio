<p>Second one is intelligence. Parrots are very intelligent birds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I came here to add this. Birds' brains may seem small compared to those of the mammals we recognise as fairly intelligent, but they are also somewhat dissimilar at a cellular level. Studies over the last couple of decades have shown that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2016/jun/15/birds-pack-more-cells-into-their-brains-than-mammals" target="_blank">they have a much denser concentration of cells</a> - effectively, they pack a lot more potential power into a smaller volume.</p>
<p>African Greys (usually reckoned to be the smartest species, and the most proficient talkers) show <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/12/harvard-researchers-test-intelligence-of-african-grey-parrot/" target="_blank">intelligence comparable to a five-year-old child</a> in many tests. It shouldn't be entirely surprising, then, if some of them show a basic ability with language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ability to think abstractly about thoughts seems to be a uniquely human trait, and most probably because it requires complex language in which to frame said thoughts. However, this particular ability should not be confused with self-consciousness, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-consciousness-universal/" target="_blank">which is far more prevailent than most people realize</a>.</p>
<p>So, yes, and not just somewhat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on who you ask and what your definition of &quot;self conscious&quot; is. Many would say Alex would fail the red dot test while others would say the question was repeated so often that he was simply mimicking the question and not actually asking. He was asked that question hundreds of times a day for years. To many parrot owners he was considered a mentally abused bird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an oranged winged amazon for a while, he was quieter when you were in the same room if you left him alone for too long he'd start screeching and was one hell of a noisy bastard.</p>
<p>had lots of character though i remember he could say 'what ya doing?' and would often say it when you put your hand in his cage. &quot;what ya doin?&quot; other than that he must have learned other bird chirps and he often did whistle like builders whistling at a hot chick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also respond to ambient noise level.  They will tend to be louder when the environment is noisy (e.g. watching netflix) and quieter if everyone else is quiet.</p>
<p>Would be pretty funny to see, but maybe you could try watching with headphones?</p></div>		</li>
