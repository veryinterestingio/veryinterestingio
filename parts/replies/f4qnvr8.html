			<div class="markdown"><p>Being sociopathic does not mean you have a compulsion to hurt or kill everyone you meet. It just means that if you do you won't really feel regret beyond regretting the potential consequences of your act for yourself. </p>
<p>There is a chance you interacted with sociopaths in your life without even noticing.</p>
<p>You can therefore put a sociopath among other people and chances are many of them will find them charming. They are generally good at reading people since it's even more of an essential skill for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whom do you subject the psychopathic prisoners to in order to give the prisoner their necessary human interaction? Like that Swedish guy who killed like 100 youngsters on that island, who should have to hang around him just to give him his necessary human interaction? I don't think you could pay me to pretend to be his friend, unless it was a good salary with benefits.</p></div>		</li>
