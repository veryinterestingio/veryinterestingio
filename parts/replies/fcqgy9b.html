			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer here. I’m a respiratory therapist and this checks out.</p>
<p>To add to that, CO is about 220 times more attracted to hemoglobin than O2. To make matters worse, since your body doesn’t use the CO for anything, it just sticks around. To make matters worse worse, you will look all rosy cheeked and if we check your O2 levels using pulse oximetry, it will tell us you are at or near 100% saturated with O2. We have to use hyperbaric oxygen chambers to slowly force the CO out.</p>
<p>Edit: I read all the replies and would love to reply back to each one, but I just wanted to say thank you to all of those who corrected me on the stuff I was wrong about. TIL also! Happy New Year!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it measures the ratio of Heamaglobin bound to (O2/CO) to the total of Heamaglobin bound to (CO2/Empty).</p>
<p>It works fine when there isn't any CO, but it cannot tell the difference as the colours are essentially identical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give a little more information, LifePak 15s and certain other specialty devices have the ability to measure carboxyhemoglobin (when CO is bound to hemoglobin), but most pulse oximeters cannot. So you have to know which device you're using and its capabilities.</p>
<p>It's a very handy tool when you're treating someone with conditions like smoke inhalation, but it still can't tell you about cyanide exposure which causes similar physiological problems through a different mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carboxyhemoglobin (CO+Hb) shines at a very similar wavelength to oxyhemoglobin (O2+Hb), so the pulse oximeter assumes the ‘red stuff’ is oxygenated blood. Only pulse oximeters with multiple wavelengths, called Co-Oximeters, are capable of differentiating COHB ‘red’ from OxyHb red. Pulse oximetry is a <em>distant estimation</em> of blood oxygen content. The true gold standard is blood gas analysis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No.  95% of the CO in your blood, under normal conditions, will clear out each day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>No! It does come out, just 220 times slower. This is also aided by the fact that your blood cells are broken down in the spleen and liver and replaced frequently by blood made in your bone marrow, with a full exchange every ~4 months.</del></p>
<p>UPDATE: The biological half-life of CO is 320 minutes, so it'll be removed from your blood much faster than your blood is renewed.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can lead to problems with fire suppression systems.  They use an inert gas, like argon or xenon, and fill the room with it on order to remove the oxygen and smother the fire.  Your lungs don't care, as long as there's no carbon dioxide, so someone entering the room could suffocate without realising.  The lack of oxygen would just make you sleepy and groggy and you don't realise what's happening.</p>
<p>Back in the 50s or 60s some test engineers in NASA suffocated when testing a rocket capsule on the ground when the capsule filled with nitrogen leaving them with no oxygen, killing them.</p></div>		</li>
