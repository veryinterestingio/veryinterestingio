			<div class="markdown"><p>Clothes were more flammable and there were a lot more open flames. Gas and wood burning we’re far more common than today, people would to a lot more of their own repair work which could involve flames, and of course smoking was pervasive.</p>
<p>One day after my kid read something about the importance of not playing with matches he asked me if there used to be more matches around when I was a kid. I said, “now that you mention it, yes. They were on every diner table, in every lobby, and sitting in a bowl on every coffee table.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll go on record saying that I have a big box of wood matches in my kitchen drawer.  Sure, it's next to 3 scripto lighters so they rarely get used, but I've still got them.  They should last a lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably won't though.  If your clothes are on fire in 2020+ odds are you have a fuel embedded, as clothing is not made out of flammable materials.  You'd be better off removing the clothing than waiting for the fuel to burn out while rolling.</p></div>		</li>
