			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do people confuse them? Because in American politics both numbers are so absurdly negative (don't use &quot;absurd&quot; to draw inference on my opinion about government spending money). The current deficit is over a trillion dollars for 2020 and we're 23 trillion dollars in debt (some say much more, but we'll use published numbers) when numbers become so extreme the words themselves kinda lose meaning. Thus it's kinda easy to just conflate the two. Not to mention deficit spending leads to debt so they are not unrelated terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deficit or Surplus refers to spending. Is the government spending more or saving more?</p>
<p>If the government is in significant debt and the economy is doing well, they may choose to run a surplus for a few years, collecting more taxes than they are spending. They use that money to pay down their debt. That way, when the economy takes a turn for the worse, they have room to increase spending again, running a deficit and perhaps borrowing more if they need to.</p>
<p>If the Govt has -$100 in debt, they could run a surplus of $20 each year (say they're collecting $40/yr in taxes and spending only $20/yr). They spend the surplus $20/yr paying down the debt, and after 5 years the debt is gone. Alternatively, they could choose to run a deficit of $20/yr (say they're collecting $40/yr in taxes and spending $60/yr), after 5 years they will have -$200.</p>
<p>Running a surplus can be unpopular, as it involves spending cuts and/or tax hikes. Holding on to a large amount of debt can be unpopular too though, because then the government spends a lot of money paying interest on the debt, which is money that could be spent on public services.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you gain debt you also gain cash. </p>
<p>So if you will have deficit spending until the cash you gained from adding additional debt is spent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Deficit spending can lead to debt, but it doesn't have too.</p>
<p>Let's look at a simple example.  Say my income is $100,000</p>
<p>If one year I spend $90,000, that leaves $10,000 in savings. That's what we call a surplus. If a government declares the have surplus, it just means they spent less than they earned.</p>
<p>Now, let's say I want to buy a car but I don't want debt. I run the same $10,000 surplus for 3 years. I'll have $30,000 in savings</p>
<p>In year 4, I go buy a new car for $35,000.  If my income is still $100,000 and my regular expenses are still 90,000 then with the car will have spent $125,000 that year. That is $25,000 more than my income. I would say that I had a deficit of $25,000. When a government spends more than they earn, its called a deficit.</p>
<p>So at the end of the year I bought the car, I would still have $5,000 in savings. My yearly budget had a deficit, but no debt.</p>
<p>Now if in year 5, I buy a $200,000 house, I need to go into debt. My expenses are $90,000 and I only have $5,000 in savings. So I need $185,000 of debt (mortgage) .  That would mean I had expenses of $290,000 and only $100,000 income so I had a deficit of $190,000</p>
<p>In future years, I would have to use my surplus to pay off the debt.  If the payments were less than $10,000 I would be able to run a surplus while still having debt.</p>
<p>So in summary:
I can have a deficit, but not go into debt
A deficit may lead to debt if have no savings or use them all up
I can have a surplus, and still be in debt
A surplus can be used to pay off debt, or if I have no debt build up savings to offset future deficits</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stocks versus flows:</p>
<p>Stocks are what you have; flows are how things move</p>
<p>An example of a stock is a pool.  The level of the water in the pool is your stock.  You can adjust the stock by adding water or draining it.  If you remove more than you add, you have a deficit, but you can still have plenty of water in the pool.</p>
<p>With money, if you owe money you have debt.  If you have money you have savings.  That's your stock.  Your flow is your revenue minus your expenditures.  If you spend more than you make, you have a deficit.  The reverse is a surplus.</p>
<p>If you have lots of money in the bank, you can run deficits for a long time without going into debt.  An example is a retiree who has a large retirement account and spends that down over the years.  He runs annual deficits, but still has plenty of money.</p>
<p>On the other side you can have a younger working person.  She owes student loan debt and has a mortgage.  She makes much more than she spends, so she runs surpluses, but she still has debt that she is paying off.  Over time, that debt will shrink until she starts to have a positive net worth.  Her flows are surpluses, but her stocks are debts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that it's different from the debt a person might incur. The biggest differences being that people generally hope to retire at some point, which requires not just being clear of debt but also having a surplus, while a government exists in perpetuity, at least from the perspective of planning. And the government sets the rate of interest, meaning they can keep it very close to the rate of inflation, over which they have considerable influence, meaning that the amount they pay back later is worth about the amount they borrowed. Basically they're getting the money for little to no cost, so as long as they use that money for productive things, which improve the economy even a little, that debt turns out to be a money maker rather than a burden.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, yeah, but they can't set the rate at which other entities will buy their bonds from them. As an example, various European economies had vastly different bond rates to one another after the 2008 recession, despite all using the same currency with the same interest rate from the central bank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First world governments have independent central banks that influence the market interest rates by loaning or borrowing money from banks. These central banks also try to influence the inflation rate using monetary policy measures. As I already mentioned, central banks are completely independent from the government. So what you’ve said is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s important to note as well that government debt is fundamentally different from household debt. The government will NEVER pay off the national debt, nor should it. The size of the national debt only matters in terms of the cost of servicing that debt as part of the federal budget. Also important to note that we owe most of that debt to ourselves in the form of bonds held by American individuals and institutions.</p>
