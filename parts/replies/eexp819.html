<p>a patient receiving cpr can be intubated without further sedation</p>

<p>Being dead is an excellent sedative</p>
<p>But yes, I would tailor the anesthetic based on the mental status of the patient. Brain dead? No hypnotic needed. Unconscious but responsive to pain? Narcotic induction. Intubated and unconscious? Inhalational induction. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, sorry. But there are levels of consciousness based on what the person reacts to. </p>
<p>Alert - completely awake with no stimulus. </p>
<p>Voice - will react/open eyes to voice. </p>
<p>Pain - Will open eyes or react (at the most will open eyes and maybe vocalize sounds, at the least will grimace and/or contract some muscles) to pain. </p>
<p>Unresponsive - Will not react to anything in any way, including severe pain. </p>
<p>You can have someone unconscious (not alert at all) but reacting somewhat to pain. </p>
<p>Also see part of the <a href="https://www.glasgowcomascale.org/" target="_blank">Glasgow Coma Scale,</a> of which one component is Motor Response:</p>
<p>6 - Obeys Commands</p>
<p>5 - Localizes pain (not necessarily awake/eyes open)</p>
<p>4 - Withdraws from pain</p>
<p>3 - Flexion to pain</p>
<p>2 - Extension to pain</p>
<p>1 - No reaction</p>
<p>As for narcotic induction, I believe OP means that instead of needing to use paralytics and possibly multiple sedatives for anesthesia, s/he can use strictly a narcotic such as fentanyl. I only see certain varieties of things we need to sedate or paralyze for, so I don't have as much expertise in that field. In my area there are times we only need to use a narcotic to continue sedation instead of something like versed or propofol on top of the narcotic, for example in some intubated patients. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The autonomic system is part of the nervous system that is outside direct conscious control - it is responsible for the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response when you are scared or in pain, and the &quot;rest and digest&quot; response when the opposite is true. The &quot;fight or flight&quot; stress response keeps functioning even when the patient is fully unaware under anaesthesia.</p></div>		</li>
