			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend had a psychotic breakdown when we were about 16. He smoked daily but his dad was also killed in a horrific accident. So it’s hard to say what the true cause was. Scared me off weed though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm aware that we need a lot more research concerning this topic to fully understand the link between cannabis use and psychosis, but what I always read is that at the moment it is assumed that cannabis use does not increase your chances of getting psychosis, but that it can function as a &quot;trigger&quot; for people who are prone to psychosis, which means that those people basically get psychosis earlier than they would if they did not use cannabis. Can you link me any studies that suggest that cannabis use might actually be a cause for psychosis outbreak?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the cannabis will cause psychosis so much as that it may be one of many things that can increase the overall risk. Heavy cannabis use in adolescence is one environmental factor linked to increased risk, a family environment with high emotional expression is another, immigrant status another, experiencing something deeply traumatic another. None of those things by themselves will mean someone develops psychosis, but all of them have been linked to an increased risk. That's all I know from my understanding, I don't know anything about the genetics of it just environmental risk factors.</p></div>		</li>
