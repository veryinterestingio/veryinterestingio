<p>That's hyping a lot.  From your own reference,   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, even a catastrophic Kessler scenario at LEO would pose minimal risk for launches continuing past LEO, or satellites travelling at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit" target="_blank">medium Earth orbit</a> (MEO) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit" target="_blank">geosynchronous orbit</a> (GEO). The catastrophic scenarios predict an increase in the number of collisions per year, as opposed to a physically impassable barrier to space exploration that occurs in higher orbits.  </p>

<p>There's a lot of space; and transferring between significantly different orbits requires a lot of energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only crowding in our airspace is at airports, where all air traffic must originate from and end at.  Once you're away from the airport, you never come close to another aircraft and rarely even see them.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's separation rules in place that keep planes specific distances from each other. That's why they rarely fly into each other. I fly 75+ times a year and almost always have a window seat. I see planes all the time even when we're in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>There are flight routes that many planes take that mean that there's absolutely going to be planes in the vicinity for those routes. Just pull up something like FlightRadar24 and you can see them. It's not like the planes are flying in tandem but they can be relatively close. This is especially true for flights between North America and Europe as something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Tracks" target="_blank">North Atlantic Tracks</a> is in effect. There's a similar system called the Pacific Organized Track System.</p>
<p>Here's some great animations where you can clearly see some of the busier routes between major hubs: <a href="http://maps.unomaha.edu/AnimatedFlightAtlas/FlightTrafficAnimation.html" target="_blank">http://maps.unomaha.edu/AnimatedFlightAtlas/FlightTrafficAnimation.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alot of space! Here is an example for perspective. If you take a classroom size globe of the Earth, a scale model of the international space station would be in orbit about a centimeter from the surface. And so small you would need a 100x microscope to see it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Decay would mean any object under 350 KM would be gone in under a year, so its clearly hyped up a bit. Biggest issue would be it'd destroy current LEO satellites and make 500KM-700KM impossible to stay in for extended periods of time, and introduce more risk when going above that altitude.</p>
<p>Still wouldn't make space travel impossible, because the majority of collisions don't create debris large enough to smash another spacecraft in the same style of collision, and the majority of debris wouldn't even be in a stable orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, satellites go up to like 30,000k.</p>
<p>Very LEO - 350k is lower than the ISS isn't the issue.  It's the stuff 500-20,000k that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most satellites are in LEO. Beyond LEO, the number of satellites is lower and the &quot;shell's&quot; surface grows quadratically. Besides, most MEO and all geosynchronous orbits follow a ring around Earth's equator, which makes the shell problem less likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ISS could be moved below 350KM - in fact it has been multiple times, what I was saying is that spaceflight is definitely not screwed even by the worse possible kessler syndrome. Not many satellites are at above 900 KM and below 30000, so yea its the 500-900 belt thats the problem, which is easiest solved by taking the big unpowered pieces of junk that caused the 2009 collision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kessler syndrome isn't a problem at the higher orbits as there is simply such a vast amount of volume (it increases by the cube...) and, on top of that, all GSO satellites orbit in the same plane and altitude so they don't cross each others paths. </p>
<p>It's the middle band of LEO where the danger zone is. It's the sweet spot with a relatively high population of satellites and long decay times.</p></div>		</li>
