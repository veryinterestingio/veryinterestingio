			<div class="markdown"><p>Hamsters are really triggered by basically anything, I knew one that would freak out if a can of compressed air was used in a room over, they're all a bit different but unless you hear them start squeaking you can be rest assured it's just natural instincts and you aren't stressing it out too much.</p>
<p>Make sure it's got a proper sized cage and plenty of room to dig to feel safe and the lil ham will be okay. Pet stores often house hamsters in terribly inhumane ways, and they can come with lots of trauma from being a cage mate that is bullied constantly in a cage not even big enough for a single hamster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, but also because many rodents are heavily preyed on by birds. Birds of prey (hawks, eagles, etc) mostly hunt by eyesight - eagles, for example, have almost no sense of smell (vs mammal predators which tend to rely very heavily on smell to track down prey). </p>
<p>So if you’re an eagle’s prey and you think you’ve been spotted - freezing in place makes it easier to escape detection as you’re not creating any more movement for your predator to track you down with, meaning you’re less likely to become dinner. </p>
<p>Incidentally, this is why the introduction of domestic cats has been so brutal to native birds to more recently settled island nations areas like Polynesia and New Zealand (humans have only been on New Zealand for the last 1000 years or so). </p>
<p>Historically these islands had no mammal predators until humans came along, only bird predators. Freezing is a great strategy to escape a Haast’s eagle, but a terrible strategy to escape a cat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have four rats and this is so right. Their eyesight is shit but their hearing is awesome. Thankfully, rats learn pretty quickly which noises  are safe. My girls chase the vacuum cleaner and don't react when the neighbours throw plates. Fire trucks are fine. But open a treat jar or make the &quot;you have 3 seconds to get off the human couch&quot; signal and they react right away from across the apartment.</p></div>		</li>
