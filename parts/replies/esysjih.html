			<div class="markdown"><p>Just had my house rebuilt from a fire and not a HVAC engineer. Originally my return was on the 1st floor and it basically just went over a wall to the furnace in the garage, with the rebuild it got moved to the middle of the 2nd floor. This did result in the loss of a good portion of a closet since there was no dead space in the walls up there to accommodate that much duct. We don't have A/C so it is a bit more efficient to heat the warmest air in the house, but not sure if that was the main consideration in the change or if it was a code thing. There's a lot of code changes in 25 years I'm finding out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably depends on what the house usually needs. This is speculation based on anecdotal evidence, but houses in the north where it gets cold have return vents on the floor to get the cold out; houses in the south where it gets hot have return vents on the ceiling to get the hot air out.</p>
<p>Temperate climates might need both, but the more vents you add, the higher the cost of construction, because you need room for the vent shafts in the frame of the building and there's more material/installation to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the coolest setups I've seen, had dual vents.  Vents in the ceiling and Vents in the floor.  When the AC was on a damper swapped over to blow cold air out of the ceiling and when the heat was on it came up from the floor.  Then they had ceiling fans in every room.</p>
<p>So if it was cold, you reverse the ceiling fan and it sucks up the heat.  If it's hot you put the ceiling fan on normal and it blows the cold air down and around.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do to make a huge difference in energy efficiency is equip your house with exterior shutters.  Light comes through windows and heats up what it hits inside, like curtains for example.  But if you have an exterior shutter, you can close it and that heat stays outside.  </p>
<p>Of course I'd rather have all my vents in the ceiling for cold AC and have heated floors, but that's expensive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In my city, there's a trend to equip new high-rise buildings with &quot;second skin&quot; which are basically perforated aluminum plates that shields the windows. People can still see outside but the second skin functions as sun shields, lowering heat as much as 45% so the building is more energy efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome.  </p>
<p>My strategy when I built my house was to build a ranch house on a basement.  The basement is 95% underground sitting on french drains and a sump pump and it has a 9' ceiling, so it's deeper than most basements.  It's on a mountain so I don't really have to worry about water run off, it goes down hill down the ridge.  </p>
<p>HVAC unit is in the basement, all the vents are in the floor of the up stairs (by the windows etc in all the bedrooms).  </p>
<p>Attic is extremely well insulated, all modern insulation in the house, and even the basement is insulated.  The windows are all Anderson Silverline windows.  The front of the house is shaded entirely by a 46 foot porch and roof and the rear and sides of the house are shaded by trees.  In total the house is 28 feet long, 70 feet wide counting the garage (all continuous roof).  The houses roof is gray and siding is blue.  </p>
<p>I don't have shutters, but aside from the sliding deck door there's not much that get's direct sunlight into the house due to the trees.  </p>
<p>Electric Heatpump and ceiling fans.  There is also a wood burning fireplace directly under my master bedroom.  </p>
<p>My electric bill this month was $80 and that's with the hvac set to 70 degrees Fahrenheit .  In the winter I supplement with wood heat, and it stays under $100 as well.</p></div>		</li>
