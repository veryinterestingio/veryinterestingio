			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a fascinating bit about this in one of Richard Dawkins books, I think The Blind Watchmaker. </p>
<p>The sound the bat uses for echolocation has to be incredibly loud because sound attenuates rapidly: it weakens as it travels, then a fraction of the sound energy bounces back, then it weakens further on the way back to the bat.  </p>
<p>So the bat needs to have super-sensitive hearing to pick up the very faint sounds, but it's generating extremely loud high pitched sounds at the same time! So the bat disconnects its hearing each time it generates a pulse of sound: and it does this multiple times a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bats only produce these sounds when hunting. Unless a bat is doing it directly into another bat's ear it's not going to cause an issue.</p></div>		</li>
