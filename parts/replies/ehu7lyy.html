			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this still work on a treadmill? I imagine it will since the phone is still moving around. Referencing GPS could counter this. However, most treadmills are indoors where a GPS signal may be hard to get. I usually just leave my phone on the treadmill but I need to start logging steps for medical insurance incentives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will only be able to count the number of steps. But the distance will be inaccurate, since it's simply using the number of steps multiplied with some distance around 2-3 feet.</p>
<p>The GPS signal wouldn't help even if the treadmill was outside, since it can't tell the phone anything about what your feet did.</p>
<p>It's just used to be more accurate when walking/running outside, since the distance each step takes can vary quite a lot between people and walking speeds.</p>
<p>So it'll tell you 10,000 steps (as in as many &quot;shocks&quot;) and then use the most accurate source to put a distance behind that like 5 miles.</p>
<p>But the step counter will always work. It does not require anything to happen but the shocks from landing on the next foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I donâ€™t think it would work with a phone. However, my anecdotal experience is that the Apple Watch is capable of giving a fairly accurate estimate of distance when running on a treadmill (Like within 1% of the distance shown on the treadmill). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend got a FitBit for her mother at Christmas. Her mom has been obsessed with the thing, which is good...she's always tracking her steps and such.</p>
<p>But one thing she found out was that when she does her crocheting, the FitBit would register that motion as steps as well.</p>
<p>So she takes the FitBit off when crocheting.</p></div>		</li>
