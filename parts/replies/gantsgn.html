			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi thank you so much for the explanation When the lymphocyte numbers rebounded, would the T-cells continue to attack the beta cells? Or would that 14 day gap allow the beta cells to repair so that they can start producing enough insulin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit lengthy, but includes information I probably should have put in the original comment:</p>
<p>This study was designed to look at prevention of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) onset. They did this by treating relatives of T1D patients who had not yet developed T1D themselves, treated them with teplizumab (or placebo control) for 14 days, and then followed them for several years to see how many participants in each group developed T1D. In the group that received teplizumab, onset of T1D was delayed by over 2 years. </p>
<p><em>Teplizumab has a slight preference for activated T cells</em>, so in a &quot;normal&quot; person who is not battling infection, the majority of those activated T cells will be what we call auto-reactive: they see normal proteins that are supposed to be there, and think they're foreign. In the case of T1D, this leads to them attacking the beta cells. So <em>in a person with T1D</em> (or at high risk for it), <em>a large chunk of activated T cells will be attacking beta cells.</em> </p>
<p>Now, it's important to remember that once you've been diagnosed with &quot;clinical significant&quot; T1D, it means that severe damage has already been done to your beta cells and they're no longer able to produce enough insulin to meet your body's demands. That's why trials of teplizumab in people already diagnosed with T1D have been disappointing: The damage is already done. This trial screened people for signs of T cells attacking beta cells (inconsistent insulin levels, auto-antibodies). These are the ones at high risk of progression to T1D, but who still have enough beta cells to meet demand.</p>
<p>So in the study participants, administration of teplizumab had what you might call a &quot;preferential&quot; effect on beta-cell attacking T cells. This led to a median time of T1D diagnosis of 2 years in the control group, and 4 years in the treatment group, with many still free of diagnosis over five years later. </p>
<p>Now, to your question, once the T cell counts rebound, is it likely they would be still able to attack beta cells: yes. This is why they're following these patients to see what fraction of them do go on to develop T1D. A question that arises is: would it be worth trying to do multiple treatment courses, say, every 3-4 years? Not sure.</p>
<p>In any case, a delay of 2 years in T1D diagnosis is huge. Why? In contrast to T2D, T1D is diagnosed more often in <em>children</em>. 80% of new diabetes cases in individuals &lt;19 years of age are T1D cases. Why does this matter? T1D is a huge stress on the patient (often in this case, a child), and one the parents. Delaying onset means these children are much more likely to have a childhood with considerably fewer health worries, it takes significant stress of the parents, and it means that if the individual does, unfortunately, progress to T1D, they will be more likely to be at a stage in their life where they are able to be active participants in the management of their disease, rather than passive participants who can't understand why they don't get to do the same things as all the other kids.</p></div>		</li>
