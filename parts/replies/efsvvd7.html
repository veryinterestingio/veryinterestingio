			<div class="markdown"><p>I've assumed it was just a matter of naming things before understanding them.  When magnets were found to align with the North/South directions, the ends were just named in the same way.  Presumably nobody had the realisation that opposite poles attract and therefore the naming convention is wrong until it was too late.</p>
<p>Maybe a bit like the convention for electric currents - we always talk about current flowing from +ve to -ve, but in fact current is almost always the flow of -ve charges in the opposite direction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit. Last part is apparently not true. My convention is better, though!</p></div>		</li>
