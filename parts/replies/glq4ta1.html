			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing how we hold on to old habits and outdated information. It was advisable to fully cycle <del>NiMH</del> NiCD batteries to avoid the memory effect back when they were a thing; Li-Ion batteries are very different, and still, my fiance was adviced by a retail worker to always fully drain and charge her iPhone battery when she bought it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except NiMH doesn't have memory effect. That was observed in NiCD batteries of a very specific type, in extremely specific conditions.</p>
<p>NiCD is a type that quickly went out of fashion except for things like power tools because cadmium is poisonous as hell. But more than that, memory effect was observed in a specific type of NiCD, and in satellites, that is, devices that charge and discharge on an incredibly consistent schedule. It can barely be detected in laboratory conditions, and likely wasn't ever an actual issue in consumer applications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, before we starting doping our li-Ion  with graphene, the full cycle thing was actually good advice. Li- batteries then were prone to memory so if you kept plugging it in at 40%, 40% would become the new 0%,.</p>
<p>This hasn't been an issue since 2006ish</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I just go by the manufacturer's manual. If they recommend it one way, I try to keep that in mind but I don't go out of my way.</p>
<p>I used to stress over my Nintendo Switch losing its battery health over time, some people even recommended to not leave it on the dock because it could still drain the battery.</p>
<p>I just gave up and decided if someday the battery becomes too bad, I'll just get a new battery or a power bank. Problem solved</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for clarification, this is true for all lithium cobalt oxide and lithium manganese oxide batteries. Other lithium batteries, not so much. </p>
<p>For example, while I've never seen them in a laptop, lithium iron phosphate batteries behave much differently. They're suitable for deep cycling, do not suffer from thermal runaway, and have inverted temperature related resistance — where resistance increases the colder they get instead of the other way around. Minor inconvenience if you use them in cold. </p>
<p>I use these in my motorcycles for the weight savings and the lack of potential thermal runaway and explodey-goodness of a standard lion. After all, with the battery square between my legs, I'd rather not turn  into a Jerry Lee Lewis song.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, you're supposed to look for an option in your bios that will limit maximum charge to 80%.</p>
<p>Or if you're on an Asus laptop, go to the MyAsus app and set it to 60%</p></div>		</li>

I can click the icon and have it charge to 100% if I know I’m going to be using it unplugged for a while if I choose, though.</p></div>		</li>
