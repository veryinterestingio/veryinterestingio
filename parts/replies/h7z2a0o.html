			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey help me out here. I thought R0 was the &quot;basic reproduction number&quot; of a pathogen. That is, an average of how many infections will be caused by an individual case in a population that has no experience with that pathogen.</p>
<p>Once you factor in vaccines, past infections, and public health numbers, we are no longer talking about R0 but R^E. Or rather, we are no longer talking about &quot;basic reproduction number&quot; and are now talking about &quot;effective reproduction number&quot;. </p>
<p>I don't think it is possible to reduce the R0 of a pathogen. However, the R^E can be changed for a given population.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is possible largely because the real world conditions is a bit more complicated than the model R0 originated from.  The base spread rate can actually be tied to a couple different environmental factors. </p>
<p>R0 is a normal term that shows up in models that deal with exponential rates (generally any process where the speed is determined by current population size).  It's also has analogs in other fields such as initial rates, starting velocity, and other similar terms.  </p>
<p>The thing is though even though it's thought to be a constant in modeling, in real world processes even the R0 can be dependent on multiple factors. For example.  We know for example COVID's stability in aerosol droplets is a function of both relative humidity and temperature. It is most stable at low temperatures and either really high relative humidity or really low relative humidity. This determines how long the virus stays active in an aerosol which can influence how likely it is to spread to a new host.  If all other factors are constant the R0 will also be constant.  This is similar to how in say chemistry, the rate constant of a chemical reaction is only a constant if the temperature and other thermodynamic conditions are the same.  This is also why it's usually tough to measure these kinds of values exactly when you can't strictly control the conditions.</p>
<p>It's pretty well known that exponential constants can themselves be functions of other variables. Usually those variables don't change rapidly however which is why the model still works well even for those situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that the difference between R0 and Re?</p>
<p>R0 is the virus's base &quot;in the wild&quot; replication factor, where Re is its &quot;effective&quot; replication factor.  It's Re that matters most, as this is the one we can change.</p></div>		</li>
