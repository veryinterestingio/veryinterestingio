			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, gold and silver do have some fantastic functional properties. Gold is an excellent conductor of both heat and electricity, and its extreme ductility means it can be stretched very very thinly. That’s why you can have gold contacts in a lot of electronic connectors, or gold-plated objects that aren’t super expensive.</p>
<p>Silver also has a lot of practical applications, though I’m not quite as knowledgeable off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>
