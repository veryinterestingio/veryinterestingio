<blockquote>
<p>investigators had a breakthrough when one posed as a  potential advertiser on the site, and combined this information with  data handed over by Apple that allegedly successfully cross-referenced  an IP-address used for an iTunes transaction with another used to login  to KAT's Facebook account.  </p>
<p>The official complaint  reads: &quot;Records provided by Apple showed that tirm@me conducted an  iTunes transaction using IP Address 109.86.226.203 on or about July 21,  2015.&quot;  </p>
