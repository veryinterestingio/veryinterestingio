			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the point. I once was wondering where the border is on surviving thirst in the desert by drinking alcoholic drinks. So, you could continue to drink a 4% beer for days and survive the killer thirst. But drinking 60% vodka probably would dehydrate you quicker. </p>
<p>We never really looked it up but there must be a tipping point where the alcoholic content outweighs the water. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Overall they're actually hydrating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that beer was much much thinner back then. When Leonora Christina Ulfeldt was imprisoned 1663-1685, her guards, the soldiers of Hammershus, were noted for drinking 12 liters of beer per day, each. Around the same time, soldiers in Aalborg complained that they were only given 6 liters each per day. The rich usually drank less than 8 liters because their beer were richer. </p>
<p>In Denmark, we also have a saying of &quot;only the thin beer remaining&quot; which means only being offered leftovers or a lower quality product. The saying is also used in gym classes if someone else has had first pick for their team and you have to do with those who aren't picked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It was the same in factories in the Victorian  times up until the 20th Century. They would drink beers at lunch as the water was so dirty. Also they all drank a lot of gin for the same reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once got bottles called Spiritus(*spirytus?) smuggled from Poland to Sweden where I live. Those motherfuckers are 96%, but only 4 bottles could sustain the entire house worth of people (I mixed 1 part spiritus with 2 parts cold water before adding any other ingredients to the drinks. Shit was strong tho).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure on the science, but from personal experience a hangover from primarily sugary alcoholic drinks feels MUCH worse than one from a similar amount of straight alcohol. Similar to how you feel like garbage after having a ton of cake/ice cream, just combined with a normal hangover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It dehydrates you. You just want water and electrolytes (salts) to help replace what the alc is taking from you so sugar free sports drink or mineral water but mostly if you just take shots of something low(er) sugar like vodka and chug water in between you won’t have a bad hangover </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright you do this for me then. Get yourself a breathalyzer, one night drink only wine, one night drink only mixed drinks with soda or high sugar mixers, and another night drink clear liquor with water or club soda or another sugar-free mixer. Drink to the same BAC each time and find out how that sugar is affecting your hangover.</p>
<p>Edit: Also good excuse for drinking if you need one :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol in small quantities with large amounts of water will not dehydrate a person. A common use of alcohol, before modern processing, was to treat water to make it consumable.  This would be grog from back in the day, and I believe wine was used in the same way. Alcohol fueled exploration.</p></div>		</li>
