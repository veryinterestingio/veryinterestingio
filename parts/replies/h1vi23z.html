			<div class="markdown"><p>Places like California have just not needed to, there has been sufficient water in nearby places (mountains) that can be relocated to the places you want to irrigate and stored in various reservoirs. There are currently some places with less water access that are investing in water recycling (instead of just letting it out into the ocean) and also desalination. In the end whatever is cheapest is usually the approach that people take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it is one of the greatest sources of hope that I have the we will be able to solve global warming and other environmental problems through technology.  The vast majority of the progress they have made was just done in the last 10-15 years. Imagine where they would be if they didn't have to focus so much energy and resources on defense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of misleading tho - feel free to correct me
Israel's water supply numbers do not include west bank lands. But Israel does (illegally) control the wells in the west bank and uses it to supply settlements and their borders (which counts as Israeli land)
So that 'recycling' and 'efficiency' is (partly) stealing
Their numbers don't make sense simply because the situation their is too messed up for the numbers to truly reflect how good they are.
That being said, they are superb when it comes to water desalination. Not human rights tho</p></div>		</li>
