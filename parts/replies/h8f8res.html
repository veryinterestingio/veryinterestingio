			<div class="markdown"><p>See that's the question. Each virus will technically be different from one another just through natural coding mistakes. I imagine they're focused on the spike protein and it's precursor genes. There's probably a statistical method to determine if the mutation is significant, that taken into account along with what sort of gain of function the mutation causes, probably would lead to a new variant?</p>
<p>Like there could be a significant mutation in like a random exon that doesn't code for anything particularly crucial and they wouldn't classify that as a full variant worthy of investigation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They base the classification on real world data, no? So every few percent of PCR positive samples are sent to get a full sequencing and then that gives the strain/variant, and then based on aggregate data the WHO issues reports... right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an epidemiological/health question more than it's a scientific/taxonomic question. It's not a scientific criteria of &quot;differentness&quot;, it's a practical consideration of &quot;interestingness&quot;. The WHO literally calls them &quot;variants of interest&quot;.</p>
<p>So the answer is &quot;different enough that it's worth tracking separately&quot; and there are a wide variety of factors that could make a variant &quot;interesting&quot;. That could be transmissibility, deadliness, incidence of hospitalisation, resistance to (some) vaccines or (some) antibodies, speed of geographic spread, and many more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the greek letter system for variants was introduced, it was first used for the &quot;variants of concern&quot;, which were given the letters alpha-delta, and then for the &quot;variants of interest&quot; of which Epsilon was the oldest</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The WHO variant names are in the order that they have been re-classified as a variant of interest, which is not necessarily the same order that they were first identified.</p>
<p>Also, it takes some months until a new variant spreads enough to show that it is a variant of interest. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Epsilon_variant" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epsilon (CAL.20C) was first observed in July 2020 by researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, California, in one of 1,230 virus samples collected in Los Angeles County since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic.[1] It was not detected again until September when it reappeared among samples in California, but numbers remained very low until November.[9][10] In November 2020, the Epsilon variant accounted for 36 percent of samples collected at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and by January 2021, the Epsilon variant accounted for 50 percent of samples</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Referring to the variants with Greek letters is a fairly recent development, and is managed by the WHO. They aren't necessarily named in the order they were discovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many different antibodies are attacking the spike protein from somebody who is vaccinated?</p>
<p>Do variations in this protein that reduce vaccine effectiveness mean certain antibodies become entirely ineffective?</p>
<p>Will somebody who has had all of the proteins (from the actual virus) in there system have a larger set of antibodies against multiple proteins?</p></div>		</li>
