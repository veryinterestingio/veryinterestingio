<p>Amory from the Endless Thread poidcast team here just copying and pasting one of Dr. Meissner's answers to a very similar question below:  &quot;Lymerix was available in the US but production was stopped because of law suits. Even though some awards were made by the courts, it is clear today that the vaccine was not responsible.  Second generation Lyme vaccines are being developed and will be available in not too distant future.  A Lyme vaccine would only be recommended for people who live in Lyme endemic areas, so routine vaccination would not be recommended for all.  </p>
<p>A vaccine against RSV is being developed.  One approach is to vaccinate pregnant mothers so their babies will have protection for the first few months of life.  This is another area of need for vaccines.&quot;</p>

<p>Why not? What are the drawbacks of vaccination that would make it not recommended more universally?  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the AMAer but there is risk to everything we do in medicine, even vaccinations and this must be weighed against the potential benefits. The majority of the time risk is very low but there will always be people who will have an allergic reaction when given a new medicine. Even if the risk of a reaction is very low, if your risk of contracting Lyme is basically zero then the risks will still outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>A second consideration is cost, I do not know specifically about Lyme but some vaccines need boosters every so often which increases the cost, there is cost associated with the production and infrastructure, cost of publicizing it and educating people, etc. Viable public health interventions should be cost effective. </p>
<p>If something has little to no benefit but significant cost and risk it does not make sense implement.</p>
<p>Edit: think of it this way, why donâ€™t we just put hurricane glass and hurricane shutters on every house in America?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes please answer this! </p>
<p>As Lyme disease carrying ticks are becoming more prevalent closer to urban centres will this result in a human vaccine being tested and developed? Or is there something inherently specific in the disease that permits a dog vaccine to exist but not a human vaccine?</p></div>		</li>
