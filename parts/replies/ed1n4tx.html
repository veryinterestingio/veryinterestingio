			<div class="markdown"><p>You raise an interesting point. Traditionally, efficiency means the amount of energy converted to mechanical work (while the rest turns to heat waste). So, say an engine or a motor is 40% efficient. However, this has also been applied to light bulbs, for instance, going from 10% for incandescents to 70-80% for the best in class LEDs.</p>
<p>However, how do you go about measuring the efficiency of a CPU? Surely we can't say they're 100% inefficient and do nothing with their power. </p>
<p>Although, for the non traditional use cases, I would imagine it's not their actual output that's being measured, but rather how much heat they generate and substract that from the total power usage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there is a measurement. its FLOPS (FLoating point Operations Per Second) per Watt. basically, how many calculations can a cpu do every second if given a single watt of power. so a 2 megaflops per watt cpu would do 2 million floating point operations for each watt of power you feed it.</p></div>		</li>
