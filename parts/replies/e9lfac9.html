			<div class="markdown"><p>While that is true, the respiratory issues are to a different extend. Healthy humans regularly sneeze to remove irritants from the respiratory tract. Healthy mice almost never sneeze. They sneeze when there's persistent respiratory problems, such as lung infections etc. It also occurs at a different frequency in mice than in healthy humans, more akin to high-pitched labored breathing than the sudden expulsion of air that we are used to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does it really include it? I thought that calories/energy in food was measured by essentially burning the food. If that's true, it would just be a pure measure of energy rather than a net that subtracts the energy needed to digest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems that the original method was burning, but now they just measure the amount of fats, carbs, protein, etc... and calculate it from there (and the original measurements for those components did come from burning). The article points out that they specifically leave out fiber because the energy from fiber is not accessible to humans.</p>
<p>It still doesn't answer my question of whether the caloric count includes the energy needed to process the nutrients. For example, it says 9 Kcal/g is used for fats, but is that just the total energy or the energy net of the energy needed to digest said fats? The article doesn't say anything about this, so I believe it's the former. I don't think there is any subtraction being done for digestion.</p></div>		</li>
