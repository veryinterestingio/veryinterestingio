<p>In one day, the <strong>blood</strong> travels a total of 19,000 km (12,000 miles)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6.3 km/h * 24 hours = 151.2 kilometres. And it would be significantly less than that, considering the blood in your veins travels a lot slower than the blood in your arteries and the blood actually only travels around <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6695664" target="_blank">92 cm/s or approximately 3.3 km/h</a> in the ascending aorta, where it would be at its peak velocity. What you're saying is all the blood combined travels a <strong>combined</strong> total of 19000 kilometres. Big difference.</p>
<p>That's like saying 5 people in a car, driving for 100 kilometres, traveled 500 kilometres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm.  If he came up with 19,000 km, and you came up with 151.2km, and the difference is due to combining blood like you say, then we can divide 19,000 by 151 to conclude that the human body contains 125.8 units of blood.</p>
<p>I suspect that that's nonsense, and that the reality is that /u/Drhma simply measured the length of all of the blood vessels.  We can check that against his volume figure by dividing 5L across 19,000 km and we get an area of 263 square micrometers, which sounds to me like a believable average cross-sectional area for a blood vessel (it'd be about 18 micrometers in diameter)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so, because the total length of all blood vessels in your body is more than 5 times that, approximately <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39925-circulatory-system-facts-surprising.html" target="_blank">100,000 kilometres.</a> Fun fact, all of your blood vessels laid out could circle the Earth about 2.5 times. I'm not sure how he got 19000 kilometres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that calculation is way off.<br />
19000 km/day is 13.19 km/minute or 220 m/s on average.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These 5 liters of <strong>blood</strong> circulate through the body three times every minute. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure about that. The average male weighting 70kg has around 5 litters of blood and a left ventricle volume of 70ml.</p>
<p>So if I am doing the math correctly 70ml x 80bpm (state of rest or mild work like walking) = 5,6l of blood are pumped out of the heart at any given minute. This is 112% of the blood volume.</p>
<p>Edit: higher bpm (beats per minute) will increase to blood flow but to a point. Mainly because the heart needs some time of rest (diastole) that is used to fill itself with the next batch of blood. At around 140-160 bpm as a physician I usually see lowering of the blood pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct </p>
<p>I perform and interpret right heart caths, and we measure cardiac output and cardiac index (CI).  Only CI has a normal range - it's 2.4 to about 4 L/min/m2.</p>
<p>This translates to a usual CO of 5 to 6 L per min. </p>
<p>This regularly doubles or triples with exertion, so your heart definitely can pump 15 L per minute - but that would be highly abnormal at rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not done any work on that sphere of medicine but my gut tells me that trippling the volume of blood that gets pumped might be a little unrealistic on normal individuals (maybe not for professional athletes). Even if you have very high blood pressure (such as in a patient/training person under stress or injected with adrenalin) there still has to be some technical time for the blood to get into the heart during diastole.</p>
<p>So if you have 160 bpm and the heart spends around 60% of the time in diastole this means (if my math is correct) that there will be around 0.225 sec for the heart to fill up as oppose to ~0.5 sec (on 70-80bpm). If we consider that a healthy heart has to have around 70ml of left ventricular volume and around 15-20ml left over blood (going on a memory here could be mistaken) and mitral valve of 3-6mm. </p>
<p>This means that on a conservative estimate the volume flow should be around 222-244,2ml/s (depending on the left over blood in the ventricle) and the velocity of blood going through the mitral valve should be at least 7.85 m/s and up to 34.5m/s if the valve is 3mm wide.</p>
<p>All these calculations are for ~10l/min goal (160bpm) of blood flow. If we want to get triple - 15l/min I would consider it highly improbable if we take a normal person as a blueprint.</p></div>		</li>
