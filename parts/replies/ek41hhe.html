			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with the crust the uppermost part of the mantle, which is called &quot;lithospheric mantle&quot;, goes beneath the overlying plate into the mantle. Plates are basically fragments of lithosphere. Oceanic lithosphere is colder and denser in comparison to continental lithosphere, and therefore it always subducts at a subduction zone. You can imagine the process as putting a long ice bar into a hot, steaming soup. Mantle is hot. Once in the mantle, the behaviour of the subducting plate may be different. It can either cross the 660-km transition zone and sink toward deeper regions or simply stagnate at the transition zone.</p>
<p>At this point, I advise you to look at the article in the following link:
