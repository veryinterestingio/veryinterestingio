			<div class="markdown"><p>Most lawn grass comes from hybrid strains of grass. Therefore the seed that this grass would produce is typically sterile. If you're seeing benefits it's likely just due to a reintroduction of nitrogen provided by the clippings, not the seeds sprouting. In cases where it does sprout, the resulting grass will not be the same as it's parent. So the lawn will have inconsistent traits requiring different methods of care (sun tolerance, water retention, growth rate, ect.). Best practice is to just purchase the seed you know is needed, fertilize and water appropriately, and cut regularly to maintain the recommended hieght.</p>
<p>Will also add that certain grasses spread through rhyzomes. This is horizontal growth of the roots that continues to sprout new stocks of grass. With these grass types, regular mowing will actually encourage this spreading to occur as it forces the plant to focus it's energy towards it's roots since it doesn't have so much on top that requires nutrition. Therefore the whole practice of seeding becomes less and less necessary over time.</p>
<p>Edit: First gold for knowledge about grass. Not the most glamorous topic for that honor but I'll take it. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would the same thing apply to a hybrid variety of kale? Are the seeds worthless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Store bought seed is often contaminated with other grass species, and even seeds of common weeds. I prefer to let my grass repopulate naturally. Plus, it's free!</p></div>		</li>
