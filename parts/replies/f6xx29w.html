			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it is not like you &quot;see stars&quot; when you experience an aura. It is more like you loose vision in some parts of your view. For me it slowly expands from the middle and grows until i cannot see anything i focus on anymore. It is kinda weird, because loosing vision in certain regions is not like &quot;going black&quot;. You simply do not notice anything odd, but you cannot seem to focus at some spots. (This might only apply to me, but it seems to be a general symptom from what i have heard).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First time I experienced it I thought I was having a stroke. It took me a minute to remember a friend describing her “migraines” which are entirely visual before I realized I was experiencing a visual migraine or, what I later understood to be an “aura” as this visual loss became the precursor to my migraines thereafter. I’d had migraines my whole life and never had auras until my mid 20’s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember my first migraine. I was in gym class in middle school and we were playing basketball. A classmate tried to pass me the ball and got mad because I didn’t react. I was confused because I literally did not see the ball. My auras weren’t tunnel vision, more of blind spots. I haven’t had a migraine in 10+ years, but to this day I get paranoid and anxious if my vision does anything weird haha! I also experienced physical auras in which the entire left side of my body would be numb and tingly. If I took excedrin when I first noticed my fingertips getting tingly I could prevent the pain, but if it got any further than that I was in for a good 8 hrs of intense pain and up to two days of moderate pain no matter if I had excedrin or not. The numbness was so bizarre though, even the left half of my tongue would be numb while the right side wasn’t.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had a major migraine attack during a meeting that was the last thing I had to do that day. I tried to write out what was going on to my coworker because my speech was slurred. I tried to write that I wasn’t leaving until it settled. We had a good laugh the next day because even what I wrote down was unintelligible. I hate auras.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always liken the visual symptoms to if you accidentally look at the sun, or too bright of a light or whatever. There’s that refractory period which typically lasts 2-3 seconds where your eyes dilate and recover from the burst of light. However, with an aura, that “recovery” period lasts like 40 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, that seems really accurate. I also get the same feeling when I close my eyes. With closed eyes I can &quot;see&quot; the spot, where the sun was and I can also &quot;see&quot; the spot where I loose my vision due to migraine in almost the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting. Especially how migraines behave so differently depending on the person. I used to get migraines with an aura about once every 6 months. The aura was only in my right eye as an area of &quot;wobbly&quot; vision. However I've noticed the migraines stopped completely for some reason after I got laser eye correction. I wonder sometimes if the migraines were related to my vision</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>migraines can definitely be caused or exacerbated by vision issues.  Most migraine-specialized neuros seem to insist on eye exams for that very reason.  I know that my own wacky vision (left near, right slightly far) makes my migraines much worse when I don't have my glasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was explained by a Neuroscientist, that epilepsy and migraine are due to neural circuits, that reach a certain activation threshold and keep activating themselfs which leads to local, in the case of a migraine, or global, in case of epilepsy, periodical activations. Is that true, or am i mistaken here? Seems like quite a good explanation to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that is indeed a wide accepted theory, but a lot of things is unknown. I think what you tell is more related to epilepsy than migraine, as migraine can have more than one cause and the threshold alterations are only found in familial migraine. </p>
<p>But yes, in epilepsy the brain is over-active and this keeps enhancing the own activation. In normal conditions, the brain has like an automatic feedback systems that becomes active if the brain gets to active and slows the signal down, by altering the threshold or lowering the input. It's like your brain has 2 signals, positives and negative ones. The positive ones are used to send signals and the negative ones are used for fine tuning.</p>
<p>In epilepsy, this fine tuning system does not work and the positive signals keeps firing and eventually derails: the cells send all kinds of trains of signals to all their connection and your brain just crashes like a computer. In some cases this is locally, we call this focal, and people often lose one function: speech, vision, hearing, attention, wakefulness, absenses, etc. However when it hits your thalamus, which is like a relay station in the brain, the seizure can spread and become generalized. This is most often the case of the classic epilepsy, where people drop to the ground and start jerking their arms and legs and are completely out of consciousness</p></div>		</li>
