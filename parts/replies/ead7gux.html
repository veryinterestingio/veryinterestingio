			<div class="markdown"><p>If you consider the volume that would be there if there wouldn't be a black hole, and divide the mass by this volume, then large black holes have a very low density. The awkward phrasing is necessary because the interior &quot;volume&quot; of black holes is not well-defined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get the large black hole density concept. Unless your calculating density based on the event horizon. In which case your not talking about the density of the black hole. That would be like throwing a pebble in a empty swimming pool and saying the average density of the pool is very low, when the only object in the pool is very dense </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on whether or not you consider the event horizon and all of the space within it to be part of the black hole. You can make an argument either way for that. </p>
<p>Seeing as we don’t know exactly what happens at the singularity, and once you cross the horizon you’re probably destined for the singularity, I’d argue it makes sense to consider the horizon and it’s interior to be part of the black hole. </p>
<p>The difference from your pool/rock comparison is that the pool already existed on its own, where a black hole’s event horizon wouldn’t exist without the singularity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I specifically avoided the term singularity, one would think if a black hole is a singularity then you would have to consider the black hole it's self a single point. Which means a large black hole would be the same size as a small black hole, with the former being of greater density.</p>
<p>Event Horizon is not actually a physical object. Therefore should not be used in a density calculation. You could say energy density of the space contained within the event horizon is low</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;Black hole&quot; includes the event horizon. And, in fact, the event horizon is what makes it a black hole in the first place. The &quot;singularity&quot; is what you're talking about. It is possible to have a singularity without an event horizon, and it's possible to have an event horizon without a singularity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. The edge of the hole is defined by the event horizon.  But why would you then need to know the density of what is with in the event horizon.  As the event horizon is not made of anything it makes no sense to use a border made of nothing as a measurement for density </p></div>		</li>
