			<div class="markdown"><p>Umm, I'm not sure about this. I have autonomic dysreflexia, where the sympathetic system is damaged and can be set off by random triggers below the point of injury. I've also had one or two true panic attacks in my life, and seen my sister have many more and she's described them to me.</p>
<p>I can't speak to the parasympathetic, but I don't think the damaged sympathetic system reaction is similar to a panic attack. A panic attack makes your chest tight and you feel fear; or sometimes other strong mental feelings combined with physical ones.</p>
<p>But when I trigger my autonomic dysreflexia, it's more of an overwhelming &quot;tickle&quot; in my chest/heart, like a heart arrythmia. I also get really tired. But even when it feels extremely uncomfortable and (initially) shocking I'm definitely mentally in control and it's a purely physical response. Once I identify the trigger especially it's not even remotely panicking no matter how strong the sensation. I might not be able to <em>do</em> anything but clutch at my chest or try to remove the trigger, but I never feel mentally &quot;controlled&quot; by the symptom like with a panic attack.</p>
<p>Again, just anecdotal personal experience. I think we just don't know enough about the brain and receptors to say what the cause is. But I'd be wary to attribute it to systems that (at least in my experience) seem to control bodily functions more than mental ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get panic attacks like that. Nausea, tight chest, arm and leg muscles are difficult to move.  Can barely talk. Feels like impending doom/ something seriously wrong within my body. My Temperature can drop too.  It’s an autonomic type malfunction/shutdown.   No actual panicky type breathing, or adrenaline or what is typically described by most ppl as a panic attack.  </p>
<p>These can last hours and hours for me - only thing that works to stop it is a low dose benzo.  My neurologist is familiar with these and agrees that there is no amount of mindfulness or breathing techniques that can stop these.  Fortunately I don’t get them too often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heyyyy dysautonomic buddy! I am also bad at maintaining homeostasis! Mine do often involve adrenaline, but that's mostly because they are tipped off by being startled. Once that happens, whatever feedback system is supposed to make me ramp back down once there is obviously no threat is busted, and I stay like that... well, my record is two solid days, but at that point I hike to the ER if I'm out of emergency Xanax, so I don't know the actual upper limit. </p>
<p>The only thing that has ever stopped it is low-dose (as in, I have liquid because the pills do not come in a small enough size) benzos. Technically, I suppose the beta blockers worked, but they also made my blood pressure crash through the floor, which was kinda bad. Also tipped off a migraine.</p>
<p>I don't suppose you could forward me whatever info you have on this? I keep getting sent to talk to psych about it, where they just stare in confusion, because I'm 100% lucid and with it except for the part where I can't eat or sleep, and have a resting heart rate around 140. I know this stuff is co-morbid with Ehlers-Danlos, but I'm having a hard time getting anyone to listen.</p>
<p>Thanks, and I hope your nervous system is having a good day!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for describging autonomic dysreflexia - can you give us more information? Point of injury? (If you can specify it would be wonderful) Any meds you were recommended (beta blockers) - any symptoms ex lack of sweating, problems with ejaculation if male - what tend to trigger the attacks - how does your body show stress, and how do you handle stress? Sorry offtopicing but as a medical student this is mesmerising we never studied this.</p>
<p>Sidenote - as someone already said (now speaking as a pharmacist) anxiety is very complicated, its not a simple its a serotonin imbalance issue. Some drugs as mentioned have effects on other neurotransmitters, and you have to keep in mind affinity, which part is really imbalanced, what is causing the imbalance ect. Neurotransmitters are very complex, one regulates the other, and over time there is upregulation or downregulation of receptors in the brain. So, saying serotonin is the only player is wrong. </p>
<p>Also benzos are called anxiolytics - but they dont work on serotonin. So its.. complicated to say the least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have these. I'm bad at homeostasis because of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which has the weirdest fucking range of symptoms, you have no idea. Many doctors ignore the diagnosis because we are the zebras you're taught to ignore in your differentials. DM me, I will cheerfully go on about this for several hundred pages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, late here too so I could have been unclear.
I'm just not sure science is clear on the sympathetic system being directly a cause of anxiety/panic attacks. Perhaps it is, but in my anecdotal experience with having a broken one it's effects are entirely physical and not panic inducing. But of course I admit I hadn't even heard of that as a potential source for anxiety, so perhaps I'm completely missing something. And perhaps a more properly functioning one <em>does</em> affect the brain.</p>
<p>I do totally agree it seems nobody knows for sure how/if seratonin affects anxiety.</p></div>		</li>
