<p>Why dehydrate then rehydrate if you can just get it straight up naturally?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because dehydrating a food increases the relative sugar content while also making it more resistant to spoiling.</p>
<p>You might be thinking “rehydrating” means injecting water back into a prune, but it’s really more like cooking them in a pan of boiling water to make a stew that is then drained and turned into juice.</p>
<p>If they taste better and are less likely to spoil, might as well dehydrate them first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same way soaking a raisin in water doesn't turn it back into a grape. A rehydrated prune is still a more concentrate flavor than a plum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, gotcha, but still why not just take plum juice and half dehydrate it, seems that would be quicker and more efficient to make?</p></div>		</li>
