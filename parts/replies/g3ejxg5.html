All because enough of the  locals are anti-tax and anti-'socialism' (but they'll take those federal funds just fine thanks)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeeeaah...he’s full of shit.</p>
<p>It’s done for a couple of reasons...first being safety in the form of conditioning i.e. getting people used to the changes and adding a buffer at each end (or on each side of a divided highway) to move people over and get things slowed. Next is prep work. Road renovation or repair involves more than throwing down asphalt and calling it good. Each step and stage has to occur over the same piece of roadway and it makes sense to keep it isolated until it’s ready to be travelled again. Sometimes a stage will be delayed for survey, drainage work, materials, utilities etc. It doesn’t make the contract nor work required null. If there’s a delay, it’s easier to just leave things in place until the process begins moving again.</p>
<p>Besides, how else are the guys holding signs and walking around holding shovels supposed to look like all they do is stand around and do jack shit? They have to be trained, too. That’s a skill that has to be learned.</p></div>		</li>
