			<div class="markdown"><p>I (an American) was invited to a dinner party in Germany and everyone at the table was kind enough to speak English for my benefit.</p>
<p>At one point I apologized to those at the table for not being able to speak German, but explained that in the states we just don't get the opportunity to stay fluent in any foreign languages (except possibly Spanish) because there are almost no opportunities to converse in them. I suggested that perhaps there should be some language that everyone learns as a second language while retaining their native language.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, there is&quot;, replied one of the guests. &quot;It's English.&quot; Everyone at the table nodded agreement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. English native speakers may not realize this, but the main reason why so many people learn English is not to talk to English native speakers, but rather to be able to talk to people from all around the world with all sorts of different native languages.</p>
<p>In fact, a language doesn't even need native speakers to have such a status. In medieval Europe, Latin was used everywhere for all sorts of official purposes, but also for regular conversations between speakers of different native languages. That was long after the end of the Roman empire, and long after the end of Latin as a native language anywhere really, as the different Romance languages had already diverged quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Indeed. Some years ago, I worked in an office in the U.S. with people from all over India. India has so many dialects, they all had to use English to speak with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've met a lot of international friends through writing horror online of all things. Almost all of them, no matter what corner of the globe they are from and their first language, speak English fluently. Several of them spoke 3+ languages. Meanwhile, I have English and like...30 Spanish words under my belt. I can ask for the bathroom, the library, or the bathroom in the library but that's about it. </p>
<p>The situation made me feel both shockingly lazy for never branching out and incredibly lucky that I was born into speaking English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't you feel unlucky? Anyway, I use English so often to converse with other non-native speakers it's actually kind of weird to see someone speak it at home and not switching to another language. For me English is kind of &quot;external&quot;. I guess this may be hard to convey to a native speaker, imagine seeing an actor go home from theatre and speak like a character from Shakespeare to his wife and kids.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That seems unlikely. An American English speaker and an Australian English speaker can understand one another just fine, despite the two languages having had ~150 years to diverge even before modern media. <em>With</em> modern media, you'd expect (with the exception of a few regionalisms) a pretty comprehensible common language to survive for a very long time, if not indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the language. Classical Arabic from 1800 years ago can be easily understood by Arabic speakers today.
That is because the Arabic language does not variat over time as much as say english does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because Muslims everywhere study the Quran which is written in classical Arabic. Note that Arabic speakers from different countries like Morocco and Iraq cannot understand each other, they have mutually incomprehensible spoken dialects. But they all study the Quran so they can all understand that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 1920s it was theorised that American English would no longer be mutually intelligible with other English speaking countries by 2000. </p>
<p>But then along came television.</p>
<p>British English was then and is now the most common second Langauge. But if you compare that to American English for certain occupations you can see how that could have been the case.</p>
<p>For example a car mechanic, from the UK who had never seen any US media, would have no idea what they're doing working in the US. As almost every single part of a car has a different name, and almost every tool used on it also has a different name.</p>
<p>Media not only allowed the langauges to keep track of eachother, they also stopped them changing as quickly, since there was a need to remove local dialects from national programming and slowed down the speed of change in ever country.</p></div>		</li>
