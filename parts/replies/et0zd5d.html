			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool! There are quite a few seismometers near you, and you can check out the recordings of ground motion from this M7.1 earthquake in a pretty simplistic way using this <a href="https://www.iris.edu/app/station_monitor/#2019-07-06T03:19:52/NW-L44A/webicorder/NW-L44A|11058875" target="_blank">link</a>. It isn't hard to request and plot the data using <a href="https://service.iris.edu/irisws/timeseries/docs/1/builder/" target="_blank">this tool</a> either, if you want to look into a certain station further.</p></div>		</li>
