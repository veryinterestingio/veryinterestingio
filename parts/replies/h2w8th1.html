			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also 35 and grew up in Kerry. So just to address OPs question of what trauma people might have, thats largely going to depend on where the family lives and how old they are. Kerry is, like, as far from conflict as you could get and I expect you and I had very different childhoods in some regards, despite only being a couple hundred miles apart. </p>
<p>Like, in the early 90s, we were playing IRA vs FBI (which was basically just gorilla warfare with half rotten crab apples until someone got hurt for real. I assume the FBI aspect came from TV shows. X files was really popular at the time), in between games of tip the can and red rover. We were obviously aware there was conflict but it was pretty far removed from our day-to-day existence. Kids knew enough from their parents to be opinionated/parrot what they'd heard and argue about it, but marching season was a thing we watched on the news, not a thing we lived. </p>
<p>Since I would assume people in need of an au pair would be about our age, give or take a few years, I think the range of experiences are too varied for anyone to say &quot;this is the collective trauma experience&quot;. You'd have everyone from people with family members who were missing or imprisoned to people whose scariest life experience was seeing guns and armoured vehicles every bank holiday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t believe I had to scroll down this far to find a mention of Civil Rights. While all of the historical context in other answers sets the scene, this was the real catalyst for “The Troubles”. I can’t believe how many Irish people on both sides of the border or the political divide still don’t get this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Trying to rent a house, or get hired at a business was much harder as a catholic.</p>

<p>How did this work in practice, how would someone even know your religion in a big city?  Was it possible for someone to convert religions and gain the benefits?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, Irish here as well-- Ireland isn't an especially big place, so it was easy to figure out whether you were/are a Catholic or Protestant based on your name (and if your family was in that community it was common knowledge). My Dad started his career as an accountant in the Republic of Ireland in the 70s, and back in those days they had clients that would ask that he not be assigned to those jobs because they were Protestant companies. The divide was and is still very real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not religion as in &quot;what do you believe personally?&quot;</p>
<p>Several ways to know: appearance, first or last name, where you lived or went to school, accent/dialect, how you dress, and just knowing you / your family, or vice-versa, them not knowing you or your family.  Northern Ireland is not big and doesn't have big cities - largest is Belfast with \~200k at the time and then everything else is pretty small, &lt;100k.</p>
<p>First/last name was the most common and easiest divider.</p></div>		</li>
