			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend used to say I was like a damn radiator of a night.  I have a high metabolism, mostly caused by a low-fat, high-sugar diet since I was a kid.  That's how I turned out skinny-as-hell.</p>
<p>In work, there's a woman who in the winter will literally make up excuses to get me to come sit on her chair for 20 minutes (to fix the computer or whatever), just so she can warm her bum on the seat AFTER I've gone.  I am not exaggerating.</p></div>		</li>
