			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs a fact check. Biochem classes years ago stir in my memory, and quick googling shows adrenaline is not a pain killer, nor does the added muscular capacity for work come from an anesthetic reaction. Adrenaline works by quickening your heart and dilating your blood vessels, kicking glucose production into overdrive, and delivering as much oxygen and nutrients to the muscles as fast as possible to feed the “fight or flight” response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline definitely kills pain. If youve ever been in a fight you would know. My cousin was a police officer chasing down a suspect. The suspect shot at my cousin but missed (or so he thought) and kept running. My cousin caught him and when the suspect was being taken away my cousin noticed that his hand was bleeding. At first he thought he cut it on a fence because he didnt feel anything, but when the adrenaline died down his hand started to hurt a shitload, and when he looked again he saw there was a clean hole through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To take your point further, perhaps the drugs inhibit the feedback from the golgi tendon organ (GTO).</p>
<p>In short, OP, the GTO are proprioceptors in your tendons that are basically used to inhibit muscle contraction as a protection mechanism if the weight you're about to lift is too heavy. If you've ever tried to lift something super heavy and couldn't do it, it's likely your GTOs telling your muscles NO DONT DO THAT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cordyceps mushrooms give you an endurance boost by helping your body more effectively utilize/absorb oxygen. Try that before a run, it’s pretty crazy. Non psychoactive and I doubt it has any negative health effects when used in moderation.</p></div>		</li>
