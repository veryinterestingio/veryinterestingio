			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to quibble, but it’s not quite accurate. It implies that it’s just a bandwidth problem, but that’s not the case. A more accurate but still simple metaphor would be that pain is pushed to the side while pressure gets precedence sorta like an ambulance. You and an ambulance can both easily drive down the four lane highway at the same time, but you pull over anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's conceptually accurate without being at all accurate in detail. I'm sure that someone could come up with a better analogy but its the best I've seen. You couldn't get much more accuracy without talking about interneurons, mechanoreceptors, hyperpolarization and a bunch of other stuff that isn't nearly as easy to understand.</p></div>		</li>
