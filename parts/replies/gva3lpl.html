<p>I wonder if there were people that knew this for longer, and just didn't realise the glitch they'd found.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This happens all the time. Even speedrunners themselves sometimes find exploits/glitches/bugs that are deemed &quot;not useful&quot; and forgotten, just to resurface years later when someone finds the video buried in a speedrun.com forum thread and understands that it applies perfectly to the new strats that have developed during the years.</p>
<p>In GTA San Andreas, for example, while equipping certain weapons you can hit a weird combination of crouch and aim keys to make CJ &quot;slide&quot;: walk in a weird shuffling way which is faster than walking but slower than running. It was discovered as a &quot;useless glitch&quot; as running is faster. Only a few years later someone said &quot;Wait a second, there are places in this game where running is not allowed, I wonder if... OH.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a guy doing speedruns for <em>Goldeneye</em> who asked on a forum for some tips. He was told to &quot;put his nose to the grindstone&quot; - meaning practice the skills he already had, and speed would come. He took this literally, and pointed his camera at the ground to do all his runs. It turned out that when doing this, the game didn't load assets that weren't being looked at, and thus his runs were fractions of a second faster than everybody else.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the people doing those weird shits aren't just some randos who thought &quot;hmmm what if I do this&quot;, they are most of the times, dedicated glitch finder who uses multiple tools, including frame advancing, computer-fed joystick angles, a memory viewer to observe the changes in ram with every action, mods or other assemblies to display debug data like speed, position, wall hitbox etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other times there are those who deliberately try to find these exploits by just doing the most weird shit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also the face that programming is hard and game developers often fall in the same pitfalls, so people tend to try to reproduce one game's bugs into another. See all the games where you can use an item to squeeze yourself through a wall, where the top of the map isn't solid and allows you to get out of bounds, where pause doesn't actually stop the game and allows some effects to keep applying, where a specific way of obtaining an item or getting rid of an item will not check if/how much you have of the item, where forward speed is capped but not sideways or backwards speed etc, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day Driver on the PS1 had boundaries at the edge of the map, obviously, so you couldn't drive outside of the allowed area. Well, apart from this one gap in the wall on the San Francisco level (I believe near Fisherman's Wharf, but it's ages since I played it) that you could fit the car through :)</p></div>		</li>
