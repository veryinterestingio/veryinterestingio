			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of long range heatseeking missiles that are designed for use against ballistic missiles, but otherwise heatseekers tend to be short range missiles (where a sustaining rocket would just add weight and reduce maneuverability).</p>
<p>P.S: And &quot;the first few seconds of flight&quot; is still typically 25-50% of the missiles total flight time to target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just going to leave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA5eartth80" target="_blank">this</a> here as an example of egregious missile burn times.</p>
<p>The bloody space shuttle didn't burn it's engines for that long to get into LEO!</p>
<p>Also, I don't know of any missile that repeatedly locks and seeks like that after overshoots and misses.  Movie missile are magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You were not kidding. </p>
<p>I think I died, reincarnated as a dog, and came back as a human again and the missile was still going. My god. </p>
<p>Not only that, but what's the first reaction when the pilots see a SAM launch (with the convenient indicator light)? Pull up of course. Less energy will totally help defeating the missile. Ground cover is meaningless, the missile can apparently phase through terrain. And it's a heat seeker so let's increase our engine exhaust for good measure. </p>
<p>Flares are not going to be used immediately, only after we have attempted to defeat the missile by slowly maneuvering around. If you can't do that you don't deserve flares. </p>
<p>And also keep the drop tanks for as long as we can, as they contain some new flammable fuel that can easily ignite in a mushroom cloud when hitting the ground. </p>
<p>The missile is an experimental cat missile. It's actually toying with the plane - see how they suffer a midair collision and the missile is intact (and did not trigger the proximity fuse)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is soo much wrong with that scene.</p>
<p>They are painted meaning it's a radar seeking missile but they drop flares to confuse it instead of chaff.  They also repeatedly pull up which would put them against a clear sky which would make tracking them easier.  They also clip the missile.  Missiles generally have proximity detectors in them and they will explode before they impact their target.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>They also drop their external fuel tanks quite late in the game.  Pretty sure if a missile is fired at you the first thing you do is drop them because they slow you down and make you fly like a pregnant yak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the &quot;PS!&quot; I was instantly able to wrap my head around that! I think movies mess with our perceptions because they need footage. They make a four-second missile flight look like it's 12 seconds. The longer fight also gives our &quot;hero&quot; time to dive out of the way.</p>
<p>EDIT: I just saw the clip posted above; my numbers were way off!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No pure heat seekers for ABM.  At least no US.  They are all radar guided with a IR sensor for enhanced terminal guidance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the final stage of the RIM-161 was capable of IR only acquisition?</p>
<p>Because I know it can be launched in Inertial guidance mode, but I thought it was capable of SARH/IR or IR only terminal approach.</p></div>		</li>
