			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some types of debt that you can't go bankrupt to get out of. They are called nondischargable debts. Student loan debt is one example. And legal judgements can fall into this category, depending on what one is sued for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming it can't be discharged in bankruptcy, the person is on the hook for the rest until the debt is paid off.  If they earn/receive more money in the future, the judgment holder takes some of that until the debt is paid off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what creditors rights look like in your jurisdiction. In mine, they garnish your employer and take a cut of your earnings going forward. They can also register a judgment debt against any assets you own (i.e house) so that when you sell the asset and pay off the mortgage balance, any proceeds of the sale get paid to the judgment creditor instead of the debtor. </p>
<p>Bankruptcy discharges certain types of debts, in which case the creditor gets a share of the bankrupt’s estate and then is SOL on the balance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, nondischargable debts are limited to debts owed to the government (or government run institutions) as well as any debt that's backed by the government. This is why student loans are nondischargable. They're government backed through different grants and other tax payer funded programs.</p>
<p>This isn't always the case, but is a decent rule of thumb to follow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, I have had a 5-digit student loan debt forgiven through a &quot;total and permanent disability&quot; clause:  although I'd already suffered from several pre-existing health problems, 18 years ago I fell in the shower and was injured badly enough to be admitted to a nursing home long-term.  Not being physically able to bathe, dress, or even get out of bed without two people's help is fairly solid proof that I'm not hireable... *shrug*</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bunch of other things as well - i.e. Child support.  Them there are other debts that can be objected to and the court can make nondischargeable - usually intentional injuries like assaults or frauds.  It can get very complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true because private student loans are subject to the same rules. The reason it's so hard to discharge them is because the student loan industry lobbied the government for protections over fears law students would strategically declare bankruptcy after graduation to get out of their debts, despite no evidence this was occurring.</p></div>		</li>
