The Fermi paradox was first mentioned in the 1930s  by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and later rephrased by Fermi in the 1950s. It  is basically tainted by the way the world and our civilization were seen at this time. In short, the idea is that if  technological civilisations exist, they should have been visible because they probably have &quot;colonized the entire galaxy and their civilization should be visible to us&quot;. There are a lot of reasons to say that this is not true and the Wikipedia article on this topic lists two dozens of them.<br />
One of them, that I personally favored is that biological technological civilizations like our are not here to last. I personally think that we are at the crossroad where decision on our civilization will need to be taken:<br />
- adapt ourselves fully to our planet modifying our genetic self so we can live on this planet without technology (like whales and dolphins on today planets but maybe smarter?) </p>
<p>- integrate ourselves into those machines that we are building, making us ultimately non-biological so fully capable of exploring our galaxy (e.g. tiny cubes of silicon with the consciousness of humanity  floating around harvesting the energy of stars)</p>
<p>- disappear as a civilization because we have been unable to take over our evolution path and our civilization is not stable on a long  term </p>
<p>In those cases, we will not be detectable anymore and that's possibly what happened to most biological civilizations, hence the silence...  Those advanced civilizations are probably here but they don't really need to be loud anymore.</p></div>		</li>
