			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate statement. It has little to do with layers of the skin - scarring can form almost anywhere in the body.</p>
<p>Last time this question was asked, someone compared it to throwing flex seal on a leak. It looks ugly as hell, but it works and it's fast. In a similar way, instead of filling the wound with the standard, carefully constructed mesh of proteins that makes up most of your skin, your body kinda just throws everything at it to plug the hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not super familiar with what factors cause more or less scarring, but here's my two cents.</p>
<p>Pulling the skin together reduces the distance between two sides of a wound. This reduces the amount of tissue that needs to be replaced, and thus reduces the amount that <em>is</em> replaced by scar tissue.</p>
<p>There are other ways to minimize scarring, mostly focusing around minimizing damage and encouraging proper healing. For example, there's a handful of plastic surgeons who use <del>obsidion</del> <em>obsidian</em> scalpel blades. The obsidion makes much cleaner cuts, allowing for closer stitching and easier healing.</p>
