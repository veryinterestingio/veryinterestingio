			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! That's actually how they figure out what parts of your brain do what things, including this. They took a bunch of people with brain damage or neurodegeneritive diseases, measured which ones could not feel embarrassed by putting them in embarrassing situations, and then found which brain area those people had damage to that the others didn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, in very much the same way that any issues with that part of the brain can affect typical emotional response. If you had an un(der)-developed amygdala (part of the limbic system that regulates fear and hormones, among other things), you would not feel fear like most people do. I think I've even seen/read about an individual with a nearly non-existent amygdala who actually never felt &quot;fear&quot;; they could still make rational decisions but would never have that emotion come up as part of the process (which might sound nice, but fear can be a very useful emotion)</p>
<p>On the other hand, having an over-stimulated/developed amygdala can cause one to feel unnecessary amounts of fear</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Embarrassment is essentially saying 'hey, in your past this situation has been detrimental to our or other people's social standing or relationships.'</em></p>
<p>It's even more complex than that because it is inherently comes as one of defense mechanism too, but there are times when embarrassment is not that negative either, like blushing or embarrassed when being complemented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the body is interpreting it as negative anyway. A compliment you don't feel you deserve or one that is drawing attention to you that you don't want. Associations like that in the past, even if you don't consciously associate them, can lead to embarrassment even in otherwise positive events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read it's useful as an &quot;unfakeable social signal&quot; people can see you turning red and know that it's not something you can turn on and off consciously so it confirms you're really feeling it - &quot;it&quot; is contextual, you get pretty red when you're mad, for example.</p></div>		</li>
