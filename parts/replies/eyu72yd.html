			<div class="markdown"><p>That, and people just <em>died</em> a lot. People died from cuts and scrapes, and from a burst blister. People died by the droves, especially children and the elderly. Things like surgery were massively risky, as was childbirth. For millennia it was considered a death sentence for a surgeon to cut into the abdomen, because the risk of infection was so high.</p>
<p>There's a reason antibiotic resistance is so incredibly terrifying to rational people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How commonly do you need antibiotics after getting a paper cut?</p>
<p>It can happen, and yes, they could die from it, but it's not common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about paper cuts in particular, and they do tend to be pretty shallow, but broadly speaking... yes. You step on a tack or a nail today and it's no big deal. Back then? Tetanus, bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) and sepsis were all real possibilities. Women routinely died from something called puerperal fever, which was basically just what we'd call sepsis as a result of people not washing their hands while helping deliver a child. Calvin Coolidge's young son died from an infection resulting from a burst blister. </p>
<p>This was <em>common</em> and one reason people had tons of kids; a lot of them died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a reason for silk shirts in Mongol armour - arrows are wrapped in the silk, still penetrate, but can then be pulled back out without leaving bits of foreign materials in the wound.</p>
<p>Edit: though less terrifying than the Celts going naked - it is bloody cold most of the year</p></div>		</li>
