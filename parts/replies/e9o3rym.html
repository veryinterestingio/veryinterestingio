			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming from a signal processing background, I know it's been established that a certain type of uncertainty relations are independent of any physical laws. You can compute a discrete Fourier transform over a sequence of numbers (without assigning a meaning to the index of the sequence) and you still end up with &quot;sample index to period&quot; uncertainty. Is what you describe about time evolution a consequence of physical laws in quantum mechanics or is it something that drops out of the mathematics?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To clarify, the reason supporting the math is <em>not</em> inherently physical. Uncertainty arises in a &quot;pure math&quot; scenario as well.</p>
<p>This poster is saying that the reason we apply this particular mathematical technique, Fourier analysis, is a physical one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I described discrete-time sampling without mentioning quantization, but I picked that to make a point about how you can have the uncertainty without reference to space or time. You can have uncertainty in the periodicity of a sequence, without reference to Nyquist-Shannon if you define the sequence as a list of numbers, not the result of a sampling process. (Nyquist-Shannon applies when a discrete time process is related to an analog process.)</p>
<p>You can have a discrete-time continuous-valued signal. An example is an analog sample and hold circuit driven by a digital clock. Even when you remove quantization there is still time-frequency uncertainty.</p>
<p>You can also have continuous-time continuous-valued signals (ignoring the quantum scale). These still have time-frequency uncertainty too. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that it is something that drops out of the mathematics.</p>
<p>In signal processing, you have the uncertainty relation relating the width of the time and frequency representation of a signal. If you have a signal in space instead of time, you have the uncertainty relation for position and wavevector.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics postulates that particles can be described as waves, and that the energy and momentum of the particle is equal to Planck's constant times frequency and wavevector of the wave.</p>
<p>So the position-momentum uncertainty relation is just the position-wavevector uncertainty relation, and the time-energy uncertainty relation is just the time-frequency uncertainty relation.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, there are uncertainty relations for all pairs of conjugate variables, not just time+energy and position+momentum, but also for example angle+angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time can be an operator in QM. Fully constrained quantum systems work like that.</p>
<p>H psi = 0</p>
<p>H = p_t - H_0</p>
<p>gives you a fully constrained quantum system with an operator t and its conjugate operator p_t that satisfy the usual uncertainty relation.</p>
<p>On the physical states you have p_t = H_0, so you have an uncertainty relation between t and H_0 in a weak sense.</p>
<p>In fact we often want to compute time statistics in QM. For example time of arrival or time of decay. Often this is just fudged but really the time at which a particle hits a screen should be a good physical observable representable in QM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Time remains a parameter, and spatial coordinates are demoted from operators to parameters, in order to treat them all the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add (I'm sure you know I just think it might be interesting for those who don't yet). Relativity allows particle number to increase due to the famous E=mc^2 part of the relativistic energy relation when using a p=0 reference frame.  The new operators of significance are the ones that create and destroy particles similar to the harmonic oscillator (fields act like 3D oscillators or as Zee calls them mattresses). These operators can be applied at any point of time or space so that's where the aforementioned parameter comes in; also that's why we call them fields in analogy with plants that can be created or destroyed in a farmers field except with more quantumness. Time and space are combined in the usual four vector notation of relativity where the 0th component is time and the other three are the spatial params. And of course we can FT these operators to get a momentum space version (so then the momentum four vector with energy as the 0th component is the param. This is usually how we start doing Feynman Diagrams (they're usually done in momentum space).  String theory starts by considering a 1+1 dimensional (1 space and 1 time) field theory of D particles in the line that correspond to vibrations in exactly the way they do in QFT. It just so happens there's another interpretation where the door fields (which turn out to be identical) are the dimensions of spacetime that we would say the string is in. Hence the joke that string theory is actually 2D.   </p>
<p>Everyone should read Zee and also maybe Griffiths Elementary Particles (Griffiths while in undergrad or during the summer before grad) if they want some decent intuition.  I have all there of Zees books and there have been many times where I was surprised how simple a concept was that baffled me before or sometimes I was humbled (in a good way) when he explains an aspect I hadn't considered that makes things &quot;intuitive&quot;. Intuitive on the sense that you'll be able to calculate Feynman Diagrams but also be able to think about other systems in other ways without needing diagrams before you do your calculations. The Group Theory book was great. I actually have a Math Masters (decided to go back to my first love, theoretical physics recently).  Lots of Lie Group and Algebra stuff was explained so well compared to every other book I tried. Representations are just homomorphisms to matrices, Characters have to do with equivalence classes within a group stuff like that really helped fill in some stuff I glossed over when I tried self studying QFT during my Masters.  I don't know how this became a book review haha but Ill leave this in in case someone is looking for a book that clicks with them. Can never have too many references and most school libraries have them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and this suggests that location-momentum uncertainty shouldn't be considered all THAT different from time-energy uncertainty since in relativistic QM they're both parameter-operator uncertainties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could definitely consider time as an operator as well, more even so in relativistic quantum mechanics, i.e., QFT, although it is not usually done. For instance, in the formalism of first quantization in string theory, both spatial and time coordinates are operators.</p></div>		</li>
