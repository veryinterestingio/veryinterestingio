I will after posting, but I want to see commentary as it frequently shows me new questions to search for that I would never have thought of otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. The direction of evolution depends on the sign of the difference between the spin and orbital period. Tidal evolution can act to spin up the primary in which case the secondary (orbiting body) will inspiral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually do not know this. We have only measured the length of day (LoD) back 2Gyr at which point it was ~20hr. We can not extrapolate from current LoD variation as this is not a constant value.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its complicated, but no, it doesn't mean the earth used to spin faster. The earth did spin faster before, and is slowing down, but you could have a faster rotating core without slowing the overall spin rate.</p>
<p>The angular momentum of a system is conserved, so without external factors, the average spin speed will stay the same, but only if you adjust for how close to the center of rotation the mass is. Mass close to the center of rotation contributes less at a given angular velocity, so if mass moves in to the center, it must either speed up, push other mass outwards, or speed up other mass to maintain constant momentum.</p>
<p>If something is sinking, it is more dense, so whatever it pushes up will contribute less angular momentum at the dense object's previous height, so something has to go faster. My intuition says it should be the sinking matter that speeds up, because that is what happens if there is nothing to push out of the way (like the classic ice skater example). With the earth, the example would be more an ice skater with a hula hoop, they speed up, and then over time drag the hoop up to speed to match.</p>
<p>Of course, earth has a moon, and the moon is slowly stealing angular momentum, shifting further away, and will continue to do so until earth is fully tidally locked, from core to crust.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So relative to the earth's surface, the core only rotates 1 degree in an one million years? Is it possible this is just measurement error?</p></div>		</li>
