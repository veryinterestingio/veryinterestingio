<p>The Soviet Union was beating us in space exploration. Americans reasonably feared the militarization of space and the danger of going unprotected from the hostile use of space. Going to the moon would be the next big achievement which would test the best of our abilities and put us in a position of preeminence in space. This was decided, in part, for security and also scientific and economic advancement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Politicians aren't really deciding on the mission agenda normally.  They can make a call when they want, but their only involvement normally is voting on the budget.  NASA itself decides what it's budget will be used for (unless Congress intervenes).  Many NASA employees write up potential mission plans, and the advisory council decides which will get funded.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And it does often. Turns out many Congress members are more interested in funding for their district than an actual goal of NASA. The project turns out to be overly complicated and cost much more than necessary? Great, more money spent, let's do it, or make it even more complicated!</p></div>		</li>
