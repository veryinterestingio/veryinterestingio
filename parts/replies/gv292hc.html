<p>I grew up in a small older town. An old lady died, and the town discovered that she had forty cats. The cats were removed by animal control, and her family attempted to get the place ready to sell. She owned an end unit, brick row home. Somebody cleaned the place, removed all the floor coverings and had the piss soaked subfloors professionally mitigated. It didn't take long to realize that there was no saving the place, and NOTHING was ever going to make the place not smell like cat piss. It was demolished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a property management company and you are definitely right. We forecasted a 5 year lifespan and if someone destroyed it beyond what was cleanable they were charged a prorated amount. Same sort of approach for the vinyl plank, but the key difference was time. When turning an apartment over between renters, time is literally money. Carpet is a much faster install and requires less cleanup. A good carpet cleaner can work miracles and avoid replacement all together more often than you might think. There isn't a ton you can do for scratched, chipped, or warped vinyl planks beyond replacement.</p></div>		</li>
