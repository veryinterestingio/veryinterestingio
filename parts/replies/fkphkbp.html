			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of valid posts here but this one is what it boils down to ultimately. Even if you could get everyone to agree to such a &quot;pause&quot; and work out how that would play out fiscally, essential services still have to keep going (especially for those infected) and everything else is fundamentally intertwined with those essential services.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't really answer the question though? If we all agree to do those jobs and we all benefit from them, it would all work out? Like why involve the factor of money? Every person does a job, everyone gets what they need?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money is how all these things are tracked, essentially. Can we remove the tracking mechanism? Technically, maybe, but the main reason the tracking mechanism exists in the first place is so people know what to do. You could try to replace that with some other system that tells people what to do but basically none are as good as money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other systems are central planning, which throws away the enormous amount of information every person brings in every transaction they make (and <em>don't</em> make). Most people grasp this in the realm of gift-giving: other people don't make very good choices for yourself. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Tdz9GAX.jpg" target="_blank">Milton Friedman's four ways to spend money</a>.

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does &quot;everyone gets what they need&quot; actually mean? Especially once you have the bare essentials covered, and we start talking about non-essentials, it becomes tricky. If I want, say, a really nice guitar, or a fancy photo camera, or the newest graphics card, or whatever — who gets to say which of these things I can have?</p>
<p>There's simply not enough of these things to go around, so you need some mechanism to decide which people get which of these things — turns out that money is really good at solving this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well who deems how much food I can have?    </p>
<p>I work in IT, I fix people's computers, unless I'm fixing a grocery stores computer I can't trade my service for food.  </p>
<p>So how can we determine what my work is worth or how much I need?  </p>
<p>Do we all get given the same?  </p>
<p>This is why money is so necessary, it's a universal IOU system. If a bar of chocolate is worth 4 IOUs and I earn 24 IOUs every hour for my work, then 1 hr of my time is worth 6 chocolate bars.</p></div>		</li>
