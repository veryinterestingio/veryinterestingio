			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fram museum is a stone throw from the Vikingship museet and the Kon Tiki museum. They are each pretty small so I recommend taking in all three as well as the folk museum.</p>
<p>Although I am a lifelong Viking history fanatic, and the ships at the Vikingship museum are iconic, I actually find the Fram to be the most fascinating museum experience of the three.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah did that too ðŸ˜€ the ship's hull was made out of wood and had very round shape, which caused it to get pushed out of the water by the closing Ice instead of being crushed.</p>
<p>The First engine also was only Steam powered. I recall it being about 80 something horsepower or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's freaking cold, not to mention remote and with a difficult terrain.</p>
<p>You need heavy clothes, including equipment that let you survive a blizzard. You also need food that is easy to eat and to carry yet won't rot for extended periods of time (months). Making it to the poles is no small feat.</p>
<p>And of course, a question at that time would probably have been: &quot;why even go there?&quot;  It's not like there are exciting lands to colonise or resources that you could exploit back then. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You also need to make sure that food is packaged in a way that won't poison you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The story of how Scott's expedition to the Antarctic was affected by scurvy is fascinating. I read this page a few months ago:</p>
<p><a href="https://idlewords.com/2010/03/scott_and_scurvy.htm" target="_blank">https://idlewords.com/2010/03/scott_and_scurvy.htm</a></p>
<p>The famous story goes that the vitamin C deficiency that causes scurvy was eradicated from the Navy centuries ago, thanks to introducing citrus fruit to sailors' rations. However the men on the Scott expeditions to Antarctica (including Shackleton) suffered from bouts of scurvy. As that blog post explains, this was because in the 200 years between the Navy beginning to supply sailors with fruit, and vitamin C being discovered in the 1930s, a lot of medical misconceptions about the link between diet and the disease became received wisdom.</p>
<p>One of the things that page explains is how the success of the bacterial theory of disease in so many areas of medicine made scientists believe that it must also be the cause of scurvy. That meant that Scott paid a lot of attention to ensuring that his canned meat was unspoiled. And although the symptoms of scurvy started to recede when his men started eating fresh seal meat, he boiled that meat it to make it weigh less as an expedition provision, inadvertently destroying its vitamin C in the process.</p>
<p>As the end of that page discusses, the misconceptions around at the time didn't just affect the Antarctic explorers, but it also led to deficiencies in early 20th century Britain: for example, pasteurisation makes milk much safer to drink, but destroys its vitamin C. For poor children who went from being breast-fed onto adult foods this wasn't an issue, but wealthy children who stayed on diets of cereals and pasteurised milk suffered from vitamin C deficiencies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or better yet, food that is able to carry itself. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_Amundsen_and_Scott_Expeditions" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> on why Amundsen was so much more successful than Scott at reaching the South Pole, there's this choice quote about using dog teams: &quot;In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves.&quot;&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which kind of makes H. P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness (1936) such a cool book. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the 1920s, Antarctica was &quot;one of the last unexplored regions of the Earth, where large stretches of territory had never seen the tread of human feet. Contemporary maps of the continent show a number of provocative blanks, and Lovecraft could exercise his imagination in filling them in...with little fear of immediate contradiction.&quot;</p>
