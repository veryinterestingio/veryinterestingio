The rainbow is always a circle around the point in the sky opposite the sun: for example, if the sun were directly overhead, the rainbow would be circling your feet. If the sun is very high in the sky, unless you can spray your hose off a high platform and look down, it's going to be tough to spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dno, do you have 5 year old kids? they're pretty limited in knowledge. Being able to visibly see the droplets help explain that each drop has a certain colour in a way they'd understand - then you can layer on the explanation of why by introducing angles and bending/bouncing, maybe even spring for the fancy word ;) </p>
<p>The statement above was simply that actual ELI5 are the bestmost answers, not necessarily that the other answers here are all &quot;ELIhavePHd.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
