			<div class="markdown"><p>usually germs and dirt stick to your hand and can't be washed off. germs and dirt stick to soap harder. soap can be washed away, and when it's washed away the germs and dirt go with the soap instead of sticking to you. and in the process of sticking to the soap some germs/viruses will just die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. I don't think people need a lesson on how surfactants work every time they ask how washing your hands gets rid of germs – I can't help feeling this is part of the reason why the fallacy that &quot;soap kills germs&quot; persists.</p>
<p>Soap and water works on germs the same way that it works on dirt: it washes them off your hands. It doesn't need to be any more complicated than that.</p>
<p>EDIT: Hi folks – I realize that yes, soap can kill SOME viruses by stripping away the lipid layer. But that's not the primary method of action, it's not all viruses, and it doesn't necessarily account for bacteria, yeasts, and fungi, which you also don't want on your hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only correct in specific cases.  Not the majority of the time.  It is definitely not the main reason to use soap.</p>
<p>Soap sticks well to germs, oil, and grease.  Soap also sticks well to water.  First, you use scrub and lather so that the soap is stuck to the things you don't want.  Then you rinse well so that the soap (along with the things it's stuck to) go down the drain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/bxUg2tF.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a good visualization.</a></p>
<p>Basically, soap molecules are like balloons with harpoons on them. The harpoon sticks into the dirt (bacteria/fat/oil) and the balloon lifts it away so that water can wash it away easier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I see your point, but... glass isn't particularly soluble in either.  Ethanol is quite soluble in both.</p></div>		</li>
