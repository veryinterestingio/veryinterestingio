			<div class="markdown"><p>Blank VHS cassettes always had the tab intact. Breaking the tab would render a recordable cassette into a non-recordable. If you bought a VHS of, say, Caddyshack, the place where the tab is should have nothing. To make a non-recordable into a recordable, youâ€™d just use something like scotch tape to cover the hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right, sorry, it's been a while since I interacted with a VHS.  But I remember my father fixing tapes for the mom'n'pop video store at the top of our street and we'd get free rentals all the time, and free movies from the guy who owned the place.  I remembered some interaction with the tabs, but forgot which state was &quot;protected&quot; and which wasn't</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not &quot;copy protection&quot; though, that's the recording tab to prevent accidentally recording over the tape. There is copy protection schemes that do some clever things like recording to places that can't be recorded to by a home VCR so you can't directly record the tape to another tape with dual tape decks (or whatever). It is very similar to cassette tapes.  </p>
<p>The read heads on a VCR also read tape in a helix shape and spin (ie diagonally) which provides a continuous stream of data read at a higher rate than the tape is moving linearly. It's actually really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone here who's making sense.  People are confusing the tab, which prevents the tape from being overwritten, to techniques used so you can't rent a movie, then make a copy of it at home.</p>
<p>I remember that if you tried to do that with many movies, the recorded movie would look normal, then slowly turn really red, then back to normal. Do you know how they managed to achieve that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as I understand it, this is what happens... old school CRT TVs (and modern TVs that can handle the signals) basically draw a picture one &quot;dot&quot; at a time starting at the top left of the screen, then zipping from left to right and then down the screen in a super fast Z movement ... so fast you can't tell. But then the &quot;scan line&quot; takes a second to reset to the top left. It doesn't actually take physical effort, but it's a way to synchronize when the next &quot;frame&quot; of video starts. So a copy protected video tape inserts into this tiny fraction of time a really high gain signal (or something similar to that) basically just a screaming banshee signal.
When you play the tape to your TV, the TV is &quot;resetting the scan line&quot; during the &quot;sceaming banshee signal&quot; and basically ignores it. BUT if you are playing on a VCR into the input of another VCR, the VCR doesn't ignore this signal as it is not a TV that has a slight pause for the scan line, it in fact hears the scream and can't handle it so it messes up the copy.</p>
<p>ELI5: Imagine you are watching a play on stage. Every time you blink your eyes, a thousand flash bulbs go off from the stage. You never notice this because you are blinking at the time they go off. But if someone is recording the play, the camera records the flash which makes the camera electronics blank down for a second. So you've enjoyed the play and never noticed anything wrong, but the video recording is all messed up because there are all these blanks and flashes all over it. So your TV can play a copy protected tape because it is &quot;blinking&quot; when the copy protection signal plays, but your VCR is not blinking and the signal is strong enough to trigger it to record snow or something. but unlike blinking, this happens I THINK 60 times per second.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There were a few.</p>
<p>The one you described messed with automatic gain control (AGC).  Macrovision even managed to get their specific company's product mandated by law to be included on recordings; it wasn't just the recording technology, it was the branded Macrovision product itself required by law.</p>
<p>You might be more familiar with AGC in microphones and headsets. When you're in a noisy environment or quiet environment, AGC adjusts volume automatically.  This way if you're whispering in a quiet room the microphone still records; if you're in a noisy environment and need to speak loudly the background noise won't be picked up and your loud voice will be reduced to normal.</p>
<p>The recordings relied on similar technology in VCRs to compensate for <strong>(huge ELI5 simplification warning!)</strong> what is basically loudly-recorded video signals or quietly-recorded video signals. During the brief blank time between screen pictures they would include additional video data that was either extremely bright or extremely dim. </p>
<p>Again, tremendously simplified, just like your microphone automatically adjusts for noisy rooms and quiet rooms, the recording would automatically adjust between bright video and dim video.  However, the copies didn't have that same hidden information. For a microphone this means the quiet room microphone would again sound whisper quiet, and the noisy room microphone would be a cacophony of sound. For video, it was a slow cycle spanning multiple seconds moving from very bright displays, often of a specific color like blue, to very dim displays of near black.</p>
<p>The end result was that the original would (usually) display okay but copies would slowly cycle between bright blue then down to black, up to bright color then down to black...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what copy protection is. Copy protection prevents reproduction of data, not recording of data. The tab on VHS tapes allows or prevents recording, not copying. It's <em>write</em> protection.</p>
<p>Copy protection for VHS does exist, it's called Macrovision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't prevent copying the tape.  You can read the tape all you want and duplicate it until the cows come home.  It does prevent <em>writing</em> to the tape and overwriting the existing video/audio, which is different.</p>
<p>Copy protection prevents copying or duplicating the source material.  Write protection prevents overwriting it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That, again isn't copy protection. It's loss prevention.</p>
<p>If you remove the tab, you can still copy the video by hooking the VCR up to another device (Usually another VCR with a SCART lead) and recording from the second machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_head#Rotating_heads" target="_blank">The recording head worked differently than an audio tape also.  On audio tape the head just linearly wrote to the tape as it passed across it.  On a video recorder the head is spinning and it writes in parallel diagonal stripes across the tape.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tapes with copy protection actually just use a little tab that interacts with a switch </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same with audio cassettes for you youngsters.  Floppy disks had a similar device.  If a notch was on one edge you could read/write to it.  But floppy disks could be written to on both sides, the manufacturers only guaranteed one side though.  So cheapskate kids like myself would double our floppy disk space by taking an ordinary hole punch and punching out a notch on the other edge and now we could read/write to the other side of the disk.  I never had a problem with this.</p></div>		</li>
