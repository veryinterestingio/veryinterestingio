<p>EDIT: Not just zoonotic schistosoma!  And for a parasite that makes a horrific transdermal ESCAPE, check out dracunculiasis!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to look particular drugs up I recommend <a href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc" target="_blank">https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc</a> itâ€™s a uk website listing the SPCs (summary of product characteristics) of most drugs available. Gives loads of information as to  how the drugs work, trials data, side effects etc. Worth a look if youâ€™re trying to gen up on pharmacy ðŸ˜ƒ</p></div>		</li>
