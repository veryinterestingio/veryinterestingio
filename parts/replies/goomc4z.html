			<div class="markdown"><p>Does your complexion determine the colour of your scar ? I have two scars that are 11 years old from the same incident - on my arm and knee. They are both purple to this day, most people mistake them for tattoos at first sight. I am also very very pale (red hair) .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. The type of scar is determined mostly by the kind of wound and genetics. That said, the genetics of scars and skin colour seem to be related, so certain skin tones are more likely to develop certain scars. What you've got sounds like a hypertrophic or keloid scar, which interestingly enough is more common in darker skinned people. The different colour is because with the disruption to the normal pattern of skin, your blood shows through your skin differently. Usually a purple colour doesn't last that long, but I'd guess your particular scars have more blood flowing through them than most, and not much pigment. That's not a bad thing - it's just one of the ways that the tissue in a scar can be different from the usual balance of stuff in skin.</p>
<p>The reason it's purple is because the blood vessels closer to your skin surface are veins, which carry used blood back to the heart. That blood has less oxygen in it, which makes it take on a darker, more purpley colour. This is usually balanced out by the pigment in our skjn (melanin) to give us what we see as our skin tone. Freshly oxygenated blood from the arteries is bright red, but is, by and large, deeper in the body, so it doesn't affect the way our skin looks so much.</p></div>		</li>
