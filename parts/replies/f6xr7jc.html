			<div class="markdown"><p>People say there's no solid surface, but I have no idea how people would know? The core is almost certainly metallic, and it's under extreme temperature and pressure.  Surrounding the core is a layer of liquid, metallic, hydrogen.  Which is a material entirely exotic.  Below that is probably metallic constituents of rocky bodies that the planet has absorbed over billions of years, under unfathomable pressures.  Pressure such that even hydrogen is squeezed into a state of being as close to a solid as it can get.  I'm not even sure that science has a level of material understanding today to say, withcertainty, if there is a &quot;solid&quot; surface, or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cuz that's not how chemistry works. Even right now the air you breathe isn't just one gas... its several, of different densities, all surrounding you.</p></div>		</li>
