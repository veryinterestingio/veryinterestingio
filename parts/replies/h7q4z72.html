			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, and there's more too - those big power plants, even if they're powered by coal or gas, are a lot more efficient than a car engine!</p>
<p>Your car is only 25% efficient when it burns fuel. Only 25% of the energy goes to powering your car, the rest is lost in heat. Power plants have typical efficiencies from 35% to 60%, in comparison.</p>
<p>So basically: the same amount of fuel can power more electric cars to go farther.</p>
<p>When some of the electricity is coming from renewable sources, it's even better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last time I checked it was more around 80% - 5% for power delivery network loses,  5% charging loss, 5% discharging loss, and finally 5% engine efficiency. Your point still stands though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the efficiency increases power plants have over cars, every single electric car on the market, past and present, powered by a power plant gains efficiency when the power plant efficiency improves.  </p>
<p>In the case of internal combustion engines, only the cars manufactured after efficiency improvements of the engines get any kind of improvement. The ones that are already manufactured? They gain nothing unless it's some efficiency increase prior to fueling the car itself (which coincidentally would likely also improve efficiency for electric cars).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This. And also:</p>
<p>Today let's say the power to your home is 90% co2 and 10% green sourced. One year from now, the mix is 85%/15% and five years from now it is 70%/30%. If you owned a gas car, your car would be using the same or more (after wear and tear) fuel and therefore emitting the same or more co2. But by owning an EV, which is already much more efficient per pound of emitted co2 gas today, you are using even less co2 by being connected to the more efficient greener grid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And in the meantime, one electric vehicle charging to 100% does <em>not</em> cause a coal plant ten miles down the road to suddenly put out more emissions than it would have otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is untrue. Coal power plant capacity is constantly adjusted to meet demand.</p>
<p>The important part you missed is that the efficiency of the system from nat gas/coal power generation to electric car is about 3-5x more emission-efficient than the path from oil to gasoline to car.</p>
<p>Electric motors are simply better at converting energy to motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

<p>Some nuance here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coal is mostly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load" target="_blank"><strong>Base Load</strong></a> mode of power generation: While coal plants are responsive and can be adjusted, such adjustments are slow (on the span of hours) and so the idea that demand is &quot;constantly adjusted&quot; is misleading.</li>
<li>This contrasts from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_following_power_plant" target="_blank"><strong>Load Following</strong></a> modes and types — a good example of Natural Gas, which can be much more quickly ramped up and down than coal.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant" target="_blank"><strong>Peaking</strong></a> plants are the opposite end of the spectrum from Base Load plants. These plants actually are constantly adjusted, and often stopped/started to meet demand. Hydroelectric dams can act as Base Load and Load Following types, but they're also really great acting as Peaking plants, for instance, because they can be so quickly throttled up and down.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Control Room Operator at a coal plant here.   In the interests of staying competitive they make us offer lower minimum and highrr maximum loads and follow an automatic generating control  that definitely does not operate us like a base load.  We typically follow at 6MW a min, I've personally gone up as fast as 15MW a min and down at 20MW a min.</p>
<p>Yes combined cycle natty gas units do it faster than our old shit, however.  I wish we could still operate like a base load.</p>
<p>As -the enemy- our constant skepticism about EV is that it uses 8 to 13 microwaves worth of electric while it's charging.  The problem with this is it seems like nobody is thinking about the pollution caused by the infrastructure we will have to build so eventually everyone in the neighborhood can have an EV.  The problem right now is electrical distribution(not me) just can't pump enough electric into an area right now to support wide spread EV use yet.  Me I want an EV because the torque and acceleration is pretty sweet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll concede, you've picked up on some nuance I missed. I assumed coal was much more like nat gas as far as load following abilities go.</p>
<p>That said, my point remains. Charging 1000 electric cars on a coal-fired grid is not &quot;unnoticed&quot; by the grid, obviously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate more on how this is done? The power stations use properties of electricity (capacitance in particular?) to detect load, yeah?</p>
<p>Do power plants always have to produce or store slightly more energy than required to prevent blackouts, or is it more complicated than that?</p></div>		</li>
