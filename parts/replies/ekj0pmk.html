			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect answer.</p>
<p>This is also why your sewage system (assuming in the US, built to current codes, etc.) has a direct vent straight up to your roof that bypasses all of that.  The main vent stack is there because anaerobic digestion creates flammable methane levels and also creates odors.  Plus there is always the H2S potential, which should never be ignored.</p>
<p>With the water trapped in the P-Traps, that vapor goes out the easy exit (the main vent stack) and doesn't come through things like sinks.</p></div>		</li>

The water heater that grew some algae in it on the other hand... That was producing levels that no human should be near.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm going to ask a question I know you know the answer to, from that brief bit of information...but that other people should know.</p>
<p>Imagine you are dealing with an underground tank, sewer, or other enclosed underground area.  Someone goes down to do some work and collapses.  Do you go down there to pull him or her out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The roof vent you mention is actually to prevent water being sucked out of the toilet trap by a plug of water passing down the pipe, air is sucked in the vent rather than the water trap being emptied. Hope that makes sense itâ€™s very early in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both, if you dig into it.  Sewer vents to the stack, and stack prevents vacuum issues.  Both aspects are important to prevent toxic/flammable/odious vapor intrusion into the home.</p>
<p>Without the main stack, if there were anaerobic digestion going on in your sewer it would potentially bubble straight into your sinks and toilets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my understanding as well. I build houses for a living, and I know some co-workers have had sewers back up due to the vent not being un-capped after the pressure test. It's like putting your finger on the end of a drinking straw, it significantly hurts the drainage of the system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain what H2S is, where it comes from, and what it does to the body? There's an interesting discussion here about its consequences in an industrial context, but the only thing I get from it is that you don't save people who collapse in tanks because you'll end up the same</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parts copied from my post above, but it's important enough to repeat.<br />
H2S is sulphur, bound to hydrogen.  It is formed if organic compounds (fe shit) is being broken down by bacteria without the addition of enough oxygen. So it'll appear in closed spaces where there's organic compounds. Sewer systems, wastewater treatment plants, but also farmer's manure gathering places are notorious for this. </p>
<p>Practically:</p>
<ul>
<li>At a very low concentration H2S smells like rotten eggs</li>
<li>At  a slightly higher, but still very low concentration, H2S desensitizes your  odor receptors - you won't smell it. NEVER RELY ON YOUR NOSE.</li>
<li>When  the concentration is not high enough for you to die instantly, there's a  HUGE chance you'll end up brain damaged. I got the &quot;pleasure&quot; of  meeting a mechanic who went in to grab his stuff during a H2S alarm, and  trust me, there isn't much of a man left in there.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't want to breathe in H2S? Sounds like a toit plan. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>NEVER open a pit, tank or anything else that contains waste water, unless you have training, someone certified did a gas measuring, and you have someone to watch you, even if it's a regular pump station at floor level.</li>
<li>NEVER open water drainage systems. Some cities have mixed waste water systems, which means that rain water and household wastewater get transported through the same pipes. Low chance there, but seriously, H2S is no joke. </li>
<li>Always watch out at farms. The places where farmers store and dry manure are notorious for claiming a lot of lives. Remember how some farmers ferment their straw+poo under a nice plastic sheet? Yeah, always a few dead there, too, animals and farmers. Most accidents happen after fermentation when the stuff is spread out over the land: enough time for the H2S to form.</li>
<li>Have bunches of respect for those working in this field. This stuff is seriously dangerous, especially because you can't see or smell it. </li>
<li>On a related note, just because I cannot repeat this enough: NEVER flush anything else than toilet paper, pee and poo. NEVER flush tampons, sanitary pads or wet wipes. No oils/greases either, since they can . I'm from the Netherlands and we supposedly have (close to) the best water management in the entire world, and even our pumps get stuffed SO often by people flushing shit they shouldn't flush. Every time this happens, a man needs to go into the pit (2 of them, to be safe, according to protocol, and 1 pit watcher for every man down there) to open up the pumps and pry your stuff out of your neighbor's poo, with all H2S-related AND explosion risks that come with it.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic gas that can be produced by anaerobic digestion (i.e. your poop in the sewer being broken down by microbes without enough oxygen) or come from natural gas (plus other sources).</p>
<p>In low levels it smells like rotten eggs.  In high levels, it overwhelms your nose and can kill you without you even smelling it.  It's denser than air, so if it is produced in an underground chamber it will tend to just remain there and not vent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, floor drains work the same way. If you're ever in a shower/laundry room and you can't figure out what's making the entire room smell like ass, chances are the p trap in one of these drains has dried out and needs to be filled with water. Pretty common during the dry winter time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not that common anymore tho. You are talking about a &quot;FlachspÃ¼ler&quot; (flat flusher). Newer installations are rather using the other design, common in the US, called &quot;TiefspÃ¼ler&quot; (deep flusher). </p>
<p>The most popular German internet shop for bath applications (reuter.de, I'm not affiliated) has 1291 bowls in its catalogue. 102 of them are flat flushers, 1189 deep flushers.</p></div>		</li>
