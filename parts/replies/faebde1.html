<p>gravitron ride</p>

<p>If you're referring to the carnival rides where you're stuck up against a wall as the entire thing spins, they actually have to generate quite a bit more gravitational force than just 1g, in order to counteract the forces already pulling you down toward the ground. It's a vector sum of the two forces so in order to have it at least more toward the wall than toward the ground it would need to be at least 1.41 g (square root of 2). So yes you feel quite a bit heavier on those spinning rides than you do just standing on the ground and yes the force falls off very rapidly as you move away from the wall. (Try suddenly turning your head or lifting your head up and turning it to get a sudden jolt of nausea from those Coriolis effects mentioned in the video.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The closer you get toward the center of that “circle” the more you would feel the difference in gravity. The larger the diameter of the circle the less of that difference would be felt. I can’t remember from astronomy class, but we posed the same question to the professor. He basically said that unless it was nearly the size of a planet, your body would either have a hard time adjust for a long while and/or you would experience some adverse effects such as more blood flowing to your feet than your head, motion sickness, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your professor over estimated there. Earths D=12700 km so let's say we had a ring &gt;1% earth's diameter 100km in diameter r=50000m. A=r*w^2 or A~r so if you are 2 meters tall the difference in g from your head to your feet is 2/50000 or .004% I dont think you could notice that but dont take my word for that let's see what that would feel like.
Let's say you had a 2 meter obstacle you wanted to climb over and wanted to feel the difference in g you could feel on the spaceship. You would need to take over 1 trillion seconds to climb over the hill.</p></div>		</li>
