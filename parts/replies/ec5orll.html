</blockquote>
<p>I was busy sucking at EE and thinking about quitting because I didn't understand what was going on. One day we had a new lecturer and he was covering induction and he said, &quot;For those of you who play electric guitar this is how the pickups work.&quot; I switched seats and moved up to the front of the class and things started to click into place in my brain. All it took was someone else's teaching style. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Following up on this, why do battery's die if this is the case? Is there just natural loss of energy through atrophy (am I using that word correctly?)? Your explanation is amazing but I'm not seeing how anything is &quot;lost&quot; in the exchange, yet we can't reuse the same energy over and over, it depletes somehow...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity can be created by the movement of any charged particle.  In a wire, it is mainly movement of electrons.  However a battery creates electricity via chemical reactions which create ions (charged molecules / atoms).</p>
<p>The battery acts as a water wheel with a small rocket engine strapped to the one side so the thrust causes the wheel to spin.  The spinning wheel causes the water to move (producing current), but at the expense of the chemical reaction inside the rocket engine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical reactions are all about moving electrons around - swapping electrons between atoms. Arrange your reaction right, and you can have part of the reaction that gives up electrons happen over here, and the other part that needs electrons happen over there. The 'here' ends up with lots of spare electrons, and the 'there' ends up with lots of missing electrons, as they are moved across by the reacting chemicals. Pretty soon you end up with all those extra and missing electrons building up a voltage that prevents the reaction continuing. For a zinc-carbide heavy duty cell or alkaline cell, that happens at 1.5 volts, for a fully charged Lion, it's 4.2 volts.</p>
<p>You can then connect some equipment between 'here' and 'there', and 'pressure' of the excess electrons cause the electrons get pushed through it. This causes the voltage to drop, allowing more chemistry to happen, moving electrons and keeping that voltage.</p>
<p>The energy for this all comes from the chemicals in the battery. These are being changed from an energetic reactive form that reacts easily, to a stable form that doesn't react - like, an acid and a metal, that react to form a stable salt. It is this - the active chemicals - that get used up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To keep the analogy, voltage is how much pressure is pushing the water (e.g. a full dam vs a low waterline dam) and amperage is how much water is pushing/passing the wheel in a given moment. You can imagine a garden hose with your thumb on the opening to push the wheel. That’s high voltage low amperage. Or you could have a fatter hose with slower moving water (but more volume), that’s more amps. </p>
<p>Watts = Volts x Amps so if you have a 100w lightbulb, you could:
Plug it into a 120v wall outlet and it would consume .83 amps OR
Connect it to a 12v battery and it would comsume 8.3 amps. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So I read it as 83 A at 120 V...</p></div>		</li>
