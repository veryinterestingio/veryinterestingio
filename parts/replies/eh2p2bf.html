			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, ice increases the tension in the muscle. I do this until I can't take the cold anymore and the muscles get tired of staying tense. I remove the ice and  then the tensed muscles relax and I feel better than when I started. Doesn't always work, but it's better than Tylenol sometimes.</p>
