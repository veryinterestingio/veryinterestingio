			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. It is mostly how updaters/patching software works. If you do a small change in a file, it is both easier and safer for the software to download the new version of the file and replace the old file. Instead of taking the small part that was changed and modifying the existing file.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why they do this. First is that it is less likely to lead to file corruption. The second reason is that they have the bandwidth to do that now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly because developers are too lazy to set up delta patching, or don't use file formats amenable to delta patching. It's entirely possible to have it integrity check, delta patch, and fall back to full download if there is an issue.</p></div>		</li>
