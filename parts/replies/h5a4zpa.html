			<div class="markdown"><p>You can programmatically do this by assigning one color to each pixel and then compressing it with a lossy format like jpeg. It might combine similar shades that are next to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Base on this, does it mean that if I artificially makes it so the pixels next to each other is drastically different (idk, maybe switching the dark and light color for each odd or even number of pixels), This can create the largest, uncompressible image with a fixed dimension?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. The compression algorithms are a bit more complex, but depending on the type of compresdion there may exist a setup that is impossible to compress to a &quot;simple&quot; mathematical formula, in which case yeah, the compressed and &quot;raw&quot; image would be the same size. </p>
<p>Note that I put &quot;raw&quot; because usually the term raw is for images that use all the camera dynamic (12-16bits) whereas usually PNG images are 8 bit, so you do lose information anyway between the raw image and the PNG image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need a magical camera, you just need to have your camera set to save files in the .raw format or some other lossless format. Lossless formats just describe every pixel of the image and result in no degradation of digital quality, whereas lossy formats use types of compression that degrade digital quality in order to save space. JPEG compression is a good example, depending on the level of compression chosen when encoding the file, it takes similar shades that are too similar in wavelength to be noticeable to the naked eye and simply homogenizes them. It's a lot easier to say &quot;15 blue pixels in a row&quot; as opposed to &quot;1 blue pixel, 1 slightly lighter blue pixel...&quot; and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lossless formats don't guarantee that every image is the same size. It's easy to perform actual lossless compression in general, it's just that you'll get less compression than you would if you were willing to throw away some information. An actual raw image, on the other hand, where every pixel uses the full precision of the color depth and no compression is applied, will be the same size no matter the content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but lossless describes compression, not a format, and it can save some space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TO add - better (maybe all) DSLRs - allow you to shoot in Raw format - for these I am pretty sure the file size, while huge, would remain constant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't remain constant. I just took a look at a random few raw file sizes from photos I took with the same camera and they ranged from about 28MB to 35MB</p></div>		</li>
