<p>Because photographers and videographers realized that that's how most of the world is layed out.</p>

<p>If you're human!</p>
<p>Before locomotion, there was no movement to food and so the interesting world was shapeless. Afterwards, sensory organs developed at the end facing the direction of travel, front and back were born and the world was a tubular nub. With eyes and predation and light from above, top and bottom became a thing. And with it left and right, and the interesting world became a sphere of danger for some, and a cone of attack for others.</p>
<p>Out of the sea up and down become more important and the sphere becomes a dome, and cones intersect and distort against the ground and the horizon. A fulcrum with a rule of thirds, and the interesting stuff at the bottom, looked through by photographers as they evaluate the world.</p></div>		</li>
