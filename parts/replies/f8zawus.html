			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, just because your body is hit by some form of stimulant, that doesn't mean you miraculously gain full fine motor (muscle) control again. You may feel more clear, but your body still moves more slowly and less cooridinated, including speech.. Meaning you can still be swerving in the car or tripping over yourself, even if you feel completely clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.. Trust me, I've done lots of cocaine and heavy drinking. It's anecdotal, yes, but it's also been studied. My heart suffers for it, because ethanol and cocaine metabolize into cocaethylene in the liver, which is more cardiotoxic... Don't hurt yourself or get a DWI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline actually kills erections, usually. This is because adrenaline as a hormone that is released for emergent, life or death situations. Typically, in an emergency, having an erection will offer no benefit, so blood is diverted away from this area of your body. That’s why if you’re having sex, and something abrupt happens like your parents walk in or something, you’ll lose your erection very quickly.</p></div>		</li>
