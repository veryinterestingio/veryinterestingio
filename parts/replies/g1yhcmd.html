			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains the phenomenon when you look at a screen that shows the wheel frame by frame. But OPs questions does not mention watching a recording.
I wonder if OP forgot to mention that. I don’t think this phenomenon occurs when just looking at something that spins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very obvious in recordings, but the eye does have a sort of frame rate. It's very variable, and differs across your vision , but given the right conditions you can get the effect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are indoors, you may have flickering lights caused by AC current causing an artificial &quot;frame rate&quot;.</p>
<p>Record player turntables used to exploit this to help you adjust their speed, they had a checkered pattern at the edge of the platter and a small lightbulb illuminating it. Set the speed just right, and the checkered pattern appeared stationary. Effectively, this system used the AC frequency as a time reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, and it’s a simplification, but notice how my example, a flip book, is not a screen, nor has an strict refresh rate, any digital/electronic components or light involved, etc... it’s the oldest trick. And yet, your brain interprets movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human brain actually has a &quot;refresh rate&quot; that is a bit slower then the standard refresh rate of a monitor or screen (mid 40s per sec.) If anything, I believe this phenomenon would work at slower rotational speeds than on a recording. I think its called the the Wagon wheel effect.</p></div>		</li>
