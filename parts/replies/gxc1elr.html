			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fine paper going into the details, but there's a simpler proof of /u/RobusEtCeleritas 's statement using dimensional analysis:</p>
<p>In the absence of air drag, the fall time of a tall thin object could conceivably depend on gravity (g, units m/s^2 )  and the length of the object (L, units m).  The only way to combine these factors to get a quantity with units of time is</p>
<p>T ~ sqrt(L/g)</p>
<p>(You might imagine that T could depend on the mass of the object, but if it did there would have to be another relevant mass to cancel out the units of kg, and there isn't.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no reason to treat mass separately in this way. Just include it in the list of quantities: T, L, g and m. Four quantites, three dimensions, so one dimensionless quantity: gT^(2)/L = const.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a chain of dominoes the separation between them matters, too. Luckily it doesn't change the argument - as long as the lengths stay the same you still get some length-valued object that gets divided by g and plugged into a square root.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another factor that impacts how fast a line of dominos will fall: the chance that any individual domino will slip across the surface rather than use its corner as a steady fulcrum.</p>

<p>Intuitively, I would guess that a stronger gravitational force would reduce the chance of slippage. Higher normal force results in more friction. This is also strongly influenced by the materials of the dominoes and the underlying surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you saying shouldn't matter?</p>
<p>The rate of dominoes slipping has a significant impact on the time it takes for a line of dominoes to fall because a domino that slips stops acting like a pendulum, and is more likely to impact the next domino such that it also slides forward rather than falling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related question - how would increased gravity affect air resistance? If the planet had g=20m/s², a skydiver would 'weigh' more, which would lower the effect of such resistance, but the air would also be heavier, with higher pressure. Would those balance out? Or does the impact of air resistance change as g increases? (assuming thickness of the atmosphere, air composition, etc are all the same)</p>
<p>Presumably this also could impact the domino similarly, though the change would be minute</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here simply conflating a doubling of gravity to a doubling of density and saying that the effects cancel out are a bit incomplete, and potentially incorrect. Terminal velocity typically is modeled using the balance</p>
<p>mg = 1/2CAρv^2 or v^2 = 2mg/(CAρ)</p>
<p>where ρ is the fluid density, A is the cross sectional area, m is the mass of the object, g is the gravitational constant, and C is a drag coefficient (normally empirically obtained because it is a conglomerate of a whole bunch of factors), and v is the terminal velocity.</p>
<p><em>Assuming</em> C stays constant, if gravity doubles, density would need to double (and it would) as well in order for v to stay constant, but the thorn here is the fact that C is not <em>guaranteed</em> to stay constant. C is a fickle beast, and doesn't always behave the way you would expect. As a more famous example, drag coefficient on airplanes in our atmosphere increases as altitude increases, and non-negligibly so. This is <em>also</em> due to a multitude of factors. How these factors would actually affect the terminal velocity of a sky diver is heavily non-trivial. Someone with more experimental or simulation experience with drag coefficients would probably be able to give you a better gut feeling as to which way this would push the terminal velocity and by an approximate degree of magnitude, but even then I'd only expect a gut answer, not one that's highly objective. </p>
<p>Domino though? You would probably not notice atmospheric changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how much atmosphere there is. Venus and Earth have very similar gravity (Venus being 0.9g) but Venus has an atmosphere so thick that the surface pressure is 93 times that of Earths! A skydiver would fall much more slowly, at least until their parachute melted. </p>
<p>Conversely, you could have a planet with 2x earth's gravity and no atmosphere, providing no air resistance with predictable results for skydivers. </p>
<p>If you doubled the mass of earth tomorrow, the atmosphere would squeeze down and become denser but less tall. Right now a square inch of atmosphere from top to bottom weighs 14.7 lbs. If you double the acceleration, it would weigh 29.4lbs. I'm sick right now so I'm not gonna calculate whether the increased density will offset the increased gravitation. </p>
<p>Hopefully one of those scenarios helps you get your mind around what's going on. </p>
<p>A domino has a pretty small air resistance so gravity will probably be a bigger effect at small changes, but if you start getting an atmosphere as thick as water or honey or something you'd start getting a lot more drag and buoyancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll help out with the offset.</p>
<p>Aerodynamic drag scales linearly with fluid density, but scales with the square of velocity. A domino tipping over is never going to get anywhere near terminal velocity in that amount of time (the point where drag cancels out gravitational acceleration), so we can assume drag is not a large contributing factor. If we doubled Earth's gravity without adding more atmospheric mass, you'd probably be able to ignore air resistance entirely and still predict the fall times to within .1% of actual.</p>
<p>However, planets come in various sizes and atmospheric densities. Surface gravity doesn't necessarily scale with surface area, assuming there's a solid defined surface at all. This means a planet with stronger surface gravity than Earth's could be smaller and have a dense enough atmosphere to make a difference, but it would have to be pretty extreme and I'm not sure that would be a stable body for long. Atmospheric currents (read: insanely fast and dense wind storms) alone would probably kill any chance you have to set them up in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It exactly cancels out! Terminal velocity is proportional to 1/sqrt(rho/g). For a given atmosphere mass per planet surface area, atmospheric pressure is proportional to gravity, and at least in the regimes where the atmosphere can be considered to be an ideal gas, density is proportional to pressure. Thus, changing a planet's mass, while leaving its radius and the mass of its atmosphere unchanged, will not impact terminal velocities - at least assuming the drag coefficient stays constant. However, a higher air density also means a higher Reynolds number, which will impact drag in a way that depends on the shape of the falling object, its surface roughness, and what Reynolds number it started at.</p>
<p>Venus's atmosphere, incidentally, is decidedly not an ideal gas. At 9.3 MPa of pressure and a temperature of 740 K, we are well beyond the critical point of carbon dioxide.</p></div>		</li>
