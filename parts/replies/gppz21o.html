			<div class="markdown"><p>Also this is why you sometimes get trees with multiple trunks or a fork in the tree trunk. If the meristem is damaged (for example if it’s eaten off by an animal) new ones will form from multiple areas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also related to trimming a hedge. When you trim away the terminal bud of a limb, there will be a fork that forms 2 more. </p>
<p>So hedges are like hydras...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two? Depends on the species. The easy hedges activate 3 or 4 regular buds and generate 3 or 4 new terminal shoots - and maybe some epicormic shoots further down the branch. </p>
<p>Running the shears through low spots in a new or neglected hedge seems counterintuitive but works. Yes, I'm making the bare spot lower, but I'm also hijacking the growth factors to do what I want. </p>
<p>Still hate hedges. A fence and trees are so much better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely a good answer. It all boils down to hormones and chemistry, just like a developing fetus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These cells produce a chemical (auxin)  that stops other stems from branching.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious, how was that figured out? What is used to watch that level without destroying the plant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know much beyond the basic mechanics. I’m a teacher, not a botanist. </p>
<p>From what I can find quickly find, Darwin and his son showed that the tips around leaf sheaths of grass seedling determine how the plant grows.</p>
<p>This led a Dutch botanist named Went to use those tips to make an extract that he used to make grass plants grow as if they were being exposed to light when they weren’t, which led him to argue for a hormone he called auxin. </p>
<p>Because of his setup, he was able to demonstrate that more auxin is associated with one side of a plant than another based on how the plant bends. </p>
<p>I’m assuming this led other scientists to explore auxin in trees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, so not necessarily measured directly, makes sense. </p>
<p>Impressive to get it to grow like there's light. Will have to look into that, thanks. Kind of a side hobby for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume they took samples of the main steam and side branches and compared the actual chemistry. Tree are very hardy, a little damage is not going to kill it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can apply hormones to plants exogenously to get an idea of how they'll make them behave.</p>
<p>Commonly in cell cultures (like for propagating orchids) they'll add auxin to the media to encourage root growth or cytokinin (auxin's bitter rival) to encourage shoot growth.</p></div>		</li>
