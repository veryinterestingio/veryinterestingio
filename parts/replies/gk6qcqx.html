			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I was searching for this. Because whales basically use SONAR to see a lot of the time, ship sonar completely disorientated them. In addition, offshore drilling causes very loud sounds and can involve periodic piercing explosions which are incredibly loud. Often they move away from the deeper areas where these loud noises are into shallower water and can end up beaching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  I think SONAR is the main reason.</p>
<p>Here's a short article: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-military-sonar-kill/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-military-sonar-kill/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-military-sonar-kill/</a></a></p>
<p>Apparently sonar &quot;can retain an intensity of 140 decibels as far as <strong>300 miles</strong> from their source&quot;.</p>
<p>Here's what sonar sounds like: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXfNfvnDyQI" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXfNfvnDyQI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXfNfvnDyQI</a></a></p>

<p>If you're a whale, that must be incredibly annoying!!!  I'd want to kill myself too if I heard that all day.</p></div>		</li>
