			<div class="markdown"><p>In your body are tiny things called cells, they make up &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p>Inside these cells is a set of instructions, called DNA.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when sunlight hits a Hair-Cell's DNA, it changes the instructions.</p>
<p>Instead of telling the hair-cell to &quot;Grow hair slowly&quot;, the new instructions tell the cell to &quot;Grow as much hair as you can as quickly as possible!&quot;</p>
<p>So the cell goes into overdrive and tries its best to grow hair as fast as it can, which makes it long, soft and white, instead of short, thick and normal coloured.</p></div>		</li>
