			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is to some extent also where the different prices for Diesel and Gasoline come from.</p>
<p>Diesel used to be a lot cheaper because Diesel was essentially a byproduct of Gasoline production. With more Diesel cars around that's no longer the case necessarily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For bonus bonus info, here are some other factors that influence the diesel/gasoline price differential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emission standards for diesel and gasoline were not identical at all times. In 2006, &quot;ULSD&quot; standards for Diesel came out and required a switch to 15 ppm or less sulfur in diesel while gasoline had less restrictive standards. As of 2017, Gasoline is on &quot;Tier 3&quot; standards which require 10 ppm or less sulfur in gasoline. As standards change, more intensive hydrotreating units (high pressure hydrogen + catalyst = no more sulfur) have to be built for that product, changing prices.</li>
<li>Export markets: The same thing, but also including the relative prices and legality of shipping gasoline or diesel to external markets and what their standards are.</li>
<li>Crude diet: What crudes a refinery or country tends to be running affects the relative yield of gasoline and kerosene, which affects their supply and then their price. Run all heavy crude with a ton of diesel+ material, gasoline becomes more precious. The reverse is true with lighter crudes.</li>
<li>Jet fuel contracts: Kerosene is in-between gasoline and diesel in terms of distillation, and is primarily used for jet fuel. If a refinery has a jet fuel contract, then kerosene will be used separately to make jet; if not, then kerosene is available as a swing cut to increase the supply of diesel or gasoline depending on how the refinery is set up.</li>
<li>The hydrotreating process: As I mentioned above, hydrotreating is needed to decrease the sulfur of the finished product. The thing is, because of their different combustion cycles, hydrotreating affects fuel performance differently for gasoline and diesel. Hydrotreating saturates aromatics (molecules with benzene rings as part of their structure) and olefins (molecules with double bonds), turning them into naphthenes (rings without double bonds) and paraffins (hydrocarbons with single bonded chains). Saturating aromatics increases the volume of the product, which is generally very valuable since you get more fuel for less feedstock. However, aromatics and olefins are very high octane and so saturating them is very bad for gasoline and hydrotreaters are ran in order to maximize sulfur removal while minimizing octane loss from feed to product. On the other hand, aromatics and olefins are very bad for diesel's Cetane rating, so aromatic saturation improves both the volume and the quality of the finished product, and so diesel hydrotreaters are ran to maximize aromatic saturation, often even if that results in removing more sulfur than is necessary by emissions standards.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that we can also produce more gasoline from a barrel of oil than we can diesel. </p>
<p>Refineries use a technique called &quot;cracking&quot; where they heat the heavier fractions in the presence of a catalyst. This breaks the molecules into smaller ones, such as gasoline. We can actually produce more than a barrel of petroleum products from one barrel of crude oil because of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, all oil isn't the same.  Oil from different parts of the world will &quot;crack&quot; (term used to describe the fractional distillation process) differently.  Middle Eastern crude will give different amounts of gasoline vs diesel vs bunker fuel than West Texas crude per barrel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crack is a second step where carbon-carbon molecular bonds are cracked. This allows heavier fractions to be cracked into lighter fractions.</p></div>		</li>
