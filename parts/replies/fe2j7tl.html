			<div class="markdown"><p>Going to bring a little politics into this so apologize in advance if anything: but an old dictionary that was available around the 1700s/widely used when the Founding Fathers were alive, had the definition of the word &quot;emoluments&quot; and a guy argued that when making the emoluments clause in the constitution, it could reasonably be argued that what trump was doing with his hotels (the DC on in particular) was counted as and violated the emoluments clause </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty important branch in political theory. A common debate is textualism vs originalism (and many other -ism branches) where laws should be viewed as written or as intended. But then there are branches of “as written” where meanings of words change so you use the original meaning, or always use the current meaning. Or if we look at “as intended” then how much material can be used to determine that intent  and the weight of intent to assign say, a letter to the editor from James Madison vs a personal letter he wrote vs another legal document.</p></div>		</li>
