			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s called a Goldman Applanation Tonometer, which uses another type of lens than gonioscopy. A gonioscope is used to check if the angle between the cornea and the iris is narrow or closed. They are both important tools in monitoring glaucoma suspects.</p>
<p>And you’re right it is more accurate. Non contact tonometry like the puff of air is still accurate enough to tell if a patient has abnormal IOP in general screening. Typically however, you’ll have the pressure checked with the device you’re talking about anyway if the puff of air test is too high. Some clinics only use the one you’re talking about right off the bat though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, well I’m glad you’re attending your 6 month routine checkups. I hope you’re doing well and that you continue to have a happy and healthy life with good vision. There are quite a few options for glaucoma patients these days (depending on the patient). </p>
<p>And definitely! Any glaucoma clinic that I’ve seen will always use a Goldman applanation to measure eye pressure. Or rather if you’re in whatever combined clinic and happen to be a glaucoma patient, they will definitely go straight for the Goldman. </p>
<p>Usually glaucoma check ups are a combination of Visual acuity check (like every clinic ever), eye pressure check, visual field testing, and an occasional OCT scan (particularly to track the parameters of the optic nerve and nerve fibers). And the attending physician would also have you dilated to take a look at your retina and optic nerve themselves. </p>
<p>It’s also important to know eye pressure before dilating. There are agents capable of reversing dilation. However, especially in a glaucoma clinic (regarding patients with high IOP due to narrow angles between cornea and iris) it is possible for the angle to completely close if a particular patient is dilated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: after a quick search, the method used on me was called Gonioscopy.</p>

<p>Gone eye oscopy.  </p>
<p>Somebody was trolling when they named that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just had this test done for the first time a few weeks ago. I am so glad they got rid of the puff machine. I would know it was gonna happen but would still jump out of the chair every time lol.</p></div>		</li>
