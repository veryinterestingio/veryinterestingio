			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why this parent comment was removed (or what it even said), but can someone please explain the claim that bluejay feathers are not <em>really</em> blue? What does this even mean? Why would this be an <em>illusion</em> as OP suggests? Isn't <strong><em>all</em></strong> color simply an interpretation by the observer?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are actually creating a negative 'gauge' pressure that 'pulls' the fluid, not pushes.</p></div>		</li>
