<p>&quot;We’re dealing with a highly nonlinear entity moving at a very high speed&quot;
&quot;We start by sucking a sheet off the stack with vacuum feeders then it travels along thirty feet of path at one thousand three hundred and fifty millimetres per second, changing speed and direction at accelerations reaching 3g.”</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh my god, is that why the paper comes out slightly warm from laser printers but normal temperature from inkjet ones? I always thought it was the laser somehow heating the paper in the process of printing, not something intentional</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there is a heating element in there called a fuser unit which essentially melts the toner into place. That is why if you ever spill toner on your hands, clothes, or anything else you should wash it off with cold water since it is designed to adhere with heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone already said the toner gets molten onto the paper by a heating element, but I just wanted to say that the laser never his the ballet, but rather a photoconductive drum. There's more steps but the simple version is there's a photoconductive drum that gets a static charge applied to it, then the laser (reflecting off a moving mirror) hits everything that should be white with makes the static dissipate (because the drum becomes conductive when exposed to light) so now there is a static charge forming there square you hadn't printed. Now the toner gets attracted to the drum by the static, and the the paper is rolled over the drum to transfer the toner (there's a bunch more steps and usually a few more rollers to make sure the toner actually transfers from the drum to the paper) now the paper has the shape of what you printed on it but it's just loose dust, so as it exits the printer it essentially goes through a toaster to melt the toner on.</p></div>		</li>
