			<div class="markdown"><p>I think itâ€™s both interesting and important to mention coal is different than charcoal. Iâ€™m not saying you donâ€™t know this, but a surprising amount of people assume coal is just the short name for charcoal - it isnâ€™t. Coal is mined from a ground and is a non renewable resource similar to oil. Charcoal is man made from wood, and is arguably renewable. Not a great renewable, but definitely more renewable than coal. Relatively speaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The origin of coal totally blows my mind.</p>
<p>Basically, at one point in time, trees existed, but the microbes and bacteria that could eat cellulose and lignin (that the trees were made of) had not yet evolved.  There were massive forests of these early trees that had shallow root systems and fell over all the time, so the world was literally just covered in fallen trees that never biodegraded (though they did catch fire, causing massive global fires that put the Amazon or Australia or California to shame).  Eventually these massive piles of wood got buried, and that's what we now call coal.</p>
<p>And that's also why it's non-renewable - because those microbes and bacteria exist now, so wood biodegrades instead of becoming coal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, I always knew the difference between coal and charcoal (at least as an adult), but even though I've watched documentaries on coke production, I somehow got it in my head that it was a further refinement of charcoal. It was always bothering me in the back of my mind as to what else could be taken out of charcoal to make it burn hotter.  Thanks for that, the second I saw your post it all clicked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon residue isn't volatile. Actually, charcoal is made from wood by removing as much volatiles as possible. And because volatiles are the easiest to ignite, dry wood catches fire quicker/easier than charcoal or especially charcoal briquettes.</p>
<p>This said, charcoal burnes significantly slower and hotter than wood. And it is still somewhat easy to ignite because of its porous structure. When it catches fire, it will make a better job of spreading it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, it also removes all the moisture and dramatically increases surface area.  </p>
<p>I can take a single match and light a piece of charcoal. I can't do that when it's still a piece of kindling however.   </p>
<p>Perhaps however I simply haven't had wood dry enough, I've never actually moisture metered it to see. Like for example if I kiln dried it first to make it as absolutely dry as possible maybe it would perform better than charcoal.<br />
I'm sure someone's done a side by side analysis. I should try and find it.</p></div>		</li>
