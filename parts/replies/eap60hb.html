			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what some non smokers fail to realize. It's not the nicotine addiction. That's fine, within a week and you're good... It's the habit of smoking itself. Your brain is programmed to have a cigarette at certain points, when you wake up, after a meal, with your coffee, etc... You get the point.  </p>
<p>I've been 10 years strong now, and the first year was the hardest. Trying to break the routine, swapping the habit(sadly mine was food and I gained weight), seeing others smoke... It's a battle of sorts. But I feel the true key to quit smoking. Is you have to truly want to quit, you have to despise it, you have to be over it, the smell, the taste. Otherwise it's easy to fall back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who never has smoked, why is that a hurdle?  Does it mean that withdrawal really doesn't set in until <strong>after</strong> five days because you still have some nicotine in your system?  So it's easy to 'quit' for five days, but day six is awful?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Follow up, is that five days unique to nicotine, or is it similar to almost any substance/addiction?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unique to nicotine. Any chemical will have its own unique detox time until your body fully metabolizes it. This is also specific to the quantity in your system. It also leaves at a steady rate, not all at once.</p>
<p>Also the nicotine in your system just means youre affected by it. Initial cravings could be greater etc. And makes it harder to quit in that initial period. Cravings always decrease with time. Doesnt mean they really go away but you figure things out and the drugs arent affecting you as much.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I stopped and started at least 4 times, breaks varying from 3 to 8 months. The first 3 days are absolute hell, I feel restless but exhausted, constantly craving for cigarettes to the point that I cannot concentrate on anything else. I get irritated easily and my mood is generally very low. After 5 days it is getting easier to not smoke, not harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting, but this is only about the possible risks, it doesn't state how much it takes to replace damaged cells and possibly get rid of all the tar in the body etc..</p>
<p>like those pics of smoker lungs vs normal lungs. how many years of non-smoking does it take (if ever) to have your lungs return as if you never smoked?</p></div>		</li>
