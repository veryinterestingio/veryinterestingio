			<div class="markdown"><p>That's &quot;true&quot; in technicality and... well, kinda stupid advice in practice. </p>
<p>It's basically like saying &quot;avoid soap because it dries out your hands&quot;. In fact alcohols, in this instance, do nearly the exact same thing as soap does. </p>
<p>This advice is bad because 1) it's not just alcohols that can &quot;strip moisture&quot; and 2) because &quot;stripping moisture&quot; is the <em>point</em> of using soap. The moisture you're removing is the oil that builds up on your skin and hair which holds onto dirt and makes your hair look greasy. </p>
<p>A traditional hair care routine is to use shampoo to remove excess oil from your hair and then use conditioner to restore new oil to it in a controlled fashion. </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that a lot of &quot;natural&quot; soap products can actually strip <em>more</em> moisture from your hair or skin than an engineered product, because the engineered product has moisturizers designed to remain after you wash it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No no, alcohol(ethyl alcohol) doesn't have humectant and emulsion properties.  Soap is cleaning the body because it's a surfactant/emulsifier. Ethyl alcohol dries the skin. It's not like soap.</p>
<p>By the way, if you don't have a conditioner, you can add some oil to the shampoo on use. Not much. But personally, I don't use any conditioner for my hair, because I love very short hair, and my skin is very oily. Even I use SLS shampoos to clean my skin deeply.</p>
<p>For example, in here, soaps are sold as &quot;natural&quot;, but I think the old women add sodium hydroxide to their formula with &quot;spoons&quot;. They should add with a scaler. And I don't also think they add coconut oil because it's so expensive here. As you know, you should add coconut oil or palm kernel oil as a soap ingredient, or the soap won't clean your skin. They won't add those oils and use NaOH properly because they don't have any chemistry study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the kind and concentration. Like if you ever put rubbing alcohol on your hand and let it evaporate, you'll feel the drying effect. Cetyl alcohol, not so much.</p></div>		</li>
