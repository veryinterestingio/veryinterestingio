			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first mistake was to be on Reddit! Social media makes us feel that we're not successful enough, fun enough, or attractive enough. These feelings will linger even when we put the device down, making it hard to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Plus the blue glow of electronic screens screws up our biological clock, making us think it is daytime. Night filters that make the screen yellow help reduce this effect but it's best to not be exposed in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off this comment since I feel it may help some - white noise machines have helped me fall asleep consistently. It takes a few nights of getting used to it, then, once you become used to the sound, just hearing it start up will cause me to naturally start feeling sleepy. I use the Dohm - YMMV of course, but it has helped me greatly. I'm sure the factors mentioned above all play into it.</p></div>		</li>
