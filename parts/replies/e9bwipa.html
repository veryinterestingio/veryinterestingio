			<div class="markdown"><p>He's been Coroner for 34 years. Since 2012, to be eligible to run for position of Coroner, it's required that one enroll in a Medicolegal Death Investigations Certification course and have at least 640 hours of death investigation experience under your belt. He's certainly gotten those hours in <em>now</em> and has been &quot;certified&quot; but that wasn't the case when he first was elected. </p>
<p>Strange isn't it? About ten years ago, a former EMT ran against him and lost. Two years ago, someone who'd been deputy Coroner but hadn't enrolled in the certification course ran against him and he had them disqualified because they hadn't <em>enrolled</em> yet. </p></div>		</li>
