			<div class="markdown"><p>If you only eat one meal a day regularly your body figures it out and you stop really feeling hungry during other times of the day. Usually when I am intermittent fasting for a while I will be hungry when I wake up but it drops off fast and I only get hungry again at lunch for a bit. If I am eating my meals at dinner and continue to ignore it it will go away after about half an hour. It gets weaker and weaker too the longer you do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.  I've lost 35lbs since Covid and this was primarily how.  I walked a lot, still mountain biked when I could (it's damn hot though), but mostly just ate less.  I was hungry at first not eating breakfast and lunch most days but now I'm just not feeling hungry.  I've gotten close to my goal so I've brought a couple hundred calories back in the morning and lunch time but my hunger doesn't seem to care.  I'm real hungry at around 5pm though regardless of what I eat before.  Some days I've eaten big lunches just due to convenience and I'm still hungry at 5 but won't eat much if I had 1500 calories for lunch.  Honestly it's just getting used to the feeling and ignoring it at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick, my dear die_balsak, is not minding that you’re hungry.</p>
<p>Thats what IF comes down to for me, 75 lbs later. Once you can just tell your body, “okay, well I’m going to eat later so don’t worry about it.” and go on with your day, it is just a matter of waiting for the calorie deficit to add up.</p>
<p>It honestly feels like a superpower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did it make you hungry or craving? Hunger is a feeling in your stomach. Craving is a feeling on your tongue and around the inside of your mouth. Think about that the next time you want a snack. A lot of times it’s not hunger, it’s craving it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i disagree with your hypothesis about calorie density. humans ate way more saturated fat in the paleolithic era. also, animals that are lean are generally fast and, therefore, difficult to hunt.</p></div>		</li>
