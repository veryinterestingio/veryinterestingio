			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the benefits to being a large, complex terrestrial vertebrates is having not only watertight skin (yonder snails in your example have permeable skin, they absorb things from their environment, which in the case of crawling over a chunk of copper, is a tiny little world of &quot;not good&quot;), but also having robust kidneys with ion pumps that can just pump some of the rifraff right the fuck on outta town. So, part of the reason yonder snail would be scrood even at human size, is we have better ways to keep the stuff out, or get rid of it once it's in. </p></div>		</li>
