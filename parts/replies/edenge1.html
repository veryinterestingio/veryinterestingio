<p>In terms of muscle fiber types think endurance vs speed. Take normal weight average joe vs long distance endurance runner. Average joe wouldn’t have the endurance as the distance runner in terms of longevity. However chances are if you were to do a vertical jump of the 2 individuals, chances are average joe beats the distance runner due to the majority of the runners muscle fibers being slow endurance fibers, where joe has a well balanced mix of the 2. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait isn’t something farther away supposed to look like it’s quicker? Source: it actually is moving quicker since the whole joint undergoes the same rotation, which means that the farther out from the joint the longer the distance that part of your finger travels in the same time so the faster it goes
