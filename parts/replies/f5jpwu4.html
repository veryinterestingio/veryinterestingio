			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically that would be a good way to repair UV damage and it can be done in cell culture in a laboratory setting. However, it is quite difficult to get thousands of full proteins through a cell membrane (just one won't make a large impact), especially at the organismal level and especially for skin which has a huge surface area. </p>
<p>Genetic approaches might be more effective. If you can get a single copy of the Photolyase gene as DNA or RNA in to a cell, then the cell can make thousands of proteins. Gene therapy approaches like this are being developed for cystic fibrosis patients, so entirely possible. Another avenue is designer babies, but that brings up ethical concerns and is not being pursued by scientists.</p>
<p>There are many cosmetic products that claim to get Photolyase into your skin. I would be highly skeptical of them! It is very difficult to get proteins across a cell membrane.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except the ones in China based on the news.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to do something crazy like make a patch with millions of microscopic needles that could pierce the membrane and then pressing down could push out the enzyme?</p></div>		</li>
