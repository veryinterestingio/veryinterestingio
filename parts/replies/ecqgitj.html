			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point.  I will read the article.  It can be confusing to reconcile the flow of current and the alternating phase of the 60 Hz ac wave.   I read that in the old logging camp, the power was generated at 40 to 50 hz and one could see the lights vary slightly in intensity.  Still obviously using power though.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frequency is directly related to the speed of the generator, so if it's spinning slightly slower that's how you get lower or higher frequencies in standalone systems. Airplane engines generate &quot;wild frequency&quot; power that goes up to about 800 Hz, for example, because of the variable speed of the engines. The grid system is just so big that any individual generator spinning slightly off the rest of the system gets pushed back to the system frequency by all the rest of the generators in the system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Agreed. Honestly, I think 'water flowing through a hose' and 'ping-pong balls through a tube'  are bad analogies for electric current and have done more damage than good.  I am an electrical engineer and it took me a long time to understand that current is *not* the flow of electrons, it is the flow of *charge*.   There are some really good answers in this discussion as well...  <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-right-to-say-that-current-is-the-flow-of-electrons-considering-current-is-the-flow-of-charge-per-unit-time-and-charge-is-the-flow-of-electrons-but-in-a-circuit-diagram-current-moves-from-the-+ve-to-ve-terminals" target="_blank">quora - Is-it-right-to-say-that-current-is-the-flow-of-electrons?</a></p></div>		</li>
