			<div class="markdown"><p>I can understand simply not knowing that it’s all that bad for you. That was my local radio station and I didn’t realize how bad it was for you until that happened. The worst part of this story was that they had multiple doctors and nurses calling into the show to tell them to stop and how dangerous it was, and instead of listening or doing a quick online search to confirm, they continued.</p></div>		</li>
