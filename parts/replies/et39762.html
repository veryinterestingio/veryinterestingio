			<div class="markdown"><p>They can be fairly accurate, though. I grew up in a neighborhood where I had the largest <em>clear</em> back yard, so we had 2-4 hot air balloons land in our back yard every summer.  </p>
<p>There's gotta be <em>some</em> method of aiming. We were still in the suburbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Balloon pilot checking in, u/MrRonObvious is correct. Our hot air balloon &quot;races&quot; are accuracy races. A target is set out in a field and you're scores based on how close you can get to the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OfmFiH_MII" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/9OfmFiH_MII</a> this video shows the different wind layers. The balls up higher are going to the right (in relation to their direction of flight) then they drop down in altitude and the wind direction changes to the left.
Sorry about the link I'm not sure how to make it a hyper link.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Albuquerque, NM, there is a hot air balloon festival. They launch in the morning , while the air is cool, but then can follow air currents that carry them to the (I think) Sangre de Cristo mountain range nearby. There's an updraft there when the sun hits the mountainside, carrying the balloons higher, where they encounter another air current that carries them away. The balloons then sink until they hit the first current, and go back toward the mountain.</p>
<p>This cycle can go on all day long, almost, without having to expend a lot of fuel to alter the buoyancy of the balloon.</p>
<p>(I used to work for a guy who was part of a balloon team, and served several years as Grand Marshall of the Balloon Fiesta. I think most of what I described is what he told me.)</p></div>		</li>
