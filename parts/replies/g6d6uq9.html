<p>braising</p>

<p>No one has been able to adequately explain to me why, when braising, the oven temperature should be significantly higher than 100°C. If you're cooking in liquid, and the liquid cannot get hotter than 100°C, then why make set the oven to 180°C?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>180C is probably used because it's a familiar temperature to cooks.  It is also done as low as 120C.  This lower temperature really allows you to fine tune the texture much easier before it becomes fall apart tender.</p></div>		</li>
