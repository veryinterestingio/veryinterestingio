			<div class="markdown"><p>YES. suede or even more so velvet. i get chills and my fingertips go numb/dry, so i have to rub them on something else to get back to normal. i donâ€™t even have to touch velvet/suede to feel it, just see it across the room, or think about it (like while typing this)</p>
<p>also those cheap knobbly gloves, chalk/chalkboards (not so much the sound, just the feeling on my fingers), really dry paper... although i do hate the sound of paper tearing</p></div>		</li>
