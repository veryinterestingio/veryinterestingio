			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually have been tests on this, at least for the auditory ones! The general theory is that humans evolved to use communication for survival, so certain sounds (similar in pitch to a person screaming, or a baby crying) elicit strong physical and neurological reactions from us (<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.livescience.com/amp/57106-why-fingernails-on-chalkboard-hurts.html" target="_blank">source</a>). IIRC, some monkeys have a warning cry that is very close in pitch to &quot;nails on a chalkboard&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you answered the question, let me ask you.... did you interpret OP as just asking why people hate the sound of nails on a chalkboard, more or less? I've never heard of people having an aversion to touching polystyrene. I'm also not sure what he means by the sound of ice scraping in a freezer. Do you have any insight? I guess I need an ELI5 of the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's what I think OP meant. The sound of ice scraping in the freezer makes my skin crawl and I get mildly panicked. It's like nails on chalkboard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Styrofoam makes a sort of high pitch squeaky sound if you rub pieces of it together, ice too although it's a more rough &quot;gritty&quot; sound. In either case I think part of it is that the sound is coming from many different points on the surfaces rubbing, and they are all at slightly different frequencies which makes discordant tones, which are generally unpleasant and very noticeable.</p>
<p>One example of a useful application of discordant tones is this tornado siren, which is rather annoying, and impossible to ignore.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate styrofoam to the point I impulsivelly and mindlessly thrown a big heavy glass ashtray in the head of a person who started rubbing two pieces of it together &quot;just for fun&quot; to check if my reaction for it is really that bad. (She's alive... unfortunately). </p>
<p>The sound of tornado siren is pleasing and I'm blasting it on my headphones on repeat, it sounds like a dope base for a beat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, sorry. My question was specifically around sound so the polystyrene part of my question probably confused things. So nails on a chalk board is a great example. Im interested why we have such a response to these kind of sounds and why that sound seems to bother some people but not others üëç</p></div>		</li>
