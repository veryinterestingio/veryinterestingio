			<div class="markdown"><p>Really thick calluses can dry out and crack and the fissures can lead to infection. Moisturizing can help keep the callus from getting too hard and painful, and calluses can be trimmed/scraped down (by professionals), but the callus will always come back if the underlying pressure or friction issue is not addressed. This may require special shoes, special inserts or even corrective surgery.</p></div>		</li>

They can easily cut your skin badly. Imo, better than sitting with a file for way too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Through middle school, I had a callus on the inside of my thumb from gripping pencils really hard and writing with a lot of force for years. My high school issued laptops starting my junior year and most of our notes and assignments became electronic. </p>
<p>I graduated last year, and I haven’t done any writing since then. Recently, I noticed that my callus has mostly gone away. It used to be thick and visibly discoloured (lots of dead skin layers, I guess), but now it doesn’t look different. The only reason I know it’s still there is because it’s a little harder than the surrounding tissue.</p></div>		</li>
