<p>There are many reasons people may chew on ice, beyond anemia. And some people just like crunching ice. I’m honestly puzzled why ice is lumped in with dirt and paper and called pica. It’s water, just in frozen form, and most water contains trace minerals an electrolytes, so it’s not completely nutritionally void. Water is necessary for our survival. Ice is still water, just frozen. But I’m not not a scientist, so I’m sure I’m not understanding something correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just looked it up:</p>
<p>You're right about the definition of pica and one of the first things listed in example of a craving is ice (followed by clay, soil, or paper).</p>
<p>Also, one of the first symptoms listed for iron deficiency is pica.</p></div>		</li>
