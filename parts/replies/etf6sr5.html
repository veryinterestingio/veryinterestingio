			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. And astronauts lose bone density like mad if they don't do impact exercises in zero gravity. But this doesn't generally change the dimensions of the bone that soft tissues have to accommodate. Either way though, we are amazing adaptation machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Complete conjecture here but I wonder if part of the reason steroid use results in injuries, is that the bone and connective tissue cannot keep up with the muscle growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our bones are great at remodeling following breaks. So what if, doctors thought, we intentionally break bones, move the two halves slightly apart, and let them heal? The answer is they can slowly lengthen bones over time, causing someone to become taller, for example, if it's done to the bones in the legs.</p>
<p>It's done slowly enough that the muscles/tendons/skin can stretch in the process. Physiotherapy helps this process along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, they cut the bone clean through, increase the gap, and set it with screws and plates. Your body will eventually fill in the gap, resulting in a longer bone. Skin and everything else will grow in response to tension. If the tissue is being stretched, new cells will be added to relieve the tension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: </p>
<p>My step brother broke his arm around his growth plate when he was 15 and now that arm is 3 inches shorter than his other. </p>
<p>Also, skin and muscle doesn't always grow at the same rate as bones. I had this friend who had inch thick stretch marks along his spine from where he grew way too fast for his skin to keep up.</p></div>		</li>
