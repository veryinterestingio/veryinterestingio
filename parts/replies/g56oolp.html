			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked a holiday season in a cheese packaging plant back in high school.  Extra sharp cheddar is the most unholy mess when it’s opened for trimming and packaging.  The smell, the slime.  It looks like rodents got at it, didn’t like it, but would go back to it occasionally instead of starving to death.   It was years before I could stomach anything other than the mildest cheese.</p></div>		</li>
