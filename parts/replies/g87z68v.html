			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars are not bright enough to outshine the sun during the day because they are so far away. However, when the energy/light from the supernova which formed the crab nebula reached earth 1054, that event was so powerful that the supernova could be seen during daytime on Earth, despite the fact that the crab nebula is over 6000 light years away from our solar system!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because during the day, our own sun is such a powerful light source that the entire atmosphere scatters with light...and a star would have to be brighter than our sunlit atmosphere in order to see it.</p>
<p>The only thing with enough brightness magnitude to actually pierce through the atmosphere during the day is the moon.</p>
<p>Now, if you knew exactly where to look then you could still find some of the bright objects in the sky during the day, but they would be extremely faint and mostly bleached out by the sky.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, you can view Venus naked eye during the day. I've done it when it's close to the Moon and you know where to look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of your questions have already been answered, but one interesting thing to note is that space is a vacuum that is almost entirely empty, so for that entire unimaginably long journey of a single photon (bit of light) there was really absolutely nothing to disturb it. Even in our solar system, which seems crowded, there is a whole lot of nothing. Try looking up 'solar system to scale', and see just how much nothing there is. There was a really good post about that too in r/dataisbeautiful some time ago.</p>
<p>tl;dr: space is really really empty, so no matter how far away the light source, there's most likely nothing at all to disrupt it until it reaches Earth.</p></div>		</li>
