<p>If it's really tonic water</p>

<p>I don't understand OPs confusion. I wonder if they are actually drinking tonic or something else.</p>
<p>The tonic I drink (Canada Dry) is super sweet (and bitter, but mostly sweet).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I assume like garbage, or else we'd have some on the diet market.  It's cheaper to cut the sugar than to add aspartame or w/e they use nowadays</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think nowadays when basically no one is drinking tonic as a way to get quinine, brands have gotten pretty unclear about tonic water, sparkling water, seltzer, etc. and a lot of people just think they are all the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, that's basically what, like, LeCroix is, or any seltzer. Tonic water with less sugar and no quinine.</p></div>		</li>
