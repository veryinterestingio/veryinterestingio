			<div class="markdown"><p>But only if it's perfectly converted which it isn't. The sun will only produce around 10^44 joule over its lifetime. (At least if my math is correct) So that amount of energy is equivalent to the energy of 30 suns over their entire lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could see a large object moving at relativistic speed, it would be spatially compressed in the direction of travel. I'm not sure what it would look like, having light from an object coming towards you while travelling past.. well, technically, I guess you wouldn't see it because it would be so fast.   </p>
<p>Okay, let's say you recorded, then slowed down an object travelling past you at relativistic speed, its length would contract relative to the direction it was travelling. Basically, it would look 'squished' (scientific term)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>from my understanding, it will not be that much powerful because it's not 100% energy conversion. Once the first particle starts releasing energy it's will push other matter out which leave them not change to collide. So only small amounts of energy will be converted</p></div>		</li>
