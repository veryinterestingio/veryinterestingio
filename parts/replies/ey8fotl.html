			<div class="markdown"><p>Too add into this, even if they were frozen properly, by the time you get it from the freezer at the grocer to your freezer at home, it's thawed enough to have no longer been &quot;properly frozen,&quot; and begin developing other bacteria.</p>
<p>I regularly walk to my grocery store, which is a good 10-15 minute walk each way. No way my frozen food is making it home 100% in tact in the summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live almost two hours from trader Joe's but I love the stuff I can find there but nowhere else. Their $5 cooler bags with a freeze pack I got from hello fresh a long time ago works great! And frozen half gal milk jugs. Stuff gets back frozen even in the summer heat 90F+</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add this, I worked at a grocery store chain for a few months. You'd be appalled at some of the stuff people do. There is a reason why the people they hire get shit pay....sometimes you'd see a uboat full of frozen foods outside of the back freezer for hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also adding to this, as I work in food safety and quality! If your meal is labelled ready-to-eat or cooked or something of a similar nature, there is nothing unhealthy in eating it lukewarm - more than anything, the heating is for quality. This DOES assume that there has been no temperature abuse between the time it left the factory and came out of your freezer. However, there are plenty of frozen meals that come raw - that is when you MUST cook your food to a minimum internal temperature to render it safe to eat. Minimum internal temperature is largely regarded to be 165.2F / 74C for raw products - if you want to err on the side of caution for ready-to-eat meals, you can follow the same temperature rule!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume also just a liability thing. If there ever was an issue, the manufacturer can say they clearly stated the product needed to be cooked to a safe temperature.</p></div>		</li>
