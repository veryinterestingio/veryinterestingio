			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Telomeres are are just structural components of chromosomes, and the phosphate backbone just provides structure for the base pairs. There's no information there. You also have mitochondrial DNA, but that's not part of your nuclear DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, if you're gonna correct someone, make sure you're right first, and you're not. The human genome is 3.1-3.2 billion base pairs across 23 chromosomes. Haploids cells have one copy. Diploids cells contain 2 copies (46 chromosomes) which is 6.2-6.4 billion base pairs. We need both copies, but it's 2 copies of 22 chromosomes and then an XX or XY, not 46 unique chromosomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human genome is the whole 46 chromosomes. It seems you're impliying we have the exact same set of 23 chromosomes twice, which is false. Just look at men : they have a X and a Y, which are indeed different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to be rude. From your comments below it sounds like poor phrasing (re: copies) and your intent may be correct. But correct terminology matters.
Your verbiage implies that all you need is 23 and then just &quot;copy them&quot;, creating an identical set, summing to 46. But in reality all 46 chromosomes are unique and distinct, and so your implications are fundamentally incorrect in both comments.</p>
<p><strong>It is incorrect to say &quot;the human genome is x amount of base pairs across 23 chromosomes&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Our genome is contained in 46 unique chromosomes. We need each and every one of them, your genome cannot be complete without all 46 unique chromosomes. They are <strong>not</strong> a single set of 23 copied twice. Copies are only made when DNA replicates in preparation for mitosis, or in this case meiosis. And all copies are then separated into different gametes. Then each parent donates that half via sperm or egg. When copies incorrectly stick together we get things like trisomies.</p>
<p><strong>It is incorrect to then imply that a complete copy [of our genome] is contained in haploid cells</strong> </p>
<p>Gametes are haploid and contain half of a theoretical genome. They do not have a complete copy - <strong>23 chromosomes are not a complete set of genetic data.</strong> . That's the whole point of sexual reproduction, neither parent passes along a complete copy and must combine to create a 46 chromosome zygote. Thus, sperm contain half of a complete set of genetic information.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Diploid cells contain 46 distinct chromosomes. They are not copies of each other. While your intent may have been correct your language and implication were not, and that's against the point of this subreddit.</p>
<p>Edited after posting to be more polite, be the change that you want to see in the world and all that jazz.</p></div>		</li>
