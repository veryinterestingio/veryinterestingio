<p>There's even some research that shows that when you're sleeping in an unfamiliar environment, you &quot;sleep with one eye open&quot; by sleeping lighter and remaining more alert to more potential threats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cats do this too. Ever come across a cat that's in a comfortable environment they actually fall into deep sleep? You can move their limbs around and they won't react. It's kind of scary the first time because it's almost like they're dead, but jolt them around enough and they'll wake up with the sleepiest expression on their face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only for some time though. I imagine that eventually your brain will get used to it and tune it out, or at least not make it as effective of an alert (&quot;oh it's just my alarm&quot; vs. &quot;OH I need to get up!&quot;). Probably best not to &quot;cry wolf&quot; to your unconscious reactions too many times, in case you really need them at some point in the future.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fire alarm? Slowly waking up. Someone screaming? Barely conscious. The weird grunting my cat makes as she poses to throw up whiel two rooms away from me? I am awake and turning into Usain Bolt</p></div>		</li>

Whenever he called my name from the other room in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or whatever I woke up instantly, it was very weird as I'm a extremely heavy sleeper.</p></div>		</li>
