			<div class="markdown"><p>I, too, work graveyard and in a pretty warm area of the country. I sleep much better during mid-fall to early spring than I do May - September. I get like 6 hours of sleep a day and I wake up every hour to hour and a half most days. It isn't fun at all. I have a/c, a fan on my bedside table, blackout curtains, and earplugs. Sometimes white noise helps, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a sleep aid helps, sometimes it doesn't. I am basically so exhausted by the end of my work week that I go right back to a first shift sleeping schedule on Fridays. I sleep fine at night. </p>
<p>My point is, do you have any tips for getting better sleep? I suppose it won't matter soon as fall semester for my grad program starts in a week and even though classes are online, they're still over Zoom instead of asynchronous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like you have never gotten used to the graveyard hours. Could sleeping normal hours on Fridays make it harder for you to stick to graveyard hours? It's easiest if you shift your hours gradually, like sleeping an hour later each night.  </p>
<p>Have you tried melatonin? Lots more research on it being done. I would think by now they would have good recommendations of how to take that for the night shift workers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also do things like wear inappropriate clothing for the weather, not drink enough water, stay out in the sun too long, and otherwise fail to compensate for the heat. </p>
<p>I remember when London hit 80 Fahrenheit one year while I was visiting and they were calling it a &quot;record heat wave.&quot; They said people were dying left and right from the heat. When I was outside I saw people in layers, with long sleeves, long pants, and drenched in sweat while hurrying to catch their train. I understand, maybe you have a job to get to, but you get changed at the office or in a nearby bathroom. Don't run around outside in full business attire. It's suicidal.</p>
<p>It was nice weather to me, but I also wore shorts, a tee shirt, and breathable walking shoes. People who aren't used to the heat just have no survival sense when it does get hot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>80F wouldn't be anything close to a record heat wave in London. London hit 97F a few days ago and has hit 100F before and even when that happened I don't recall stories of people dropping dead all over the place. </p>
<p>Everything else you said about British people not knowing how to deal with the heat is basically true though. I presume lots of those people were in suits they had to wear for their jobs, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>vulnerable people drop dead all over the world every summer when the temps get high enough. Doubly so at times of grossly atypical heat for the region, when that place was not built for, does not have active cooling and buildings designed to do one exact thing: keep the heat in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in an area that is very very cold in winter but can have very hot heatwaves in the summer, so I anticipate the heat but we only have one AC in one room. We had a heat wave that lasted a week and I couldn't get cool enough to sleep normal for a week straight. By the end of it I was physically sick from being so hot and so tired. The night it dropped below 80 I slept like the dead.</p></div>		</li>
