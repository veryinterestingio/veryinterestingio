			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Itâ€™s more specifically a factor of thermal diffusivity. Aluminum has such a high thermal conductivity in comparison to its volumetric heat capacity that most reasonably sized aluminum pans shed heat very rapidly. In comparison a cast iron or carbon steel pan has substantially lower thermal conductivity and somewhat higher volumetric heat capacity due to higher density. As a result they store a large amount of energy and release it slowly compared to an aluminum pan. It also allows these pans to deliver sustained heat outputs to food higher than an aluminum pan because aluminum pans reaches an equilibrium temperature much much faster than carbon steel or cast iron pans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking it up aluminum has a higher specific heat than iron. It's a little more than double 0.9 vs 0.4. So the difference is all mass. An alluminum pan with similar mass to a cast iron one would have a higher heat capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I just replied to another poster with a similar comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rate at which the bottom (cooking surface) of the pan heats up, given a certain burner input, is determined by the heat capacity, not the thermal conductivity.   (The thermal conductivity only comes in when you're considering parts of the pan far from the heat input.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll add that my last parenthetical statement is not quite true, because in a low thermal conductivity pan you are effectively heating less of the pans fractional mass, because parts of it (the sidewalls, the handle) are somewhat decoupled by the low thermal conductivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that the aluminum will heat &amp; cool more quickly so the pan's temperature will vary more widely compared to stainless or cast cookware, which makes foods like milk-based sauces very prone to scorching when the burner cycles on &amp; the pan gets too hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most quality cookware is aluminum or copper wrapped in stainless steel.  Stainless so it's easy to clean.  Copper or aluminum so the uneven heat from the burner is conducted evenly across the surface of the pan or pot.  Stainless on its own would make a poor cooking tool.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, I don't believe iron is a terrible conductor.  I thinks it's characteristics for cooking are a function of its mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the application. Copper cookware is used in some applications because of control of because of its more even heat distribution.</p>
<p>Other times you need more energy than your burner can put out, so heating a cast iron pan will store a lot of energy over time and allow you to release it into food quicker than a burner+aluminium might be able to. Things like searing a steak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copper cookware is usually two or more layers, too. Copper on the outside, aluminum in the middle, stainless steel on the inside is a pretty common arrangement. The copper on the outside helps with the heat distribution, the copper and aluminum help it heat up quickly, and the stainless steel inside is a decent cooking surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copper will actually sear <em>too well</em> and it just doesn't work out. Try treating a heavy copper pan and cast iron the same and slap a chunk of steak in each sometime! It's pretty amazing!</p>
<p>Cast iron does a fantastic thing for steak by giving up just enough energy to blast away a little moisture immediately, but by the time that's gone (about a second) the surface temp has dropped to the point you won't char anything. You still have some pretty significant latent heat, but the temperature tapers off at a near perfect rate to match slightly fatty beef needing to be flavorized! If you want to get super nerdy about it, stick a fast reacting thermocouple to the surface of that steak just before you sear on a variety of materials and temperatures! Delicious science!</p></div>		</li>
