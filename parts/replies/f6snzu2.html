			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if they don't die they may still get sick. I don't imagine a sick squirrel is going to be froliking in your backyard. It will be in its nest or hiding someplace so you simply are unlikely to see a sick animal. As for pets they may be sick but not very sick, a stomach ache may not result in vomiting or diarrhea they may just sleep it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the animals that we own or care for, we constantly ensure that they don’t drink the dirty water because we’re already pulling them away from it if they go for it. Our prevention of our animals from drinking stagnant water is a lot higher than wild animals, so even if pets do drink from a puddle, it won’t be nearly as much as a wild animal repeatedly drinking from still water sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's instinctive too. My dogs won't drink the water out of their water bowl, but they will drink water that's moving from anywhere. tap, hose, Tub faucet, etc. I bought them a water bubbler and they drink from that pretty freely.</p></div>		</li>
