			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out, also, that the 'machine' can be upgraded. Long-distance runners get to a point where running (at a moderate pace, not <em>sprinting</em>) can continue more or less indefinitely as long as they have energy (Gu or chewables or whatever), water (to replace sweat) and until they finally need sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why people are able to complete extreme ultra marathons. Although many of the top runners have a fast pace, their bodies uses fuel and energy more efficiently. Listening to Shalane Flanagan speak about her diet and routine she said that she doesn't eat as much as people think she does because her body is much more efficient at using the fuel. The whole science behind top athletic performance is fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually how humans became apex predators as well, since we can't outrun most animals in a sprint. But we have them on the endurance level. Like we can chase them nearly indefinitely and they eventually become exhausted and collapse.</p>
<p>Over time we invented new tools to make hunting easier, and require less running. But our bipedal stance, to our sweat glands, and relatively hairless appearance, all likely came from our ancestors all running marathons to chase down prey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have also heard that it is much harder to walk a marathon than run one. (which seems to go against what the OP is saying) I wonder if it has something to do with the amount of time required at a walking pace, vs finishing faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like something runners might say to sound badass. Doesn't really make sense though.</p>
<p>So walking a marathon would take around 8 hours. If you grabbed a random person off the street, how many of them could do it? One in ten? Maybe one in twenty?</p>
<p>How many of them could <strong>run</strong> a marathon? One in a hundred? One in a thousand?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>imo I think that people aren't used to walking any distance at all. People who are used to running find it easy because they've trained. I think if you <em>trained</em> walking with the same dedicated you would find it way easier. I've walked a marathon (trails) with no prep except finding my boots and packing some sandwiches!</p>
<p>One of my old comments covered something similar. I said walking is easier than running, and all I got was &quot;you should run more and you are lazy&quot; :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk. I've walked between 13 and 25 miles on vacation a bunch of times without ever feeling tired or anything. When I run 13+ miles I'm dead. Haven't worked up to a full marathon. But I'd assume if I ran 26 miles I'd be more tired than walking it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's called the Italian tune up! </p>
<p>It's more effective the less you redline the car. If you car has a redline of 7k most people will rarely push it past 3-4k RPM. The increased velocity of of the air and fuel rushing through the engine does seem to help dislodge some carbon build up and get it out of the engine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably an old wive's tale, and maybe true for really old engines - maybe it had something to do with carburetors? Someone who is an expert on older cars would need to chime in to clarify.</p>
<p>I do know that a modern fuel-injected engine in your typical consumer motor vehicle will not need this. As long as you bring it up to full operating temperature on a regular basis to vaporize any water that collects inside the engine, and get oil changes at the manufacturer's recommended interval or in accordance with the car's oil monitoring system, it will regulate and clean itself.</p></div>		</li>
