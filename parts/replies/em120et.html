			<div class="markdown"><p>Tickets sold per capita is still flawed though because it doesn't account for the fact that decades ago most people didn't have TVs or blu-ray players or video games. The things competing with cinema were much rarer and shittier. There were also much fewer films being produced, so each film would remain showing for much longer than today.</p>
<p>So in other words, there are too many things that have changed over time, such that comparing the success of films from more than maybe 15 years apart is fairly meaningless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the popularity of cinema as a whole has changed, it should be accounted for. Ticket sold per capita is good in my opinion. The statistic is not supposed to show the best film, but the most popular film in percentage</p></div>		</li>
