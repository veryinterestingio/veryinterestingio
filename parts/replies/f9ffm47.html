			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting! An aspect of inner speech that I was always curious about is how it works for people who have impaired hearing and use sign language. Do they “visualize” the signs as their inner speech?</p>
<p>Also as an exterior case I wonder if it is present in people who have not learned any language skills (like feral children that never learned a language). I wonder if those people have inner speech?</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Sign_Language" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Sign_Language</a></p>

<p>Which seem to suggest that the possession of language affects ones ability to reason (at least spatially) in the first place. The people who learned the more limited version of the home signing, the people who came up with it and learned it first, had no way to encode relative position in their language, and this correlated with them being unable to locate things physically. Relative position, it can be inferred, wasn't a concept present in their thought processes because it wasn't present in their language.</p>
<p>I'm having a hard time finding it right now, but I recall reading an account from one of the people who developed and used this sign language. They expressed that they didn't really have inner speech before they had their language.</p></div>		</li>
