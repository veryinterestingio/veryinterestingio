			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, there are a lot of benefits to having the brain where it is, but how it got there in the first place may not have anything to do with any of them. The shape and insulatory properties of the skull, on the other hand, very likely due to a need to cool the brain while simultaneously protecting it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, even with this thread I'm really not sold on the current position being optimal. upper torso seems like a better spot in general in my opinion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could they have? Sure. Humans also could have evolved to be blue skinned and tiny and live in mushrooms. It’s almost silly to talk about “could haves” in evolution though since mutations are random and selection pressures can be very hard to predict.</p></div>		</li>
