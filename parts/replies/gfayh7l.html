			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily coronaviruses are not nearly as prone to mutations as the flu virus is. That's part of what makes the flu virus so hard to make a vaccine for, it mutates so fast and there are so many variations out there that it's impossible to vaccinate for all of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flu viruses are labeled based on the combination of Hemagglutinin (H) and Neuraminidase (N) that they present on their surface. There are multiple varieties of each (18 for H and 11 for N) which can reassort in a process known as &quot;genetic shift&quot;. This typically leads to brand new viruses which people have little to no immunity to, causing pandemics. However, flu viruses also undergo the normal mutations every replicating thing does but lacks the ability to repair those mutations, which leads to small changes over time known as &quot;genetic drift&quot;. So broadly, it's the &quot;same&quot; virus, but due to genetic drift they're different enough that they're not truly the same. Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean there can be a potential 198 different varieties of the flu virus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Most speculate the big difference was antibiotics.  In 1918 H1N1 would weaken the immune system and open people up to secondary bacterial infections that would ultimately kill them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there were antibiotics for secondary bacterial Pnuemonia, and Steroids in 1918, I wonder how that would have affected the pandemic. </p>
<p>Or if we didn't have antibiotics and steroids (or modern medicine in general) today, how much worse would it be. </p>
<p>I read in an NCBI study that upwards of 75% of Influenza cases with Pnuemonia, are secondary bacterial pnuemonia.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then there's the obvious difference of population density and urbanization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One quick note here: The problem with spread of disease isn't density, it's crowding.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of people living in a skyscraper in downtown Manhattan, that's density. This is fine, there's no issue here with the pandemic.</p>
<p>If you have 14 people living in a unit that's designed for a single family, that's crowding. That's a huge problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely the density does make some difference because it will by necessity induce some level of crowding.
E.g. all those people living in the skyscraper have to share the same set of lifts, same set of front doors, many share the same corridors on each floor. Many people in skyscrapers don’t own a car so will be sharing public transport etc etc</p>
<p>All of those increase the vectors for the disease to spread that wouldn’t exist in an area where everybody lived in their own detached house and owned their own cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Density does make a difference in that it calls for different mitigation strategies. The main difference is that density creates a potential for crowding, obviously, which is the direct correlate with transmission, so most mitigations aim at prevention of crowding.</p>
<p>As far as using the same set of lifts, etc, the combination of mask wearing and hand washing appears to work. The mask keeps you from touching your face until you have a chance to sanitize hands, so even if everything you're touching is covered in virus, it doesn't result in a transmission.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you consider low-density areas, people still need to go to gas stations and grocery stores. But because of the lower density, they don't <em>feel</em> like it's as much of a threat, but it's functionally the exact same risk. So people aren't wearing masks, they aren't hand washing, and they are touching their faces while out and about, and the rates of transmission are much, much worse.</p>
<p>So yea, density makes a difference in that mitigations have to be applied in shared spaces, and there are more shared spaces, but there are shared spaces in low density areas too.</p>
