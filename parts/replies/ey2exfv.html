The benefit is that stock options are taxed at the individual rate which is a higher percentage at the corporate level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be practical to just have a government office keep track of specific companies and make sure they aren't bending the rules? The <em>Department of Tax</em> or something.</p>
<p>I know it's not practical to look into every business, but it's only the big ones that matter the most anyway. Couldn't they just track the S&amp;P 500 companies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Believe me, they do.  These companies are generally in compliance with tax law.  Tax law is written to allow for this to happen to encourage economic activity.  It also ignores the millions/billions paid in payroll taxes, personal income taxes, etc that are completely separate from corporate income tax and all part of the economic benefit of a bigass business</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only do they already heavily monitor these companies, but it's not a &quot;scam&quot;. Its only a &quot;scam&quot; when you dont understand economics.</p>
<p>For his first example. The van is expenses fully on taxes for GOOD reason. In that example, what wouldnahooen otherwise is that they would have to pay taxes on 40k, which is let's say 10k. But of course they couldn't. If they only made 50k and spent it on a van they have no money left! (Oversimplified but overall true.) They would have to sell the van to pay the taxes, which just effectively shoots yourself in the foot...they needed the van for a reason, and that's to make more money!</p>
<p>The second example.... again, totally legit. If you believe that companies should only pay taxes on profit (which every succesful country does, including social democracies like Sweden), then it's right to allow loss carry over this way. A year is just an arbitrary amount of time.major companies have time frames much larger than this. On the example, they didnt pay taxes on the million dollars because they literally have overall not turned over a dollar of profit.</p>
<p>There are certainly small advantages and loopholes garnered here and there. Occasionally a big one is found, but then it gets closed. In general though, outrage is only to rile up ignorant people to vote one way or the other.  I mean, everyone knows amazon makes alot of money, and they paid less in taxes than YOU. Omg!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the courts have ruled that bending the rules is legal if by bending you mean acting according to the law but perhaps not the spirit of the law. Basically every corporation/person paying taxes is within their rights to do everything legal to reduce their tax bill. It’s congress’s job to close loopholes, not some department as that would lack the checks and balances needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some things are not &quot;loopholes&quot; but completely intended.</p>
<p>Carry forward losses which both Amazon and my Restaraunt/sports center running cousin both do, is completely intended by Congress to encourage economic growth.</p>
<p>But idiot article writers would rather write OMG they paid zero taxes this year.   And not reference how much they're in the red overall because they just opened their 2nd location (cousin) or 1000th (Amazon)</p></div>		</li>
