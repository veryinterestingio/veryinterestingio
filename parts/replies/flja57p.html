			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is naturally insulated through the plane of the sheet, does this mean it could be OK without conduit?  Then a rod would be great to cover most of the distance then swap to regular wiring in the last few feet.  Most flexible wire in a building is ran in straight lines up to a certain point where you start having to dodge other equipment.  But would still need a way to splice it together in the field if construction were to ever use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you wouldn't need all that much right? If the resistance is near zero then the voltage drop would be small meaning maybe we don't have to step up or step down our voltage. Maybe we dont need cables a few inches thick from power stations to homes.How much amperage can a graphene nanotube carry? The wire gauge charts get thrown out the window for sure...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theoretical resistivity  of graphene is about 60% of that of commercial grade copper  (as described in the IACS).  You don't save much in terms of diameter (around 13% smaller).</p>
<p>What makes graphene exciting is how quickly charged particles can move within it. This enables smaller transistors to respond more quickly which is exciting for microchip designers.</p>
<p>OTOH Electricity doesn't technically require electrons to move much. Pure AC by definition only makes the electrons or holes vibrate a bit, and that allows energy to be transmitted much faster than the electron mobility of the conductor would allow in DC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldnâ€™t use such a cable for data transfers. Fiber would be cheaper and more practical (unless you needed PoE) and a cable like this might have neat electrical properties that allow for a low diameter high energy capability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you put an insulator between the sheets and roll it up, you have a capacitor.  Probably a really good one too but capacitors makes shitty wires, at least for data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the additional capacitance between conductors is part of what makes coax and twisted differential pairs so much more effective than standard paired wires when it comes to blocking noise. They might be on to something.</p></div>		</li>
