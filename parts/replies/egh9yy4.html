			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually no such structure as a nucleoid, that's why I clarified with DNA. Nucleoid is just the region in the cell that currently has the DNA in the prokaryote. But there are single celled eukaryotes that have a nucleus, and the line gets blurred with archaea.</p></div>		</li>
