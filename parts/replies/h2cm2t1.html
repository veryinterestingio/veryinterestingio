			<div class="markdown"><p>They get some of it from plants, but also from gnawing bones and fallen antlers....and even from eating eggs and baby birds when they can get them (this isn't unique to deer, other herbivores like cattle and sheep are known to sometimes eat meat too).  You can find videos of this stuff online, it's pretty crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I found on the internet, grass is like 0.3% calcium. So for every 1kg of grass they get up to 30g of calcium. And they eat a lot of grass. A cow can apparently eat 12kg of grass per day. So it seems that access to calcium is not an issue.</p>
<p>Remember, calcium is ridiculously abundant, at 4.2% of the earth's crust by weight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And showing off.  Possibly used occasionally for predator defense or other purposes (caribou use them to clear snow).</p>
<p>It's super metabolically expensive, that's the point.  It's what's called an &quot;honest signal&quot; in that you can't make big antlers unless you are really healthy.  So they effectively signal to other males that you are big and strong and would probably win a fight, and to females that you are healthy and would probably be a good mate.  You can't cheat the signal because it's just too hard to make big antlers without actually being healthy.  </p>
<p>Since good antlers make a big difference between reproducing and not reproducing, there's a lot of selective pressure to have nice ones.</p></div>		</li>
