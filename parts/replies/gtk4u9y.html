			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, singing passes through a different portion from those. It’s why you don’t necessarily have an accent while singing, stutter while singing, etc…</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The voice in my head doesn't have a voice. It sounds weird but I do, &quot;Hear,&quot; words just not with a specific voice.</p>
<p>Unless I'm reading something, and then that voice is that of an actor that I like, usually from a roll I like them in.</p>
<p>If I read anything from hard science it's in commander Data's voice, chemistry or physics for example. Humane sciences like sociology or archeology I hear in Spock's voice.</p>
<p>Characters in books I hear with a specific actor as well. Drizzt Do'Urden as read by Michael Bell in his harsh posh british voice for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's really it I believe, the 'voice in your head' is what you recognize as your voice, just talking to yourself as you think. I think it's why, for me at least, 'thinking out loud' is just literally talking to myself as I vocalize my thoughts for whatever reason</p></div>		</li>
