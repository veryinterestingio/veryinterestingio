<p>This is a great answer. </p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s an incorrect answer. Bowen’s reaction series describes the order in which certain types of minerals crystallise from a melt. The core formed as certain elements sank towards the centre of mass <em>whilst still molten</em>. </p>
<p>This was largely a function of density, but chemistry is also important here. Just not the chemistry that Bowen’s describes. The relevant concept would be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification" target="_blank">Goldschmidt classification.</a> If an element is happy to be with liquid iron, it sank to the core. If not then it didn’t — even when it was a dense element in itself, eg. uranium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna have to disagree with you here. Fractional crystallisation and Bowen’s reaction series is <strong>not</strong> the reason for a metallic core.</p>
<p>When the Earth was very young and had recently grown large enough to be very hot and partially (perhaps even completely) molten as a planet, some of the denser elements sank towards the centre of mass. Iron is an extremely common element in our solar system, and one of the denser ones so naturally a lot of it migrated to that centre of mass. Being the largest component of the sinking elements, any other elements soluble in a liquid iron phase also joined it in forming a planetary core (mostly nickel). However, some elements are more soluble in/have a greater chemical affinity to a silicate based phase, and so these remained in the mantle and crust, which are based around silicate structures. </p>
<p>This is encapsulated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification" target="_blank">Goldschmidt classification of the elements</a> and shows how it’s not just as simple as the denser the element, the more it wants to go into the core. A good example of where the chemistry matters is uranium — an incredibly dense element which was essentially excluded from the core because its lithophile, so stayed in the mantle and crust. So core formation is a form of differentiation but is not what we mean when geologists talk about fractional crystallisation. Where fractional crystallisation <em>does</em> come in is in the fact that uranium is more concentrated in the crust than it is in the mantle. This is because the crust (particularly continental crust) has been formed via several rounds of partial melting and fractional crystallisation, the whole system being recycled through subduction zones. </p>
<p>The concentration of uranium in the crust is still not due to Bowen’s reaction series though, it is because in the minerals that make up the Earth, uranium behaves as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_element" target="_blank">incompatible element</a>. That is, it doesn’t fit too well into most minerals and when <strong>partial</strong> melting happens (which is always the case when the solid Earth starts to melt) then uranium is amongst the first elements to be released from the minerals and enter the melt. It will then migrate along with the rest of the magma into the crust and eventually crystallise in whatever minerals form there. </p>
<p>Bowen’s reaction series was essentially developed as a way to explain the wide range of compositions we see in the igneous rocks of the Earth. It is an incredibly important factor in this, but often gets misrepresented or oversimplified in the more basic geology classes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radioactive materials actually aren't a significant source of heat in Earth's core, because the main heat-producing elements (uranium, thorium, and potassium) are lithophile elements! They matter in an indirect way, though: the heat-producing elements ended up in Earth's mantle, and they definitely play a role in keeping the mantle hot. Because the mantle stays hotter than it would without radioactive elements, the core is more <strong>insulated</strong> and <strong>cools more slowly</strong> than it would if the mantle didn't have radioactive elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why would the core stay hot?  I thought it was from the presence of radioactive materials.  It's not from gravitational tidal forces.  Would not the iron in the core simply shed heat over time and cool unless some radioactive elements kept the heat going?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're exactly right, the core is in fact simply shedding heat over time and cooling! Because of this, the liquid outer core is slowly solidifying and the solid inner core is slowly growing. <strong>TL;DR</strong> the Earth is so massive and hot that even though it's been a long time, the inside (including the core) is simply still very hot. Read on if you'd like an explanation.</p>
<p>The amount of heat that an object at a certain temperature contains is proportional to its volume. Volume is proportional to the <strong>cube</strong> of the length scale of an object (for a sphere the length scale is the radius).</p>
<p>The rate that an object loses heat is proportional to its surface area. Surface area is proportional to the <strong>square</strong> of the length scale of an object.</p>
<p>A relevant concept here is something called the <em>square-cube law</em>: if you take e.g. a sphere and increase its radius by a factor of 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>its surface area (and the amount of heat it can lose in a given time) increases by a factor of 4 (2^2 )</li>
<li>its volume (and the amount of heat it contains, if the temperature stays the same) increases by a factor of 8 (2^3 )</li>
</ul>
<p>Earth is <strong>huge</strong>, so the amount of heat it contains is <strong>enormous</strong> relative to the rate at which that heat is lost through its surface. So, its interior temperature has decreased pretty slowly over the billions of years since it formed.</p>
<p>An additional way of thinking about it is that in order for the core to cool down, it has to transfer heat to the mantle, and then the mantle has to bring that heat to the surface before it can radiate away. Even though billions of years have passed since Earth formed, heat can only travel so fast across Earth's huge radius and the interior contains a ridiculous amount of heat, so the process of cooling occurs very very slowly.</p></div>		</li>
