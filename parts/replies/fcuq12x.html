			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right.  Just want to point out that most everyone is already infected with JC virus and that it is clinically silent unless you become severely immunocompromised (major chemotherapy, late stage HIV/AIDS, chronic immunosuppression)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah immunocompromised people are at risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephelopathy because JC virus isnt kept in check. Its a shame because medicines like Tysabri are incredibly efficacious but have a small chance of causing PML which can be lethal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sterility dogma has a fascinating history.</p>
<p>It actually starts back with the grandfather of Microbiology, Luis Pasteur. He was the person who proved that bacteria exist, before there were microscopes strong enough to see them. To do this he created swan necked flasks that prevented bacteria from innoculating liquid from the air. He found that boiled liquid that was closed off from air stayed clear, while liquid that was exposed to air turned cloudy. Thereby proving that there was a microscopic organism growing in that liquid. In these same experiments he <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8283513/" target="_blank">actually also used boiled urine</a>.  He concluded that “fresh and healthy urine is perfectly free from bacteria or other minute organisms” - Pasteur, Lister and Roberts (1881):</p>
<p>And in one sense he wasn't wrong. Urine is a terrible growth medium. Remember, we think bacteria are growing on the uroepithelium, not in the urine itself. And unless glucose is present (from say un-managed diabetes) nothing will grow to high abundance in urine.</p>
<p>Now we jump forward to the 1950s, where <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14454174/" target="_blank">Dr Kass developed the standard urine culture</a>. This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13380946/" target="_blank">protocol was designed</a> to identify who was at risk of dying of a kidney infection. If a patient had higher than 100000 colony forming units (CFUs) per ml of urine, then they needed to be treated immediately. Because that was the population where the bacteria had the greatest chance of progressing up into the kidneys and causing sepsis and death. And he discovered that you definitely should not do any surgery on these patients, because they were likely to go septic.</p>
<p>His test was hugely successful, and his patients thrived after surgery. It was so successful that his test was applied to absolutely everything. And it is still the same test we use today, over 70 years later.</p>
<p>But his test was designed to grow one organism, <em>E. coli</em>. And the conditions he chose are hostile to the growth of a lot of other organisms, including those that we as the most common in female urine.</p>
<p>Over the decades doctors saw reports of &quot;no growth&quot; for people who were healthy, and reports of &quot;growth&quot; in people who had symptoms. And over time the concept morphed from &quot;nothing is currently growing&quot; to &quot;nothing will ever grow&quot; and the sterility dogma was born.</p>
<p>There were some people, like Dr Rosalind Maskall <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/86778/" target="_blank">in the 70s, that tried</a> to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20064694/" target="_blank">push against this dogma</a>. But she was shot down. It wasn't until the development of non-culture based methods, like 16S sequencing, that our group was able approach this.</p>
<p>As a few people have said on this thread, it all depends on the development of the right technology.</p></div>		</li>
