			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s good enough for an Eli5 yeah. Air is essentially transparent to a lot of radiation which is what makes it... transparent(!) it’s worth mentioning how the lowest layer of the atmosphere is heated mostly by infrared radiation coming off the Earth’s surface (which does so because it is reradiating solar radiation as thermal radiation). </p>
<p>Certain molecules in the atmosphere are capable of absorbing this infrared radiation coming off the Earth and reradiate it themselves, again in the infrared spectrum. This is the greenhouse effect. </p>
<p>If you travel straight up through the atmosphere from the surface, you would actually experience an increase in temperature above the lowest layer of the atmosphere that we live in (it heats up again after about 20 km high due to the ozone layer because ozone is a greenhouse gas), then a decrease, then another increase to temperatures greatly exceeding the surface temps when you get about 140 km up and further, which is well into the thermosphere. The idea of temperature gets a bit weird here though, it’s not like you would feel hot there because there’s a far thinner atmosphere, so fewer particles to bump into you and impart their energy, ie. heat you. The particles that do exist however, have a lot of energy (that’s how they got so high!) and so an average of their total kinetic energy translates to a high temperature in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically right. The air is mostly transparent to visible light, especially all the non-blue visible light. and it is even more transparent to infrared, which is carrying a lot of the heat.</p>
<p>Additionally, the higher up in the air column you go, the thinner the air is. Which means that there is even less matter in those layers and it is even less likely to catch a random bit of solar heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought the atmosphere just trapped the heat in and it built up.. like a greenhouse</p></div>		</li>
