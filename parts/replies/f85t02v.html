			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a field of research, called post-quantum cryptography, that tries to solve this. An idea is to encrypt data using NP problems: these problems cannot be solved in polynomial time, in other words, a computer might need infinite time to find the solution. Quantum computers will not crack these problems faster than regular computers as we have them now. Some people were afraid that using these problems with a high complexity as encryption will make encryption super slow. However, it has already been shown that this is not the case. I don't have a source for this now, might look some sources up later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have found what I was thinking of while writing the answer: <a href="http://mqdss.org/index.html" target="_blank">http://mqdss.org/index.html</a> NIST is organising a contest for post-quantum cryptography. This website is about one of the ideas. Feel free to read about it. There are links to papers on this website. So they are working on it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds really interesting! One minor point: there are no <em>known</em> algorithms to solve NP problems in polynomial time. But it’s currently unproven whether it’s possible. This is the open <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" target="_blank">P vs NP</a> question. However, there are algorithms that solve NP problems in exponential time.</p></div>		</li>
