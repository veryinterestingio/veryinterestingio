			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife wasn't familiar with en passant and it took me many years to successfully explain it to her and convince her it was a real rule. It was only after several Skypes with her father that she believed it was a real thing. </p>
<p>Even to this day she'll give me a dirty look and mumble under her breath whenever i am brazen enough to use en passant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>En passant is definitely nowhere near as known as castling. It's way more unlikely to occur and kinda feels like six year old logic when you try to explain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting enough, the Vietnamese translation of the chess pieces are exactly those you mentioned as &quot;original&quot;, Rook = Chariot, Bishop = Elephant, Knight = Cavalry. Probably they are relevant to Chinese Chess.</p>
<p>In the end, I think aside from Go Chess, the other chess was an enhanced version of an older one and the rules were changed overtime to balance it better and create more diverse strategies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually very similar to the rule set of Xiangqi, a Chinese version of chess that is still widely popular and played all over the country today. It’s more fast paced and the culture around the game reflects that. </p>
<p>When I lived in Beijing you could often see groups of older men gathered around two players in the streets. The players would trash talk each other and slam their pieces on the board and shout things like “Ha-ha! Take this, you [insert Chinese insult here]!!!” </p>
<p>I bought a set and learned the rules so that I could understand what the hell was going on whenever I passed someone playing in public. Turns out it’s really hard to get good. Also turns out that it’s much more fun to play “regular” chess when you slam your pieces on the board and call your opponent an uncultured amoeba with stinky breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Chinese chess is really interesting because there're a couple of cannon pieces that move like rooks but can only capture by leaping across another piece. That combined with limiting the &quot;king&quot; to a 3x3 grid in the center means there are more opportunities to go straight for the jugular.</p></div>		</li>
