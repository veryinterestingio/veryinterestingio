			<div class="markdown"><p>That's vastly unhelpful and just doesn't answer OP's question. Yes they will be very close to parallel, but they will not be parallel. Field of view is pretty much irrelevant as it's clearly assumed we are aiming with the exact center of the telescope. And you definitely can aim at the apparent edge of a star, just every star. And this is a theoretical question anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key point isn't really about the uncertainty, it's about scaling laws. You can do a little bit of trigonometry to work out the exact angle, actually. If the star has width W, and the telescopes are a distance D apart, and the star is a distance X away from the Earth, then the angle will be a = arcsin((W - D)/R).</p>
<p>The key point is to think of the scaling law, or the asymptotic behaviour involved, as W/R -&gt; 0. We have a = 0 + O(W/R). The O(1) behaviour is vanishing. That's what a mathematician would say; a physicist would say instead, for a star that is far away, the telescopes are parallel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. They will essentially be parallel and the main thing OP needs to understand is the immensely vast distances in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Practically speaking, I think the original commenter is pretty close to correct. We're not pointing at the stars with lasers (lines) and these Starz are really really far away. To put it into perspective, if you and your friend are 5 feet from each other and each have binoculars and you're looking at a  pen tip 1000ft away, you're approximately looking in the same direction and looking parallel. Scaling up using some geometry and a real world example, Proxima Centauri, and assuming the same proportions, you would need to place 16 million Earth's side by side with their telescopes facing Proxima Centauri to have the same angle between the two friends who are looking at a pen.  Put them on 1 earth on opposite sides of the earth and the effect is that you and your friend are even more parallel.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I'm approaching it from an engineer's perspective where pi is approximated as 4, sometimes 5 if I want to be conservative ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>
