			<div class="markdown"><p>They're both generally limited by the same physics and engineering. </p>
<p>Neither Nvidia nor AMD actually manufacture their own silicon, they just design it, and get a company to make the chips for them.</p>
<p>AMD is using TSMC's 7nm lithography for its latest products, Nvidia is using Samsung's 8nm lithography. </p>
<p>A large part of what determines final performance is the lithography used. </p>
<p>Both TSMC and samsung are competing heavily to bring the most advanced and competitive lithography to customers, so it's no surprise they're reasonably close together. </p>
<p>If one company got huge imprivements from a new node, it's very likely the other company is already working on the same thing. </p>
<p>Both companies have some of the best design engineers on the planet working for them. Both companies are capable of getting close to the maximum out of a given node as possible, with whatever GPU architecture they end up designing. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: progress is largely limited by the manufacturing technology available. Neither GPU company actually manufactures the silicon, they're limited by what other companies can do, which is limited by money and physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know Samsung was in this race as well, which is cool. As far as I could see though, they only produce processors for themselves, with their Exonys chips. At the same time, I believe TSMC produces processors for AMD, Apple, Android phones with Snapdragon chips, etc. Is there a reason TSMC seems to have such a large chunk of the processor market, when Samsung is so competitive in the graphics market?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You just missed the shit ton of memwory and storage devices that samsung works on.Sure,they dont need to be on the cutting edge but samsung doesn't make make silicon <strong>only for their own</strong> .</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes,TSMC was and is the only one on the market to have a working 7nm node that is capable of mass production.</p>
<p>Usual caveat :7nm is a buzzword,none of the transistor features are actually in single nm dimensions.</p>
<p>They were the only one to consistently improve YOY,which made them the only solution when Global foundries <em>left the chat</em> at 14nm and Samsung's 10 and 8nm nodes weren't as impressive as TSMC's 7nm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when Samsung is so competitive in the graphics market?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No,samsung is not competitive in the &quot;graphics&quot; market.AMD still uses TSMC for their radeon lineup of GPUs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nvidia chose samsung because, Nvidia and TSMC had sort of a &quot;fight&quot; but was it really Nvidia sandbagging TSMC to lower its prices or TSMC really having supply issues with all their fabs being booked for the foreseeable quarters? We don't know.Its probably the latter but NVIDIA has a very good history of pissing off others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Samsung had to undercut TSMC's price because their process isn't the best out there.Nvidia went with samsung for the consumer grade cards and raised the power draw (so as to compensate for a slightly &quot;older&quot; node)for their cards eventhough they had a very good architecture design(Ampere) on their hands.</p>
</li>
<li>Intel's disaster,that is its 10nm node, happened(not that intel ever manufactured other chips on their fabs but in terms of the cutting edge tech,they've always been there) and now TSMC is at the top with no one really to challenge,atleast for now.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Samsung isn't really competitive in the graphics market either. AMD uses tsmc, nvidia did as well until recently and even tried to have their top 30 series card use tsmc (didn't work out due to limited supply).</p>
<p>Samsung mostly focus on memory, something they have alot of experience in and their processor manufacturing has always lagged behind tsmc (but tbf even intel lags behind them).</p>
<p>The main benefit to samsung manufactoring is they are cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this i work heavily with the intelligence community and you’d be surprised how many micro lectronics are just flat out copied by others. If AMD is pushing out a super fast GPU you can bet NVIDIA has known about it for a while. These aren’t closely guarded national secrets and even with those there are constant leaks literally all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, at the top it's hard to keep secrets when the R&amp;D guys are getting excited about big breakthroughs or new ideas to pursue. </p>
<p>The top engineers are always moving about between the big silicon companies, taking ideas and certain company secrets with them as they go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dead right. And both TSMC and SEC use much of the same semiconductor production equipment anyway. Only a single company makes EuV steppers (ASML), EuV mask blanks made by only HOYA etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is, they both have a year or more of backlog prototype tech/designs/improvements. They tap into that tech as needed to provide reasonable generational improvements.</p>
<p>They figure out where they land on their next generation by figuring out the required research and development cost theyd need to pour into the new production cost, the cost of production and materials, and their estimated revenue.</p>
<p>In the case of intel, they havent moved from 14nano meter production because it didnt make sense financially. They didnt have competition until recently, they have/had an absolutely dominant market share. So intel was pushing out conservative 5%-10% performance increases this last 4 generations.</p>
<p>Intel/amd are capable of production at the 5nm level but itd be so costly, theyd lose market share and profit margin. If they both poured in all theyre research and tech into a product, they wouldnt know if theyd have anything to keep them financially secure in 3-5 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intel screwed themselves on process improvements because they essentially gutted their engineering group, resulting in setback after setback for their 7nm node (equivalent to other's 5nm). They're using 10nm++ at this point (equivalent to other's 7nm). I think they only use 14nm for their older/less demanding chips. They never stopped working on 7nm but the upper management cut their engineering group so much which resulted in a massive brain drain to other firms including Apple. </p>
<p>AMD is fabless, they spun off their fabs years ago to Global Foundries. So they don't have a horse in the process race anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though when there's literally only two companies competing, I do find myself wondering how likely it is they honestly just talk to each other and work together for their mutual benefit. Something like an agreement to never exceed 50% increase from their top card of the previous generation so they can drag out the incremental improvements before we hit the wall of not being able to shrink pathways any further doesn't sound impossible to me, but this is of course wild speculation. I could see it either way.</p></div>		</li>
