<p>A lot of people here are talking about more oxygen. This is a good thing for bigger bugs, but for everything else, the answer is actually more related to CO2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention the fact that oxygen levels weren’t really much higher than today’s for much of the time that the dinosaurs were alive. In many instances, it was actually lower. The age of giant insects (and other arthropods) was a long time before this during the Carboniferous, when oxygen levels were through the roof. </p>
<p>Anyone reading should lookup up Meganeura (giant dragonfly), Pulmonoscorpius (giant scorpion), and Arthropleura (giant millipede) to see examples. All of those existed in the forests and swamps of what is now modern day Scotland, though it’s important to note that this was all many millions of years before the dinosaurs firs appeared. </p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://i.imgur.com/k1h7B19.png" target="_blank">this graph of atmospheric oxygen over the Phanerozoic</a> (the Mesozoic is from about 252 to 66 million years ago on the x-axis; for reference today’s oxygen levels are about 21% of atmospheric composition) and <a href="http://theconversation.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-oxygen-18954" target="_blank">this article</a> for more info on the history of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Gigantism of certain dinosaurs was not to do with oxygen levels in the atmosphere, and more to do with their lungs, metabolisms, and a certain amount of evolutionary pressure to not get eaten by large predators. Not all dinosaurs were large either, there were plenty of small ones.</p>
<p>You raise a good point about dinosaur lungs, which are very much a part of certain dinosaur gigantism and a very active area f research in paleobiology today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And avian respiration is very much more efficient than mammalian. Where our lungs act like bellows filling and unfilling avian respiration works in a closed-loop where the air is constantly being pulled through it allowing for more oxygen extraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we are limited for our own mammalian DNA. Sauropods, fishes and birds lay eggs the size of a football ball and call it a day. After a few years, that football-size egg turns into a 100 ton dinosaur. Mammals, however, carry the offspring until it's born, so mommy has to carry her giant weight + the baby during several months. Just ask your mom how she was handling you near the 9th month. It wasn't a walk through the park. </p>
<p>Now imagine elephants and their 20 something months of pregnancy, Paraceratherium (largest land mammal that we know of) that had one baby every time after who knows how much, and blue whales. Argentinosaurus, Pelagornis and Megalodon never had that issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that for mammals the size is related to the climate. Larger mammals for colder climates. What drives this is cooling - the ratio of body mass to surface area. You want a higher ratio, i.e. bigger animal, to keep warm and a smaller ratio to cool off. So humans may have killed them off, but a warmer climate probably keeps the sizes smaller as well.</p></div>		</li>
