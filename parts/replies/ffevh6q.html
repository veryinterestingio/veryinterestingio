			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming traction is the issue, moon snakes might be our largest problem... Unless they miss their first strike, because then they're just sorta floating there; but eventually it would make them super precise because all the inaccurate once would be caught - eventually leading to a super deadly species of moon snake.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think this is correct. The speed at which you run is determined by two factors, step length and step frequency.</p>
<p>On the moon, you'd have a much longer step length due to the reduced gravity allowing you to float through the air.</p>
<p>But you also need to maintain a high step frequency so you can't go too high off the ground.</p>
<p>The trick would be to run in such a manner that you stay low to the ground while moving forwards, so you'd probably want to run angled forward a lot and low to the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But increase step length requires more horizontal acceleration. Which requires more force. That requires more traction. </p>
<p>You could very slowly creep up on a higher speed over a long distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can just leap into the air and maintain a decent speed that way.  You don't need to constantly recontact the ground if each of your steps is several meters long and your average speed is relatively high whilst &quot;airborne&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
