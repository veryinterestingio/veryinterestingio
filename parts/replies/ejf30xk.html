			<div class="markdown"><p>They also have some cool muscle fibers called asynchronous muscle that actually pulls on the exoskeleton of the bee rather than the wing itself. So bees (and other members of the order hymenoptera such as wasps and ants) actually pull their exoskeleton down and allow it to bounce back rather than pulling both ways. This makes their flight incredibly efficient and allows them to flap their wings much faster than a butterfly does. Pretty crazy stuff!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is, but it's not related to its wings: Insects don't have lungs which actively pump air, instead they have small holes in their body through which air can passively move, called trachae. This system works for small insects, but very large insects would have a hard time getting enough oxygen into their system this way. </p>
<p>There are actually fossils of dragonflies with wingspans of more than half a meter, which are now long extinct. Back in their time, the air was more oxygen rich, which made trachae more effective.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, is why there was megafauna then and not now?  Because individual animals on the food chain were bigger because higher O2 levels sustained larger bugs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does not really answer the question. I am not asking why larger insects have proportionally larger wings. I am asking why butterflies and moths have larger wings than many other insects of comparable size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smaller wings allow for greater maneuverability, but the trade off is that they are less efficient. Vice versa for larger wings. Butterflies don't have to hunt down prey like, say, dragonflies, so they don't need to be that quick and agile. And unlike bees, who usually stay in range of their hive, butterflies often migrate large distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some butterflies seasonally migrate and the larger wings would make it easier for them to travel greater distances. When compared to dragonflies, which are probably just as large when only the bodies are measured, have less surface area of wings. I'm not sure about moths, but I would assume that it has to do with their flight habits like the butterfly. Smaller faster wings are useful for speed and larger wings for agility, distance/energy conservation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a solid theory. Dragonflies are predators and need to be quick and agile, and they have a short life span in a small territory. Butterflies just float around looking for flowers and some species migrate where their larger floaty wings will conserve a lot of energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect there is some trade-offs -   energy to fly vs appearance /  mate attraction, vs defense (such as beetles) I think Butterflies and Moths have that Mate/camouflage going on?</p></div>		</li>
