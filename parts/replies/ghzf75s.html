<p>if notes were crayons, you can mix blue and yellow crayons and make a nice green color; you can mix red and yellow to make orange; but most crayons mixed make poopy brown colors.</p>

<p>The problem with the crayon analogy is that if you mix red and scarlet, you get something in between red and scarlet. If you mix 440 and 441, you get very off-putting nasty beat frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear you but I'd say the main problem is this is something five year olds can't understand. Couldn't think of something better on the fly. Discussing music theory and audio science in kindergarten? op's question wouldn't come up until at least middle school, even then, when do kids start learning circle of fifths or logarithms? I don't remember learning anything about waves/frequency until 11th grade physics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading through lots of these, I like this explanation the best. The combination of ‚Äúthese things‚Äù maybe create something that isn‚Äôt as pleasing as ‚Äúthese other things‚Äù. Very easy to understand as a dumb üëçüèº</p></div>		</li>
