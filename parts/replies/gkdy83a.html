			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes some things more resistant?  For example, car paint doesn’t fade (or at least not very quickly). Reds and blues seem to fade very quickly compared to other colors. And this may be totally dumb to ask, but “natural” colors, like green leaves or flowers, don’t fade at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well first of all, any living things appear to be unaffected because they are able to repair themselves. Their cells get damaged by the sun and are then replaced with new cells.</p>
<p>As far as other materials resistance, basically they are designed to hold up better by being made with stronger and denser materials. It's the same reason lead can protect you from xrays while your clothes can't (like at the dentist when they make you wear the heavy vest). </p>
<p>Left long enough in the sun and everything will eventually fade. Take a look at some old cars that haven't been repainted and you'll definitely see fading.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is one of the reasons for using a clear coat. It protect the paintjob. The clear coating get damaged over time as well, but can be fixed with polishing, while if the paint get damaged you'll many times need to repaint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern paints and Clear in particular have UV blocking components that retard fading quite a lot longer than without.  That said, even those still fade or discolor, perfect situation is if you remove (or it removes itself) a badge or door rub strip and you can clearly see the outline and no amount of polishing will make it completely disappear.</p>
<p>Some colors are more color fast, but even white discolors in the Sun so it will turn yellow, think ivory, rather than a vivd white</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going from red to violet in the spectrum the light gets more energetic. Red paint reflects red and absorbs the others so it is absorbing the high energy light which causes more fading. Blue / violet paint reflects those colours and absorbs the lower energy light which causes less fading. That's the story for pure colours, most paints are complex mixes so different colours will fade differently.</p>
<p>It's a nice visual effect of quantum mechanics, but I can't explain that to a 5!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color is caused by specific chemical compounds (pigments). The sunlight breaks down some of these compounds, essentially bleaching them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most organic compounds are white, because you need specific molecular structures to interact with light in ways that make bright colors instead of just scattering all visible light equally (white).  So if you have an organic compound with such a specific structure, and it breaks down, just by random chance it's unlikely that the breakdown product would be one of the rare colored compounds.  </p>
<p>It's kind of like how if you have a musical instrument that plays a specific tone, and then you smash it with a hammer, it's unlikely that the fragments will also make a specific tone.</p></div>		</li>
