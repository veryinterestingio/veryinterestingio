			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren’t 100% sterile. Which is why we only send the probes to the most inhospitable parts of Mars and keep them very far away from the areas where we think might have liquid water and life. Which of course makes the search for life very difficult. Is kind of a catch 22. We want to find it, but we’re scared of touching it, so we don’t go looking too hard. Or you could say we make it harder than it has to be. Idk.</p>
<p>But if we did detect life on mars, it probably would be hotly debated whether or not it came from earth. Same for Europa or wherever. Probably require genetic sequencing and such to prove conclusively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth mentioning that despite no 100% certainty, NASA is meticulous about every single part being cleaned thoroughly, on top of the temperatures, the vacuum of space and cosmic radiation that the probes travel through on the journey to Mars. And that's just to get there. The composition of the soil, the UV radiation, pressure and so on, on the surface is very deadly, few meters under the surface would be more likely.. but it'd be hard to get it there by accident. But this is just one side of the coin. On the other, the microbes that may potentially exist on Mars and the ones that could come from the environment where the assembly takes place on Earth.. would very unlikely be anywhere close to being the same. If life exists on Mars, it already found a way to adapt. Maybe not even carbon based, more likely underground, esp. if a liquid water reservoir exists. If we brought life to Mars and it adapted, you would have evidence of recent evolutions to adapt. I don't think it would be a topic of hot debate in terms of wether its Martian or not - rather debate on the consequences of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if we found some microbe on Mars in 1000 years. Earthlike DNA, but unlike anything we've seen. </p>
<p>It would be possible it was some extremophile that survived the trip and adapted. Unlikely, of course. But it's less likely that it's originally from Mars and we share DNA in a general sense. </p>
<p>It's not about tomorrow. It's about the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be debated. For two reasons. First, just because it's a polarizing issue. There are a lot of people who would vehemently deny it's extraterrestrial, regardless of the evidence, and there are others who would immediately jump to it being extraterrestrial, again regardless of the evidence. And these groups can be very vocal, so even if they're in the minority, they will garner lots of attention and make it a topic of debate until the evidence is truly overwhelming. Just look at events like Tabby's star and Oumuamua, with all the people screaming aliens. People believe what they want and can make issues out of it. We still debate climate change, despite the evidence.</p>
<p>Second, and more importantly, Mars is very far away and our equipment there is limited. And will be for the foreseeable future. While you are right that there would likely be very noticeable differences, we likely won't be ABLE to notice these differences. Like, even just putting it under a microscope is difficult. We'd most likely be working off of just chemical analysis and very grainy photos to start with and gradually get more and more info as we sent better/different equipment for tests. This preliminary data may give a clear indication of origin, but going back to point #1, if there is ANY other explanation (which there almost always is) then people will argue it until we've completely ruled out those other explanations.</p>
<p>And you are right about NASA being meticulous, but I also think it's worth noting that they have different levels of &quot;meticulous&quot; and decide how thoroughly something needs scrubbed based upon the type of work it'd be doing. The vast majority of the equipment they send off is not scrubbed to the best of their abilities because it's just too expensive. They know this equipment has germs on it. Very few, within an &quot;acceptable&quot; margin, which is likely to die on the journey, but definitely still there. Attempting to get rid of all the germs is extremely difficult, can't be guaranteed, and isn't really necessary for most of their research. So they don't bother. That's part of why they again don't go to where martian life is most likely to be, because their own rules and regulations would require the most stringent sterilization procedures which they don't want to dedicate budget funds to. They can get so much more research done by dedicating those funds to the actual equipment instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't be sure that we aren't contaminating other places, but I would think that we would be able to tell the difference between earth life and life that evolved from a completely separate source. We aren't sure what sort of form DNA would take if life evolved differently, if DNA is even used for passing information from one generation to the next. Also, mitochondria have their own DNA since they likely descend from symbiotic internal bacteria. If we found something on Mars with mitochondria, we would know that it's from earth because it would be too much of a coincidence for extraterrestrial life to have organelles with ring-shaped DNA very similar to bacterial DNA. The fact that the mitochondria carry information, and that that information is in the specific form of DNA, and also happens to be ring-shaped, is one of thousands of litmus tests for telling if something we find was brought there recently by rovers or if it evolved on Mars for billions of years.</p></div>		</li>
