			<div class="markdown"><p>If you as a government were to run off a billion dollars for some reason and not tell anyone, theoretically, no, it wouldn't have an effect as long as your economy is big enough. Not right away. There are market forces at work, however, as well as more human factors. </p>
<p>If a government were to knock out a batch of money worth a billion dollars, it doesn't matter who they pay with that money, those notes will enter circulation. If enough has  been printed relative to the actual money value, the money supply has increased but the overall value of the currency hasn't, which will lead to inflation. It seems a little mystical, but finance is very responsive to the amount of cash in circulation - the splitting of value issue mentioned above. Every dollar in circulation can be traded for goods and services. If there are suddenly more dollars being handed around, prices will rise because businesses will want them and inflation has begun. If only a little was printed, it might not be noticed. But the more that was printed, the worse it'll be.</p>
<p>The other problem is the rest of the planet. Governmental debt is tracked, budgets are reviewed, and basically international finance keeps close tabs on how every government is doing with its money. If a government were to suddenly start paying off debts, other governments and financial analysts would start looking into how. If revenue hasn't increased, then where is the money coming from? It wouldn't take much for them to come to the conclusion that the money came from nowhere. At that point, not only will inflation kick in (everybody just realized their money is worth less), but that government will be on the receiving end of sanctions and other punitive actions from a lot of world governments and international financial agencies. It'd be bad.</p>
<p>The safer option by far is to just got a little further into debt. For most governments, it's not an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So say theoretically “grandpa Joe” sat his whole life on cash in his home, and the money went unchecked for decades.  Now multiply that by piggy bank money, home stashes etc and hundreds of thousands of homes. </p>
<p>At what point is that money not counted by the government as “in circulation” anymore?
And what’s the effect on the economy once it is reintroduced?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Should probably clarify that 'cash' really just means money, as the majority of money in circulation isn't actually physical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a closed economy (a small town, maybe) with a few people, 10 pounds of potatoes in a market place, and $20 circulating.  The person selling the potatoes is going to charge as much as possible for the potatoes.<br />
The price for potatoes will settle at some hypothetical point depending on the negotiating skills of the people, the amount of hunger, the amount of potatoes, let's say $8 for the 10 pounds of potatoes this week.  </p>
<p>The following week the farmer comes back with 10 pounds of potatoes but a new $10 has entered the closed system, so now there are $30 circulating.   </p>
<p>The farmer is all set to sell the potatoes to last week's buyer for $8, when whoever has the new $10 offers more (is able to comfortably offer more).  The farmer is happy to sell 10 pounds of potatoes for $10 this week.    That's inflation. </p>
<p>More money chasing the same quantity of resources = inflation.   </p>
<p>Modern monetary theory (MMT) guesses that if inflation is not happening, then probably the resources available in the economy are growing faster than the money supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the first accurate ELI5 of inflation on this thread. The rest are just rubbish.</p>
<p>Printing more money != inflation. Printing more money beyond what the aggregate economic activity can support is what causes inflation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't understand about this model is that no one would offer 10$ for the 8$ potatoes. No one voluntarily spends more on a product. Unless it becomes an auction situation it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>That's why I never understood the concept that more money in the system would increase prices. People don't spend more per item because they have more money. They spend more if they are forced too. </p>
<p>And most of our consumer good aren't necessities at all so they shouldn't be sensitive to those rules of supply and demand.</p>
<p>I could easily see a economic system benifiting from a complete removal of inflation as it would allow the consumer to spend more by having more purchasing power, without having inflation bring it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note that there are 2 causes of inflation.</p>
<p><strong>1. Printing Money Zimbabwe Style:</strong> This one's easy to understand--the government devalues its currency by printing cash. The internet <em>loves</em> this one, because it's easy to imagine Jerome Powell just flooring the &quot;inflation throttle&quot; to screw over the working man. </p>
<p>But in industrialized economies, increasing the money supply doesn't usually cause prices to rise. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=qvvF" target="_blank">Here's a graph of all the money in the United States vs. inflation</a>. The money supply grows <em>way</em> faster than prices. </p>
<p><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=qvw3" target="_blank">Here's a more recent view--since the 2008 crisis, the amount of money in the US has more than doubled. Prices have increased 22%.
</a></p>
<p>And <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=qvvO" target="_blank">here's a chart comparing how fast cash is being printed in the US vs. how fast prices are rising</a>--there's no direct connection. </p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money" target="_blank">The Velocity of Money</a> (aka, Aggregate Demand):</strong> Internet commenters don't like to talk about this one, because it's an unsatisfying correlation. The Fed doesn't decide how fast money moves around, except very indirectly through manipulating short-term interest rates. It's just kind of an &quot;animal spirits&quot; thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It also starts to get really fuckin complicated when you get into that because you start stumbling across shit like the paradox of thrift among others. (And if you stumble down the rabbit hole you quickly realize why econ is a soft science)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But at a time when governments all around the world are trying to infuse liquidity into their respective economies with debt, who's to buy it all?  In the last economic crisis, AFAIK mostly China bought our debt.  But China is still suffering economically as are countries all throughout Europe.  What stops a global bond rate bidding war from occurring when the world is cash-strapped and money-hungry?</p></div>		</li>
