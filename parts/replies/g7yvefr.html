			<div class="markdown"><p>A real fun one is the religion of the Basques. They were notoriously difficult to convert where one missionary actually converted to <em>their</em> religion. Eventually, the Spanish Inquisition destryoed that bit of culture.</p>
<p>In Basque religion, they worshipped the goddess Mari. She had something to do with how Basque Country has so many mountains, if I recall. Every time one climbs a mountain, they place a rock on a pile for Mari. It's been awhile but I thought you were supposed to take the rock from the base.</p>
<p>Well, once Christianity came, they just turned Mari into Maria, Jesus' mother. The continued some of these &quot;innocuous&quot; traditions but basically lied and said it was about Maria the whole time lmao. I know Basque people who still do this rock thing to this day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My sister used to watch a lot of telenovelas (south and central American and Spanish). And I always found it weird when I heard the characters pray to Jesus' mother. I assume that Jesus's mother has a big influence on the Spanish speaking world?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mari is one of the main goddess in Hindu mythology too. South Indian god. But even the South Indian people who followed folk religions were converted to Hindus. During Mughal/British invasion anyone except Muslim, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist is set as default to Hindu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. But the problem is it's a bit difficult to categorise Hinduism as an organised mono relegion. So it's not completely right to say they converted to hinduism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are, you have it the other way around. What was once believed as elves and sprites were changed into the Christian idea of angels and so forth. It's like how Halloween was a celtic holiday and Christianized to focus on the dead saints instead of the ghosts and spirits of the nether realms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the Celts did not influence ancient Hebrew religion. That is an absurd conspiracy theory. The Hebrew Old Testament has angels in it, and it was written well before Christianity even existed, let alone before the conversion of Celts thousands of kilometres away from Israel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Judaism is the origin of the Christian concept of angels, and it dates waaay back. It cannot originate from Norse or Celtic beliefs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also important to note that “Christianized” doesn’t mean canonizes.</p>
<p>If there’s a “Christian equivalent” of Frea that doesn’t mean Frea is canon to Christians, it just means that people in some area culturally associate Frea with the Bible now.</p></div>		</li>
