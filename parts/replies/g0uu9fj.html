			<div class="markdown"><p>From the large univariate and multivariate analysis:</p>
<p>On univariate analysis, there was no association between blood type and any of the peak inflammatory markers (peak WBC, p = 0.25; peak LDH, p = 0.40; peak ESR, p = 0.16; peak CRP, p = 0.14) nor between blood type and any of the clinical outcomes of severity (admission p = 0.20, ICU admission p = 0.94, intubation p = 0.93, proning while intubated p = 0.58, ECMO p = 0.09, and death p = 0.49). After multivariable analysis, blood type was not independently associated with risk of intubation or death (referent blood type A; blood type B: AOR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.42–1.26, blood type AB: AOR: 0.78, CI: 0.33–1.87, blood type O: AOR: 0.77, CI: 0.51–1.16), rhesus factor positive (Rh+): AOR: 1.03, CI: 0.93–1.86. Blood type A had no correlation with positive testing (AOR: 1.00, CI: 0.88–1.13), blood type B was associated with higher odds of testing positive for disease (AOR: 1.28, CI: 1.08–1.52), AB was also associated with higher odds of testing positive (AOR: 1.37, CI: 1.02–1.83), and O was associated with a lower risk of testing positive (AOR: 0.84, CI: 0.75–0.95). Rh+ status was associated with higher odds of testing positive (AOR: 1.23, CI: 1.003–1.50). Blood type was not associated with risk of intubation or death in patients with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Me:  one thing that I feel should be pointed out here is that interpreting findings of no significant correlation is very different than interpreting highly significant findings.  Just because we don’t have significant does not mean the variables are not highly correlated.  Especially with some of the inflammatory markers showing p valises of close to 0.1 .  This is the statistical difference between a ten percent chance that we accept something random as an effect and a 5 % chance (p of .05).</p>
<p>Today’s scientific world is very caught up in showing significance, but even non significant relationships are worth talking about and even being used as evidence supporting hypotheses.  Essentially what this means is that we need more data and more studies to figure it out.  It is strong evidence, however, that the initial worries that casualties of certain blood types would be much higher proportionally than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. This is from the first article you have linked here:</p>
<p>“An intriguing finding from the MGH researchers was that there appeared to be a greater chance of people with blood types B and AB who were Rh+ testing positive for the virus. Even stronger evidence was assembled by the team that symptomatic people with blood type O were less likely to test positive. “These findings need to be further explored to determine if there is something inherent in these blood types that might potentially confer protection or induce risk in individuals,” says Dua.”</p>
<p>This study seems to indicate the severity is not associated with the blood group, but the chances of non-O blood groups testing positive are greater than O.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What confuses me still is, do these 44% continue to have no symptoms throughout their infection? It looks from the link like this figure is just based on a random point in time sampling and they did not follow up to see if these asymptomatic carriers later developed symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know how the study followed up with asymptomatic patients? Like since it is probably based on 2nd hand data, is that a <em>20% reported back that they developed symptoms and we assume the other 80% didn’t</em> or is that a <em>’we did a follow up screen and 80% remained asymptomatic’</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The WHO drew attention to this problem of calling people asymptomatic when, in all likelihood, someone with a high viral load whose not showing symptoms at a particular moment in time is actually pre-symptomatic. </p>
<p>It was mostly American epidemiologists that attacked them, forcing them to change the message to “well we aren’t sure”. </p>
<p>But you’re right to be skeptical. High viral load will almost always lead to symptoms with something like a coronavirus, and it’s odd that we are forgetting that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It said in the paper that about 20% of the asymptomatic group went on to develop symptoms. Granted, this was 21/110 people so the numbers observed were still on the smaller side</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am listening to Radiolab podcast “invisible allies”, which tells of early research into vitamin D deficiencies and its effect on COVID-19.
Homeless shelters have statistically high cases of asymptomatic cases.  They theorize that they spend more time outside and get more vitamin D.
Really interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to an article from the NY Times that is probably paywalled (and I don't have access), was reprinted in The Buffalo news on Aug. 5: the immune system response is grouped into three categories each using cytokines. Type 1 would be the proper one to fight Covid, but in people who struggle with the disease, the immune system seems unable to concentrate on that type, and pours resources into Types 2 and 3 as well.</p></div>		</li>
