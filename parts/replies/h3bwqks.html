<p>People see AC as a 'luxury'. The problem is in many parts of the world it is a requirement. You can't 'swamp cool' you way out of 95% humidity and 100F.</p>
<p>I'm always troubled remembering when a heat wave struck Paris and hundreds died. They couldn't handle the heat/infrastructure to shed it, and people (mostly the elderly and isolated) died for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know how people can stand not having AC in FL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend from high school changed his college choice to FSU at the last minute and was only able to get into a dorm that had no AC. It was ridiculous. We joked that every time we called him to go do anything, his response was always, &quot;Yeah, sure, just let me take a shower...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with ya. I've traveled a lot of parts of the world and hottest and most uncomfortable I was was in Florida.</p>
<p>I'm walking around Qatar in a suit, it's 119F (as measured by a temp probe), and I'm fine. Florida, I'm sopping mess in shorts and tshirt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hottest I ever felt was Berlin in summer 2019. It’s just a place that is not prepared for heat—thick walls, stone, not much AC, sizing and materials all made for ice ages. Cool place but brutal in a heat wave</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>? I can't speak for San Diego, but LA is hot as hell in the summer, particularly once you're away from the beach, and once you're into the inland empire, then the deserts, you're well over 100/120 even (the valley is 100+ as well). dry is better than damp, but it's still fucking hot. even june gloom doesn't bring much respite in the city. a/c is everywhere, and it's a necessity. most of so cal is desert...</p>
<p>I remember being out in the middle of the high desert as a kid (campsite) and only having a swamp cooler. about the only thing it did was make the air heavy and damp. yuck.</p>
<p>side note:  when I came to nz I was surprised that shops didn't have ac. trying on clothes when you're sweaty is no bueno.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of both. Is my understanding of how it works wrong (ie: do air con configurations actually use more energy), and what is driving both the negative view of air cons and positive view of heat pumps (ie: why are they not both good or both bad)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People in cooler climes believe they are better than people in warmer climes. People who have industrial jobs think their lifestyle is superior to people who have agricultural jobs. People who don't have to sweat for a living call people who do wetbacks and rednecks (a historical misnomer). People who use a technology to stay warm disparage the same technology when others use it to stay cool.</p></div>		</li>
