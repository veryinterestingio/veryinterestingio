			<div class="markdown"><p>This has me curious, how does the payout work. It can't just divide the money evenly amongst the winners, then there's no point in even betting high, because chances are you'll be retuned less. How does that all work?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The whole point in the exercise is that the bookies are playing the long game: They know that the matchup isn't a 2:1 matchup, and they are more likely to get their money than pay you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A smart bookie gets paid no matter who wins because they tune the odds correctly to get the right amount of money on each side of the bet.</p>
<p>If you have 2:1 odds for one fighter and 1:2 odds for the other (by necessity), then ideally you would have twice as much money bet on the latter than the former. That way, no matter who wins, you break even.</p>
<p>The trick is just slightly worsening both odds so that they don’t cancel out like that and the overall payout for either winner is less than the total amount that you took in bets.</p>
<p>The job is knowing how to balance the odds so that all of the money doesn’t go in one direction or the other (leaving you on the hook if that bet wins) and knowing how much to “skim” off the top of the odds so that the bets are still attractive but you can make your money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always thought the entire pool of money was distributed to winners weighted by their bets, minus a % that would go to the bookie thing.</p>
<p>Do they figure out the odds beforehand? And if so, how?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>?? Bookies make money from the losers, their take, and carefully calculated odds.... The bookie, like a casino, doesn't lose, otherwise they'd just be another gambler in the crowd and their business would end very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others said, you're betting against the house. What i haven't seen explained is that the house has an &quot;infinite&quot; bankroll or amount of cash to payout winners. It's like going to a casino and betting on a roulette number. Sometimes the casino pays you a lot of money (which they have in reserve), but over a long time you are guaranteed to lose because of how the odds are set (specific to each game, or in this case, fight).  </p>
<p>As a simple example for a fight, let's say the fighters are about even. The odds might be 1.1:1 for both fighters. Not 1:1. This means you need to bet 1.10 dollars to win 1.00 dollars if you are correct. Over many of these fights, some people will win overall, some will lose, but the house will always makes money since it averages out to be a 10% profit for them.   </p>
<p>This assumes the fight really was a 50-50 chance. The casino or fight organizer has experts to decide the odds. If you are smarter than their odds makers, you can win long term. But they are very smart and have lots of computers these days... But if somehow, for example, you knew one fighter had a stomach flu, and for some reason no one else knew this, then you could be expected to make money since the odds wouldn't have been set right by the experts that didn't know about the stomach flu.</p></div>		</li>
