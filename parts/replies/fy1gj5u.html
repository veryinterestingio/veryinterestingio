<p>The pitch you perceive comes from the dominant one, the strongest (loudest) in the bunch. </p>

<p>That's false.  The pitch you percieve depends on what pitch the harmonic series you're hearing is related to.  Example: a low E on a bass guitar often has NO fundamental, but we can still hear that it's a low E because the harmonics are all related to the low E.</p>
<p>Another example, low notes played through a phone speaker will have almost no fundamental, because phone speakers cannot reproduce those low frequencies.  That generally doesn't change the perceived pitch of the instruments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further this point, organ builders will use this trick to make stops that sound lower without having to build super-enormous pipes, which can get pretty expensive. Combining a stop at 16' pitch (sidenote- organ pipes' pitches are listed as the length of the pipe which sounds the lowest note on the keyboard, two octaves below middle C. An 8' stop is the same pitch as a piano, a 16' stop is an octave below that) and one at 10 2/3' pitch (a fifth above 16' pitch) creates a &quot;resultant&quot; or &quot;acoustic&quot; sound at 32' pitch (an octave below 16'). The 16' and 10 2/3' reinforce the 2nd and 3rd harmonics of the 32' fundamental, giving the listener the impression of hearing a lower tone than is actually being produced!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually isn't because of the harmonics themselves; what you actually pick up is the difference in frequency between the harmonics. For example, say your fundamental is 41Hz (a low E). There will be harmonics at 82, 123, etc. You hear 123-82=41Hz. </p>
<p>Technically, u/itsmemarcot is correct; the fundamental frequency determines the pitch, but not because of its own presence but rather by determining the spacing between harmonics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think there's a practical difference between this statement and mine, since your ear isn't actually doing math in that sense.</p>

<p>That's not what he said though.  He said the &quot;strongest (loudest)&quot; frequency, not the fundamental.  You basically summarized my comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fundamental frequency isn't necessarily the loudest. Consider this: you have a synthesizer playing a sustained note, using a harmonically rich waveform such as a sawtooth. By itself, the fundamental frequency of the sawtooth wave is louder than the harmonics.</p>
<p>Now, apply a resonant high-pass filter to it, one with a steep slope, and set the cutoff frequency somewhere above the sawtooth wave's fundamental frequency. The filter will attenuate (reduce the amplitude of) frequencies below its cutoff frequency, which means the fundamental will have its amplitude reduced. The filter resonance will amplify any frequencies in the signal that are at/close to the cutoff frequency. If the filter has a steep slope, and the resonance is high, the fundamental frequency of the sawtooth wave will no longer be the loudest. However, it will still sound like the same pitch, because the brain can infer the fundamental frequency of a sound from its harmonics.</p></div>		</li>
