</blockquote>
<p>There've been studies recently that indicate that this is real (previous thinking was that it may not have been), and that it may indicate that the measles virus attacks the immune system in a much more direct way than we thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why measles vaccination is so essential and why it protects against more deaths than just measles. We now know that measles attacks immune system memory cells, which is really, really bad. This can make every common cold as dangerous as a SARS-CoV2 infection. People can and do die from run of the mill respiratory viruses after having measles. This probably has something to do with why measles grants lifelong immunity. In scientific terms, the immune system says, &quot;Nope, not going through that again.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, but getting more doses gives you immunity for a longer period of time. In fact, even after three doses your immunity may or may not wear off after a number of years, I had to get a second round of vaccination to do research with HBV after my initial three doses as an infant, as my antibody titer was back to base levels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nowadays most vacations inly need 2 shots, not 3 as 50 years of stats have shown that to normally be enough.
For viri and bacteria your first immuno response will create IgM antibodies that are reasonably large and look surprisingly like 5 IgG’s hooked up like a snowflake.
Your second (and later) response(s) will create IgG antibodies that look like a Y and are a lot smaller. It’s the memory of these IgG antibodies that you want. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the size of these 2 antibody types are why rhesus disease doesn’t hit the first kid: IgM is too large to pass through the placenta but IgG does. the antidote is actually antibodies against those antibodies.</p>
<p>Edit: IgM is like driving lessons and IgG is actual solo driving experience. You’d probably be fine going out on the road when you just have your license but a bit of experience is nice to have.</p></div>		</li>
