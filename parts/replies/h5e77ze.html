			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good point. The reason it doesn't cause cardiovascular issues is due to the way the heart muscle grows. When we think of muscular growth, say of the biceps, we typically think of &quot;concentric&quot; hypertrophy: the muscle becomes <em>thicker</em>. When heart muscle experiences concentric hypertrophy, the chamber volume decreases. The smaller volume means that the heart can't pump as much blood with each beat, which is bad.</p>
<p>So, if concentric hypertrophy is bad for our heart, then how does it get stronger? Turns out that our heart gets stronger mainly due to &quot;eccentric&quot; hypertrophy: the muscle fibers get <em>longer</em> as opposed to thicker. Eccentric hypertrophy of the heart does not entail a decrease in the chamber volume since the walls don't get thicker, and is as such not 'bad' for our heart.</p>
<p>As with my first reply, this is also a simplified answer. An improved heart function has to do with so much more than just improving raw heart strength, e.g. diastolic function (how good the heart is at relaxing during diastole, the hearts elastic recoil and so on).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if an athlete stops training for a long time, I assume their heart will shrink back down?
Or does their heart remain big, but just gets less efficient (so old athletes have oversized, lazy hearts)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to your point about improved diastolic function, it’s worth noting that the left ventricle gets perfused in diastole (right ventricle gets perfused in systole and diastole).  So athletes have very efficient diastolic function and thus, augmented filling of their coronary arteries, which helps offset some of the potential issues with ventricular hypertrophy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots and lots and <strong>lots</strong> of studies that usually aim to investigate one narrow part of the body under some specific condition.
