			<div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has a “vomiting center” that receives nerve impulses from the stomach/small intestine. Many triggers, both chemical (poisons, infections (stomach viruses), etc...) and physical (distention, outlet obstruction, etc...) that irritate the stomach induce signals that go from the abdomen to that area in the brain to begin the cascade known as nausea and subsequently, vomiting. Many cancers that have brain metastases can affect the vomiting center in the brain to also stimulate this cascade to happen without any problems in the GI tract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vague nerve can transmit signals that induce nausea, but it’s a bit more complicated than that, and that isn’t my specialty in medicine so I hesitate to go into more detail without looking it up and accidentally giving you false information. Sorry!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that no neural circuit is perfect. Pain is stratified into somatic (superficial, outer) and visceral pain (inner, relates to organs), and neuropathic (nerve related). Visceral pain sends nerve signals to the brain that activates many brain centers. Severe pain causes such intense activation of these nerves that many spots in the brain are activated, and it can also activate the vomiting center. That is put very simply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiple pathways can lead to vomiting. For example, the area postrema or chemoreceptor trigger zone is a part of the nervous system where the blood-brain barrier is tenuous which makes it capable of sensing noxious stimuli in the blood; the vagus nerve transmits signals about noxious stimuli in the stomach to the vomiting center...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several answers to this question. The big one is that a heavy workout you’re not used to (if you’re not in shape) exhausts your muscles. Your muscles need oxygen to work, This is called aerobic respiration. The harder you work your muscles, the more oxygen you need, and once the oxygen runs out, your muscles resort to anaerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration produces a byproduct called lactic acid. Lactic acid and carbon dioxide (CO2) both build up in your blood and cause your blood to trend toward being more acidic, lowering your blood pH. </p>
<p>If you remember, the stomach has stomach acid in it, which has a very low pH. One of your body’s regulatory mechanisms for dealing with low pH due to the lactic acid and CO2 is to breathe heavily and rapidly (getting rid of the CO2 as gas through your lungs). However, this is not always enough, and as acids build up, it can induce nausea for the second mechanism your body has to get rid of acid- which is to vomit, because vomiting gets rid of acid quickly and it is a natural mechanism of homeostasis your body has developed. This is a simpler response that has a more complex physiology, and there are other factors at play as well.</p></div>		</li>
