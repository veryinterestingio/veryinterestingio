<p>Apologies for my ignorance, but I was under the impression you get the vaccine so you <em>don’t</em> get measles?</p>
<p>Does the vaccine just lower the chances of getting measles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant the entire vaccine schedule that you receive throughout your childhood. Mumps, chicken pox, HPV, etc.</p>
<p>Let’s say you already received the chicken pox and polio vaccines at 2 years old, and you’re supposed to get your measles vaccine at 5. At 3 years old you contract measles, and survive. Would the doctors have to re-administer the chicken pox and polio vaccines after you recover from measles, since the disease has “wiped” your immunity to those two diseases?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think any vaccine is 100% effective, and the effectiveness of each vaccine varies quite a bit. So yes, even after receiving the measles vaccine you’re still somewhat susceptible to measles</p></div>		</li>
