<p>The first is saccadic movement. This is the fast, voluntary movement you use to 'lock onto' an object.</p>

<p>Interestingly, saccadic movement is a fine motor skill that can be trained.  Educators are increasingly looking into the impact of saccadic movement on reading, such as:</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Background. Eye movements are necessary for the physical act of reading and have been shown to relate to underlying cognitive and visuoattentional processes during reading. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of saccadic training using the King-Devick remediation software on reading fluency. Methods. In this prospective, single-blinded, randomized, crossover trial, a cohort of elementary students received standardized reading fluency testing pre- and posttreatment. Treatment consisted of in-school training 20 minutes per day, 3 days per week for 6 weeks. Results. The treatment group had significantly higher reading fluency scores after treatment (P &lt; .001), and posttreatment scores were significantly higher than the control group (P &lt; .005). Conclusion. Saccadic training can significantly improve reading fluency. We hypothesize that this improvement in reading fluency is a result of rigorous practice of eye movements and shifting visuospatial attention, which are vital to the act of reading.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The present study examined thevisual scanning hypothesis, which suggests that fluent oculomotor control is an important component underlying the predictive relationship between Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) tasks and reading ability. Our approach was to isolate components of saccadic planning, articulation, and lexical retrieval in 3 modified RAN tasks. We analyzed 2 samples of undergraduate readers (ages 17–27). We evaluated the incremental contributions of these components and found that saccadic planning to nonlinguistic stimuli alone explained roughly one third of the variance that conventional RAN tasks explained in eye movements registered during text reading for comprehension. We conclude that the well-established predictive role of RAN for reading performance is in part due to the individual ability to coordinate rapid sequential eye movements to visual nonlinguistic stimuli.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We review the literature on children’s vs. adults’ eye movements during reading. We test two theories of these differences using a model of eye-movement control. Our simulations suggest that linguistic proficiency accounts for these differences. Our conclusion is discussed in relation to development, aging, and reading skill. </p>

You probably didn't realize as a child you turned your head while writing during tabletop tasks. A lot of kids demonstrate eye dominance and neglect their left side (perhaps they asked you to look through a pinhole and look at them) ...this also sometimes presents in individuals with a right sided stoke; they develop something called left neglect or sometime left hemianopsia/field cuts.. On an OT evaluation I test saccades, smooth pursuits, ocular ROM, convergence/divergence, peripheral vision and VOR almost every time and majority of my mentors have been practicing 20+... just no one knows what an occupational therapist is ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add to this that smooth pursuit is usually difficult to do without a target. Normally, we do not need to slowly scan over a static scene. We can get more information from a static scene by making saccadic movements and getting disparate parts of the scene to fall on the fovea. However, smooth pursuit can be trained, and you can learn to smoothly move your eyes across a static scene / without a target to track. </p>
<p>The exception to this is what happens when a moving objects disappears (e.g. goes behind an occluding surface). In that case, we are able to smoothly move our eyes along the extrapolated trajectory of the object, even though there is no longer a target there. However, eye velocity gradually slows down and you often have to make a big saccade to the object when it reappears (or else, if you can expect where it will reappear, you make a big saccade to that location and wait for it to appear there; that is, you either saccade too late (catch-up) or too early). This effect increases with the time that an object remains invisible.</p>
<p>In addition, even when tracking moving objects with smooth pursuit, we are looking slightly behind the object and often have to make &quot;catch up&quot; saccades to jump our eyes forward along the trajectory. </p>
<p>Edit: see below for a longer discussion of some of these points + citations and demos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way that you can train people is with an auditory source that is moving from left to right. Observers can learn to move their eyes at the same, constant speed as the auditory source (Zambarbieri et al. 1981; unfortunately, this is a book chapter and I don't have an internet source; <a href="http://jn.physiology.org/content/90/2/972.short" target="_blank">Madelain and Krauzlis 2003</a>). In general, this is just not a practiced movement and can somewhat be trained like converging (crossing) and diverging (un-crossing) your eyes or fine motor movements with your fingers, as when you learn to play an instrument. In young infants, for example, it has been shown that smooth pursuit is a learned and trained response (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurent_Madelain/publication/222305434_Operant_conditioning_of_the_visual_smooth_pursuit_in_young_infants/links/0fcfd510bd5cb69337000000.pdf" target="_blank">Darcheville et al. 1999</a> &lt;- pdf!; <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027703001665" target="_blank">Rosander and von Hofsten 2004</a>; <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:37804/FULLTEXT01.pdf" target="_blank">Kochukhova and Gredeback 2007</a> &lt;- pdf!)</p>
<p>Re slowing down: This is actually quite complicated and there are a number of factors at work. One is the imprecision in the maintenance and updating of position and representation of target velocity of invisible objects that have been invisible for some time (<a href="http://invibe.net/biblio_database_dyva/woda/data/att/3d6a.file.07946.pdf" target="_blank">Becker and Fuchs 1985</a> &lt;- pdf!; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-005-0101-3" target="_blank">Bennet and Barnes 2006</a>; <a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193196" target="_blank">de Xivry, Missal, and Lefevre 2008</a>). </p>
<p>There is also an effect of misperception of velocity at the moment that an object disappears -- it appears to slow down (see, e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robin_Baures/publication/46404494_Eye_movements_influence_estimation_of_time-to-contact_in_prediction_motion/links/0912f509908c5af17b000000.pdf" target="_blank">Bennet et al. 2010</a> &lt;- pdf!). This can result in some interesting visual illusions (see, e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Evan_Palmer/publication/261441587_The_Aperture_Capture_Illusion_Misperceived_Forms_in_Dynamic_Occlusion_Displays/links/0a85e537103f0c2922000000.pdf" target="_blank">Palmer and Kellman 2014</a> &lt;-pdf!) including shape compression during anorthoscopic perception (seeing an object through a slit; <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698908002320" target="_blank">Aydin, Herzog, and Ogmen 2008</a>; although there is also some effect of object form: <a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193551" target="_blank">Aydin, Herzog, and Ogmen 2009</a> (and in general, there are lots of interesting form-motion interactions)). </p>
<p>I have made some demos of these illusions which you can see <a href="https://gifyu.com/image/Sjj6" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://gifyu.com/image/SjjQ" target="_blank">here</a>. In both cases, the lines are perfectly straight, but at the moment that one of the lines disappears, the other appears misaligned. This is because the part of the line that disappeared now seems to move at a slower speed than the continuously visible line. In the second demo, the effect is enhanced because of the way that the bottom part of the object meets the occluder. (Looks like imgur is having an outage so I used some other random uploader; will move to imgur later.)</p>
<p>There may also be different mechanisms involved for pursuing slow-moving and fast-moving invisible targets that may also interact with target size (<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/p3397" target="_blank">Sokolov and Pavlova 2003</a>). </p>
<p>Finally, there may be other, cognitive factors involved in smooth pursuit. For example, in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-008-1678-0" target="_blank">Makin, Stewart, and Poliakoff (2009)</a> observers learned that objects of different colors moved at different speeds, e.g. red slow and blue fast. Later, they were shown a red object disappearing behind an occluder at a certain speed and a blue object disappearing behind an occluder moving at the same speed. Their eye movements were tracked and used as a measure of how soon they thought the object would reappear from behind the occluder. Despite the fact that both objects were actually moving at the same speed, the fact that they had learned that one moved slowly and the other quickly in a different part of the experiment affected their eye movement patterns (i.e. the expected time when the objects would reappear). See also <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698908003015" target="_blank">Makin et al. 2008</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-010-2313-4" target="_blank">Bennett et al. 2010</a>. This is an example of a cognitive influence on smooth pursuit.

			<div class="markdown"><p>When standing watch in the Navy we were taught to scan the horizon in steps.  Pick a section of ocean and watch it for a few seconds, move a little to the left or right and stop for a few seconds again.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit of a separate point. It is the case that we are more sensitive to motion (and less sensitive to detail) in the periphery as opposed to the fovea because of the larger number of rods and their increased convergence (many rods pooling their signals together). This is why, for example, it's easier to see stars or comets out of the corner of your eye than when looking directly at them. </p>
<p>You can also confirm this by doing a little experiment on yourself. Take your left index finger, point to the right, and hold it a few inches in front of your eyes. Keep your gaze fixed directly ahead and slowly move your finger to the left (out of your field of view).  Keeping your eyes still and staring straight ahead (easier to do if you closer your right eye), at some point, you should no longer be able to see your finger. Now wiggle your finger. Suddenly it should become visible again!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can easily let my gaze &quot;glide&quot; along a straight line (e.g., the edge of a table), as long as my eyes move from <del>left to right</del> right to left.

That's why when you take a look at the clock, the first second on display often seem to last much longer than the following ones - that's because your brain is adding the time of saccade to the first second.</p>

As far as I know the errors in pursuit are similarly small as those fixational eye movements. Thus your brain does not need to do anything differently during pursuit. </p>
<p>BTW: Vision actually profits from fixational eye movements. Stabilized images fade and sensitivity for stabilized stimuli is lower than for moving stimuli. Thus at least on an eye movement level you would not want to be more stable.</p></div>		</li>
