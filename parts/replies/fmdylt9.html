			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny how timely this post is. I had to let out a few good ones in the privacy of my car after I was laid off/state quarantine/beaches and activities closed/no longer fully in control of my own future. </p>
<p>My brain locked on the idea of screaming to get it all out and nothing, but nothing, provided relief until I'd given my vocal cords a rather rough workout. </p>
<p>And, screaming helped. It was strange to not know why it did, but belting out a few good ones helped settle my emotions and move into a different headspace. </p>
<p>Now I know why. Thanks for sharing your knowledge!</p></div>		</li>
