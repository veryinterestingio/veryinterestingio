			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, domestic layer breeds of chickens are efficient little animals! In the most productive breeds a hen can lay over 350 eggs per year during peak production (during their first 1-3 years of laying). Nearly one egg every single day. Though egg production slows down as hens get older.</p>
<p>Some domestic duck breeds are up there as well - Khaki Campbells and Welsh Harlequins from good egg-laying lines can lay 300-350 eggs per year per hen as well during their first few years of laying.</p>
<p>If you don't mind, what do you mean by &quot;simplest food sources&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the falconry centre I volunteer at we get a lot of ex laying quail. It's pretty fascinating because there's usually still half a dozen eggs maturing inside and you can see the yolk, white and shell deposition going on like a production line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is the correct answer.  I am a Poultry Scientist, and have seen plenty of eggs that got cracked early on and mended.  I've even had triple shelled eggs, where for whatever reason the hen retained the egg for several deposition cycles and just kept layering shell on.  I'll add that early on in the shell deposition process the egg can be quite weak, so it's much easier to crack from external forces like the hen having a hard landing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know how similar egg shells are to the zona pellucida of mammalian eggs? In mammals the ZP is involved in fertilization as well as early embryo development before the embryo &quot;hatches&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have much experience with mammalian reproduction, but from a google search it seems they are not at all similar.  The ZP seems to be a protein membrane that binds sperm and aids in fertilization, while in birds by the time the eggshell is being formed the egg has already been fertilized and there would be no way for sperm to penetrate the shell as it is a lattice of crystallized calcium carbonate.  When an egg yolk is &quot;dropped&quot; into the oviduct it gets fertilized first, then the albumen is formed around the yolk, then the shell membrane is created, and finally the shell itself is deposited.  The vitelline membrane (membrane directly around the yolk, under the albumen) would probably be the closest analogue to the ZP.</p></div>		</li>
