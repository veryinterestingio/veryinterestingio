			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a 29er and in the lowest gear I almost can't pedal fast enough to stay upright. I've been working on endurance because I want to pedal up my hill (I live about 500 feet above the nearest bus line and walking that hill sucks hard... biking down it is fast and scary but I don't think I can make it up the first 100 foot climb but that's the steepest part. If I make it past that I'd have to upshift for the next section.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At high enough speeds though you want to be low. Centre of gravity and all that. Watch the tour riders when they're doing 100+km/h downhill, these days a lot of them actually get down on the top tube which reduces drag and lowers their CofG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. At a certain slope angle walking becomes more efficient regardless of a perfect gear ratio. The reason is that on a bike you need to apply force to stop you from rolling backward AND provide power to go up. The person walking only needs to provide the latter thanks to the much higher friction between their shoes and the ground.</p>
<p>Imagine sitting on a tricycle with no breaks, and it's in a slope. You need to apply force to the pedals just to remain where you are, otherwise you would roll backward. Imagine the slope angle increasing, then you need more and more force just to remain stationary. A person standing does not experience an increase in force needed to remain there. The friction between sole and ground does the job for him. This extra force required to combat going backward for a cyclist makes the bike less efficient at some point, and that is clearly noticable in real life as OP has experienced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more about momentum. Getting the crank through the dead zone, where it is straight up and down and very little power can be exerted, requires extra power on the power part of the stroke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. I’ve been trying to cycle up a specific hill for several months. Even in the bottom gear my heart rate climbs until it’s unsustainable. I can get off and push the bike up the hill (slowly), or I can get off, wait for my heart rate to come down and then cycle the rest of the way. But as yet I can’t cycle up the whole hill without stopping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the ratio on your bottom gear? If you do something like 22 teeth on the front and 32 teeth on the rear you can bike up damn near any hill that you can walk up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve no idea how many teeth. But the small ring at the front is bigger than the biggest ring at the back, so more like 30:20 than 20:30. It’s a road bike, not a mountain bike. But the issue of whether I can balance the bike while cycling at walking speed does come in to play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the bike. Road bikes have much, much less favorable gear ratios for hills lol. If you were on a mountain bike with a nice gear ratio it should be pretty easy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve cycled up Troodos Mountain without a granny ring so maybe it’s just a biomechanical thing, I’m sure you can ride competently. I’m 6’2” with long legs if that is any difference from your experience, longer levers make it easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sure age and fitness are key, as is the gear ratio. Plenty of other people can cycle up that hill. Maybe one day I will too. I was just disagreeing with the generalized statement that  &quot;If you dropped down to your lowest (Granny) gear, you would be able to contribute with relative ease &quot;. That's not true of all people, on all bikes, on all hills</p></div>		</li>
