			<div class="markdown"><p>I've experienced Alice in Wonderland syndrome a lot as a kid, and now I finally know what the hell that was! Sometimes, it would freak me out so much that my mom could barely calm me down. To this day she keeps bringing up the fact that as a kid I apparently said the phrase 'your head is so small' regularly and it would drive her insane lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this too! I didn't figure out what it was until I was in my twenties. For me it felt like my hands were much too large and like things were moving in slow motion but also too fast at the same time? I don't know, it was weird. But I remember crying and freaking out during one episode and saying to my mom, &quot;you're moving you fast and too slow&quot;. Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, I know this feeling, but only it appears before I get fever. The evening before I fall sick, when I close my eyes, I see all these cylinders in all different colors and sizes rotating too fast and too slow at the same time. They rotate with such a weird speed that I get all dizzy with my eyes closed. Next morning I have fever or similar, most of the times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this explains why i woke up as a kid and got sick because objects in my room was huge and so close to me... it was all just so confusing and dizzy feeling until i sat up and focused on things... then things would go back to normal</p>
<p>Edit: this suck though: Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) is often associated with migraines, brain tumors, or psychoactive drug use. It can also be the initial symptom of the Epstein–Barr virus</p>
<p>Edit2: I really appreciate reddit sometimes,  this post gave me answer to a thing in my life that i didn't really understand... or even were able to describe on words</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever been sleep deprived and it sounds like a person sprinting behind you, quickly shouting in your ear, then disappearing? It’s very rare as I don’t stay up late like this anymore, but I can remember the times it’s happened and it’s pretty creepy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes when I use to play games all day as a teen when I would finally lay down to sleep I would hear sounds and people talking. Use to scare me to think I was going crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds kind of ace in a nuts way. If I played too much doom2 mods for a week I'd have &quot;doom engine&quot; powered dreams and would know that's why.</p>
<p>with Exploding Head Syndrome, I used to imagine a basketball being dribbled (more just bounced in perfect bpm) in an empty indoor basketball court with all the indoor acoustics and echo that implies as I drift to sleep. bounce... bounce.. then one sounds 100% realistic and more than 3 times as loud like it was bounced off my head and that was how I would often jolt awake from 97% asleep at like 11 years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got exploding head syndrome alot as a kid. Never remembered what image I would see when it happened but it would always scare me awake but happened so often I would just wait for the ringing to stop and go back to sleep. It doesn't happen anymore but now I have severe progressive hearing loss. Always wondered if it was contributed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I had a similar thing happening to me. </p>
<p>When I didn't really have a regular day to day schedule and wasn't really tired at the end of the day, but had to sleep anyway, then right before falling asleep I heared these noises in my room and dream vividly of my room. The dreams were so realistic that every detail of my room was correct. There was this person, a person I cared for. It approached me slowly and touched me. The moment it touched me I would wake from horror, because the touch felt so realistic. But then there was nobody after all.</p>
<p>Sadly every so often it happens again and when it does, I'm afraid to go to sleep for the next couple of days. I'm in my 30s, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the &quot;Alice in wonderland&quot; syndrome, if I concentrate on something massive, like thinking about the size of the universe, it feels like my brain is expanding in my head putting pressure on the inside of my eyes/nose/throat, but I'm breathing normally. Equally, if I think about something really really small, like atoms, it feels like I'm suffocating down into myself.</p>
<p>Its definitely a mind trick, but I've never found the right description of it. &quot;Alice in wonderland syndrome&quot; is the closest I can get, mixed with something like extreme empathy, or just a very vivid imagination... any ideas?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thing I have something like this. I can start percieving my whole field of vision as one object, it feels like it is either infinitely expanding or shrinking as close to my face as possible. It is quite scary at times, but I am used to it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking-like you refer to it sounds like contemplating = really taking time, having time, relax, eyes closed, etc; you allow it to become a whole body, senses and mind experience.  The unit of memory = engram and is stored in some 50-100 neural cell mini = concept network. A memory is quite a all round experience : your kids, grandparents, pets - you can recognise them even if you hear, see, smell or catch a hint of them: how they move, smell, shape, tone of voice etc is often enough.  Similarly when you contemplate on small or vaste, your neural concept networks for those kick in and they are not only abstract but recall /are accompanied / there is gateways to other neural concept networks of 50 neural cells close by that hold info on very related topics.
that is close to what happens in rem and NREM sleep cycles where your brain allows new links to be made or severed to make better organised networks :) I’m a cognitive scientist :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first thing sounds like meditation. I don't need to meditate to make it happen, I just have to remember something huge/tiny exists, think about it for some 2-10 seconds and it feels like whatever it is, is in my brain, and my brain expands/contracts to account for the space that thing would take up. Like reading the responses on my own comment have got my brain ballooning and I'm not even trying!</p>
<p>Your details regarding neural networks are certainly interesting, but I'd really appreciate it if you could please ELI5 on how what you're describing relates to what I'm describing... Thank you!!</p></div>		</li>
