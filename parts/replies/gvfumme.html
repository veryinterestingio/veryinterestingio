<p>The west coast of the US?  But the Pacific Northwest has shockingly mild winters, for as far north as it is.  Seattle‚Äôs winters are as warm as places as far south as Oklahoma!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pacific Ocean is a <em>moderating</em> influence. It keeps temperatures from getting too hot in the summer and from getting too cold in the winter. But on average, the water is much cooler along the pacific coast, because the clockwise oceanic current brings water down from the Gulf of Alaska, and it doesn‚Äôt really warm up until it hits the tropics off the coast of Mexico.</p>
<p>That water is relatively cold as far as oceans go (44 degrees off of the Olympic Peninsula in winter, up to 68 degrees off of Southern California in summer), but that‚Äôs enough to keep things relatively cool in summer and relatively warm in winter compared to inland areas that experience far creature temperature swings. </p>
<p>As an example of how much that moderating influence affects things, just look at summer temperatures in places like San Diego, Oceanside, Long Beach, Malibu, Santa Barbara, etc.‚Äîyou‚Äôll notice they‚Äôre quite a bit cooler than places even just a few miles inland on the other side of the Coast Ranges. And ever hear of June Gloom, the infamous ‚Äúmarine layer,‚Äù or Mark Twain‚Äôs statement that the coldest winter he ever experienced was a summer in San Francisco? The reason that coastal California is so foggy and chilly in the summer is because of that cold ocean current. Go to any SoCal beach and you‚Äôll see lots of sunbathers on the sand, but the water will be filled with surfers in wetsuits. You won‚Äôt see too many other people in the water‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs cold.</p>
<p>It goes the other way in the winter. The ocean off of Washington might be 44 degrees, but the thermal energy it gives off keeps the land in western Washington from getting too much colder than that even when the lack of solar heating would otherwise cause land at that latitude to drop to frigid temperatures.</p>
<p>It even works as far north as Anchorage, where the ocean is even colder. Compared to Fairbanks, which is 300 miles further north and also 300 miles inland (with mountains blocking air movement), Anchorage experiences both far milder winters and summers. A cold day in Anchorage is -20 and a hot day is 70, whereas Fairbanks can see -50 and +90, respectively (I‚Äôve been in Fairbanks in the summer and dying for an air conditioner!). The lack of an ocean near Fairbanks to absorb heat in the summer and give off heat in the winter is why it experiences such a greater temperature swing than Anchorage, which is on the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The PNW (Puget Sound) is a bit of an anomaly being sandwiched between the Cascades and the Olympics. This creates a water shed effect that blocks much of the colder wind from the Pacific and isulates with a layer of clouds. Its nearly 10 degrees colder on a sunny day in the winter. Kinda weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why my home country (Portugal) is a lot warmer than some cities in the US. For example New York is on the same latitude as Lisbon but New York has snow. I rarely went to Lisbon but I don't think it ever snowed there. My city was a bit further to the south and it never snowed there. Also I remember my teachers talking about how America also has a stream current but it comes from the north pole so it's a lot colder</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding:</p>
<p>The western part of Europe gets most of its weather from air coming in over the Atlantic (including the Gulf Stream that warms it) so the climate is driven by ocean temperatures, that act as a significant moderating influence.</p>
<p>You see a similar effect on the West Coast of North America - take Vancouver - this is a very moderate climate because it‚Äôs driven by the ocean temperature as most of their weather comes in off the Pacific. Go almost due-east to Calgary and winter temps drop about 20F as you‚Äôre in a Continental climate zone, go due East further to Winnipeg and winter temps drop another 10F again as the weather is entirely driven by the enormous North American landmass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Massive factor, noot just Shara though, the whole Africa. For much of the Southern Europe, everything is shielded from the north and south as well. No ocean streams, no big avenues from which cold winds can come from, etc make big difference for the Mediterrenean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I'm not sure you actually live in Calgary as we sure didn't have 3 weeks where it didn't get above -20 degrees during the 2020/2021 winter. We had one week of cold weather over Family Day week. We also had zero days where it was -40 over that period.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Vancouver definitely has more mild winters than us, but you seem to not even be aware of the weather that we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the West coast of North America is relatively cold - because of the Pacific. Moderate, yes (the temperature doesn't increase and decrease as much), but still cold.</p>
<p>In Europe and the Eastern US, the water is mostly from the Gulf Stream - an ocean current that flows up the US from the Caribbean, past Maine, and across the (relatively narrow) Atlantic. As anyone who has tried to either heat or cool water knows, water takes a lot of energy to heat or cool - and while that Caribbean water does cool down over time; it warms the air a lot on the way, warming the area.</p>
<p>However, on the West US/Canada coast, the water is from the Alaska/California current: it's cold water. And while that water warms somewhat on the way, Monterey messes that up: the Monterey Bay has a deep canyon in it that allows water from the deep (which is all about 4c/41f) to come to the surface, chilling the water a bit (it's not a lot of water compared to the larger current). The result is that water in Los Angeles (34N) averages about 17c/63f - the same as Norfolk, VA (36.8N)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was gonna say, in SF you often need a hoody in the summer, I wouldn't exactly say it's warm for it's latitude. </p>
<p>Being on the ocean in any case moderates your temperatures because water is a huge heat sink, but the west coast is generally colder than you'd expect.  Which is great for Southern California, it would probably be pretty unbearable heat otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
