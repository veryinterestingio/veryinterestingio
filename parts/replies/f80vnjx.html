			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t necessarily need to be the owner, although it’s probably easier if you are, or at least are working with the owner. If I manage a lot of the finances for someone else’s business, there’s a good chance they wouldn’t notice a few odd transactions here or there that you set up to clean some money. The larger the amount the harder it’ll be to fake unless you have a business or are working as an independent seller/service provider in a transaction. </p>
<p>Art is also a decent way. If you want to buy a bunch of illegal goods from me, I can just make a painting. I could sell ‘the painting’ to you for thousands or millions of dollars and who’s to say that’s not right? And then I give you whatever illegal good you wanted. By all accounts that’s clean money even though it was really for an illegal transaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to do something to receive the money. You could have some other business owner launder the money and then pay you for a service that the law can't prove you didn't provide.</p>
<p>Basically just remember that money was taken from the public for something illegal, e.g. drugs, and you have to fake a legal reason that this money was taken, e.g. a laundromat. Somebody in the process needs a steady stream of income that can be stretched, and then each link in the money transfer chain needs some good or service being provided to justify why person A gave person B $2k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, preferably the person who owns the dirty money and wants to clean it should be a shareholder of the business so that he can take out the clean money as dividends.</p>
<p>In some cases you can funnel the money through multiple companies to launder it so that he doesn't have to be the owner of every front company. For example the front business could pay for franchising, royalties, accounting, security, consulting, or whatever. Preferably something where costs are not directly linked to verifyable hours worked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>unless they can conclusively prove in court that you actually got the money illegally it doesn’t really matter if pretty much everyone knows it’s not really legal money</p>
