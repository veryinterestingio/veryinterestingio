			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAD, but it's my understanding we dream more in REM sleep. This could be an indicator that you're waking up in REM sleep, so you remember the dream better, but that would be too early to wake. Which indicates you're not leaving enough time for sleep. </p>
<p>Easy to test by going to bed earlier for a few weeks until you get in the habit. </p>
<p>Sleep apps can help you track quality of sleep and length of time spent actually sleeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm getting 8-10 hours of sleep everyday, so I don't think this is the issue. But idk, I'm a little weird with my sleep, because I need to fall asleep with something playing in the background and o wake up in the middle of the night when the video has stopped and put on another one to feel safe I guess...? But I don't think I get quality sleep regardless, but I also have hashimotos which messes with your hormones so....idk, maybe it's just anxiety, but I dream every single night and I remember almost everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah so it seems you're waking up during cycles. Maybe get a white noise machine; perhaps you're waking up becuase the video stops, prompting you to wake, getting a device like this might help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain foods (e.g. processed garlic) did that to me. The worst of it stopped after I had antibiotics for something else. Can only assume that some gut bug, that was killed by the antibiotics, was feeding off undigested food and excreting chemical that would affect my mind during sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's weird, but glad you found out. With me it's probably anxiety because my dreams are almost always me on a tall mountain and me trying not to fall  (I'm afraid of heights) or me getting sucked into the ocean and not getting out. But I don't feel then as nightmares if that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this. One day, not related to this, I decided I wanted to use moisturizer at night to improve my skin, got some 'night' stuff, it happened to have lavender in it. It claimed to help sleep, but as with most crap like that I didn't believe it, bought the product because it was high quality and good value.</p>
<p>I found that my stupidly intense dreams stopped. My dreams used to be really vivid to the point I could make decisions in those dreams, so it felt to me like I was actually not getting rest because of the damn things. My brain felt 'active'. Almost felt like there was no point sleeping.</p>
<p>The lavender really helped. Could be something for you to try.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always use Lavender shower gel and body cream after showering because I love the smell, but I haven't noticed any effect to be honest. It doesn't really calm me down, I just love the smell :) but thank you for the suggestion :)</p></div>		</li>
