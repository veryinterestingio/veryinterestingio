			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation, and thanks for pointing to some good resources. I just went through 12 hours of diagnostic evaluation with a new psychologist, and I was impressed with how much the exercises obfuscated the goals for measurement. Some things were more obvious, like the impulsivity test. However, that one is impossible to fake. I smacked that spacebar every goddamn time I saw the &quot;x&quot;. Anyway, not sure what the point of this comment is.</p>
<p>*Edit: Thanks for all the info about the test! Fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a <strong>HUGE</strong> difference between psychologists and psychiatrists. </p>
<p>Psychiatrists go to medical school first to learn about the sciences of the body in general and then spend another eight learning how what they know science-wise can be used to help all they learned what they’re learning head shrink wise.  - total twelve years. </p>
<p>Psychologists only do the last eight. They’re good at working things out, but if if there’s a real problem, you need a psychiatrist. </p>
<p>IMO. So judge. It’s just what I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I miscommunicated. I've had a rough few days. My psychiatrist and psychologist work as a team with me. I was just making a point about the fact that I'm treated medically by the person who uses the fewest tools to diagnose me. But my psychologist who does <em>not</em> prescribe my meds is the one doing all the testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that this effort to objectify diagnoses is highly controversial among experts. In part, this is because no two patients' conditions are ever truely the same, so an attempt to 'objectively define' them could never capture the whole of the condition; and in part because mental illness is defined by how it impacts the patient's life, which is something a brain scan can't show. It is entirely possible for a condition to be considered an illness in one context but would be normal in another.</p>
<p>EDIT: This is not to say that brain scans can't be useful for psychiatry, just that trying to nail down a definition of each disorder is seen by many as misguided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have continuous tension in my back and chest that makes it hard to breathe. I was wondering if we could isolate the frequency being sent from the brain to the muscles to cause them to flex and identify where that signal is originating.</p>
<p>I was also wondering about the addictive nature of cortisol and if there's a reliable way to measure it in the body. Sometimes when I'm in a low stress environment I will grind my teeth or think of a bad scenario, maybe to get another sweet hit of that cortisol. </p>
<p>Seems if we can more accurately measure stress in the body, we could develop better policy to alleviate that stress among constituents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol isn’t actually addictive, or at least I haven’t found a study proving it (or even testing it). It’s popular now to say stress is addictive but more likely, it’s the things we do under stress and why we do them that’s driving us to continue. Additionally, the placebo effect is VERY real so imagining an addiction to stress could be damaging to you. You may start to act is if you do have an addiction to cortisol and stress, even though it’s impossible. So maybe next time you grind your teeth and think bad thoughts, don’t associate it with a NEED or compulsion. Consider it a quirky bad habit and focus on breaking it (because positive placebo effects are also a thing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you describe some of “the things we do under stress” and why those might be addicting? Do you mean things like drinking or overeating?</p>
<p>Also, where does a workaholic fall in that spectrum? An addiction to getting things done or the feeling of getting things done?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s addictive because the precursor POMC gets cleaved into a number of smaller peptide components including ACTH (hormone that causes cortisol release) and beta-endorphin. So for every molecule of ACTH there’s another molecule of endorphin simultaneously released.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can definitely identify which nerves are firing and where they go to the muscles. That being said, your problem may not be a nerve problem. It may be a muscle problem with it tensing too much. Or it may be that you just feel like things are tense when they actually aren't. These sensations are often multifactorial.</p></div>		</li>
