			<div class="markdown"><p>This is accurate, but you should also mention that the proteins being broken down are not optimised to be folded at low pH, and so will be partially or completely unfolded by the low pH and thus more vulnerable to digestion by the enzymes from the lysosome. Those enzymes will cut at, usually, defined amino acid sequences, so unfolding the protein increases the chance those sequences are exposed and vulnerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s much more appropriate to say that changing pH (higher or lower) will expose different parts of a protein, thus potentially making cleavage that wasn’t possible at a neutral pH possible.... but a high pH is just as likely to do this as a low pH and pH alone is not a good method of unfolding a protein for electrophoresis or sequencing... that’s going to be the job of a detergent that eliminates hydrostatic interactions along with a reducing agent to eliminate disulfides... not pH.  pH only fucks with ionic interactions and hydrostatic interactions defined by amino acids with side chains that are acidic or basic.  It also does nothing to eliminate disulfide bonds.  It’s definitely going to inhibit almost any enzyme meant to work at neutral pH by disrupting what it does but rather than unfolding, it’s much more of a refolding.  That’s not to say certain proteins won’t be much more unfolded in this new shape but it’s not that unlikely that a protein could be more tightly folded at a pH of 4, and I’m not only talking about proteins like pepsin that are designed to work at a low pH.  Unfolded and inactivated are very different.</p>
<p>Source: writing my dissertation... one of my 3 goals is dependent on refolding the monomers I’ve isolated from a dimeric toxin isolated from the venom of one of the snakes I extract.  I’ve been living and breathing protein folding and refolding literature for years... and no, I still haven’t conclusively found a method to refold it after the treatments required to separate the monomers... </p>
<p>I’m not saying that what you pointed out is never the case, it is A reason why we have digestion occur at variable pH’s... it’s just that you made it sound like pH has more to do with unfolding proteins than it usually does, and didn’t mention that it can be used to refold proteins into tighter configurations than they are at neutral pH as well.  It all depends on sequence... pH change alone is not enough to unfold most proteins.</p></div>		</li>
