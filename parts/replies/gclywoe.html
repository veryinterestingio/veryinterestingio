			<div class="markdown"><p>This mission really is a team effort! It's co-funded by the European Commission through the Copernicus Programme, as well as through contributions from NASA, ESA, NOAA and EUMETSAT programmes. The satellite and main altimetry instrument were built by Airbus and Thales Alenia Space together with ESA, and the GNSS radio occultation and microwave radiometers have been provided by NASA. NASA has contracted SpaceX for the launch itself, which will be performed, along with the early operations phase (LEOP) by ESA. EUMETSAT is responsible for the ground segment and will take over operations of the satellite at the end of LEOP. NOAA provide US ground station support for satellite tracking and command of the satellite. For data, EUMETSAT will process the altimetry data and deliver to European users. NASA will provide ground segment support for processing the GNSS radio occultation data, and they, along with NOAA will distribute data products to users in the USA. CNES are also involved in the mission and will be processing Level 2P and Level 3 data from the altimeter package, as well as providing support for the Precise Orbital Determination and DORIS instrument operations. All partners will be working closely together on calibration and validation activities.  - H.E.K.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot for the answer! I guess all teams are quite used to work together in other missions, nice to see such collaboration.</p>
<p>By the way, probably is a question hard to quantify... But how much of a difference will make the mission in weather prediction?</p>
<p>Any other direct/day to day application of the sea height measurements? I hear that Sentinel 2 for example was/is great for agricultural application.</p>
<p>Good luck with the launch! There were some sad news with Seosat launch today... Hope that covers the bad luck quota for the rest of the year!</p></div>		</li>
