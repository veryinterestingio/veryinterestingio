			<div class="markdown"><p>Do modern automatics still use torque converters? I've always driven manual so I haven't had reason to keep up on automatic transmissions but I thought most modern cars were going moving away from torque converters towards computer-controlled clutches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheap cars still use at least a variation of a torque converter, but yes a lot of cars are switching to dual clutch (which since it's computer controlled when you take you foot off the brake it basically rides the clutch a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a multimillion dollar cars uses one still. Well sort of its a highly modified version of one but essentially a torque converter. The koneigsegg regera. One gear takes your from 0-250 mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of cars have dual clutches now, but it’s far from the end of torque converters. A lot of cars, especially high end sports cars, now use the ZF 8 speed or at least a variation. It’s a very quick torque converter automatic transmission. The aisin 6 and 8 speeds that VW uses is also quite quick</p></div>		</li>
