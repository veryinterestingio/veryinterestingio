<p>I know. When I was a kid (1950s), I was taking a bath, and I was holding the shampoo bottle with a wet hand. It started to slip, I tried to grab it... well, at least the sliced up finger was very clean. </p>
<p>Plastic is much more sensible for anything you're going to handle when it's wet.</p></div>		</li>

Glad to see your final sentence verifies that what I'm doing is OK (using shampoo as body wash).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this has been posted, but the pH of hair and skin is between 4.5-5. The pH is maintained by sweat and sebum production (acid mantle). Washing your hair too frequently can cause an imbalance in the acid mantle, which causes dryness and in turn causes over production of sebum to compensate for the dryness.( If you wash your hair everyday because it gets oily too fast, it gets oily because you're washing it too much.) It's recommend to wash twice to ensure your scalp is free of buildup. Using too much shampoo can also cause dryness, so also why you use a quarter size amount, lather, rinse, REPEAT!  Drug store shampoos have strong detergents that dry out your hair, then heavy waxes in the conditioner to make you think it's working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really just don't use anything with sulfates (ie sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate).  I switched to castile soap for all my personal hygienic needs and I'm never going back.  I've stopped going through dry and oily cycles and am now in a constant natural sebum equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, you're saying that washing the hair too often can make it too oily as a compensation mechanism. But then you recommend washing it twice in a row? I think I can see what you mean (wash less often, but twice).</p>
<p>But is it necessary? E. g. when my hair is long, I wash it once 2-3 days, which more or less keeps it healthily soft and smooth without conditioner. If I wash twice, the hair is too dry. In your opinion, how does the two-time wash extend the time of optimal oil?</p></div>		</li>
