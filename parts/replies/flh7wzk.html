			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the fact that, as other replies have mentioned, there <em>are</em> indeed several other counting systems besides our standard decimal Arabic system, the reason why that one number-system is so much more widespread than any one alphabet is because numbers all refer to the same thing, while letters don't.</p>
<p>The alphabet we use is the Latin alphabet, which was used by the the Romans to write, well, Latin, so the Latin alphabet has letters for all the sounds in Latin. Unfortunately, the sounds that exist in Latin are only a tiny selection of all the sounds that exist in the world's languages, so there are problems with writing languages that aren't Latin with the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>Even just English has plenty of problems with the Latin alphabet. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added three new letters - W, V, and J - that the original Latin alphabet didn't have, in order to deal with the sounds that English has that Latin didn't have.</li>
<li>We combine two letters to create one sound, e.g. &quot;th&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;ng&quot; - also sounds that Latin didn't have.</li>
<li>We use one letter to make several different sounds, e.g. &quot;g&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, any vowel - again, sounds Latin didn't have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Letters aren't universal because there's no one writing system that can write all languages. (Well, there is, actually: the International Phonetic Alphabet. But it is technical, and somewhat difficult to learn, and also horribly ugly.) If you try to apply a writing system made for one language to another language, you end up with issues like what English has.</p>
<p>On top of that, places rarely have a strong attachment to their numbering system, if they have one at all; they will, however, care deeply about their native writing system, and resist attempts to change it. Mongolia, for example, had the Cyrillic alphabet forced upon it for a century under Russian rule, and even after all that time has recently announced that they'll be switching back to traditional Mongolian script.</p>
<p>TL;DR no alphabet is perfect and people really like theirs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a wonderful example of this, actually. It's a great story. (Long, but good.)</p>
<p>So, the alphabet we all know and love comes from a group of scribes in the middle of the desert four thousand years ago who really hated how goddamn complicated Egyptian hieroglyphs were. They decided to make a new, better writing system. They then invent the alphabet. (Longer story on that <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-civilizations-invented-their-own-alphabet-not-just-an-adaptation-of-another-alphabet/answer/Oscar-Tay-1" target="_blank">here</a>.) At first, no one really cares. It's used in a few places for a few centuries, but not a whole lot.</p>
<p>Then the Phoenicians come along. They find the alphabet. They love the alphabet. They pass the alphabet on to as many people as they possibly can. They pass it to so many people that some people today think the Phoenicians themselves invented the alphabet - which they didn't, but they did make it famous.</p>
<p>Phoenician has a lot of sounds in it. Three of them are important here:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;g&quot;, the hard &quot;g&quot;. It looks kind of like a curved stick. They call their letter &quot;g&quot; <em>gimel</em>, which means &quot;curved stick you hit things with&quot;, because that's what it looks like.</li>
<li>&quot;k&quot;, also hard (is there a soft &quot;k&quot;?). It looks kind of like a hand. They call this letter <em>kaph</em>, which means &quot;hand&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;q&quot;, which is kind of like &quot;k&quot;, but pronounced by sticking the back of your tongue further back in your throat. It looks like a fat monkey with a tail. They call this letter <em>qoph</em>, which means &quot;monkey&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the peoples the Phoenicians give the alphabet to was the Greeks. The Greeks also love the alphabet. Unfortunately, the sounds Greek has are pretty different from the sounds the Phoenicians have. They have to repurpose some of the letters. For the three they just mentioned, they do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;g&quot;: Great. They have that hard &quot;g&quot; sound already. They take that curved stick, <em>gimel</em>, turn it into more of a Γ shape, and change the name to <em>gamma</em>, because that's easier for the Greeks to pronounce than <em>gimel</em>. <em>Gamma</em> doesn't mean anything, but it's a good name for a letter, the Greeks think.</li>
<li>&quot;k&quot;: Also fine. The Greeks have a &quot;k&quot; sound. They turn <em>kaph</em> into <em>kappa</em>, which, like <em>gamma</em>, doesn't mean anything - it's just easier for them to say. Looks like a K now, so a little less like a hand, anyway.</li>
<li>&quot;q&quot;, though, &quot;q&quot; is weird. They don't have that &quot;q&quot; sound. What are they supposed to do with it? Is it for &quot;k&quot;? But they already have a &quot;k&quot;. They use it a bit in some places, and name it <em>qoppa</em>, and make it look like Ϙ, but it never catches on. Eventually, they drop it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before they drop it, the alphabet sails to Italy. The Etruscans pick it up. Etruscan sounds are different from Greek sounds, just as Greek sounds were different from Phoenician sounds; they decide on some changes of their own. The Etruscans, you see, have not one, not two, but <em>three</em> different &quot;k&quot;-like sounds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Γ? What's Γ? The Etruscans don't have a &quot;g&quot; sound. They do need a letter for one of their &quot;k&quot; sounds, though, so they curve gamma Γ out a little and make it a C. C is the first of their &quot;k&quot; letters.</li>
<li>K's a good &quot;k&quot; anyway, so we'll keep it like that. Another &quot;k&quot; letter.</li>
<li>Ϙ, finally, is a good &quot;k&quot; sound, so they make it Q.</li>
</ul>
<p>C, K, and Q: the three Etruscan &quot;k&quot; sounds.</p>
<p>So the Romans happen, and they take the Etruscan alphabet, and they have a problem: they've only got one &quot;k&quot; sound.</p>
<ul>
<li>They opt for &quot;c&quot; as their &quot;k&quot; sound (so &quot;c&quot; is always pronounced as &quot;k&quot; in Latin, so &quot;Caesar&quot; is supposed to be pronounced &quot;Kaiser&quot; - &quot;Caesar&quot; being where the word &quot;Kaiser&quot; comes from).</li>
<li>&quot;K&quot; they don't really need, so they only use it in a few words they steal from Greek, so that the &quot;k&quot; makes it look extra Greek, because the Romans like looking like the Greeks and all that.</li>
<li>&quot;Q&quot;, though, &quot;Q&quot; they can use. Latin has a sort of &quot;kw&quot; sound, which they can't spell &quot;kw&quot; because they never use &quot;k&quot; and the letter &quot;w&quot; hasn't been invented yet. So they use &quot;qu&quot; instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>But Latin has another problem!: the Etruscans had no &quot;g&quot; sound, but they <em>do</em>. So they need to make a new &quot;g&quot; sound. What do they do? They're lazy. They just put a line on the C. They've invented the letter G.</p>
<p>We're not done yet. Latin's invented its alphabet, but it's a language, and all languages change. Latin begins to turn into French and Spanish and Italian and all the Romance languages. As it does this, its sounds change, too: when the &quot;c&quot; comes before an &quot;e&quot; or an &quot;i&quot;, it turns into an &quot;s&quot; sound; when the &quot;g&quot; comes before an &quot;e&quot; or an &quot;i&quot;, it turns into a &quot;j&quot; sound. They don't update their alphabet to compensate.</p>
<p>The result of all this is that there are three &quot;k&quot; sounds: C, which is sometimes an S; K, which we don't use as much as we should; and Q, which we only use before U, or to represent that old &quot;q&quot; sound that Phoenician had, and that many modern Middle Eastern languages have, but that English and Latin and Greek never had.</p>
<p>But numbers? Numbers never have to deal with sound changes, or history, or being turned from one language into another. A 2 is <em>always</em> a 2, no matter your language, religion, nationality, whatever. Languages change. People change. Numbers don't. (The <em>shapes</em> of these numbers do change (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4#/media/File:Evolution4glyph.png" target="_blank">here's 4</a>), I should mention; but the values don't.)</p>
<p>TL;DR languages change and make letters funny; math never changes, so numbers never go funny in the same way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple: numbers represent counts, while letters represent phonemes (linguistic term for &quot;mental representation of a linguistic sound&quot;).</p>
<p>The mappings of Letters to Sounds can change because the sounds themselves represented by the letters can change over time.  Italians think that &quot;Veni, Vidi, Vici&quot; is pronounced &quot;veh nee, vee dee, vee chee,&quot; but their Roman ancestors would have pronounced the same sounds as &quot;weh nee, wee dee, wee kee.&quot;</p>
<p>And there can even be contemporary differences; at any given time, the same word might be pronounced differently, even though it's spelled the same.  For example, even if we limit our discussion to native speakers of English, &quot;three&quot; might be pronounced &quot;free&quot; (certain English dialects) or &quot;tree&quot; (certain Irish dialects of English) or &quot;three.&quot;  </p>
<p>Compare that to numbers:</p>
<p>3 means *** whether you call that &quot;three,&quot; &quot;free,&quot; &quot;tree,&quot; &quot;tres,&quot; &quot;tois,&quot; or &quot;drei.&quot;  The meaning of 3, being discrete and objective, doesn't shift the way letters do.  </p>
<p>Even when you have what are theoretically the same sounds for the same letters, they can be slightly different.  For example, where someone speaking Spanish would read the word &quot;dos&quot; as /d̪os/, someone speaking Spanish with an English Accent would say /doʊs/.  Despite that, both parties know that they mean **.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also not a linguist but the numbers we use are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals" target="_blank">Hindu-Arabic numerals</a>. They started use in India, spreading to Arabic countries, and then eventually to Europe becoming something of a world standard. </p>
<p>It's useful to have a single unifying syntax so we've stuck with the system but there are plenty of other ways to write numbers. Ancient Rome used roman numerals for instance, and as YagaDillon mentioned China and Japan have their own symbols for numbers as well (though they usually also use hindu-arabic numerals these days).</p></div>		</li>
