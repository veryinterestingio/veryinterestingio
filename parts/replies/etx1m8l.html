			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, it's not useful to use to try to separate ourselves by percent of neanderthal DNA, especially when most of us don't even know how much we have and you can't tell unless you get a DNA test done. We're just too similar to bother. Usually there is some sort of notable difference between designations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if we were to try and seperate ourselves, which would be the high and which would be the low class? more Neanderthal or less??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we can't tell the difference between more and less neanderthal without measuring neanderthal DNA, then the high and low classes would be based purely on how much you like neanderthal DNA. Theoretically this means there would be no high and low class since it's a neutral attribute, but we all know how human nature works...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention, not all races have Neanderthal DNA, yet alone the same contribution.  Sub-Saharan Africans, due to the obvious difference of lacking a migration pattern through Neanderthal territories, lack any of that DNA, unlike Asians and Caucasians.   </p>
<p>A more interesting question is, what makes Neanderthal a unique species rather than merely a subspecies, if they are able to interbreed with humans?   If its merely based on minor differences in skull shapes and height, why don't we consider Australian Aboriginals a different species from say Nordic Caucasians, that can be differentiated even ignoring soft tissue deviations due to a migration divergence to virtually alien habitats more than 70K years ago?</p>
<p>IMO, Neanderthal should be relegated to mere sub-species status, as if alive today its unlikely we would consider them anything more than another race of &quot;people&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pretty sure there are people in africa with no neanderthal and denisovan dna. so op is clearly just focused on people outside of africa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's my point.  A very large number of species have a similar situation where some fraction of the population has genes from some other species and a fraction does not.  If we were to try to make a classification for all of those subsets it would be pointlessly complicated.</p></div>		</li>
