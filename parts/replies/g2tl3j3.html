			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I grew up with this too. I’d sneeze so many times throughout the day, I’d pop my ribs out of place and be so sore the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had those days before I got allergy shots. I’d spend 30 minutes hanging over the sink, snot and spittle flying as sneeze after sneeze erupted forth. I’d get a break long enough to splash some water over my face before it began again. Fun times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i have sun sneezes and i love staring at bright lights and getting 4-6 in a session</p>
<p>i'm sure i've never done 100 in a day, but i imagine it'd still feel amazing</p>
<p>i've also never sneezed due to sickness though; maybe that feels different</p></div>		</li>
