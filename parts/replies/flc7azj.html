			<div class="markdown"><p>Scott Kelly describes this as one of the biggest isues on the International Space Station. Their CO2 filters keep breaking and when there are a lot of people aboard the CO2 levels rise higher. It causes headaches, eyes are sore, people get tired more. NASA tries to downplay role of this.</p>
<p>Simple solution for the house is to remember to open windows sometimes and get fresh air inside.</p>
<p>Also indoor we get dust and mites that dont help with air quality. Our bodies know that.</p></div>		</li>
