			<div class="markdown"><p>CPAP machines and any closed-off  air-driving machines I can think of are actually fancy compressors. Compressors use mechanical work to increase pressure on the output side. In a CPAP machine, it has your lungs on the output side, and because your lungs expand, pressure does not build up beyond &quot;normal&quot;. Pressure only increases if the compressor's output volume does not increase to compensate.  </p>
<p>While it is true that velocity reduces static pressure of fluid, it does NOT reduce it to zero in any case. A CPAP machine driving air in a tube is not hindered by Bernoilli's law.</p></div>		</li>
