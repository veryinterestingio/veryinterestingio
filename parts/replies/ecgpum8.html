<p>The question in your post is “is psychopathy categorical or a continuum?” The short answer is that it’s both. There is a trait of personality labeled as psychopathy and people throughout the population express different levels of it.</p>

<p>Is this not true for every psychological disorder?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I’m aware of, but quite a few disorders do have direct names of traits that parallel them. The personality inventory for the DSM-5 (PID-5) was proposed as a way of conceptualizing many disorders in a trait like manner, but it didn’t take off entirely.</p>
<p>There is also an interpersonal circumplex (search Horowitz if you’re interested) that has had both big five traits and clinical disorders plotted on the same axes. That lets people see the way most disorders line up with traits, but it’s not the only way. This is a good article on it: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675800/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3675800/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is probably true, but in order to understand this you need to identify the major drawbacks with the DSM-system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whenever you have criteria like 5 out 9 you are destined for problems. Two persons sharing the same diagnosis can be extremely different since they may have only one symptom in common. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One person with 4 disabling symptoms won’t get the diagnosis while a well functioning person with 5 mild symptoms get it. </p>
</li>
<li>With the DSM system people tend to stack one diagnosis on top of the other. They have depression <em>and</em>  anxiety <em>and</em> OCD <em>and</em> drug abuse. The mind isn’t divided in that way, it’s a general system and the pathological behavior that is expressed is a sum of all that person’s traits. </li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore it’s not correct to say that psychopathy is a different thing from antisocial behavior disorder, it’s just what we get when we examine the behavior with the DSM-system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DSM I think has only become quite the &quot;Bible&quot; it is because of our insurance-based mental healthcare system, which will often only cover treatments if there is a specific diagnosis. Your clinician can <em>know</em> what's going on with you, and <em>know</em> how to treat you - but unless that problem-and-course has a <em>name</em>, it can't be treated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably is, but it's less relevant to diagnosis and treatment in some disorders than it is in others, at least at our current level of understanding. For example, there are probably people out there living with a similar neurotransmitter imbalance as in those with depression, but aren't aware of it because they experience symptoms to a degree that they find manageable. As far as I know, we don't have any common tests that would detect such a person, and it's not clear that their quality of life would be improved by medical intervention even if we did. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be some examples of psychopathic symptoms that don't cause dysfunction? And how do you define the difference between dysfunctional and nondysfunctional? Is it purely subjective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a bit outside of my area, I’m not a clinician by any means. If I recall correctly, the focus is that it’s actually impairing them in some damaging way. In terms of psychopathy? I actually don’t see a mention of it on the DSM-IV page, so it’s possible that it’s actually always a given. I was mostly providing the norm as a way to explain the diagnosis vs continuum distinction.</p>
<p>One example that I can think of would be a cut throat business person who excels while remaining legal in action. They might benefit from psychopathic tendencies and not warrant a diagnosis, but like I said above it’s probably a stretch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is dysfunction defined in terms of the patient's perception or of those around them? Let's say my behavior falls within many of the diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder, but I don't feel it causes a problem in my life. If the people around me think my behavior/personality is harmful, would that &quot;count&quot;? </p>
<p>I'm speaking from a place where family/friends aren't consulted in the course of a mental health assessment, how would you even know if my behavior is indicative of a problem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is dysfunctional or not is the core of diagnosis. Dysfunction causes significant impairment in functional domains of school or work and relationships. Are you upset with your life? Are other people mad at you? Are you able to do your job well? Are you taking care of yourself well? and any others like a spouse or children? Functional means coping, getting along, figuring it out eventually or better. Dysfunction due to certain psychological behaviors, beliefs and ideas impair performance in an important area of a persons life.</p></div>		</li>
