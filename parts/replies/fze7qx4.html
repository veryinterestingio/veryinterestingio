			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question!  As you point out, Mars has lower gravity than Earth does, about 3/8 gee.  We must take this into account when we're figuring out loads on the vehicle during EDL (Entry, Descent, and Landing), when driving in soil, etc.  In our Mars Yard at JPL, we can offload mass or support the rover to more closely simulate Martian driving conditions in 3/8 gee.
