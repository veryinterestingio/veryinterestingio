My daughter (whose flat has gas) now has a beautiful Spring pan from the early nineties that I used daily until I switched to induction.  Modern Spring is induction compatible. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why induction over gas? I feel like with gas, you get more accurate control over heat and easier to remove heat, especially on a busy stove.</p>
<p>My gf has an electric stove with just lines on the knobs and I find it harder to control temps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On some refrigerators they actually put a thin layer of magnetic material behind the front sheet of stainless, specifically so that your magnets stick to it.</p>
<p>Weirdly this seems to be in decline? My newish fridge is not magnetic either ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Next time I need a new appliance I am taking a magnet with me specifically to test. </p>
<p>The cynical side of me suspects this has something to do with modern appliances being marketed as conversation starting ‚Äústatement pieces‚Äù where being covered with kids drawings might hide logos or brand names.. not sure what other reason there would be for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was in college I thought about going down the marketing path. In one class the professor said when we was working for a marketing research firm that they found in study after study that customers just don't care about brand names on their appliances. They care about looks, features and reliability. Yet time and again the manufacturers would insist on prominently displaying their logos on their products. </p>
<p>Now the public has more or less won (at least with dishwashers) but it took a long time for companies to concede that fact. Now they are doing weird stuff with regards to windows, touchscreens and other unnecessary crap. </p>
<p>Personally, I want a white box that keeps stuff cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fewer people care about their fridges being magnetic these days; no one is trying to make any particular statement, they're just using non-magnetic stainless and aren't willing to increase their manufacturing costs to make magnets work when fewer and fewer people care about their fridge being magnetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine is the same. A samsung. The front does not take magnets. However an exposed side of the fridge facing the interior of the house (it's counter depth fridge) where as the front just faces a wall. So I was able to just use the side of the fridge which is magnetized but is not stainless steel (that black plastic on the sides) so I don't have to worry about scratches on the front.</p>
<p>Finger prints however, make sure you get one that is treated for fingerprint marks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's annoying. Usually they put a sheet of steel behind the stainless skin so that magnets would still stick.</p></div>		</li>
