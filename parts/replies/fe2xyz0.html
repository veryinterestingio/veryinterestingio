			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this in places, cosmogenic isotopes (like Be-10, Al-26, or Cl-36) are also produced in various minerals in the first few meters of the Earth's surface and can be used to date things like exposure, burial, etc. The Balco paper you referenced is using these, not 'meteoric' cosmogenic isotopes (i.e. those produced in the atmosphere).</p>
<p>For systems like Rb-Sr where we can't assume an initial zero ratio of parent to child, it's pretty common to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochron_dating" target="_blank">isochron</a> techniques, specifically so we don't have to assume a starting ratio (instead requiring us to make the often more reasonable assumption that minerals within a single sample experienced the same thermal history).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah thanks. Well; thoroughly reading the papers beforehand could prove useful. :-)</p>
<p>Yes, that is true. It's just that Rb/Sr was the first example that popped into my head in relation to partition coefficients because I am currently dealing with Sr-contents in plagioclase (AFC-Processes and such nice stuff), so I used that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding C-14 formation- I apparently had that a little mixed up. I thought it was an electron capture process to turn one of the protons to a neutron. Is that a reasonable route as well, or not in our atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen-14 electron captures into nitrogen-14, but nitrogen-14 is stable, so it won't electron capture into carbon-14.</p></div>		</li>
