One guy said he gets rid of them by taking a shovel full of ants and dropping it into another colony and taking a shovel back from there to the original.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add that there is actually a world war between ants right now.</p>
<p>The argentinian ant species happen to not fight between themselves (except in some cases), thus building a giant network of ant colonies. It gives them ana dvantage over the other species which ferously fight each other all the time.</p>
<p>That is why we can see many argentinian ants in Europe taking over significant areas from other species.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even argentinians which are supposed to share a common odor end up fighting each others. Some, at a long distance from the others eventually &quot;create&quot; their own odor and fight their relatives.</p>
<p>If an ant is lost far from its home, it will try to find the odor of its colony potentially left by other ants. Whenever an ant explores a place, it &quot;hits&quot; the ground with its abdomen leaving traces like &quot;Hop'O' My Thumb&quot; to find its way back. The only hope for the ant is to find an odor track on the ground.</p>
<p>The ant will probably die. Either because another colony killed it. Or because another insect ate it.</p>
<p>There are even cases in which ants actually kill their own queen (in species where there are several queens and a power struggle happen).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm curious why you say unfortunately. As it seems to be an effective way to stop other colonies from being overrun even more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the idea of a super ant empire that does not have to fight each other  in the world quite fun.</p>
<p>But yeah, it's better for nature that they massacre each other, considering how much damage they can do to wild insects.</p></div>		</li>

Is there a way to help the more eco-friendly ants become more ubiquitous? Most ppl where I live are just sick of ant bites, and they poison or feed ant yummies like Amdro to every mound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best thing to do is to first identify which mounds are invasive fire ants: if youâ€™re in the US, there are several native fire ants that are similar to the invasive ones but arenâ€™t really a problem. They can persist in areas highly invaded by imported fire ants.</p>
<p>The next thing is to treat <em>those specific mounds</em>: broadcasting bait over a large area is not good because itâ€™ll kill off all the native ants, too. Fire ants will fill in the void left behind because they have a reproductive advantage over most natives. They produce insane numbers of new queens literally all year and those new queens can make a colony of 10k workers in 6 months. Native ants, on the other hand, often produce fewer new queens and usually only at a particular time of year. Some do have fast-growing colonies, but others donâ€™t. Itâ€™s hard to make generalizations about &quot;native ants&quot; without knowing where you are at â€” and even then, itâ€™s hard to generalize because they can differ from one another so much.</p>
<p>Fire ants thrive in disturbed areas â€” Iâ€™ve heard that they donâ€™t colonize new places as well if the tree canopy is mostly intact. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s hard to give any general purpose advice for eliminating fire ants other than treating individual colonies as you find them because theyâ€™re broad generalists. Lots of ants are generalists, so trying to cut down on food and stuff will hurt all the ants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Attacking the nest with fire ants(at least the European variants I have seen) can be very tough as they are usually multi-Queen and multi-colony.   I have had a lot of luck reducing their numbers through the use of a borax based bait.   Itâ€™s half a cup of  sugar in 1.5 cups of warm water.  Add two tablespoons of borax.  I usually make homemade traps by taking a plastic container and punching holes in the lids.  I then soak cotton balls in the mixture and put those in the containers.  This keeps the kids and pets out of it and allows it to last through rain a bit better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In their original habitat (the banks of the ParanÃ¡ River and its tributaries), Argentinian ant colonies fight as much as any other species. It's only within the diaspora, in places like North America and Europe, where a small groups of ants from some colony was accidentally imported that their odors have remained similar enough for them to not consider each other from different colonies but from the same supercolony. However, this happened around the 1800s and their odors are starting to become distinct and they are turning on each other and becoming not one supercolony but several.</p></div>		</li>
