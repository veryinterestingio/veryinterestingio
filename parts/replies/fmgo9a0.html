			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not much other than mess up nighttime when the earth is between the sun and Jupiter.</p>
<p>Jupiter is, at its closest, about 5 times as far from the earth as the sun, and half the year its significantly further away. Even if it were the same mass as the sun the light would have, at the strongest, about 4% the intensity of the sun, and at the weakest about 1% the intensity.</p>
<p>If it were <em>just</em> big enough to ignite it would be even less. Kinda like having an extra moon shining down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It cannot. It needs at least ~13 times its mass to start <em>any</em> fusion (it would become a brown dwarf), and ~80 times its mass to become a star fusing regular hydrogen to helium like most other stars.</p>
<p>A dim star in the place of Jupiter (let's say 100 times the mass of Jupiter) wouldn't matter much, by the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't this the whole &quot;master plan&quot; of 2010? To give it enough mass as to kickstart its transformation into a star, thus promoting life on one of it's moons. I liked that bit of scifi...</p></div>		</li>
