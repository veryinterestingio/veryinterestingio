			<div class="markdown"><p>When i mas little i had a very bad anxiety period(idk how to call it i just had some terrible years) and i felt the pressure in my chest but also a gap feeling in my stomach, they were never there at the same time. I still have anxiety, it's milder overall but i have anxiety attacks and i only feel it in my chest now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the things of the 'fight or flight' reaction that causes the OPs chest tightness. It's a general fight or flight (over)reaction and it happens in your entire body.  </p>
<p>Many feel it in the chest cause the lungs and the heart are there (plus just a bunch of other muscles). Very few feel it in the legs cause your leg muscles are pretty good at dealing with spontanious muscle contractions (they have to deal with it all the time) but you can still get panic leg cramps.  </p>
<p>In your case stomach area is also not uncommon. Again tons of muscles, multiple organs there. Lots of 'stuff' taht can cramp up or hurt when you body is yolted into 'action mode' suddenly and without knowing what to do with the implulse :-)</p></div>		</li>
