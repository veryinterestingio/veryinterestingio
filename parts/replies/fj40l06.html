			<div class="markdown"><p>The same nerves carry inputs of temperature, itch, and pain. They’re called “free nerve endings” in the skin. This explains why when people get super cold, they might feel itchy and eventually, pain, along with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that has helped others is taking an anti histamine before exercise. Benadryl ( generic name diphenhydramine), Claritin (loratadine) or other similar medications. </p>
<p>I'm not a doctor, and you should consult a doctor before taking any medications. Don't trust random people on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that if I take a rest from exercise for two days or longer, it is crucial for me to take loratadine before I start up again.  Otherwise the awful itchies will get me.</p>
<p>I usually walk six miles every day except on the weekend.  So on Sunday night right before I go to bed, I'll take a pill of loratadine so that my morning walk to work will be itch-free.  I've been doing this for four years.  I swear by it.</p></div>		</li>
