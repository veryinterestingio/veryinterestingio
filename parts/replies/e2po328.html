			<div class="markdown"><p>To refine this a little, the rod cells are very sensitive to light <em>level</em>, which is essentially what black and white is - no light = black, all light = white. Cone cells are sensitive to colour but not light level particularly.</p>
<p>The cone cells are concentrated in a part of the retina called the fovea. This is the 'hi res' part of the retina that gives us our sharpest vision, but it is very narrow - if you read a book, pay attention to how many lines are actually sharp in your vision - it'll be no more than a couple.</p>
<p>So when we look at something directly in the dark (as we naturally try to do because we're used to trying to see something in detail), the light is hitting the cone cells, which aren't very light sensitive. If you instead look off to one side, the light will hit your light sensitive but low-res rod cells and you'll see a soft, monochrome image of the object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. We have three kinds of cone cells, which is how we sense colour (each type is sensitive to a different colour). Colour blindness is usually the result of a genetic defect that causes one of the types to not work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. </p>
<p>Colorblindness usually has little to do with the rods (which gives you the ability to see in low light situations).</p>
<p>Colorblindness is the result of a missing or non-functioning subtype of a cone photoreceptor. Most people have three different types of cones. People perceive color because the different wavelengths of light excite the different types of cones to varying degrees. It is the comparison of the activity of these different types of cones at a given wavelength of light that allows us to perceive color. If a cone subtype is missing or non-functioning, then you lose the ability to compare activity of that cone to the others (and thus cannot perceive differences in colors). </p>
<p>Itâ€™s more nuanced that this, but that my quick stab at it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew the answer to the OP before this, but I have a follow up questuon. Any idea how having one normal eye and one in which the placement of rods and cones was reversed would affect vision? It would be cool if this would allow a person to have the best of both worlds, or if it would greatly impede their ability to see well at all.</p></div>		</li>
