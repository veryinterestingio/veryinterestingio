			<div class="markdown"><p>Although we don't have a <em>definitive answer</em>, sleep being necessary absolutely makes sense and always has.</p>
<p>Though it feels perfectly natural and effortless, during waking hours our bodies and brains are actually doing a ton of work just to keep us alive and functioning without us even being aware of it.</p>
<p>To even do simple things like lift your arms to stretch or move your legs to get out of bed and brush your teeth every morning, grasp a pen and put it to paper to jot down a note, etc takes all kinds of unseen mind/body coordination and communication.</p>
<p>But when we're at rest there's far less pressure. The sole focus then becomes keeping our bodies alive and documenting, sorting and storing our memories/experiences, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains why we need resting, but I believe the question is more along the lines of why can’t we rest for awhile and continue functioning? Why do we need to shut almost completely off and basically go unconscious for a third of our lives?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because even when resting your brain is very active, listening out in case of danger or opportunities, using all of your senses, and making recommendations to your consciousness about what to do next. Just because you decide not to manipulate your muscles doesn’t stop the whole computer buzzing away.</p>
<p>When you sleep, your brainwaves go into totally different patterns and you are no longer processing your environment in the same way. Instead the brain seems to be dedicating its resources to memory consolidation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess I'm just not seeing the apparent 'distinction' here...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have several answers.  The primary one being that we sleep during darkness, which is about the same amount of time as the sleep we need.  The question should really be why do we need to sleep so little, though.  Because humans sleep so much less than other mammals.</p>
<p>If the question is why we sleep at all, then theres enormous amounts of scientific findings amd saying we dont know is just shortchanging OP.  When we sleep the brain sorts memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long term storage (including conscious memory and muscle memory).  It connects distant parts of the brain to create a stroger network of neurons, resulting in creative boosts and deeper understanding.  The body kicks muscle growth into overdrive while sleeping, realeasing big bumps of human growth hormone.  The immune system also goes into overdrive, removing infections and precancerous cells.
Many other things.  Saying we dont know is being flippant to all the science thats been done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why am I more tired if I sleep 3am to noon than 12am to 9? That’s the real question here,</p></div>		</li>
