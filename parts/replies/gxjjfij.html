To add though, this was back in 2009, and the bird was tracked via satellite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes absolutely. They eat insects caught in flight and catch raindrops or swoop down low to drink on the surface of water if it hasn't rained.</p>
<p>Basically, they land to nest or if the weather gets too bad to fly. That's it.</p></div>		</li>
