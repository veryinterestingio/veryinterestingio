			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate, you only need 3 numbers to calculate an engine's displacement:
The bore of the piston (the diameter of the piston)
The stroke of the piston (the distance between the 'highest' and 'lowest' point of its travel</p>
<p>Punch these two into the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
Volume = Ï€ <em> r^2 </em> h (Ï€ is pi, if it isn't clear in your font)</p>
<p>And then the third number you need is number of pistons, e.g. 4 for a 4-cylinder.</p>
<p>So, if your bore is 100mm (diameter = 100, radius = 50), and your stroke is also 100mm, you get:
3.14 <em> 50^2 </em> 100 = 785000 mm^3 AKA 785 cubic centimeters (aka &quot;cc&quot;) per cylinder</p>
<p>AKA 0.785 (~.8) liters per cylinder.  If you then have a 4-cylinder engine of that, you have 0.785L*4 = 3.14L (~3.2L) (And yes, most companies will round up if they're close to the next tenth of a liter or whole number)</p>
<p>More common these days are cylinders with individual displacement of about 500cc or .5L per cylinder.  4 of those make up a 2.0L 4-cylinder, or a 3.0L 6-cylinder, etc... there are infinite variations, but the industry has largely settled near there for mass-market passenger vehicles.</p>
<p>Note that the shape of the piston face and cylinder head don't matter here, because you're calculating the area swept by the piston face, and the piston face doesn't change shape, so you can calculate it as if it were flat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to get further into the weeds, while displacement is 'essentially' a measure of how much the air/fuel mix can expand, one of the (many) reasons you can't simply compare different engines based on their displacement is that another key factor is: Compression ratio.</p>
<p>While the volume in the combustion chamber at 'top dead center' (IE the smallest the combustion chamber gets) does not contribute to displacement.. the compression ratio is the ratio of the size of the chamber at its smallest to its largest, which also impacts how much the air/fuel mix can expand.</p>
<p>Displacement measures the total volume of the expansion, but compression ratio measures the magnitude of the expansion.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<p>If a cylinder moves up and down displacing 500cc of volume, and at TDC there's 500cc in the combustion chamber, but at its bottom-dead-center (BDC), there's 1000cc in its compression chamber, that would be a 2:1 compression ratio.</p>
<p>But if another engine has a cylinder that also moves up and down displacing 500cc of volume, but there's only 100cc in the chamber at TDC, and 600cc in the chamber at BDC, that would be a 6:1 compression ratio, and the second engine would certainly make more power, despite having the same displacement.  More common compression ratios are 6:1-20:1 (with most passenger cars between 8:1 and 12:1)</p>
<p>Air and fuel (or just air in modern direct injection cars that inject fuel directly into the cylinder right before ignition) are pumped into the cylinder while the piston is being drawn away from the cylinder head, and then the valve letting air/fuel in closes, and the cylinder compresses the air/fuel mixture into a smaller area before igniting it.</p>
<p>Compressing it makes the expansion more violent and powerful, allowing more of the energy in the air/fuel mixture to be used to move the piston.  So the higher the compression ratio, the more efficient the engine is at using its fuel, but the larger the displacement, the more fuel it likely uses.</p>
<p>Both tend to result in more power, but you can make other trade-offs like using less fuel but a higher compression ratio to get the same power with less fuel consumption</p>
<p>Lots of other factors are piled on top of this. A car with a low compression ratio but with an external compressor (such as a turbocharger or supercharger) can extract more power from its fuel than a car with a higher compression ratio that doesn't have an external compressor (depending on how much that external compressor compresses the air).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I don't know what that is, but I'm guessing it's in something other than a circular round cylinder. Sounds like a simple calculus problem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation. (I've heard terms like &quot;bore&quot; and &quot;stroke&quot; in this context a few times and just pretended to know what they mean because they're such small, simple words. Personally I don't see them being good terminology, as you could just use &quot;cross-section (for either area or diameter info)&quot; and &quot;length/height/base&quot;)</p></div>		</li>
