			<div class="markdown"><p>First, it would still be 60 Hz, it would just be off half the time. The cycle in a sine wave is from two points at the same value and slope, or more simply, from peak to peak.</p>
<p>Second, if he had a half-decent converter, it would be 120 Hz, because it would flip the polarity, leaving you with an absolute sine wave, going from 0 to max positive instead of max negative to max positive. But almost no one notices flicker at over 100 Hz. A very high quality converter will also smooth out the sine wave, and if this is done to above the threshold for the LED, you will have a continuous light, even with an AC power source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>60Hz means it does 60 full cycles per second, so it will flick on and off 60 times per second (it's just that it will spend half of that time off and half of that time on). Or if you get a half decent LED bulb, it will have a simple rectifier circuit that will keep it on constantly with no flickering.</p></div>		</li>
