			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a new development being built locally, they're building a new school, shops and park and ride (basic carpark) but no pub. It'll probably have retail space that could hold a pub but I'd be surprised if a brewery would have enough funds to out bid a new Aldi or m and s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always thought the way they build these places is so backwards. Sure it looks pretty having a row of finished houses at the front but bloody hell, all site traffic has to try navigate their way through these houses to get to where the building is happening and these days they do not leave alot of space between them.</p>
<p>Just one huge cluster fuck at the site entrance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and it’s filthy. I know of a site where the building company paid the existing residents nearby like £1,000 per month for deep cleaning their house, cos of the dust. Safe to say, the houses never got cleaned lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really dont get it, as someone that worked on these sites for over 15 years it makes zero sense. The quickest, cheapest way of building is to start at the furthest point from your access and work backwards. That way nothing gets in the way, nothing that is completed gets damaged by traffic be it vehicle or pedestrian.</p>
<p>But no, they start at the access and deliver everything to the back of the site.</p>
<p>The amount of times ive seen ground workers spend all day replacing kurb stones that have been damaged by trucks doing deliveries, must be costing the main contractors alot of money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandpa worked in the construction of Brasilia, Brazil's capital, planned and built from scratch in the 50s and 60s. It became the capital in 1960 (before then it was Rio de Janeiro). Today it's a city of 3 million people. Once of the things I like about the city is that, at least in the urban area proper, there are no traffic lights: every road goes under or over every intersection.</p>
<p>Anyway, your description pretty much fits what they did, although Brasilia is a bigger scale than local developments. They had to built everything from scratch including power plants. All the administrative buildings of a modern capital, on top of living areas, areas, for foreign embassies, schools of all types, entertainment, etc. They began transferring families as administration buildings and enough houses/schools/stores/parks got ready.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly tight-curve ramps, if you're in one of the major connecting arteries. If you're inside one of the superquadras (superblocks), there are no intersections. Usually a street loops around a neighborhood and provides direct offshots into cul-de-sacs. There are local streets connecting superblocks by using roundabouts.</p>
<p>If you want to go somewhere in a neighboring or nearby superblock, you take the local street, go through a couple of roundabouts, and connect to the main street in that superblock. If you want to go somewhere not very close, you take your local main street, loop until you get to the entrance of a major artery, take the ramp and drive. You might be able to get off directly into your destination superblock, or you take one of the curved ramps to connect to a different artery and get to the destination superblock that way. Once there, you loop around until you find the entrance to the cul-de-sac you're looking for.</p>
<p>Have a look at Google Maps, it's easier to see than to explain.</p></div>		</li>
