			<div class="markdown"><p>More transistors is only half the picture. These engineers all saw they were getting diminishing returns on transistor count and that a purely physical approach to chip speed wasn't enough to remain competitive, so since ~2000 or so we saw a new method of speed up chips.</p>
<p>The idea that up until then CPUs just ran a program's instructions like reading the steps in a cookbook, the result is fine but sometimes you end up waiting inbetween steps for other parts to be ready.</p>
<p>However the new idea was to design the CPU to look over the recipe to find bits that you could prepare earlier so when your program runs there isn't any waiting, everything you need is already calculated. Basically if you don't know if you're going to add carrot or tomato, just chop up both and when it comes time you add the one you need and discard the other.</p>
<p>This idea is called speculative execution and is responsible for a huge chunk of the performance increases we've seen in the last couple decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely! The architecture guys are responsible for a fair chunk of the performance gains (us hardware guys just like to take the credit). For very large systems (image recognition, facial recognition, etc) radically different non-Von Nuemann architectures (parallel/neuromorphic computing) are becoming more common because the types of CPUs traditionally used in computers would be incredibly inefficient.</p>
<p>Transistor scaling is also limited with heat dissipation and power consumption so there will be a point where more transistors really doesn't buy you much if you can't effectively utilize all of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/udlMSe5-zP8?t=4067" target="_blank">John Carmack was just on Joe Rogan's podcast</a> and mentioned that &quot;the end is in sight&quot; for how small chips can get due to quantum tunneling. he does say hes holding out hope for things like carbon nano-tube wiring or photonic processing to potentially facilitate further advancement, but they seem to be somewhat theoretical concepts at the moment. a lot of the conversation was over my head, but it was very interesting nonetheless. I timestamped that youtube link right at the part he is discussing this topic, but the whole thing was worth a watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I'll definitely give it a watch. Chip scaling will definitely become a more difficult task as we start to run into fundamental laws of physics and it will be interesting to see how far the industry will be able to evolve in the next few years. Wiring is actually one of the next challenges they are trying to address. It's sort of interesting. Just like your house, a chip uses copper for all of the &quot;wires&quot; because it's a great electrical conductor. The weird thing is that if you shrink your &quot;wires&quot; to be REALLY small, copper loses some of that conductivity. Carbon nanotube wires might be far off, but I think we'll be seeing some different metals in the not-so-distant future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely hats off the engineers at ASML. It's actually very cool (and complicated) how they create the EUV &quot;light&quot; (more appropriately x-rays). They shoot a laser at molten tin droplets and because these tin droplets get excited, they release EUV. The photons then get focused using mirrors which and it eventually is used to write onto wafers. </p>
<p>Even 10 years ago I think if anybody had proposed you are going to use a tool that relies on mirrors that constantly get coated in molten metal droplets for your work, you would have been laughed out of the building, but at this point everybody (Intel, Samsung, TSMC, etc) is so desperate they really only have one choice. Intel and Samsung were so desperate for EUV they invested billions into ASML just to get the tech off the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an intern in the asml development &amp; engineering department. The absolute scale of the operation that ASML runs and the precision they achieve with their euv machines is unbelievable. In my onboarding training they visualized the precision of euv. If a chip their machines produce would be scaled up to the size of the entire Netherlands. The connections between the modules wouldn't be much thicker than a thumb and they can lay them in a centimeter precision. I'm not completely sure how accurate that representation is but it definetly is amazing.</p>
<p>Right now EUV is still an extremely expensive technique and only big players like apple can afford to invest in it. Prices of our EUV machines are 100+ million excluding service and running costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EUV is being used for production chips already though, just very sparsely due to the cost so only critical features are made with euv. Right now the challenge with euv is power and reliability. And ASML is putting alot of work into getting those aspects better. Source: work on ASML euv source.</p></div>		</li>
