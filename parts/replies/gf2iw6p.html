			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the main reason. Clinical trials have to follow strict protocols. What’s occurring now is called interim monitoring and it’s incredibly important for the safety and legitimacy of the trial. The key difference here is that interim monitoring is not typically released to the public. A typical drug will take 7-10+ years to come to market. Granted this isn’t a drug, but the process is similar. What’s occurring is already incredibly expedited, the public just doesn’t see all of the other phases or have anything to compare it to because release interim data is what’s unusual. Fully completing all of the phases of a clinical trial are absolutely vital, unless the evidence is overwhelming enough, at a pre-specified threshold, during interim monitoring to stop early (for either positive or negative reasons), which is not the case here. If the studies were to be stopped now, there would not be sufficient evidence to produce and distribute the vaccines. And there’s good reason for that, even if it doesn’t seem like it right now. Distributing an ineffective or unsafe pharmaceutical is catastrophic. </p>
<p>TLDR: statistics is one big unknown. To prevent pharma and other entities from taking advantage of that, studies must be completed to and obtain certain pre-specified values or we’d be dying from unsafe and ineffective pharmaceuticals at a faster rate than any disease. The weird part is that we see this intermediate data, not that’s its taking so long (it’s moving unbelievably quickly).</p>
<p>Edit to add: also a clinical trial requires some type of control group (in this case placebo). So continuing it as a “clinical trial” vs just mass distribution (which I explain above why we can’t do) would require enrolling significantly more people in the placebo arm, which is also not ideal ahead of a bigger roll out. In cases like this, there are adaptive designs that allow a higher percentage of participants to receive the vaccine as interim data shows promise, but again, this would have needed to be pre-specified and well justified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can adjust for expanded sample sizes and this is fairly routinely done in modern trial design. Pfizer did this in their phase 3. There are also robust methods for adding additional midpoint analyses and for switching endpoints. All of these things can be done poorly but can be accounted for as well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, it seems like simply collecting a new sample (larger sample, same size, whatever) would be a problem, too. Either way you're submitting your hypothesis to multiple tests and need to adjust the false positive rate control to account for that.</p></div>		</li>
