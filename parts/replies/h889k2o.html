			<div class="markdown"><p>So everyone's skin is different. This would affect the time it takes for the dark circles to disappear. However, 6-8 hours of sleep everyday is the only way of gradually getting rid of them if it was caused due to sleep deprivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that if it's <em>not</em> caused by sleep deprivation you could sleep the exactly perfect amount of time and not have them go away. I mean they'd probably not be as bad as if your sleep was terrible, but they'll still exist.</p>
<p>Some people are prone to dark circles from anxiety, underlying health conditions, and just general bodily stuff. One of my exes slept a solid 8 hours a day, ate really healthy, and always had &quot;light bags.&quot; He went to the doctor a few times, had a sleep test, talked to a nutritionist, and they only said &quot;sometimes that's just how you look.&quot;</p>
<p>TLDR: </p>
<p>Standards of beauty are rarely met by the average person. Even if you sleep well, eat well, and exercise, you might not line up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bruises are the color they are bc of trauma to tissue, rupturing blood vessels which allows blood to leak into the tissue; it's blood that's coagulated and in the process of being reabsorbed. Roused Panda is saying the color is result of vessel dilation, which should only give a ruddy or flushed appearance, not purple/brown/yellow, which are colors usually associated w bruising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik bruises turn the colours that they do as the blood that is pooled there is &quot;cleaned&quot; away part by part. That's why they can turn green or blue</p></div>		</li>
