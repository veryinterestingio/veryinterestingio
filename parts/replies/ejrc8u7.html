<p>Rich people: this is where most of the venture capitalists are. This is probably the most important factor now to enable new startups, without investors, you can't create startups. </p>
<p>Nerds: UC Berkeley and Stanford. </p>
<p>Location: Without taking into account the cost of living, this is arguably one of the best locations to live in, perfect weather all year-round, access to the ocean, the beach, natural parks, interesting cities (San Francisco). </p>

<p>NYC is trying to play catchup with Cornell Tech, but from what I hear it is not going as well as it was planned. I am not sure why; but it is difficult to naturally create the emergent behavior that happened in Silicon Valley. </p></div>		</li>
