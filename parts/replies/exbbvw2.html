			<div class="markdown"><p>follow up question: what if we point the IR through a transparent object like glass or acrylic? do we get the temperature of the object behind the glass or we just get the temperature of the glass itself?</p>
<p>also, in the similar situation, is possible to measure the temperature of a glass of water? or the ir will just pass through?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get the temperature of the glass, or something like that as you'll have to dial in your emissivity. Expensive flir cameras also have settings like reflective energy if you are shooting into hot spaces (furnace) with lots of radiative energy around the object you're shooting. It's a bit of an art.
As to the glass of water, you could shoot that since the water and the glass will probably be the same temp after some normalizing time. For calibration I often use black paint or electrical tape on the object I am measuring to get rid of the effects colour can have on my temperature reading. Paint the glass and now you have an emissivity of 0.99. Point your gun at it and you'll get a pretty close reading. That being said a thermocouple in the water would be better here, all about the right tool for the job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can definitely measure the temp of water, I use IR thermometer to measure my aquarium temps.  </p>
<p>Basically it comes down to how opaque that substance is to infrared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IR is a wide spectrum, so it can depend a lot on what your camera is calibrated to &quot;see.&quot;  The near visible IR can go through glass but the thermal spectrum generally can't.
When using the Thermal Imaging Camera pointed at glass I usually see a reflection as if looking in a mirror.  So you are not seeing the temp of the object or of the object behind the glass, but rather the reflection of the IR energy.
This isn't perfect, some energy goes through the transparent object and it goes both ways so you can end up with a slightly distorted or out of focus reflection.  Again, will depend on camera calibration.
Just my experience working with TICs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was shooting IR film, it was fascinating how different materials reflected in the IR band.</p>
<p>The emissity of an object has very little to do with it's visible emissity. Black cotton t-shirts would be IR reflective, White leather would be IR absorbing. </p>
<p>One exception I noted was US army combat fatigues. The camo pattern was effective into the near IR range!</p>
<p>Granted, this is near IR, not far IR, but the color of an object has little bearing on it's IR reflectivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is getting out of ELI5 territory and out of my area of knowledge unfortunately. Maybe someone else can chime in.</p>
<p>I believe it's because we approximate everyday objects as black body emitters (perfect radiation absorption and emission material) even though it's not. But I'm truly not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the colour doesn't matter because the IR wave is separate from the visible spectrum wave, and the thermometer is only picking up the IR wave</p>
<p>reflective does matter though. If the surface is shiny your reading is innacurate</p></div>		</li>
