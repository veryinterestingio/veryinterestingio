			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Up to 6 months every bit of training goes into their little sponge brains. They don't want to leave you, their recall is excellent, you start to believe you've nailed the whole dog ownership thing...</p>
<p>Then the challenges start. It's almost like they learn to ask &quot;why?&quot;. And by 10 months you're tearing your hair out wondering where you went wrong and why your pup is broken. But they come out of it eventually! (And all that training comes back).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses do the same. Years 2-5 can be pretty challenging. Also not totally age related, but after about 6 months under saddle, when it no longer takes all their brainpower to stay upright with a rider, they notice the big world out there and sometimes what you tell them goes down as fake news.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of trainers don't believe in this phase, what can happen is a lot of owners pull back on the amount of training and crate time they were putting in. Since they haven't been doing the same thing they were before the dog now has more access to things that may get them in trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dog’s size and energy levels are also going up. People don’t adjust training or exercise to account for the larger, smarter and more athletic dog. It’s a reason why you see dogs given up in the 8 month to 2 year age. A lot of people don’t realize how much they relied on being able to pick up, manhandle, and outrun a puppy until the puppy is too big to physically control and the dog can outpace you without effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I see the same patterns of frustration in parents when the kids are in the 2-5 age range. The kids never learned to listen and the parents would just physically stop them, never check to see if kids will actually &quot;follow commands&quot; without intervention. Then they get bigger and start running around and the lack of follow through starts to become very obvious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool but cognitive psychologists, comparative biologists and animal behaviorists deal with this all the time, there are studies and everything. Yes, owners giving pups too much freedom too fast is an issue but it's hardly proof against normal developmental changes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never said there is no developmental changes, but that a huge portion of what people call a teenage phase is due to lack of structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just about to ask how trainers of work dogs (guides, K9s, etc) avoid this phase, since you have to be able to rely on these dogs always perfectly following their orders.</p></div>		</li>
