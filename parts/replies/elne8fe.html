			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true that some companies share data with third parties and law enforcement. Different companies have varying policies with regards to both of these sharing practices. In July of 2018, The Future for Privacy Forum released a set of <a href="https://fpf.org/2018/07/31/privacy-best-practices-for-consumer-genetic-testing-services/" target="_blank">Privacy Best Practices</a> for direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies. These best practices indicate that “Genetic Data may be disclosed to law enforcement entities without Consumer consent when required by valid legal process.” Since these best practices are voluntary, not all companies subscribe to the standard of requiring a valid legal process for law enforcement. Basically, companies who have signed on to adopt these best practices are saying that they will not turn over customer data to the police unless they are legally compelled to do so by a subpoena. In the cases that have been solved recently, law enforcement was primarily working with companies that are open to collaborating with police investigations and were not subpoenaed.</p>
<p>Not all companies have adopted the best practices, so it is up to you, the consumer, to read the terms of service and company privacy policies to understand how your data might be accessed by law enforcement. <strong><em>- Rebecca Hong, NHGRI Policy Analyst</em></strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t have a problem with my DNA being used to solve crimes. The implication of public access to DNA can be scary for unseen reasons. The one potential use (that I know of) of it that does scare me is its use by insurance companies. For instance, would insurance be able to deny coverage bc you have a marker for Parkinson’s? Or bc you have first degree relatives with significant medical problems?</p></div>		</li>
