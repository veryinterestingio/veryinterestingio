			<div class="markdown"><p>Judging from this recent track, the actual flight is about 40 minutes. They cruise at about 450 mph. However, they only spend about 1/3rd of the flight at cruise. They start the descent about halfway through the flight. They spend so much time in climb and descent, there isn't that much time spent at cruise speed. Add another 13 minutes taxing before departure and 23 minutes taxing after arrival. So most of the time you are on the plane, it's going pretty slow.</p>

<p>Very short flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the descent is half the flight, why go that high anyways? I know nothing of planes or flying btw you might have to ELI5 laws, physics etc relating to the answer heh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also they can't just take off right at the direction they are flying, each airport has flying lanes they need to use to get above 10k, so they might have to fly X miles away from Boston before turning to Boston.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true too. I have flown between New York and Baltimore, just about the entire flight is either the takeoff or landing process. Maybe you have a good 10 mins for cruising before decent. If the airport is busy the landing part can be the longest lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, these departure routes are established to either keep aircraft safe by avoiding mountainous terrain and the like, or to keep noise in residential areas to a minimum. As there are a lot of aspects to consider, there is a whole profession dedicated to this, called procedure design!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I flew into Boston from Chicago I was like oh cool there's Boston and the coast and... why are we missing it and going over the ocean!?!?</p>
<p>Oh right, loop around to land since the runway landing point is at the coast heading inland.  It also felt like we were going down in the ocean but then suddenly, terra firma and touchdown.</p>
<p>Weirdest airport of the few I've been through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another problem is you have three busy airports (Newark, Laguardia, and JFK) in very close proximity to each other and getting in the way of each other during flights.  </p>
<p>The best thing that could happen for the average person flying in or out of NY is to close down Laguardia but the politics would never allow that to happen.  The old joke is what's the best way to be on time out of Laguardia?  Hail a cab to JFK then book a flight.</p></div>		</li>
