<ol>
<li>Storms and larger wind patterns will blow waves in other directions, but land heats up faster during the day than water, so the air over land rises creating a convection cell that brings in that nice sea breeze. This wind is gentle and will not produce large ocean swells, but will produce smaller waves typically referred to as chop, that comes ashore. </li>
<li>If you go to an island there will be waves coming in to shore at all points on the island. They will likely be larger on one side than the other due to that side facing towards the dominant ocean swell. </li>
<li>Refractions causes waves to bend more directly towards shore as they enter shallower water and slow down. If you google &quot;shoreline wave refraction&quot; you can learn more about this and see photos of it occuring.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 is right, but 3 is the answer you're looking for as it explains why near shore waves only move in one direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely true though. A south swell in southern California will come in differently at the beach causing more waves to break left. A steep north west will cause more rights. They do break differently depending on the direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you mean “waves” do you mean surf? Like the kind that crash onto the sand? The random chaotic mechanical motion of the water levels go everywhere and there are plenty of physics demonstrations that show that waves going in different directions don’t really interfere with each other (less some small mechanical losses).</p>
<p>As for why you see surf on the beach? As per point 3 - the waves have a certain wavelength, and IIRC from my sedimentology class, when the depth of the water reaches about 1/2 the wavelength, the top part of the wave is moving too fast for the bottom layer and surf forms. Or something like that :) it’s been 30 years since I’ve taken the class.  But generally, the waves break into surf because of shear forces that arise from the sea bottom.</p></div>		</li>
