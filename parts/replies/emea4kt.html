			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel this. I've started to make a habit of drinking some of the water I put into my kettle for coffee. Now I know, &quot;coffee dehydrates you!&quot; I've found for me, just that bit of water before really helped to up my water intake for the rest of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I heard somewhere the the whole “coffee dehydrates you” thing is bologna because yes, coffee is a diuretic but the amount of liquid you intake from drinking the coffee is greater than the water you would expel from it being a diuretic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I can totally relate to this. Sometimes after working in the yard under the summer sun, or just getting out of a hot sauna - I accidentally eat a bag of potato chips or chicken wings instead of drinking water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are dehydrated before you are thirsty</p>

<p>Is there a source for the idea? I was informed that it was invented by manufacturers of bottled water. How is &quot;dehydration&quot; measured? What happens if you are &quot;dehydrated&quot; for an hour?</p></div>		</li>
