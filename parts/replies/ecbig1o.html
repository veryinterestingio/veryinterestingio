			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard that deaf kids start “talking” (ie purposefully using signs to communicate) at an earlier age than hearing kids because you develop the kind of muscle control needed to make signs with your hands before you develop the muscle control needed to say words. If true, that implies that there is a stage where most babies are intellectually capable of language, but not physically capable. Is that true? When is that stage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it’s well documented.</p>
<p>Some experts propose that the friction between the child’s understanding of speech and physical inability to correctly use speech causes frustration that greatly contributes to what we call the “terrible twos”. </p>
<p>Edited to add: this is not to say that learning sign will magically fix the “terrible twos”. It’s just that learning to communicate is tough, and so that’s a tough age range to go through <em>partly because of that</em>. Having more tools to communicate is generally always a great thing, but other problems will obviously remain. (for example, the fact that kids of that age are also angry to learn that they do not, in fact, rule the world)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine was very early on verbal development and had no real terrible stage (he had his moments but they were few and far between).</p>
<p>Could be that we avoided it because of the talking.  But some meltdowns are just meltdowns.  He flipped out like an alcoholic being cut off if we gave him a single cup of juice but dared to say no to refills.   We just stopped buying juice to solve the problem, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s why many hearing parents (myself included) teach babies ‘baby signs’ which allow pre-verbal infants to communicate. My 14-month old son can sign ‘more’, ‘please’,  ‘cow’ and ‘sorry’. Some babies can sign tens of signs before starting to speak!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't have sources but this is likely true. I've heard that you can teach your baby signs for bottles and changing diapers and they can then communicate if they're hungry or if they've shit themselves. Basically they learn to wave about In a certain way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did this with my son. Taught him signs for eat, more, milk, mama, dada and a couple more. He started picking up on using them by about 9 months. He didn't start actually talking until more like 16-18 months.</p>
<p>At just about 4 now he never stops talking... But it's mostly cute as hell. And the random stuff that comes out of his mouth some times is hilarious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And a lot of replies are just pedantic for its own sake.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the numbers in the sides on a six sided die are over 2, so your chances of getting less than 3 arent very good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, your chances are still 33%, which is pretty good. Your chances of getting a 1 aren't very good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are actually no numbers on a standard die. There are only dots.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those aren't dots. They're pips.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Many dice have printed numbers on them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Its possible to construct a die where it counts from 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, so your odds if less than 3 are really 50%&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have a special die for a game and it actually has three 1s and three 2s, so you can only get numbers less than 3. Your odds are very good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it was a four sided die, going from 1 to 4, you'd also have a 50% chance of rolling less than 3.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just dont use a die where they put consecutive numbers adjacent to each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you know what you're doing, you can toss them so you always get the number you want, so you can get less than 3 more than a number greater than 2.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just FYI, it's only DICE if there's more than one. One is just a DIE.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality" target="_blank">law of triviality</a> in management or bikeshedding among computer nerds and describes how people give disproportionate weight to trivial issues because they understand those instead of the complex big picture. <a href="http://bikeshed.com/" target="_blank">To quote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Original author] Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless discussions.</p>
<p>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so vast, so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it, andrather than try, they fall back on the assumption that somebody else checked all the details before it got this far.</p>
<p>A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one of those over a weekend, and still have time to watch the game on TV.  So no matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with your proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing his job, that he is paying attention, that he is <em>here</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So people will read a long post, their eyes will glaze over, but this one example with the dice, they understand that one. So they'll comment about it.<br />
And then more readers will arrive, their eyes will glaze over but then they read the reply with the dice, and because that one makes sense to them, they'll upvote it.</p>
<p>The same goes on everywhere people want to be involved. Politics (&quot;let's solve migration issues with a wall&quot;, &quot;all Trump voters are idiots&quot;), science (&quot;Global warming can't be real, see this snowball?&quot;), society (&quot;There are two genders because chromosomes!&quot;), psychology (&quot;Just be happy and not depressed&quot;), medicine (&quot;I took this sugarpill and now I feel better&quot;) or whatever: People pick a simple and irrelevant part of a large and complex problem and argue for hours about it.</p></div>		</li>
