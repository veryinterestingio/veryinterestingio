			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect, the xenon did not burn off. Xenon dissipates in relation to the power of reactor, which was only 200 MW. The contradiction is right there in your post, where you reference the fact that it takes 24 hours for the xenon to disappear.</p>
<p>Completely inappropriate to characterize the reactor in this case a 'bomb', since it could never have exploded if not for the tip effect of the control rods, a serious design flaw.</p>
<p>What actually happened was that the central portion of the core was heavily poisoned by xenon, but the lower part of the core developed a positive coefficient of reactivity. The flaw in the control rods then triggered an unstoppable feedback loop and power excursion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I understand what you mean, but I am wondering what the issue would be assuming the engineers successfully brought the reactor's thermal output directly down to 200mw. As I understand it the lack of control rods was what really cinched the disaster. But if the engineers never had to bring the reactor up from ~30mw to 200mw, I assume that an adequate number of control rods would have remained in the reactor. In the book it is claimed that an RBMK reactor operating at that low of a thermal output would be unstable irrespective of the other issues that precipitated the Chernobyl disaster, but I don't exactly understand why that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the reactor is running at full capacity, the production of xenon matches its consumption. If the power is lowered, the production of xenon continues since it is a fission product, but the consumption decreases. This causes the xenon to build up at low power, especially if the reactor has been running at high power for a long period which was the case in the Chernobyl incident. Due to this buildup, the reactor was stuck at low power. To deal with it, the xenon must be allowed to decay, which could take a while (1-3 days).</p>
<p>The reason the reaction became localized to the bottom of the reactor, causing a lot of the instability and the inability of the reactor operators to see the temperature spike, is because liquid water is better at slowing down neutrons than steam. Slowing down neutrons increases their reactivity with fissile material, so this accelerated the reaction in the bottom of the reactor.</p>
<p>The fatal mistake was re-inserting the carbon-tipped rods, but after they had removed most of the control rods in an attempt to overcome the xenon poisoning, the reactor would have been in a state which was headed to meltdown. This is why they pressed the button which lowered all the control rods at once; they attempted to avoid a meltdown and caused an explosion instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was no attempt to avoid a meltdown; this is a myth.</p>
<p>AZ-5 was pressed in order to conclude the experiment, when there were no emergency signals being generated by the reactor. The bottom of the core was primed for a power surge, but the operators did not know that.</p>
<p>In fact the reactor should have been shut down 36 seconds earlier, but this was apparently overlooked, due to a reactor trip being disabled during a different turbine experiment that night.</p>
<p>So in short, yes the reactor probably would have melted down if the operators had sat on their hands. But the plan was always to shut down the reactor from the start, so this in an irrelevant detail. If you try to park on a hill but leave the car in gear, the car will crash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Units are important. You keep using &quot;mw&quot; (milliwatts) when the appropriate unit is MW (megawatts). Most of those reading this know what you mean by the context (I'm not sure it's possible to have a 200 milliwatt reactor output), but it may confuse other readers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they pulled out all but 7 or 8 rod equivalents (you can't actually just count the rods, it's complicated).</p>
<p>And there was possibly a computer glitch that means they actually had 15 of them in there.</p></div>		</li>
