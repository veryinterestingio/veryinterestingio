			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that's how the succubus and incubus became things.  Rape was pretty common way back so when a woman claimed she had been raped in the middle of the night they would say it was an incubus who came and did it.  If the dude was caught in the act they'd accuse the woman of being a succubus who had seduced him</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, there's considerable evidence that waking up in the middle of the night for about an hour and using that time to pray, write, have a snack or commit crimes was actually pretty common prior to the industrial revolution,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FYI, there's basically only 1 historian who contends this: Roger Ekirch. And his evidence has some issues with it too; namely that while there's references to a &quot;first sleep&quot; in a lot of literature, there's very little actual descriptions of the behaviour he describes. There's also significantly less references to &quot;second sleep&quot;, and &quot;first sleep&quot; often has drastically inconsistent timings around it, regularly even being during the day.</p>
<p>Biological evidence actually suggests that a shorter nap in the early afternoon is more natural, followed by a solid block of sleep at night.</p></div>		</li>
