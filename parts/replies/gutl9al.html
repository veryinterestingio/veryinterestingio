			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not! At least all the forms of mindful meditation that I'm aware of are not about not having thoughts. Actually the opposite, sort of: paying attention to my thoughts (here's the key:) <em>without attachment to them</em>. </p>
<p>Many people give up on meditation because they can't make their mind &quot;blank&quot; and therefore think they can't meditate. But the actual work of mindful meditation, the key piece you have to have to built the brain muscle you are trying to built, is that your mind does get distracted and wander off in thought. As soon as you catch it, back to the breath (usually the breath is the anchor). That &quot;back to it&quot; mental motion is the exercise. Not the mind staying blank part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but isn't that not thinking about nothing? Our brain's still checking we're breathing, that everything's going correctly in the background, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue there is a difference between the brain doing its normal functions and thinking which is an entirely more complicated process. Like your arm moving by reaction away from a fire takes less effort than conciously moving your arm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your arm moving reaction away from a fire doesn't connected to a brain. Spinal cord  is able to manage this kind of extra urgent movement. Ants and cockroaches can confirm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things like breathing that you do subconsciously don't count imo. This will likely be the only time this week I think about my breathing. Its like growing hair. Im actively doing it all the time, but I've never once tried to. It just happens. Your brain can be thinking about nothing and still perform hundreds or thousands of functions that it always has, that were never noticed.</p></div>		</li>
