			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I phrased my question poorly. I meant, sound is transmitted via vibration of air, right? So the same air is vibrating  for different types of sounds at the same time, so why don't different sound waves distort each other? Like if there are 5 people are speaking at the same time, it doesn't turn into a jumble of noise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s better to think of as time. One wave is a fraction of a second. So these sounds do join together but over time your brain can determine sounds. </p>
<p>Think if it as waves on the ocean. Not so much the breaking waves on the beach, but the ones further out to sea. Some big waves might come up behind smaller waves but the waves interact together but continue propagating. It’s like when you see different waves cross over behind a boat. While big waves may overpower smaller waves we’re not looking at the size of the waves, more how many waves and how close together they are. Looking at tens of thousands of waves you can understand the current.</p>
<p>What you are talking about can however happen to a degree, it’s sometimes a problem when things are recorded. It’s called phase cancellation and it’s what’s used in noise canceling headphones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the sounds are all waves. The waves don't really add up to one total wave, like colors do for sight, but are still somewhat separate.</p>
<p>As an example, try drawing 3 random waves on a piece of paper. Just visually, you can still probably distinguish the three from one another. It is kind of like that, but 3D (meaning they're even less likely to fully stack up), and your brain is really good at telling the difference, usually.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if they're too similar (or too many), your brain can't always split them up and you can't quite tell. Things like the chirp of a fire alarm with a low battery can be weirdly difficult to locate partially like this.</p>
<p>Your brain is also good at picking certain sounds out of the background, like the voice of a parent or spouse in a crowd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, they do stack up to a single wave that is a summation of sinusoids. But the fundamental aspect of all sinusoidal signals is that they can be decompiled into their sinusoidal components.</p>
<p>We use math to do this, but our brains are hardwired for a similar process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they don't. The sound of pipes in your house can be different, or the bubbling from creation of steam. However, if I put water in a glass at 5C or 95C and swirled it around, assuming everything else could be equal, there would be no difference in sounds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. I can distinguish between sounds. I can tell which which way the sounds are coming from. I can even tell how far away the sounds are.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
