			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you expand on the pear thing? What is right? We struggle where we will get them from the store and they're hard. Get them home they stay hard for a while then all the sudden they're inedibly mushy. Feels like we have no idea when it's going to transition from hard to edible to inedible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a botanist, but as far as I know, ethylene gas (which comes from the fruit itself and is heavily produced by bananas.  That's why you can put unripe fruit in a paper bag with a banana and it'll ripen.) triggers chemical reactions in fruit that break down the chlorophyll changing the fruit's color, and convert starch into sugar, which is why unripe bananas taste like chalk and ripe bananas are sweet and mushy.  The pears are waiting for the trigger to ripen, and when it happens, it happens fast.</p>
<p>Any actual botanists that want to correct me, feel free, this is all secondhand knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to use a banana in a paper bag to ripen my pears. I have no idea if it actually works because I forget they're in the bag until they're mush lol now I just don't buy them anymore unless they're at least close to edible at the store. Same with peaches, f them as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just have to be aware that the pear will choose when you should eat it. Just check it every day and the first day is ripe, congratulations, it's pear day. Tomorrow will be mush day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep pears and apples in tied plastic bags in a crisper drawer on highest humidity, or in untied plastic bags on fridge shelf if you cant use the crisper drawer. Take pears out to ripen as needed, put on counter out of sunlight until soft as you like them. This is from the lady who runs the orchard I went to last week. Her fruit lasts a lot longer than storebought does though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's our issue then. The spot we have them in that isn't refrigerated doesn't get any natural light. So they ripen by oxygen only which seems to slowly eat them away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason why it's ok to have a rare steak but risky as fuck to have a rare burger.
Oxygen only has access to the outside of a steak, but minced beef has that outside all the way through it, it goes bad a lot faster, and you can't be as sure of killing off bacteria in mince as you can with steak cooked below 60c</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also &quot;blade-tenderized&quot; meat you have to be careful with. It's safer than burger, but the blades have the tendency to push that bacteria into the center of the meat. Medium (145F/63C) is the lowest you should be consuming store-bought steaks at unless you can be absolutely certain it was not tenderized before you bought it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the source of the ground beef. If you, the restaurant or the grocery store are grinding the beef fresh in-house from whole cuts, go ahead and have medium rare burgers. But I would never, ever, ever buy a tube of pre-ground beef and serve that below done. Pre-ground beef is pretty horrible stuff and comes from all kinds of cuts and scraps from the cutting-room floor jumbled together and is rife with bacterial exposure. In this case, the oxygen exposure is dangerous because it lets bacteria thrive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you are an at risk person i wouldn't worry about medium rare burgers. If you are immuno compromised, elderly or under 12 i would only do medium well and up.</p>
<p>There is a risk of getting something from ground beef but tbh its so low that its not worth caring about unless it has a real chance of being fatal.</p></div>		</li>
