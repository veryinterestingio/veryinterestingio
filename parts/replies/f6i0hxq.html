			<div class="markdown"><p>One last characteristic is the coefficient of restitution of the material. It's a fancy sounding term that describes how much energy is kept when the material bounces back instead of turning into heat. To vibrate, the material needs to swing back and forth in the air. If the kinetic energy is being converted into heat, it is not being converted into sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There sure are! In another comment I mentioned viscoelastic acrylics, which do a pretty fantastic job of converting motion into heat. I'm not too sure about someone besides superman slapping any of these material until they get hot. Your arms don't generate that much power (tens of watts at most), and most metals tend to do a pretty solid job of springing back to shape without loosing too much energy. It's one great reason we make springs out of steel instead of play-dough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If vibranium is real, where would it place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vibranium, from what I understand, would seem to have a really high CoR. One exotic class  of materials that have an exceptionally high CoR would be metallic glasses. They are made by solidifying molten metals at such a high rate that there is not enough time for the molecules to arrange themselves into regular crystal lattices, which definitionally makes them a glass. The opposite version of this process might be how you can cool molten silicon at exceptionally slow rates if you want to make a big ass single crystal instead of your common everyday silicate glass. People do this in industry to slice into semiconductor wafers to make microchips.  </p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum would be things like viscoelastic acrylic, which is often made in thin sheets with a pressure sensitive adhesive on one side. It gets used all the time for sound deadening or vibration damping on sheet metal panels when you don't want to add a bunch of weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should realize that  resistance to scratches (i.e hardness) is a totally different property than resistance to shattering (i.e. brittleness).  Glass is harder than steel  (glass can scratch steel) but glass is also way more brittle than steel. And stiffness is yet a third property.</p>
<p>Captain America's shield has  all 3 properties.  So asking for qualification about a single number  (i.e. stiffness) isn't going to tell you how a  close an existing material is to vibranium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No... he's saying that sound is a property of multiple factors, material and geometry of the object, contributing to its macro physical properties</p>
<p>(e.g. a thin sheet of aluminium can be torn, the same amount compacted into a cube will be much harder to tear).</p>
<p>The plastic bag is defined by material and shape. It doesn't have the right shape nor the right material to ring at the frequencies we'd associate with a 'ringing bell'.</p>
<p>Using the same material in different configurations... you could certainly get a sound out of it - but it'd be much more akin to the hollow thunk that you'd associate with plastics... or the crinkling crackling of plastics popping and deforming.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any material, plastic bag Vs a plastic bottle. A tight drum skin Vs a loose drum skin, will vibrate depending on its siffness. The stiffer the item the more it vibrates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>what you're referring to is not stiffness, but the tension in the material.</p>
<p>the drum skin material has the same stiffness whether it is loose or tight on a drum</p></div>		</li>
