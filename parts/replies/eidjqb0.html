			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! Back when I was at McConnell AFB, they had a sparrow problem so they brought it 2 female hawks (maybe falcons, I can’t remember).  One ended up laying eggs. Then the hawks killed most of the sparrows and kept reproducing. Then we had a hawk problem instead of a sparrow problem. Bird strikes became a much bigger issue with the bigger birds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that common practice? I used to date a falconer, and I was under the impression that when raptors are brought in, it's standard practice to hire/contract a falconer that has trained birds that will recall so you don't end up introducing wild birds and screwing up the ecology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard of airports bringing in falconers, with trained raptors, and have them scare away the other birds. Since these were trained birds (complete with little hoods, leashes on talons, and falconers keeping them behaving by feeding them mice), that prevents them nesting and reproducing and causing problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only solid reply so far. Some airports may use dogs, falcons, or drones. All of those introduce another hazard. So those are far from the norm. Though I would say zero_karma missed one of the most important control measures, which is habitat control.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Habitat control is the starting point of any Wildlife Hazard Management Plan. Make the area as inhospitable as possible. That means one of the best methods we use is making sure to plant a very specific grass mix. It is the least attractive kind we can get in terms of food and cover. We also make sure to keep it between around 6-10 inches. Too low to provide sufficient cover for critters that raptors may want to eat, high enough to prevent growth of other plants. And the worst home to as many insects as possible. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We are also very careful with water management. We make sure no new wetlands are forming. Because once they do, federal law mandates we have to let them stay. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In fact habitat modification extends up to five miles away from the airport, so our wildife guy will work with local landfills and composting areas to either provide covering materials or anything else that may reduce bird activity. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But once there are birds on the field we do usually use noismakers like the firecrackers in the starter pistol as mentioned. Also we will harass them with our vehicles. And if they are persistent enough, shotguns. Our wildlife specialist uses a few more things such as traps for raptors and small mammals.  Use of effigy is particularly effective with corvids. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This was well over 20 years ago. That thing had to have collapsed since and been replaced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm near Montreal-Trudeau International (CYUL), and I am a plane-spotter who spends a lot of time near the airport photographing planes. We have a team that uses the noisemakers most of the time, as well as trained falcons, which are mostly used for driving off larger birds like geese or ducks. Interestingly, we have about half a dozen snowy owls that spend the winter here (in summer they migrate to the Arctic), all nicknamed &quot;Yuli&quot; by the spotters. They are often close to the runways, but the falconers only drive them off if they are within a few dozen feet of the tarmac, since their presence helps control the populations of songbirds and small mammals pretty effectively. They are also a protected species here (our provincial bird) so they're studied by the same local university that implemented the falcons for wildlife control. There have been strikes involving the owls, but very few. The researchers think the owls have learned over time to stick to &quot;safe&quot; areas of the airfield, and are becoming part of the overall wildlife management program.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually just south of you in BTV. I was aware that YUL had a falconry program. Relatively rare for a commercial airport. Last year we experienced an irruption of snowys and captured four I think. Our impression of them was actually different. Because they spend most of their time in the tundra, they don't know much about people and the danger of vehicles. So we would see them moving at dangerous times. Their saving grace is that they really like to pick a snowbank and just sit there for hours. They don't move unless they have to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case &quot;effigy&quot; means a dead bird. Crows see a dead crow out there and thing &quot;Well, this doesn't seem like a welcoming place&quot; and move on for a while. They also recognize the trucks we use and we can't get very close to them before they fly away. If I want to get closer I will grab a maintenance vehicle that looks different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the thing. You said a &quot;jackdaw is a crow.&quot;</p>
<p>Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.</p>
<p>As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be &quot;specific&quot; like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.</p>
<p>If you're saying &quot;crow family&quot; you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.</p>
<p>So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people &quot;call the black ones crows?&quot; Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.</p>
<p>Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.</p>
<p>It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandad was a falconer and Hartsfield-Jackson frequently hired him to fly his falcon to scare off / kill pigeons. (His falcon was also the mascot for the Atlanta Falcons, for a time, and he’d fly it around the stadium during half time). The falcon is now stuffed on my Aunt’s mantle. </p>
<p>This was back in the 70s/80s, so I don’t know if they still do this. </p></div>		</li>
