			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning that sightings of land that actually weren't antartica at all, were believed to have been. Tierra Del Fuego was thought to be part of terra australis. And it's pretty likely though not proven that the south shetland islands were sighted in the 1500s- certainly there were claims of such and these also were assumed to be part of terra australis.  </p>
<p>So it's not like it was wholly hypothetical- there was &quot;evidence&quot;, which happened to be wrong but still seemed to back the theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that the idea “there’s all this land here that we know about, the other half of the globe must have an equal amount of land to even things out,” despite being wrong, suggests that learned people in that era already had a relatively accurate idea of the overall size of the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 240 bc, some dude knew a place in Egypt where the sun would be directly overhead at noon. (This was known because at the time looking down at a deep well blocked light perfectly and prevented any reflection in the water. Your shadow went straight down.) </p>
<p>Alexandria was 900km from that place.  This was known and measured yearly. </p>
<p>During the solstice at noon he measured the length of a straight rid’s shadow to measure the angle of the suns rays. That's just a right triangle. His angle was about 7 degrees or 1/50th of the full circle. (yeah 7 is 1/50th of 350 and not 360, but we are rounding here. They're tools and measuring units are not the same not standardized like ours. They didn't have kilometers either and used some other unit)</p>
<p>So he multiplied 900km by 50 and got 45,000 km</p>
<p>The earths circumference is 40,000km</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The penguins that live in NZ and South Africa are native to those shores. There are 17 species of penguin, not all of them live in Antarctica, and not all of them live all over Antarctica (Emperors live much further south than Gentoos, for example).</p>
<p>As for people reaching Easter Island... well, boats aren’t new technology.</p></div>		</li>
