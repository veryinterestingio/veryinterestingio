			<div class="markdown"><p>The confusing thing is, gentlemen were also dressed by servants, at least in England. Maybe it was just seen as more important to have a ladies maid than a valet, for those people who couldn't afford both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also men's attire is reasonably simple (formal wear is very similar to old military attire), whereas if you have a super fancy dress with a thousand frills you probably just <em>can't</em> wear it without your maid doing all the buttons and ribbons for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally I agree, though it's worth noting that textiles are often designed to accomodate biological sex traits (e.g. pronounced breasts or wider hips) which isn't <em>always</em> apparent at first glance. The buttons can be a faster, easier way of determining fit than taking them all to the change room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because if you have any sense of aesthetics then you understand that a garment can look appealing in and of itself but not look good on you. Since you’re not trying it on in this scenario, the more information you have about the item itself, the better you are able to judge how it will fit you, if you have any experience with clothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cut is anywhere from dramatically to subtly different between a shirt cut for men vs for women, and the buttons are often the best way to determine that when you’re not trying the item on.</p></div>		</li>
