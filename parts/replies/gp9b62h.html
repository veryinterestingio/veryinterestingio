<p>The total amount of pollution is less, because even if the electricity is 100% non-renewable (see pt 3 below), huge power plants are much more efficient at getting energy from fossil fuels than a combustion engine can possibly be. A gasoline engine turns less than 30% of the fuel's energy into usable work. With electric cars you get more miles per fossil fuel burned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some numbers: Currently in the EU electricity production emits 295g CO₂ per kWh. I assume this is measured at the end user i.e. includes transmission losses. Most electric cars need 13 to 25kWh per 100km (including charging losses). So we end up between 38 and 73g CO₂ per km. Most cars with internal combustion engine emit between 100 and 250g CO₂ per km. They also emit more NOx and particulates right in the middle of our cities.</p>
<p>Electric cars are definitively better, but certainly not emission free. Not driving a car, sharing a ride, taking the train (28g CO₂ per passenger km) etc. is still much better. As you can see from the wide range of the numbers a lot also depends on the specific model of the vehicle. Don’t buy a SUV or truck, even if it’s hybrid/electric.</p>
<p>The internal combustion engine numbers <em>don’t</em> include CO₂ emissions during extraction, processing and transportation of the fuel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was so surprised when I first found this out - most of the fuel is just wasted as heat. The combustion engine is such an inefficient thing, it really should never have been used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were literally no remotely competitive alternatives for a century+, and there still aren't any in many applications like aircraft, ships and heavy duty automobiles. A battery-electric or hybrid airliner physically can't exist with current cutting edge technology.  </p>
<p>We've been using alternative methods where they make sense (like diesel-electric hybrid trains) for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel electric train is more about the fact that its really difficult to make a robust and cost effective gearbox to couple a large diesel engine to the train wheels than about using alternate power sources or gaining efficiency. At train scales, engine&gt;generator&gt;electronics&gt;motor&gt;wheels is simple, robust and efficient enough while also allowing for massive starting torques.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ironically, the most efficient gasoline engines are those currently used in Formula 1. The Mercedes power unit is rated at 50%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it is really <em>that</em> ironic. Fuel efficiency directly impacts how many and how long pit stops you need, so there is a direct benefit to being the most fuel efficient. There was a le Mans car that won one year because it used diesel and had to refuel 80% as often as the other cars.</p></div>		</li>
