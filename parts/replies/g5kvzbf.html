			<div class="markdown"><p>And it just so happens that birds: </p>
<p>1) don't grind seeds up nearly as much as animals with teeth, leaving enough intact to be able to grow when they shart them out.</p>
<p>2) don't feel any spicy sensation from capsaicin, making the spread of hot peppers a lot easier since birds won't be affected by the heat, and other animals are less likely to eat them. Unless, you know, some large population of intelligent masochistic animals cultivates these peppers specifically for the heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah getting humans on your side is the strictly best game plan for plants, look at cannabis as proof, sure some birds will eat the seeds but for the most part it’s entirely dependent on us and it’s an extremely successful plant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of evolution is pure chance. Somewhere along the line a primate randomly developed the ability to see red-green. As such they could find berries and othwr fruit, and therefore had better access to nutrients. This allowed them to survive and reproduce, passing red-green vision on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just chance that our ancient ancestors had the gene combinations capable of producing red-green color sight.  Even now there are people that are trichromatic and can see more calls than the rest of us, but that mutation is a lot less useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be higher.  Red fruit and flowers are extremely perceptible to some animals and act as camouflage to others.   </p>
<p>Same thing with animals.  What says danger to a predator isn't often perceptible to the prey.  Otherwise poison dart frogs and the like would be very unsuccessful hunters themselves.  </p>
<p>Add in the UV spectrum of light, which many animals can perceive and many plants emit and it is a completely different perspective.  How we see the natural world is not universal.</p></div>		</li>
