			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually an interesting thing I found out about yesterday related to this; a process that essentially renders the flesh of a specimen transparent. It's called <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/ghxmWhLMB4JVM8tD6" target="_blank">diaphonization</a>.</p>
<p>An excerpt from atlasobscura.com: </p>
<p>&quot;First developed in 1977 by the scientists G. Dingerkus and L.D. Uhler, the process of diaphonization has also been known as &quot;clearing and staining.&quot; The animals are rendered transparent (the &quot;clearing&quot;) by bathing in a soup of trypsin, a digestive enzyme that slowly breaks down their flesh. They also soak in several batches of bone, muscle, or cartilage dyes (the &quot;staining&quot;), with alizarin red and alcian blue the most commonly used.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a ton of modern tissue clearing techniques based on this idea that are still used in research labs. The most notable recently has been CLARITY which allows imaging through whole organs and is frequently used in the brain and spinal cord. Another one that makes really fascinating images is PEGASOS which has been used to clear and image whole animals without having to dissect out organs.</p></div>		</li>
