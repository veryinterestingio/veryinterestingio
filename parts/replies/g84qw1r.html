			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like I said, it was a hot day, and I jumped straight into a mountain river (forming a small lake there) doing with my head done, and the sudden temperature change made my brain quite go wooosh. I didn't know where up and down was, I did nothing tough and since I had taken a deep breath I had time enough and also slowly drifted upward again by buoyancy.</p></div>		</li>
