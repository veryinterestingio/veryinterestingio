			<div class="markdown"><p>To further answer OP's question: Before the onset of a rain, humidity typically skyrockets and temperatures drop, filling the air with moisture and denser air - hence why &quot;rain has a smell before it rains.&quot; </p>
<p>Colder (denser) air, often associated with rain events, also means there can be a higher concentration of odor molecules per square inch. Similarly, water vapor traps scent molecules, enhancing the odor they release and slowing their diffusion into the air. A combination of cool, moist air results in scent that is heavy and closer to the ground. </p></div>		</li>
