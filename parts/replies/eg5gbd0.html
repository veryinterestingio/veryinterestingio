			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study awhile back confirming that butterflies have the same memories as their caterpillar selves too. I don't have the link though. They proved this by showing them where to find food when they were larvae and watching them fly to it when they later became butterflies or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and when those butterflies were exposed to that same scent, they behaved different than butterflies who were not shocked when they were caterpillars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I heard about that study - they got a response from a caterpillar to a certain stimuli and the butterfly gave the same response, I believe? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that. I read about the &quot;Ship of Theseus&quot; earlier. It is quite interesting because it has a lot of implications especially for neuroscience. Would be interesting to see that be done with a human brain. Would the original personality persist or even more important would the &quot;ego&quot; still be the same. But that's a question that is most likely unsolvable...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't claim to have any knowledge of that besides the very basics, but I can't see how that wouldn't be you if we were able to replicate the brain in an absolutely perfect fashion, I can only understand someone thinking it wouldn't be you if you believe in soul or a similar concept. </p></div>		</li>
