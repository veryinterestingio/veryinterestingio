			<div class="markdown"><p>Ditto.  I am female and people have remarked on how strong I am.  I am not.  But I learned how to use my legs and midsection to move stuff (like rocks).  Ask me to lift anything much above waist height and I am about as strong as an 8 yr old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. That's mostæy not true. Ergonomic postures are something we believed in the 90s. For instance there is a reason why we, today, say the next position is the best position. Because we like movement. Not specific positions or some positions are better than others.
Some people have shit postures and don't have pain. Some have perfect and have pain. Pain is way more complicated than this eli5 and people are just spreading misinformation now. Which can actually lead to more pain.</p>
<p>Source: read any newer research on pain. Also I'm a physiotherapist.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>While ergonomic posture is not the end-all-be-all for pain, our muscles work MUCH better in positions where they have the mechanical advantage, and that's quite literally what ergonomy IS.</p>
<p>It's how we can stand for hours with minor adjustments to position (because we're not statues) but try being in a half-squat or plank and even a minute seems like hell.</p>
<p>We absolutely should be moving in varied ways and not be in any given position for a long time, but how long that is (and possible damage done) depends on how ergonomic the position and the work done in it are to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I get that this seems like a logical explanation for this ELI5, but is this really true? If you look back at our history and evolutionary lineage, I’m pretty sure that humans have almost always done repetitive things of one sort or another. I don’t think we were <em>meant</em> to move in any way in particular. Its just that the negative effects on the body of repetitive exercises are not bad enough to provide an evolutionary disadvantage, and therefore we have to suffer through them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  The past hundred years is really the first time humans have been assigned a task to repeat day in and day out for a lifetime.  Prior to this there would be repetitive periods of labor harvest, seeding, certain aspects local life throughout the year in conjuction with and short varying daily tasks. Certainly those under the control of others would be subject to what was put on them, but the average person would on a whole just work a few hours a day.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not even remotely true. If anything, the last hundred years have seen a broader increase in the diversity of human activities than in any other period in our history. It's only in that time that the concept of leisure time has applied to people other than the extremely wealthy/nobility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the average person would on a whole just work a few hours a day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, no. This is patently false. If you go back a couple of hundred years, the average person would be working 70 hours a week minimum, performing largely repetitive tasks for that time.</p>
