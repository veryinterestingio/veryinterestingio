			<div class="markdown"><p>I think those were based on earlier testing protocols.  People can test “clean” in some areas of the body but still house the virus in others.  So they checked a “clean” area and released the patient - but now it’s something like you have to test “clean” three times in different areas</p>
<p>This is also one of the reasons why people are concerned about the “number of tests performed” - because many of those tests are repeated on the same individuals, so the number of people tested is much lower than the number of tests performed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could but it would not cause harm to them unless they were immunocompromised or didn't have a full immune response the first time.
As far as we know(I have read) this virus behaves like all other virus's we have encountered.  Just a very specific  transmission rate and incubation period that makes it particularly global.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or initial/secondary false positives. The reports are infrequent enough (2-3 that I've seen anecdotally) that I believe it's probably technical error at some stage of testing.  You have to picture these stressed techs trying to keep up with their workload, making an occasional mistake. Samples mixed, cross-contaminated, who knows. I had a project where we intensively sampled a few hundred cases a day and retrospectively our error rate was about 0.3% (not coronavirus). </p>
<p>I have been wrong before, but generally second infections (especially so soon after recovery) are a unicorn in the field. Several years later, yes, that's possible based on some reports I've come across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big factor in the fatality rate seems to be access to testing, and localized health care capacity.</p>
<p>Look at Italy, with patients over 80.</p>
<p>Social distancing will ease the fatality rate by allowing for adequate care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not study viruses internal mechanisms, or even work on the models themselves.</p>
<p>Generally, our RnD would work with medical professionals and other scientists to perform studies to understand the characteristics of the virus, and the &quot;environment&quot;, and translate into software.</p>
<p>As far as I know, this is an unknown as there isnt data for it yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two things that work in our favor. The first is that SARS-CoV-2 is huge in terms of RNA viruses. ~30 kilobases. ~50% bigger than the flu, ~200% bigger than HIV. Even though RNA viruses mutate quickly due to reverse transcriptase errors, there is a weak but significant negative association between genome size and the rate of molecular evolution among RNA viruses.</p>
<p>The other thing is that SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, encodes a 3' exonuclease as part of its RNA. This acts as a sort of proof reader making the transcription more accurate and the mutation rate slower. In fact, researchers have seen SARS-CoV antibodies work on SARS-CoV-2 because the mutation rate has been so slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd need a source for your last statement, but I believe it to be true.</p>
<p>A mini ask science here, will migrate to a bigger thread if necessary. Your sentence about exonuclease and stuffs like that. I know what it does now, but I want to know how it does it. Like how does these little chemicals do these things, etc. I come from computer science background so I think of these as little programs. </p>
<p>Is there a search term I could use to study more about how the instructions are stored, executed, etc. Like how I understand logic gates are doing all the job and that there's no magic in computers, I also want to know the same for the proteins, dna etc. Education level is</p></div>		</li>
