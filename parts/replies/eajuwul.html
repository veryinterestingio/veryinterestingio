			<div class="markdown"><p>This copy paste from Wikipedia has nothing to do with the law imposed in Ukraine. Sounds more like fear mongering in this case. </p>
<p>The law they imposed in Ukraine:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Was approved by parliament, including some of the opposition parties. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's limited to 30 days (with further approval by parliament) and certain relevant parts of the country. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be no changes and no actions taken by default. The military will have the right to use the law when they need it (for logistics etc)</p>
</li>
<li>Oncoming elections are not to be affected </li>
</ol></div>		</li>

<p>I was only attempting to answer the first part of the question, defining Martial Law..  It sounds like Ukraine's implementation is more of a &quot;State of Emergency&quot;, except it's one where they likely expect to be invaded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. And it seems I even heard the martial law articles can only be applied in case of significant intensification of military actions so that the military don't mess with paperworks if the time comes. Otherwise, no martial law articles are applicable. But I might be wrong here.</p></div>		</li>
