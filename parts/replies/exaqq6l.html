			<div class="markdown"><p>It's insane to think that I recall being told throughout my school years the estimate was between 6.1b and 6.9b ... since I was a child, 800 million and 1.6 billion new people are on earth... with the lower estimate that's 3/4ths a new china, over 2 USA's, 8 Egypts, or 12 UKs... for the upper estimate, double those figures. The fuck.</p>
<p>edit: when I was born, there was 5.3 billion people on Earth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In developed nations, even the homeless are mostly counted, as they’ll have some sort of registered existence. A birth certificate, a Social security number, a green card (even if expired) etc.</p>
<p>These will be used in conjunction with the census to estimate populations, not just voluntary censuses responses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was my understanding that, particularly in developed nations, the census is really more of a data gathering tool on the population that the gov is already near-certain it has: i.e. they send out the census forms addressed to all the people they know they have on the system. It'll be extremely rare (in a developed nation) that a birth or death is first reported through a census form. There will almost definitely already be a birth/death certificate in existence that the gov which issued it will obviously already know about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Germany, being truly homeless is illegal. You are still in the database and have to provide an address registered to you, where official documents for voting, taxes, pensions etc are delivered to. Usually homeless people provide the address of a homeless shelter or another service that takes care of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably like NL, there is no census in the form that english speaking countries have. There is the official registration, will survey to deal with the other details a census usually collects.</p>
<p>You could in theory live here without being registering, but it can make your life a little difficult and there's no real downsides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the homeless are a lot more difficult to count during the census, they aren't impossible, and governments have incentives to getting a count on the amount of homeless people in their jurisdiction.  As before, it largely depends on the nation in question, with the caveat that number of homeless people is going to have a much larger margin of error.</p>
<p>As an example, <a href="https://www.ofm.wa.gov/washington-data-research/population-demographics/decennial-census/2020-census-everyone-counts/2020-census-what-you-need-know/hard-count-population-2020-census/counting-people-experiencing-homelessness-during-2020-census" target="_blank">here is the US census bureau's plans</a> for counting those experiencing homelessness in up coming 2020 census.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna go with Germany, but same idea. </p>
<p>The population curve is crazy. China and India have over a quarter of the world’s population between them, and then there’s a couple in the hundred millions, a dozen or so in the 80-100 million range, and then it starts dropping pretty quick.</p></div>		</li>
