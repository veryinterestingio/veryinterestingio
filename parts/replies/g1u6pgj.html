			<div class="markdown"><p>That is part of it. The mountains around Death Valley rob the air of moisture, so humidity is extremely low. Water takes more energy to heat up, so humid air tends to be a lower temperature than dry air. Look at Arizona and Florida. Florida is actually further South and gets more sunshine hours each year. So why is 105 in Miami an infrequent occurance, but 115 in Phoenix is expected? Because the water in the Florida air absorbs that extra energy. In Arizona it has nowhere else to go but as heat in the air and terrain.</p></div>		</li>
