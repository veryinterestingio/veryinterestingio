			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me with poison ivy. I used to react normally to it and then when I was 7 or 8 I got a massive dose (it was burned accidentally and it got in my lungs) and almost died. Now I can roll around in it and it doesn't affect me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom and I had the opposite reaction. We accidentally burned it in a camp fire, she ended up in the hospital because it spread to her lungs. I ended up on immunosuppressants. Now Neither one of us can even look at it without getting a rash that spreads everywhere unless Steroid cream is applied immediately.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I tried that with Legos and it really hurt. I must be allergic to Legos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this can happen in two ways. The first is desensitisation. If you are consistently exposed to very, very small amounts of the allergen, your body will eventually learn that it's not harmful. This can take years, though. When done intentionally, we call it allergen therapy.</p>
<p>The difference between exposure that will make an allergy worse or better is not entirely clearly. Broadly though, small, frequent doses lower allergic responses. Larger, sporadic doses seem to increase them.</p>
<p>The other way is just no exposure for a very long time. Your body can eventually 'forget' an allergy.</p>
<p>This is because immune responses are stored in specific white blood cells. These cells learn that molecule X is dangerous, and become specialised in watching out for X. They literally patrol your blood. If you get exposed to more X, your body might make more of these patrol cells to look for X. But if you don't get any exposure for many years, those cells will eventually die. This isn't a hugely reliable way to lose an allergy, but it does happen.</p></div>		</li>
