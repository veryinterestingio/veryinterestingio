			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re potentially getting screwed by Google though. Type in definition of whatever and Google is now providing the answer right in the SERP (search engine results page) provided by the information on Oxford dictionary’s site. Chances are you’re never going to go to the Merriam Webster website, which is serving ads (funnily enough, also potentially provided by Google), because you already have the answer. What I don’t know, is if Oxford is getting anything out of it by providing the content to Google or not to be displayed in the SERP.</p></div>		</li>
