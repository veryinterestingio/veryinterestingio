			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, the effect is the same, except in reverse. Rather than creating a pressure bubble within the vehicle as air is forced in, it creates a mild vacuum as air is pulled out. Once it is pulled out, air rushes in to the back of the vehicle to equalize the pressure differential. And repeats ad-infinitum so long as you maintain the &quot;right&quot; speed. </p>
<p>It has most to do with the volume of the vehicle's cabin, the speed of the vehicle. and the placement of openings in the cabin.</p>
<p>My dad's pickup truck used to do the exact same thing unless we cracked open the rear window to the bed at speeds above 55 mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To cancel the effect, you need to provide a route for the air to travel through the car.</p>
<p>When two opposite windows are open, the air flows in through both simultaneously, builds up pressure inside the cabin - so both Windows really act like one big one.</p>
<p>If you open one front and one rear window, the air will flow through - the constant flow of air in the front overcoming the flow of air that would come in through the rear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When driving in my car alone I often open the 2 windows on the opposite side (right side) to create this pleasant airflow. If I have someone sitting on that side they don't like it as much. Too turbulent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My car does this only if a single back window is down and I'm going over 40/45mph, but if a single front window is down it doesn't happen even up to speeds of 80mph. Can anyone explain this as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluid mechanics is complex, but it's possibly that there is a different type of airflow across the front windows, perhaps highly turbulent flow caused by the rear vision mirrors, or the shape of the car, etc. Having this type of turbulent flow (or local vortexes with minimal airflow) means that there isn't the same pressure differential as you'd normally get with high airflow past a window, so air isn't sucked in and out in the same ways, or to the same extent. Really there's no way of knowing without putting your car into a wind tunnel or doing some complex simulation to find out where the air is moving around those windows.</p></div>		</li>
