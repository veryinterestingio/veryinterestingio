			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the take away isn't that flexibility affects your ability to sleep, just that limber people sleep in more postions or at least, in more prone positions. </p>
<p>Though people should still stretch regularly. Keeps you limber, therefore helping avoid general injury and pulled muscles, releases endorphins, and just feels good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not <em>entirely</em> qualified to answer that question. When my soldiers came in wanting ambien for insomnia they had to go through a 16-week sleep hygiene program with very rare exception. If you were compliant with the program and still had issues sleeping afterwards then you could be assessed for insomnia. Very rarely did I end up having to assess for insomnia (turns out modern man is just not good at sleeping). </p>
<p>Part of the sleep hygiene program was a mobility program that was intended to increase flexibility in the core muscle groups (traps, pecs, abs, back accessory, hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings were primary target). </p>
<p>Your body being able to enter a neutral state more easily, or having to exert stress in less positions is one of several factors that influences your ability to sleep. But I don’t think it’s a wholly independent factor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that’s full of useful info that explains more in details. Thanks for sharing! What are the other parts of the sleep hygiene program? As a civilian I would love to learn more about it. I wonder if the research or program is available to the public.</p></div>		</li>
