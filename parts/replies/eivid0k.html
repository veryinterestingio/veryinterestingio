			<div class="markdown"><p>You can be allergic to eggs, which would make you allergic to mayo (real mayo at least...). If you were allergic to butterflies, how would you know? How often do you physically encounter them, not just look at them? There's lots of people allergic to mold.</p>
<p>The allergies you hear about are ones that involve things people commonly interact with, like food, pets, and medication. You might be allergic to some weed that grows on a mountain in Tibet, but if you never encounter it, you'll never know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some things are more likely to elicit an immune response though. That's why food ingredient labels also specifically list common allergens. Peanut allergies are a lot more common than, say, an allergy to corn. </p>
<p>You can't be allergic to something you've never encountered. It's only upon encountering it and developing an antibody to it that you are now allergic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, you likely won’t be allergic to a plant you’ve never encountered before unless it’s similar to something you <em>have</em> encountered before. </p>
<p>VDJ recombination only “discovers” the antibody, but you typically need exposure to amplify it. It’s why each allergic attack someone has is usually worse than the last, because it causes cells producing those antibodies to multiply. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are things we most likely will never react to, because they're pretty much chemically inert as far as the immune system can tell. </p>
<p>This includes most titanium alloys, which is the <em>real</em> reason it is so popular in implants. While titanium is strong, it still isn't always the most ideal choice in term of other material properties like resistance to bending, etc. But if it's <em>good enough</em> for the intended implant, and the alternative metals aren't both significantly better and still unlikely to trigger an immune response, then titanium will be the first choice simply because it's known to be safe.</p>
<p>Gold is another metal that is biologically inert as far as we can tell. Almost nobody will react to pure gold or pure titanium, and reacting to any alloys of them is incredible rare. But for obvious reasons gold isn't very common for implants!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Apparently because sometimes they want particular surface properties, and titanium is difficult to coat.</p></div>		</li>
