			<div class="markdown"><p>because we don't eat the right stuff. Too much processed crap that does not support gut biodiversity. Also we tend to eat stuff that is 'sterile'. They heat milk and other foods so that all of the good bacteria that helps build gut flora gets killed as well as the stuff that may be bad for us. Much of the stuff that bothers us now would not have bothered us a hundred years ago because our gut flora would have out competed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The microbiome is not my expertise, but from my limited understanding is that there is connection between your gut flora, the immune system, and possibly the CNS (Vagus nerve). One hypothesis is that you can bombard your gut with probiotics, but your body does not produce the factors needed to support the full engraftment of those probiotics and thus they get pushed out/die off over time.</p></div>		</li>
