			<div class="markdown"><p>From the line of thinking I've heard it's because the aircraft is filtering the air but more importantly it's not entirely recirculated.  A portion of the air is constantly being replaced by outside air that is filtered, compressed, and heated to cabin temperature.</p>
<p>I too find this a bit suspicious. Especially because the initial 6 ft distance rule was adopted because of the contact tracing on an airplane for another respiratory disease that showed people were infected who sat within 6 ft of an infected individual.</p>
<p>At any rate I wasn't planning on getting on an airplane until I was vaccinated. And since then I can tell you that nobody is keeping their distance in line at security or at the terminal seating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just arrived at LAX from Oregon on Saturday, and it looked like one big mosh pit in there. The airport was wall to wall people, it was insanity.</p>
<p>Not only that, but all the &quot;dine in&quot; restaurants were packed with people. So it was crazy full, as well as packed with people eating and drinking. I was glad to have worn an N95, I still feel like I held my breadth while running through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they design Airplanes with viruses in mind.  There is a lot of airflow that passes thru HEPA filters, so you aren't really breathing the same air as the people near you nearly as much as you would think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big open space? Not the typical airports I've been in. Someone previously used &quot;mosh pit&quot; to describe it, which seems apt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dang what airport is that. Maybe it's because I live in the US but every airport I've been to is huge and has huge high ceilings</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. That’s definitely what the airlines recommend. I’m traveling later today and this is my plan.</p></div>		</li>
