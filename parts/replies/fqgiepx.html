			<div class="markdown"><p>Rotation also plays into what latitude rockets are launched at. Angular speed is the same at any latitude (15Â°/hr),  but linear speed is fastest near the equator. It's one of the reasons why NASA launches at Cape Canaveral instead of, for example, Cape Cod.</p></div>		</li>
