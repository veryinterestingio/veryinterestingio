<p>I'm very sure they only write this sh*t about &quot;conditioning your eyes&quot; so people won't return them right away.</p>
<p>They're really good sunglasses though, the best I've ever had in fact. But they don't change anything about my color perception.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Took the words out of my mouth.  So many people won't return something of if the onus was on them to 'try hard enough'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, same. They just exaggerated the red in everything like a filter. </p>
<p>So I could pass the Ishihara test, I could tell apart the Red and Green characters in Among Us.. but I wasn't getting a more realistic depiction of life (if that makes sense!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I think why most videos online of people trying them are because if you film someone trying them and it not working, there isn't a lot of point in putting that online. It's not going to get mass-shared or make anyone feel good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t comment on other people’s reactions because I’m not them. What I can comment on is my own personal experience. I’m deuteranope. I’m also an artist, I paint miniatures mainly these days, used to draw quite a bit as well and was involved in the comic book industry doing that many years ago. That’s just context to illustrate that I’ve spent years developing compensation methods for not being able to see color correctly, so I’m pretty sensitive to knowing what colors should be even though I can’t see them properly.  </p>
<p>At least, I thought I knew. The glasses separating the wave lengths enough for me to experience colors in ways I never had before was mind blowing. I had no idea what fluorescent really was. Or what purple looks like. Or how vibrant the greens of the woods are. It was overwhelming and I teared up a bit at what I had been missing, and how beautiful the world really is. I would speculate that the reaction videos are real feelings being expressed in a dramatic fashion. For every dramatic video there’s likely dozens of people like me that had the same real reactions, but expressed in a reserved manner. But those don’t go viral.</p></div>		</li>
