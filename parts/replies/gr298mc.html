			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, antibodies could be absent because they were removed during negative selection, or simply because there were no antibodies that reacted to the spike. After all, the possible diversity in just VDJ/VJ combinations is greater that the number of unique B cells available to any given person. For this reason as well, different people can have different strength of antibody response as each person will have a fairly unique Ab/TCR that binds one of many possible epitopes on the spike. It's mainly random chance. Some will also cross-react to other variants better than others, leading to potential difference in long-term immunity.</p>
<p>Also, a small correction, while most of your T-cell receptors are set by childhood, new B-cell production and antibody formation (both recombination and somatic hypermutation) happens throughout adulthood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Might be wrong, it's late and don't feel like looking it up, but T-cells mature in the thymus while B-cells, which produce antibodies, mature in the bone marrow. The process of positive and negative selection is similar for both though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, but ignores the idea of somatic hypermutation? The antibodies you are born with are not the antibodies you die with. Theyâ€™re continually evolving in germinal centers to bind epitopes more effectively.</p></div>		</li>
