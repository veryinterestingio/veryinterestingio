			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you said is true but the handling models and upper-level performance in FH4 are a far cry from reality. The big names like Iracing, Assetto Corsa, DiRT Rally series, GranTurismo, even the Forza Motorsport line, all have far more realistic physics. That said, I think the Horizon series strikes an excellent balance between arcade and sim feel, Iâ€™ve played the hell out of all 4 of them, but they are by no means simulators.</p></div>		</li>
