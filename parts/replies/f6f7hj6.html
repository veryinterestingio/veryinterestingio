			<div class="markdown"><p>It is.</p>
<p>I work at a cidery and we use ozonated water to sterilize equipment. As soon as it’s turned on the room smells super fresh and clean as if it was just after a rain shower on a hot summer day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, in fact the decomposition reaction of ozone would normally be written as 2 O^3 → 3 O^2 (those 3 and 2 numbers should be subscript but that's not supported on Reddit).
What actually happens is 2 O^3 → 6 O → 3 O^2 but those O atoms (known as <em>free radicals</em>) are highly reactive and will react with anything around. That can be the other O radicals or it can be whatever substances they bump into first. Think of chemical reactions as taking a bag full of different things and shaking them around - it's random what they bump into but the concentrations of the various components determines the statistical likelihood of specific reactions occurring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the reaction on ground levels is more: </p>
<p>2 O3 + 2 organic molecule- &gt; 2 O2 + 2 organic molecule(+O°) </p>
<p>The organic compounds become oxidized and lose their previous properties. This can be good for pollutants, but bad if it's enzymes in your body or respitory system. </p>
<p>On the ground, these single oxygen atoms are so unstable that they normally don't get to exist: O3 often binds to organic molecules as a whole, and then O2 splits off afterwards.</p>
<p>The only way I know off that Ozone splits without another compound nearby is when it gets bombarded by high energy, like UV-B and UV-C. This often leads to the Ozone reforming and the process repeating. This is why the Ozone layer protects us from radiation. </p>
<p>So in short: on the ground, Ozone binds to organic molecules, dumps it's extra oxygen atom and splits off as O2. In the Ozone layer, oxygen and Ozone get bombarded by UV radiation and constantly turn into one and the other. That's where you often get the reaction 2 O3 - &gt; 3 O2, as long as there aren't Ozone layer damaging compounds nearby like CFC's that disrupt this balance.</p></div>		</li>
