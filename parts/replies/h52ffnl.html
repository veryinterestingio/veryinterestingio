			<div class="markdown"><p>Not buildings (unless it's an extremely huge warehouse), but bridges sometimes have that problem. For example, from [this Wikipedia article about the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge](<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verrazzano-Narrows_Bridge" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verrazzano-Narrows_Bridge</a> ):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of the height of the towers (693 ft or 211 m) and their distance from each other (4,260 ft or 1,298 m), the curvature of the Earth's surface had to be taken into account when designing the bridge. The towers are not parallel to each other, but are 1+5⁄8 in (41.275 mm) farther apart at their tops than at their bases.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps not the buildings you were thinking of, but for large and sensitive scientific devices (eg <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/virtual-tour/accelerator" target="_blank">linear accelerator</a>) they have to take the curve into account since the line has to be actually straight and not follow the curve of the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be very important when building long tunnels.</p>
<p>Consider the Channel Tunnel for example. They simultaneously bored the tunnel from each end, one team starting in the UK and the other in France. They then had to meet perfectly in the middle with centimetre precision after drilling 16 miles on each side. If they didn't account for the curvature of the earth they could have been off by many metres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In reality, the Earth is not a very perfect sphere from our reference scale, so the particular topography where you're walking has many orders of magnitude more of an effect than the curvature of the earth when you're walking around.&quot;</p>
<p>So, you're saying, that in some places the Earth is indeed flat?</p>
<p>Edit: lol, this has been fun AND informative. TIL I'm an Oblate-Spheroid Earther!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less than 10 arc seconds at 100 feet is pretty standard construction laser accuracy. That's about 1/32&quot; deviation. Robotic total station controlled screeds are even more accurate.
Been working on construction lasers, survey grade GPS, and optical instruments for 20 years.. I fell into this field out of school, didn't know anything about it before I got a job working on lasers, but it has been a very interesting ride over the years seeing the technology improve and change.</p></div>		</li>
