			<div class="markdown"><p>Then, is it ok if I let it rest by turning it off? Let's say, I don't need WiFi for the night. Should I turn it off just like I would do with my PC?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the insight guys. I'll keep it on and reset once a month if it were to be necessary.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm receiving a lot of mixed info @.@ I'll just keep it as it is since I don't have problems. But if I ever encounter some weird shit I'll know it's ok to restart it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get one of those lamp timers so it turns off while you're asleep. This way it's ready to go by the time you wake up too. If you don't need it on during the night for other devices, it's definitely not going to hurt anything turning it off at night.</p>
<p>Edit: If you can afford not to, you don't need to turn your router off each night unless you're doing that as a security measure. If you're having issues, you should power cycle your router to see if that fixes it. If it does, then see if your router has a setting to schedule a restart so that you're not causing the parts to go through a heat cycle — where the parts cool off and then heat back up — since that has the potential to cause some wear and tear on your router. If you don't have that option but feel the need to restart it daily, a lamp timer switch is a good cheap bandaid until you can find a better permanent solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we first upgraded from dial-up to DSL my dad made us turn our router off every night. We had to do it for years. Always annoyed me because my parents' bedroom and living area was downstairs next to it but my room was upstairs on the opposite end of the house and I was always up the latest. So I'd finally be getting tired and ready to go to bed but then getting up and moving around to go turn it off would wake me back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The router I have lets you adjust a bunch of settings by accessing its IP address in your browser and many have settings to schedule automatic reboots.  Both of my routers restart at 4am every sunday, and since I set that up I haven't had router problems in years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your device requires daily restarts,consider replacing it. </p>
<p>My home network (ignoring the ISP modem, which will restart for maintenance in its own) has been up for almost 900 days.
There is no need to restart your gear if it's not having issues, and if the issues require daily restarts, then you are better of replacing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What boggles my mind is why this is even a thing.  I've got Linux systems at work that have years of uptime.  Why does this very minimal device need restarted every few weeks/months?  I feel like either the coding standards for router software or the hardware reliability specs must be way too low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not my field of engineering, but probably has a lot to do with cost. Home router systems are cheap (compared to commercial routers) and most home users don’t start losing millions of dollars an hour the second their internet cuts out so they aren’t incentivized to spend more the way businesses are. It’d  be hard to justify, as a router company, that testing and effort. I’ll be honest, my home router has a built in feature to reboot automatically once a week and that works for me; if they sold a “years of uptime” model for even $50 more, I’d still buy the cheap one, and such a feature would cost a lot more than $50. </p>
<p>In the field I <em>do</em> work in, reliability characterization and reliability growth testing on new products is a huge effort. It’s not about development standards and practices, you have to test, and hardware and system testing too, not just software.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes to both.</p>
<p>Linux systems at work with years of uptime are usually quad digits at cheapest.</p>
<p>If you have a router that needs constant reboots, chances are that all the corners that could be cut were cut. The hardware is more susceptible to interference from environment (EM radiation, temperature, cosmic rays, etc) and the firmware (you can't just throw linux at some PCB and expect things to magically work, you have to write firmware specific to your circuit on top of that) is prolly shit-tier and full of bugs, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, no.  These are Linux systems almost exclusively using commodity SOC architectures.  </p>
<p>The real problem here folks is the software.  While you could buy more redundant HW (and, as an aside, the Ubiquiti UniFi line is relatively inexpensive compared to enterprise class gear), the real problem is that the coders that build the UIs and software that makes the router work often have no idea what they are doing when it comes to how the network, hardware, and OS come together.   </p>
<p>Almost assuredly the code that linksys or whoever had written has memory (or other) leaks in it.  When a piece of software starts it requests a chunk of memory from the OS that it manages.  It can request more of it needs it, and it can give it back when it’s no longer required.  In a memory leak situation, either the software doesn’t properly release the memory back properly and proceeds to consume all available memory it has been allocated.  Eventually the process hangs or dies.  Restarting it causes the process to release that memory and start over.  </p>
<p>Software can also leak other things, like threads, db connections, or other resources.  Often these routers are running old OS packages as well that have similar leaks that have been patched. </p>
<p>As a quick hack, you can get a smart plug like a wemo and set a nightly proactive reboot at 4am or whatever time is least likely to interrupt you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell me about it. If we're watching Netflix and someone uses the microwave, it stops. TV, router and microwave are all in separate rooms about 15-20 feet from each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've talked with a guy at a security conference. He was working with a network equipment manufacturer. He was doing security tests for some &quot;big&quot;, professional devices. What he said is that it was almost impossible to do a security assessment of a Home/Small Office (SOHO) routers because the whole budget allocated for its development in China often exceeded the cost of a 2 week test.</p>
<p>Some of the devices work only because manufacturer hacked together their own version of GCC (compiler) that avoids using certain combination of instructions in the output code or the CPU will just crash - that's how serious issues are in some chips.</p>
<p>But then those chips are already produced, they won't get sold at US or European market but will get bought in bulk by some manufacturer in china, packed into a router and as long as they crash e.g. only every second day they're good to be sold.  Someone will add a program that restarts them every night so they won't crash. </p>
<p>But if the crash happens only on some of them, after a week or two of work it's likely nobody even saw it during the limited tests that were made. So the user will have to do the reset once in a while.</p></div>		</li>
