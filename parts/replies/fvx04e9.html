			<div class="markdown"><p>We already have them. Your DNA is damaged all the time and it is either repaired or the cell dies via apoptosis. </p>
<p>The lengthening of telomeres is something that is being researched. It turns out to be more complex than previously thought. There are a lot of factors that probably contribute to aging with shortening telomeres just being one, or possibly just being a side effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but lengthening telomeres needs to come with a cancer removing agent, because the inevitability of cell division is the emergence of cancer. What people may not realize is that telomeres are in place to end cell division before cancer can take over. Even an immortal cell would eventually become cancerous given time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've always wondered, why can't they just clone cells with re-lengthened telemeres and just reintroduce them into the body? It's not like the body will reject those cells right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that those mechanisms trigger growth, and you don't want unregulated growth in your body because that's cancer. If all your cells decide to start dividing you'll die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is incorrect. We do not know whether clones have shorter lifespans or not. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that mutations are a cause of aging. Here is a relevant review: <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/452444" target="_blank">https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/452444</a></p>
<p>&quot;We find that at least some cloned animals can reach the species-specific maximum age with a performance that matches that of normal animals. However, for most species, only anecdotal evidence of cloned animals reaching high age is available.&quot;</p>
<p>There needs to be a definitive study done. We really don't have an answer yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are other issues besides telomeres including somatic mutation. This is kind of a wild card but it is guaranteed the cloned offspring will have a higher basal mutation load than the original organism which could lead to a decreased life span. Not to mention these once somatic mutations would now be germline. This could provide increased risk for cancer or aging diseases. Canâ€™t really fix that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I don't understand why everyone is getting so hung up on telomeres when somatic mutations are the real crux of the matter... </p>
<p>If you believe in somatic mutation theories of aging (and many experts do) then cloned animals are absolutely going to suffer premature aging.  There needs to be a real study on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what you're asking. Multiple sources of DNA meaning from one person? That's virtually impossible. We have ~3bilion of base pairs in our genome, and that in one cell. We are multicellular organisms, so we have up to ~37 trillion individual cells on our bodies.</p>
<p>A somatic mutation can occur in ONE base pair within one genome in one cell. And the nature of mutation is random (not really, I'd say pseudo-random but let's assume it is). To achieve what you're proposing, we need to scan 3 billion base pairs in one single cell in your body, then do the same thing with 37 trillion cells you have right now, and then to do the 'scanning' in the lab we can use a technique called single cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS), a current technology that is powerful, but is honestly still somewhat prohibitive in the sense that we cannot cheaply sequence one single cell at a time. While this hypothetical lab work is happening for 37 trillion cells in your body (unrealistic, because you need these cells to live on), time passes, and some new random somatic mutation may arise in you, rendering the large swath of your sequencing data obsolete. We haven't gone into the details of how would we specifically target this one mutation, in one specific cells of yours, extract it, fix it, and then somehow reintroduce it back to you. </p>
<p>I hope you can see how immensely difficult a task this is. (Interestingly, scientists are a stubborn bunch, and people are actually studying ways to make this become a reality).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know mutation rate increases with paternal age (40-80 mut/generation but can go up to 100-200 in extreme cases), but using a somatic cell for cloning can provide any where from 1000-5000+ mutations depending on the cell type.  You would never see this high a mutation rate through natural conception!</p></div>		</li>
