			<div class="markdown"><p>Open the scissors about a third way, as often the tip is less sharp than the base.</p>
<p>Begin with a fractional cut, to give the scissors a 'score' to guide them.  </p>
<p>If cutting wrapping paper, pull the sheet that you are cutting off away from the roll gently, close to where you are cutting.  This will keep the sheet taut and you'll get an easier glide.</p>
<p>Look up along the sheet, and pull out any semblance of a crease, no matter how small, since that means the paper is not taught at that place.</p>
<p>If at any point, your scissors get caught, close them slightly to create a new 'score' then continue.  Start of slow until you're confident.</p>
<p>Thicker paper is considerably easier.  Wrapping paper is probably hardest.</p>
<p>Now...  Curling ribbons?  That shit is witchcraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curling ribbons is easy! Place the ribbon in-between your scissor blade and your finger. While keeping your finger in the same place (don't slide it up the blade as it may cut you if it is sharp) pull the ribbon towards you with your other hand while pulling the scissors away in the other hand. Do this in a fast movement and it will curl ribbons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curling ribbons, you have to place the scissors on the &quot;backside&quot; of the ribbon or else you get a weird, wompy ramen noodle looking thing and not a curl. I prefer to just wrap nice thick ribbons around boxes and tie a bow.</p></div>		</li>
