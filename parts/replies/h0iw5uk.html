<p>it appears that one of the H3N2 clades may have disappeared â€” gone extinct. The same phenomenon may also have occurred with one of the two lineages of influenza B viruses, known as B/Yamagata.</p>
<p>Neither has been spotted in over a year. In fact, March of 2020 was the last time viral sequences from B/Yamagata or the H3N2 clade known as 3c3.A were uploaded into the international databases used to monitor flu virus evolution ...</p>

<p>This isn't saying, by any means, that influenza, or human influenza, or even human influenza subtypes have gone extinct. The &quot;strains&quot; being discussed here are quite narrow lineages. However, it's significant because they represent antigenic subsets. In the case of the B/Yamagata lineage, it's one of two major influenza B lineages that are included in the standard (quadrivalent) seasonal vaccines. If this lineage is genuinely extinct, then it might be possibly to go back to the trivalent vaccines and still get good coverage of the B subtypes, which would be a pretty big win. </p>
<p>The H3N2 lineage isn't as big a deal, but if it's extinct it would simplify choosing which H3N2 group to include in vaccines. H3N2 is a very complicated collection of distinct lineages, and removing one of these major groups would make strain selection for vaccines easier and hopefully more accurate.</p>

<p>If the global pool of flu viruses has truly shrunk to this degree, it would be a welcome outcome, flu experts say, making the twice-a-year selection of viruses to be included in flu vaccines for the Northern and Southern hemispheres much easier work.</p>

<p>How confident can we be that these lineages are gone? On the one hand, it's been difficult to get a lot of influenza viruses to analyze, because there haven't been many cases. But the flip side is that the cases that did happen, got assessed more deeply than usual -- the whole influenza analysis conveyer belt, that's geared up to deal with hundreds of millions of cases each year, now focused down on a mere few thousand. So it's certainly possible that these missing lineages are hiding out somewhere, but it's not as if experienced, careful people haven't been looking for them.</p>
<p>(Why were there so few cases of influenza? Probably the social distancing and masking used to suppress COVID. Why did it work so well on influenza? Because human influenza is much less transmissible than SARS-CoV-2. The R0 [or at least the contemporary Rt] for influenzas are around 1.5 or less; for SARS-CoV-2, probably around 4-5, considering the variants. That means even a small reduction in transmissibility -- say, dropping it by 0.5 -- would have a major impact on influenza, dropping it below the sustainable level, while having a much smaller effect on COVID.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but approval process for vaccines take too long (even by the record set by COVID-19 vaccine) to come to market within the same season. There is a chance that a new generation of vaccines are made and waiting as they do now to be produced, but production at the scale of flu shots each year takes pre-planning. If we indeed did eliminate some strains like others cited, then this makes the pre-production choice easier to make though.</p>
<p>TLDR: Maybe, but more likely to be the same yet shave off some time and uncertainty in the pre production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's part of my question, my knowledge on mRNA is limited, but I've heard proposals that the main &quot;vehicle&quot; of the vaccine can get approved, then perhaps have a shortened approval process for each specific virus that uses the same process.  Combined with with right-to-try laws those who are most vulnerable to the flu could sign up to get it earlier than having to wait for full approval. </p>
<p>Like if there is a nasty strain that is having elevated mortality rates in seniors, they could choose to get the vaccine early with some assurance that it will be safe based on using the same mRNA &quot;host&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where are they getting the information in the strains though? Because if they're from labs attached to hospitals, the hospitals haven't had any cases. They might be lacking enough information on strains.</p></div>		</li>
