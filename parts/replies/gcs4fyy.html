			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. We are probably conflating two different things.</p>
<p>Right now, I honestly just wanted to understand why my friend would want to wait for peer reviews before even trying the drug after all that rigorous testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are ignorant (I don't mean this in the pejorative sense, just in the lack of information and knowledge on how drugs are approved). I would suspect what they probably mean is they are concerned about undiscovered side effects or contraindications that may've not cropped up during trials (happens sometimes). If they have any really rare medical conditions it'd be particularly understandable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term peer review is sometimes equates with a review of the work that is not impacted by conflict of interest. Peer review is generally done in a volunteer basis by people in the Same field. Also, peer review is generally used to evoke the idea of the unbiased nature of the scientific method (which is really a system with elements put in place to attempt to remove bias as much as possible but is still designed and executed by humans and so not without limitations).  So perhaps the idea of peer review by your friend is more about the idea of an unbiased critical review by experts. Some people donâ€™t feel the drug trials are executed by unbiased parties. This concern is not completely unfounded, As there are lost of motivations for companies to get drugs approved. But there are lots of layers of review and scientific rigor in FDA approval that follows the same beneficial aspects of the scientific process. In some ways more. But that might be the difference in the type of perception of those two processes that your friend is using as a frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus I would like to add, for publications, the peer review doesn't even check the data. They just check methodology and the concept etc.</p>
<p>There are many mistakes in peer reviewed articles. The most recent one and major one I read was when they made a mess of a meta-analysis not linking smoking to covid severity
Lippi et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7118593/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7118593/</a>
(this was cited 169 times!!!!! And wasn't even retracted by the journal). </p>
<p>This was properly corrected  by Guo et al.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202479/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202479/</a>  who found the mistakes.</p></div>		</li>
