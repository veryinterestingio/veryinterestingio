			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro level cameras have way more things that can be configured by the operator and many of them are designed to be changed quicky without having to dive through layers of on-screen menus. The easiest way by far is to make those things tangible buttons, switches, sliders, wheels etc. </p>
<p>Also there are decades of standardized attachments that have large mounting points so again it's better to keep the cameras their current size. </p>
<p>Also a decent amount of the camera bulk for shoulder mounted remote cameras is the battery pack.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not to mention the size and weight helps to steady the camera and avoid jittery shaking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which really helps balance the camera - shooting handheld/shoulder mount with all the weight in front? SUCKS!!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. People think that modern apple design made everything futuristic, but they just made everything <em>look</em> futuristic. </p>
<p>Nested menus on a touch screen might allow a device to be small and pretty, but there is something to be said for just reaching out and flipping a switch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, broadcast cameras aren’t just your average dslr cameras— Google actual film production cameras and you’ll start to understand why what’s “normal” these days is more built out. Even dslrs, when kitted out for actual professional production, are sizable.</p>
<p>For instance shooting in a variety of conditions requires versatile (long and complicated) lenses, matte boxes, onboard audio recording transmitting devices like comteks and microphones, and and often onboard light panels. </p>
<p>Add in the fact that most broadcasts are in HD if not 2k, and also recording large files onto internal decks/transmitting to a nearby van for uplink, and the size of modern news cameras actually isn’t that unusual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while back i saw what was the standard issue for an ap wire photographer. I'd estimate they easily carry 40lbs of gear between cameras, lenses, flash, batteries, etc. Maybe they shaved off a bit of weight by switching to Sony alphas but probably not much.</p>
<p>TV crews have probably similar gear, since they often shoot live, there is no time to correct the video before it's broadcast. It has to have proper lighting, stable, clear, etc straight from the camera. Even if that operator is standing in the middle of a civil war.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah a bunch of the bulk resting on the back of the camera is wireless transmitting gear for either wireless microphones or backfeed to the truck. And it's all modular so you're talking a good sized pack that's got five wires coming out of it going into another good sized pack. And then maybe another pack for battery stuff. Etc etc.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, this setup is called ENG: electronic news gathering. It's almost everything you need in a shoulder mounted format, and thinking of it as just a camcorder is leaving out a lot of crucial stuff.</p>
<p>As just the first example on Wikipedia, here's a half-respectable setup... <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DP_Mark_Schulze_with_Sony_FS7_camera_and_Convergent_Design_Odyssey_7Q%2B_recorder_monitor.jpg" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DP_Mark_Schulze_with_Sony_FS7_camera_and_Convergent_Design_Odyssey_7Q%2B_recorder_monitor.jpg</a>  ...that's missing almost every piece of audio gear I'd be wanting on hand. Ain't going to be no news if they can't hear you, and the cameraman has almost no way of telling what the audio is like let alone making nuanced adjustments, getting feedback from the producer, or capturing high quality narration in the first place. This rig is better suited to recording a BMX bike rally or nature documentary than a news interview, and you can already see that the &quot;camera&quot; itself is relatively small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is just bad speculation.  Different cameras serve different purposes and the &quot;shoulder supported&quot; cameras offer features that news stations require; optical zoom, big high-resolution viewfinders, robust and complex networking features for live transmission, tons of I/O options, large image stabilization mechanisms, ergonomics for comfortable use over long periods of time, large storage options, battery packs that can run all day and computing systems to make all of that work.  </p>
<p>Some smaller stations might not upgrade as often but I assure you that most news crews are working with top of the line equipment.  A camera is like any other tool and each job requires different tools.  You need a drill for screws, not a hammer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>News teams record for tv.</p>
<p>High quality cameras are overkill, since quality is lost to compression for tv (unlike movies), and the sheer number of cameras makes buying top of the line ones for boasting purposes a bankruptingbdecision.</p>
<p>At the end of the day huge news channels - especially in the states - are overbloated organizations existing for political meddlibg. And in most senses not too dissimilar from low level state burocracy in terms of operating procedures. Keeping helicopter based news footage crews on payroll instead of buying multiple drones that are cheaper and  provide more coverage because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we already have a heli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its scary new rech thats &quot;unproven&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>we would have to retrain our employees</li>
</ul>
<p>Are arguments that dont fly for companies operating on a non-monopolistic free market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is anecdotal (but I think that this is ok in this sub?), but in the documentary <em>Attenborough - 60 years in the wild</em> (ep 1, 5:30) David Attenborough talks about how he wanted to use small portable 16 mm film cameras in the 1960s or so, but the BBC thought it was &quot;unprofessional,&quot; and a huge row followed. Attenborough finally won the argument, and proved that the new stuff his team could film with the more portable cameras really did offset the technical shortcomings of the more compact tech.</p>
<p>The same argument could probably been had today. Miniaturized tech will always be slightly inferior in different ways, and there will always be that one guy who threatens to resign if anyone were to use less &quot;professional&quot; equipment.</p></div>		</li>
