			<div class="markdown"><p>so there are two functions. there is Function1 defined by taking a number (X) and raising every positive integer to the power of -X and then summing them all. so for example for X = 2 Function1 of 2 is:</p>
<p>1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + 1/4^2 + ....</p>
<p>As you start calculating the value of this sum, you'll reach a point where you're adding numbers so small (like 1/10000^2) that it basically doesn't really change the result (I'm sorry mathematicians, this is ELI5). and you know what the number is.</p>
<p>The problem with the approach above is that function1 works for numbers like 2 and 3. and to an extent 1. but it just breaks for any number less than 1 because it just gives infinities all the time. for example -2:</p>
<p>1+ 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + ....</p>
<p>the numbers you're adding keep getting bigger, diverging to infinity.  to certain mathematicians and physicists this makes function1 useless so they applied some &quot;Magic&quot; (Again ELI5) to make give more sensible numbers at these values while still giving function1 values at numbers above 1. this magic turns function1 to the famous Reimann Zeta Function. so Zeta of -2 isn't 1+ 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + .... zeta of -2 is something else that equals 0.</p>
<p>I forgot to say why it is important. There are two reasons that come to mind:</p>
<p>1- for mathematicians, some smart calculation have managed to link the product of multiplying all prime numbers under a value to the Zeta function. we can calculate zeta, but we can't really calculate primes unless we know them. so by multiplying the ones we know and comparing it to the zeta results we can figure out if we have found all the ones in that range or if we are missing some. which has some implications in cybersecurity and things but is just really cool.</p>
<p>2- I have heard that it is used as part of the String Theory model from theoritical physicists. it is how they built this 23 or so dimensions needed for it.</p></div>		</li>
