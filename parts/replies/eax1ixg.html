			<div class="markdown"><p>I had hyperopia, and was focusing through prescriptions that were too strong. Turns out I have myopia in one eye, hyperopia in the other. I rarely experience blurred vision, but get extreme fatigue because though there are times I'm not seeing well, my eyes focus anyway.  Still haven't figured out when to wear glasses and when not to.</p></div>		</li>
