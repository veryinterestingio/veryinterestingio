			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a nice legend about the name (completely made up though).</p>
<p>Basically there was the city of Ys or Is. It was located off the coast of the Bretagne (northern France), in the Atlantic. It was a wealthy and prosperous place. But as these things go, it became decadent and the king ever more greedy and self indulgent. The city was built up in marmor and gold. With incredible bells. </p>
<p>The king was warned that he had to return to some moderation or the city would sink. He didn't listen and kept improving his palace, until one day the unthinkable happened: The city was swallowed by the sea. </p>
<p>On some days one can still hear the bells. </p>
<p>That city, Is, in the Atlantic ocean, became known as Atlant-Is. And centuries later, the great new city of the Franks was so splendid that it became called Par-Is (like Is).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The name comes from the Gaulish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parisii_\(Gaul\)" target="_blank">Parisii</a> tribe. When the Romans built a city there, they called it &quot;Lutetia Parisiorum&quot; (which means something along the lines of &quot;Place near a Swamp, home of the Parisii&quot;), which eventually shortened to &quot;Parisius&quot; and then &quot;Paris&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I see translations of names like that, I wonder how the people would have thought of the name. For instance, when people say New Zealand, I don't actually think &quot;the colony founded by people from Zealand&quot;, instead the words kind of just corrsepond to the specific thing they refer to rather than the derivation they preserve. Similarly, I wonder how the words changed in the mind of the average Roman who heard them from &quot;Place near a Swamp, home of the Parisii&quot; to maybe &quot;Swamp of Parisii&quot; to &quot;Parisiiswamp&quot; to &quot;Paris&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's helpful to think of language as something that evolves, rather than &quot;lives&quot;, and there are lots of factors that influence how it changes over time: geography, technology, introduction of slang, merging/clashing of cultures, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people who think languages are fixed probably think that language is dictated by &quot;<em>the</em> dictionary&quot;.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are a relatively new invention. Going around figuring out what words people are using, what they mean, how they can be used, how they're pronounced, how they are spelled, what the valid grammatical constructions using them are, etc. and recording it all into a big book is a newfangled thing. And holier-than-thou snobs who think that now we've put it into a book that it's now the law and it can't ever change are even newer.</p>
<p>New words that aren't in the dictionary are being invented all the time. Words that are already in the dictionary are being given new meanings all the time. Words that are already in the dictionary fall so far out of use that they're functionally not even words anymore all the time. There isn't even &quot;the&quot; dictionary, there are many dictionaries, and they all have different contents that sometimes contradict each other. Dictionaries are not rulebooks, they are logbooks. They do not define language use, they merely record language use. Because language use is always changing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have kids, try to keep up with internet lingo. Speech is always evolving. </p>
<p>There are always new words and references that become part of the new lexicon and sometimes they are forgotten quickly and sometimes they become assimilated into the language. </p>
<p>You can actually watch it happen live on the frontpage if you look closely enough. You'll memes come and go and then you'll see memes stick around and shape how the internet processes information.</p>
<p>I guarantee that you use words that make sense only on the internet. It may not make it into professional email, but you'll use them in chats and that's it's own language in an of itself. Language evolves. Therefore, it's alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I know, Classical Greek is kinda phonologically a mystery? We have some assumptions by how the Romans imported the alphabet, and how it developed into modern Greek, but the two are pretty distinct in important ways, and idk if we have any answers to where things started.</p>
<p>Was it a tonal language? if so, then the accents that we ended up retroactively adding shouldn't change the vowel qualities, and &quot;i&quot; should be 'ee' by your representation. Was it a stress language? if so, then who knows what the theoretical correct answer would have been, but an unstressed &quot;i&quot; would probably have been an 'i' by your representation.</p>
<p>Mythological Paris' name has an acute on the alpha, so it definitely could've been either tense or lax, from the details I know. Perhaps other people know better?</p></div>		</li>
