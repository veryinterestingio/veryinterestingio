			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I’m an electrical apprentice, and in school we learned that gold is the most conductive metal, then silver, then copper, then aluminum. But they didn’t say the whole side you just explained, they said it’d just be too expensive. </p>
<p>Basically what I wanted to ask is, is OP’s title wrong or was my teacher wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily saying your teacher is wrong - but everything I’ve ever known is silver, copper, then gold.</p>
<p>I can tell you that the major portion of my job revolves around using as little gold as possible when it’s required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment is not correct.  Silver is more conductive than gold.  Contact plating is the topic of the message you replied to.   There are a lot of options for contact interfaces material and conductors and these are determined by a combination of business and technical factors.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if gold plating is just for corrosion resistance, wouldn’t audiophiles and other fringe enthusiasts be better served by copper contacts and a little contact cleaning kit?  Am I about to rock the world of some audiophiles with my new low oxygen copper connection kits?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing, it's not only for corrosion resistance. There are other failures that can occur in the mated condition (for example, fretting corrosion) as well.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't know a lot about audio equipment, but you may also have signal issues with the slight increase in contact resistance from oxides that forms on the copper. Even when it's not visible, oxide layers will be there and they can cause rises in contact resistance at lower normal forces. Also, many red metals you see in the consumer market are not pure copper - pure copper doesn't have great mechanical properties for contacts. Bad spring forces, stress relaxation, etc. - the conductivity of these alloys drops significantly when alloyed so gold is most likely more conductive than the copper alloy. For example, a phosphor bronze alloy we commonly use is about 9% IACS, which means it is only 9% of the conductivity of copper.</p></div>		</li>
