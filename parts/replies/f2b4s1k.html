<p>While defects are greatly <em>increased</em> by inbreeding, that doesn't equate to it being greatly <em>likely</em>. </p>
<p>Take this as a thought experiment - you greatly increase your likelihood of having a car crash if you speed or use your phone while driving. But it's not like the minute you speed or you touch your phone that you instantly have a car accident, do you? It's similar for inbreeding and defects.</p>
<p>It's a shame that your reply is the only one which is sober and backed by science. Oh well, such is reddit I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am curious, do you know if it is more likely that &quot;bad&quot; recessives genes are expressed during inbreeding, then is it also true that &quot;good&quot; recessive genes are more likely to be expressed during inbreeding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more likely that recessive genes will be expressed, and there is no distinction between ones that we consider bad and ones that we consider good or neutral.</p>
<p>In fact, we very often deliberately use inbreeding in order to make sure that genes that we consider good. Almost every fruit or vegetable that we consume has gone through this process of selective breeding.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the basis of domestic breeding. Quite often breeders will breed an animal back to one of its parents, or to one of its siblings to further express a certain gene. They'll just cull off the ones that exhibit bad traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/JohnQK might be able to answer this for you but it's above my paygrade.</p>
<p>Also note that lots of genes are &quot;good enough&quot; or &quot;not of concern regarding selective pressures&quot; so in theory while you could end up with more chance of &quot;good&quot; genes for some quality or another in offspring, the chances are likewise pretty minimal.</p>
<p>You could look at selective breeding where plants or animals are bred in a controlled way to ensure that certain characteristics are passed down to the next generation but even that is a difficult process which needs to be carefully tended. Without direct intervention in the wild it's much less likely to occur.</p>
<p>In short, my educated guess is: technically yes but effectively not really, or at least not very likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, after inbreeding, defects are increased in the first generations, but lowered in the following. Kids with defects end up reproducing less. So, inbreeding gets rid of the carriers</p>
<p>With no inbreeding the percentage of carriers remain constant.
In reality inbreeding is a coefficient which is never 0, your descendants will make kids with some other descendants of you. Just like anyone is in couple with a distant cousin.</p>
<p>So in the long term it's all the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-on question...</p>
<p>If we know what the  recessive genes are today, should it not be feasible to use a technology like crispr in the future to weed out those traits when bringing species back from the brink? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are three questions to this solution: </p>
<p>Ethics, well I don't know much about...</p>
<p>Will it benefits the species? Most problem of low generic variation is the don't have enough choice in face of environmental changes as a whole specie. Editing out &quot;bad&quot; gene might not help much. But maybe introducing extincted genes.</p>
<p>Technical. To use CRISPR, we have to be able to first get fertilized eggs (early embryo), second get the editing in, and implement the edited embryo into a surrogate mother. The whole procedure is mature on only limited lab animals, several live stock species/pets, and technically human. For a endangered species, the second might be the easiest, but how to getting eggs, and properly implement edited embryo, can be very hard. The knowledge we get on lab animals are not very transferable. And you also don't want to put a already endangered animal in life danger just for trying out the technic, which you could do easily with lab mice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I was told that the complexity for CRISPR is over inflated and that lab kits can cost less than $100.</p>
<p>Researchers in Cornell in NY had done successful tests against sperm alone in 2018; so the notion that embryos are a prerequisite isnâ€™t accurate either.</p>
<p>To boot, a scientist in China removed the gene that HIV requires to latch on to and used that for his two daughters last year who are supposedly HIV immune now. I believe the legal case is still being hotly debated there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genome editing is dangerous.</p>
<p>What some couples do, usually people marrying close cousins or relatives: they get their DNA checked for the most usual recessive diseases, if they get both the same and they still want to make babies they can check the fetus's DNA and abort it if he gets both.</p>
<p>That way we can weed out those traits in the long term.</p>
<p>It happens in the nature for animals, they just don't check DNA. They mate and babies afflicted die. That's how nature gets rid of bad  recessive traits.</p></div>		</li>
