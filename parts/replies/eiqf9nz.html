<p>one thing I can think of is synaptic rigidity, which is much more strong in adults. concretely this means that adults motor neurons are required less stimulus in order to fire reliably. </p>
<p>another possibility is that the enzymes which break down acetylcholine esteraz are also affected by levels of epinephrine and melatonin which are differently prevalent in adults and kids.  </p></div>		</li>
