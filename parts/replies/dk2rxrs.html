			<div class="markdown"><p>As /r/chocolatechoux says, they're both encoded in Unicode (the main standard for converting between bits on a computer and the characters those bits represent), so if your browser follows the standard, you <em>should</em> be able to see them (assuming a compatible font). But notably, the first character is within the Basic Multilingual Plane (the bits representing it are equivalent to a number less than 65536), whereas the second character is outside of it. Older code only supports characters on the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP); newer code is <em>supposed</em> to support the other characters (i.e. it's good practice to do so), but many older programming languages make it difficult to do so - notably Javascript, which is the de facto standard for browsers.</p>
<p>This also might be a coincidence, and the font you use just happens to support one character but not the other. Tell me if you can see these words:</p>
<ul>
<li>? (not on the BMP)</li>
<li>? (not on the BMP)</li>
<li>? (not on the BMP)</li>
<li>鼷 (on the BMP)</li>
<li>龢 (on the BMP)</li>
<li>麑 (on the BMP)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Chinese speaker, I don't know how it is pronounced just by looking at the character.</p>
<p>It is apparently referring to some kind of fish, as the left part is 鱼 (literarily fish).</p>
<p>Some googling shows that it is a simplified version of 鱲, which is interestingly in the BMP, in fact.</p>
<p>The character itself means a genius of fish (Zacco). Some references imply that in ancient China, this character refers to the species of Zacco Platypus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacco_platypus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zacco_platypus</a></p>
<p>Edit: wiki link to the genius in Chinese: <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B2%A4%E7%A7%91#.E9.B1.B2.E5.B1.AC.EF.BC.88Zacco.EF.BC.89" target="_blank">https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B2%A4%E7%A7%91#.E9.B1.B2.E5.B1.AC.EF.BC.88Zacco.EF.BC.89</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm impressed you found a reference. I tried googling around for ?, and found wikitionary entries that just say &quot;this requires a translation to english&quot;, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%B1%B2#Chinese" target="_blank">like this one</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dictionary entries do come with a phonetic guide. As for knowing how it's pronounced by looking at it, you can make guesses (if the right hand side is the same as in some other character, the sounds are usually similar - but not always, and you can't tell <em>how</em> similar, so it's always going to be a guess). In this case, I don't know any other characters with a shared right hand side (though there might be some).</p>
<p>For what this particular character means, manyouzhe seems to have found it.</p></div>		</li>
