			<div class="markdown"><p>Baba is dad in Marathi too (western Indian language). In Hindi it is Baba (used by kids),  Baap, and Pita (used by adult). In Sanskrit it's Taat (not pronounced like hard T, but a softer T with tongue in front of mouth). But paternal is Pitra  in Sanskrit (and Hindi).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains why mama and papa would be used for parents, but doesn't seem to explain why they don't seem to ever be flipped. I'm sure there are some anomalies, but it does seem like for the most part mama is for the female and papa is for the male.  Certainly that's not anywhere close to definitive proof of a common root language, but it definitely seems to be decent evidence for it.</p></div>		</li>
