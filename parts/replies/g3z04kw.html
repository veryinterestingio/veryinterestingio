			<div class="markdown"><p>Great questions. Yes the CMB does change with time. It certainly cools, it gets &quot;redshifted&quot; just like everything else in the universe so its wavelength is gradually increasing.   </p>
<p>But the small fluctuations in its temperature also change over time, although very gradually so we would never see it in one lifetime. With a precise enough telescope, we <em>might</em> be able to detect the change after \~1000 years.  </p>
<p>Stuart Lange did a Masters Thesis on this a little over a decade ago. This is the thesis: <a href="http://phy-page-imac.princeton.edu/~page/lange_thesis.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://phy-page-imac.princeton.edu/\~page/lange\_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">http://phy-page-imac.princeton.edu/\~page/lange\_thesis.pdf</a></a> If you want to skip the technical details you could skip straight to the interesting figures in section 6. I know someone made a gif out of figures 6.5-6.10 once but I'm struggling to find it right now.</p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>Yes, it does indeed, and it does so in 2 ways! a) All the frequencies shift a bit towards longer wavelength as time goes on and b) The pattern of hot and cold spots we see changes slightly because what we see is only the light that was emitted at a place so far away that the light reaches us today. So tomorrow, we can see one &quot;light-day&quot; further (note: due to expansion of the universe this is not one light-day in actual distance but in &quot;light-travel-distance&quot;).However, both of these changes are tiny. The frequency shift will be only detectable in the far far future (remember the universe is 13.8 billion years old, a few years more or less don't change that much, relatively speaking). The change in patterns will also be only noticeable in the far future.</li>
<li>[Not an expert] We have no idea what is inside a black hole, all we know is it's minimal density (so dense that it fits inside the Schwarzschild radius). We don't know of any matter that could be that dense so people usually go with &quot;Singularity&quot; but for all &quot;practical&quot; purposes it does not really matter since there is no way for whatever is happening inside to influence the outside world. So a black hole with a singularity or something else inside would behave exactly the same (as long as General Relativity still holds).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Shaun and Stefan have nailed your first question, but I wanted to add a bit on your second one.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of singularities we know about; coordinate singularities and physical singularities. A singularity is where the metric (the mathematical function that describes your spacetime) goes to infinity at a single point. </p>
<p>A well-known example of a coordinate singularity is the Schwarzschild radius (or event horizon). We normally write the metric for the spacetime surrounding a single, static, black hole using the coordinates of an observer sitting far away from the black hole. In this coordinate system, the metric goes to infinity at a distance of 2M from its centre (where M is the mass of the black hole in units of distance... weird, I know). This is the event horizon, and its why we (as observers very far away from the black hole) can't see anything beyond this point.</p>
<p>But, if we change to a different coordinate system, then this singularity goes away. This is why it's called a <em>coordinate singularity</em>, because it only exists in particular coordinate systems.</p>
<p>The other is a physical singularity. This is the kind that is at the centre of the black hole. This is a point at which the metric &quot;blows up&quot; (i.e., we get infinite curvature, and density, and other weird things), that <em>doesn't go away if we change coordinates</em>. This is how we know it's real, if something remains the same regardless of how you look at it, you know it's physical.</p>
<p>So - as long as general relativity is correct, there is a singularity at the centre of a black hole. It's a mathematical consequence of this particular black hole solution.</p>
<p>As far as what that singularity actually is, and what it's like, as Stefan said... we'll never know. Mathematically, all we know is it's a point of zero size with infinite density and curvature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But there are other theories according to which there is no singularity at the center of black hole, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, after a little more reading I think this might be more clear-cut than I originally thought. I read <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/02/14/black-holes-must-have-singularities-says-einsteins-relativity/#d5f62c82d66e" target="_blank">this</a> article which was really helpful. </p>
<p>To summarise; as long as nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, a singularity at the centre of a black hole is inevitable. This is to do with the ability to form a bound structure in such a dense environment. You can only make an object so dense before information needs to travel faster than light to support the object from collapse. They explain it really nicely in the article I linked above.</p>
<p>I've never heard of a modified gravity theory that allows for faster-than-light travel, and I think most physicists would agree it's unlikely this is possible. So, it seems we're stuck with the singularity.</p></div>		</li>
