			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also so clearly weird as a claim. MSG... mono-sodium... glutamate... the salt of sodium, which is an essential mineral, and glutamate, which is an essential amino acid. A salt which immediately dissolves into those two component ions. How is this going to be some scary toxin different from just consuming your necessary sodium and glutamate, exactly?</p>
<p>I still don’t get it. Maybe there was some pseudo-logic. But even old chemistry books I learnt from taught this crap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MSG is mono sodium glutamate which is just sodium attached to a glutamate molecule to stabilize it. It's extracted from seaweed so if you've ever had any kind of Japanese cooking, it's probably in it whether added as a powder or by using dashi (seaweed/konbu broth).</p>
<p>Glutamate is also found in soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, tomatoes, milk products, mushrooms and yeast extract (USA uses this label frequently).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How were you attempting to find sources? Glutamic acid is an amino acid, so any source detailing the amino acid, i.e. protein composition should be able to give you this information. </p>

<p>1/8th of it's protein content is glutamic acid. By weight, it has more glutamate than tomatoes, although of course one tends to use more tomato than garlic. And I cannot comment as to whether glutamate is responsible for the flavor profile of garlic; rather it seems like something so common wouldn't be able to account for its uniqueness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Careful there. Most any source on nutrition online is an absolute crapshoot. Bonr_champ's question is unfortunately more valid than the first google result that seemingly answers it.</p>
<p>Since a) only free / unbound glutamic acid adds a savory flavor, b) garlic actually contains <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/37108/PDF/LEEgarlic.pdf" target="_blank">not that much glutamic acid</a>, and c) there's a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18167170/" target="_blank">threshold for tasting glutamate</a> to begin with, I'd guess chances are slim that there is &quot;strong umami flavour coming from naturally occurring glutamate&quot; when it comes to garlic.</p>
<p>TL/DR: Does garlic have a lot of glutamate? It lands somewhere between tomatos and breast milk.</p>
<p>STL/DR: Stop listening as soon as someone says &quot;umami&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
