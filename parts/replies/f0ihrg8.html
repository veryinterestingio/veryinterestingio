&quot;I can get a hell of a good look at a T-Bone steak by sticking my head up a bull's ass, but I'd rather take the butcher's word for it.&quot; - Big Tom Callihan.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is the Arts: Visual artists, musicians, performers, storytellers, filmmakers, writers, etc.  Though I've heard music composed by AI and it was quite beautiful. I'm curious to see what other kinds of art AI will produce. I believe that human creations will have unique qualities that will never be replaced by machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are already ANN that can apply the style of painters to a photo. You get for example a picture of New York that looks like a van Gogh painting. And this is just one of many programs.</p>
<p>But I think that &quot;creative jobs&quot; are AI prove to some degree because people want to buy something &quot;handmade&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that is true, but digging up ancient human culture has no beneficial value to an AI. Only humans assign value to it. </p>
<p>I don't remember the exact paper, but during my bachelors AI they once presented us a list of jobs that can and possibly will be taken over by AI and which jobs could be taken over, but probably won't. The only thing I do remember from it was that archaeology was the number one 'safe' job.</p></div>		</li>
