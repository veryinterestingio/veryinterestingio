<p>Egyptian is in the Afroasiatic languages family that also include Arabic  you compare to that to for similar language you are more used to. </p>

<p>Though note that Egyptian is almost as closely related to the Hausa language as it is to the Semitic languages (of which arabic is a part), so not very closely related at all.</p>
<p>Also, that guys pronounciation is atrocious. He's not even trying to pronounce the syllables right. How do we know what's the right pronounciation? Well, we don't. But based on similar languages we can guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually have a very good idea of how upper class romans pronounced latin, because they produced a lot of texts, poetry and word puns, and were rhetoricly obsessed since pronounciation was an important way to show that you weren't a part of the lower classes (who spoke Sermo vulgaris, the vulgar language)

			<div class="markdown"><p>Complete guess here, but adjacent vowel noises have special rules in a lot of languages. As an example, in French you contract for most adjacent vowels (and h?) . It is not = n'est pas, instead of ne est pas.</p></div>		</li>
