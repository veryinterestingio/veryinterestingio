<p>Plants can get overloaded with fruits. In a year with plenty of water and sunshine, they can produce so many fruits that weigh itself down, which end up bending or snapping their branches.</p>

<p>I know this is pretty common for young cultivated fruit trees, but does it happen with wild fruit trees too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not OP.   </p>
<p>Wild fruits are still subject to changes in environmental factors. An increase in daylight hours year over year, a flood increasing nutrient availability, or more consistent rain could all be cause for increased fruit production.   </p>
<p>Whether they break is kind of up to chance. Wild branches may be stiffer due to more exposure to natural, unmitigated winds. Wild branches also lose the benefit of appropriate pruning and the possibility of coverage during inclement weather. Harsh winters leading into ideal growing conditions may lead to weakened limbs that aren’t as able to handle increased fruitload. Wild fruits are not harvested early, which means fruit-bearing trees and bushes that produce for a significant amount of the season may be more at risk for bent/broken branches.   </p>
<p>All hypothetical though, I don’t have any studies that compare breakage of native plants vs cultivated plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most fruit trees have stems that prevent heavy fruits from breaking branches.</p>
<p>Stems are extensively studied in designing biological fail-safes because they have some of the most conserved ratios of growth patterns of known organic macromechanisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience is anecdotal, but I have grown flowering plants in greenhouses and closets and various other unnatural environments. </p>
<p>One absolutely must provide an oscillating fan in the growing area to &quot;exercise&quot; the growing shoots or they will be spindly and won't be robust enough to support heavy flowering heads. They wont develop as strong a &quot;vascular&quot; system to move enough nutrients and water to support heavy growth either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In wild trees there is what is called a mast year.  This is a great overproduction of their fruits and nuts and it happens with many trees all at once, not just on individual trees.   This might be a strategy to overfeed the wildlife that destructively eat their seeds so that at least some seeds survive.   </p>
<p>Last year, the pine trees next to my house had a mast year of pinecones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have read it seems to be more of a typical underproduction to limit the populations of seed eating animals the ecosystem can sustain then occasionally all over  producing seeds such that some will survive. </p>
<p>The result is the same in that more seeds can survive   but better frames how the process actually works.</p>
<p>Note that not all tough seeds, nuts and or tough nut like drupes do this strategy though lots of conifers and oaks use the strategy but chestnuts don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew outdoor and we would build cages around our plants and stake them down so they didn't have to invest energy into being strong enough to withstand the wind. One cage when they're transplanted, and another two when they get bigger. Otherwise the branches would just fall off when they start flowering, or topple over in the wind. We would also hollow the plants out by pruning any internal branches that won't get any sun, and halfway through flowering we would take out any yellowing water leaves, all in an effort to get the plants to put maximum energy into flowering. If it rained, I would have to go out and shake the water from the plants so the branches wouldn't crack from the extra weight, and once it stopped raining if it was warm out, use a leaf blower to get as much moisture off as possible so the product wouldn't mold. It's pretty intensive work to grow outdoors and so many things can go wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in San Diego and this happens to the orange trees in our front yard every year unless we make an active effort to pick the oranges. There are so many oranges that the tree limbs just start to sag and bend until the oranges are basically touching the ground. Coincidentally, I took a picture of exactly this in November of 2020:</p>
