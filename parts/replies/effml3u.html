			<div class="markdown"><p>Glaucoma patient here. Water can seep under the layers of the cornea naturally, and the endothelial cells there pump it out. Water there might freeze and expand, but the cornea can expand with them and it won't really cause issue.</p>
<p>If the moisture on the surface freezes, I don't think it'll really do much damage. It'll be like snow touching your eye. Not pleasant, but I don't think destructive.</p>
<p>I'm talking about surface/light freezes. Assuming that, if it penetrates deeper (like the inner eye freezing), that would damage the retina/lens/optic nerve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cornea does repair itself. It's if you do deep abrasions or considerable damage however corneal scarring might affect your vision.</p>
<p>Also, I have a frostnip on my index finger right now (damn Raynaud's syndrome) and it takes a considerable time to heal.</p>
