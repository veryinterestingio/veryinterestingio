			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Enough</em> pressure, yes. There's a long way between enough to roll it thinner and enough to fuse it. Temperature plays a part - you have to keep the surface cool too.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure aluminium was very hard to produce in large quantities and was <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4xsj2O_fRnc" target="_blank">more valuable than gold</a>.</p>
<p>We can produce aluminum reasonably cheap only since early 20th century.</p>
<p>So yeah the manufacturing process (in some form) was likely invented before aluminum became cheap enough to wrap your sandwich in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum is quite a costly material, even more so back then than today so they used tin. That's why aluminum foil is sometimes incorrectly called tin foil, the name just stuck around for some people. The process to make foil with other metals like gold has been around for a long time and you can bet before industrialization they did it by hand.</p></div>		</li>
