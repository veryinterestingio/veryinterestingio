			<div class="markdown"><p>Vision therapy doesn't correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or presbyopia though, which is what the vast majority of people wear glassesfor.   It can help certain people with specific visual problems, like accommodative (think autofocus of the eye) spasm or binocular misalignments that cause blurriness or eye strain (usually variable symptoms).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right. Although my ophthalmologist did say that in certain cases it improves people’s eyesight. I’m not a doctor though, so I don’t know the science behind that. In my case my prescription stayed the exact same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as far as I understand it, when I got meningitis, my brain pulled power away from my eyes to provide extra power to protect the brain stem where the meningitis was attacking. </p>
<p>Once my immune system managed to beat the infection, what SHOULD have happened was my brain relax the power to the brain stem and give it back to my eyes. However that didn't happen, instead it kept the majority of the power to the brain stem protection and only gave a portion back to my eyes.</p>
<p>Basically we slowly taught my brain to give that power back. </p>
<p>I honestly don't fully understand it. But I went from decent vision (needed reading glasses and still do for long read times) to not being able to focus near or far no matter what the prescription I was given (I was 18 when I had meningitis), then through vision therapy I was retaught how to focus my eyes both individually and together and re taught them to work together in all sorts of circumstances (sometimes one would be covered, I had to find words on a board while swinging back and forth, some were fast flashes on a computer, focusing near, focusing far and dashing between, all sorts of things)</p></div>		</li>

I went from 40 degrees seperation to about 12.i still can't read with my left eye or if I do I'm down to 1 word a minute. Would you recommend just trying to read with that eye in a psudo eyereainign therapy thingy?</p></div>		</li>
