			<div class="markdown"><p>The single transverse palmar crease, or simian crease, is found in about 1/30 typical children, 60% of children with Down syndrome and in a variety of other conditions (<a href="https://www.consultant360.com/articles/single-transverse-palmar-crease" target="_blank">see here</a> ) Ultimately, chromosome testing or equivalent is needed for diagnosis.  Microarrays are beginning to replace karyotypes in this regard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, people with Down’s have a fold that goes from the left (on the left hand) of the palm to the right of the palm, basically right through the middle. Most other people have an M shape that the “Down’s fold” would pass right through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I moreso was talking about the common features you had mentioned such as eye shape, height and weight rather than ethnic background. </p>
<p>Interesting that they used to be referred to as &quot;mongoloids.&quot; I never had heard that before. </p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation :)</p></div>		</li>
