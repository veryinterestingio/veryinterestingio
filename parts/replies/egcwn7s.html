A film that reacts too quickly may not be good for daytime or long exposure shooting. While a film that reacts too slowly won’t be good for low light or for capturing action shots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After leaving auto I think most folks start out finding aperture priority mode the most handy since it probably has the biggest effect on the character of the photo and modern digital cameras are pretty good at managing the other two unless you're going for something pretty specific </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>photographing moving things or birds from a distance calls for a particular way of shooting.  For everyday walking around and snapping random shots around town shutter is usually not the critical lever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>99% of people aren't shooting flying birds or anything moving that fast. For about 95% of non-tripod situations if you use a minimum shutter speed for your focal length (which for modern cameras is amazingly easy to do automatically), you're golden even with a bit of movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never foeget to check your lightmeter either. If you look through the camera view finder (film or dslr) it will show how far off your camera shutter and aperture are off from the picture coming out too bright or dark.</p></div>		</li>
