			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to overdose on fat soluble vitamins, however it takes effort.</p>
<p>To overdose on vitamin D for example, it is not possible through the sun and barely possible through food to get an adequate vit D intake without supplements.</p>
<p>It is possible with supplements, but still would take a good amount of effort. Most supplements are around 4-5k IU and to get poisoning, one would probably have to take 40-50k IU for a prolonged period of time. (Many months)</p>
<p>Vit A overdosing was more common long ago when cod liver oil was popular for various reasons.</p>
<p>Treatment for both of the above (excluding some extreme fringe cases) would mainly be to stop taking the supplements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cod liver oil never really was the cure-all it was supposed to be. It was basically snake oil or an early &quot;essential oils&quot; scam of its day.</p>
<p>On a related note, I've heard cod are becoming extinct from over-fishing. Add that to our list of bad shit to worry about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that too. I heard polar explorers would develop high intracranial pressure as a result of eating polar bear livers and developing a vitamin A poisoning. I think even taking too much vitamin A supplement causes high intracranial pressure which can be dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's seal livers. So while a polar bear has no issues with it, someone trying to survive off the barren tundra can get themselves killed if they start scooping the liver off the seal like chunky ice cream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah in those cases I have seen 50k for a month, then 10k, then 5k based on how the blood test goes. hard to overdose but possible.</p>
<p>im sure if it has not already happened that some facebook fad could start a vit d cleanse of 50k per day for a year. then they claim all the bad effects are proof it's working. happens often enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the fat soluble vitamins are A, D, E and K. This is why you never eat the liver of a predator, because they can have dangerous levels of fat soluble vitamins.</p></div>		</li>
