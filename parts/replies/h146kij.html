			<div class="markdown"><p>He basically did explain it though. The electrons carry a tiny force. These tiny forcefields prevent objects from going through each other, e.g. your hand hitting a solid chair. Your hand and the chair are repelled at the microscopic scale because of this tiny forcefield.</p>
<p>Magnetism is an amplification of that same force. It works over larger distances because the electrons are all aligned. In fact it's true that everything repels magnets, there's videos on YouTube demonstrating this. You can very weakly push anything with a strong magnet. Now if you have two of those push forces acting against each other, you achieve that weird feeling of repulsion between two magnets. Because the combination of the two repelling forces is orders of magnitude greater when you bring these two together.</p>
<p>Flip it and they attract. Magnets behave so strongly with each other because the force is being multiplied. They react weakly with everything else because the electrons are not aligned. So all you get is a stronger than typical force that prevents your hand from moving through a chair.</p>
<p>The only reason he dodges why he can't explain further is because science has yet to explain why electrons carry force in the first place. Since he can't answer that, you simply have to accept that electrons have forcefields and amplifying that creates magnetism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, even Feynman said he couldn’t explain magnetism because it’s so different from anything most people are familiar with.  That was the whole point of that video.  Your description above rests entirely on the statement, “ electrons carry a tiny force,” but what does that mean?  How can an electron carry a force?  Where does that force come from?  How does that force attract or repel?  Without explaining that , it’s just handwaving.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Scientists don't even know why electrons exist at all yet. In the early 10\^-30 seconds of the Big Bang, for some reason, a tiny amount more matter was created than antimatter.</p></div>		</li>
