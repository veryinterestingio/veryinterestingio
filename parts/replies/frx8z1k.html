			<div class="markdown"><p>A question, do some birds nest again after abandoning a nest? We've got a pair of blackbirds who had the bright idea to nest on top of a rake in an area frequented by cats, weasels and squirrels. Unsurprisingly it was quickly abandoned, but the birds are still showing strong breeding behaviour. You always see only one of them at any given time and they constantly mob our cat.</p></div>		</li>
