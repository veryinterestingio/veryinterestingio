			<div class="markdown"><p>This also explains birds vs Windows.</p>
<p>The tiny puffs like robins or whatever, can fly into a window, be stunned, and fly away</p>
<p>The big birds like hawks, my old man has that happen years ago. Beautiful as fuck speckled hawk flew into the window and died, I said jokingly he should get it taxidermied, he straight did and every thanks giving that fucking bird watches us eat Turkey.</p>
<p>Also rep!!im 6 5, and fuck falling, shit hurts like hell. The last one my Apple Watch called 911 luckily because I shattered my elbow and had a concussion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile short as hell wife can have a fall and be peachy keen -.-</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 4'10&quot;. One day I busted my ass in public. Like pitched forward and flopped, tits-flat, on the asphalt. Scraped my chin lightly. Shattered my ego-bone. </p>
<p>I walked, dazed, into my dorm room and sniffled about how I just fell ALL THE WAY DOWN, boo hoo. </p>
<p>A girl on our college basketball team looked at me and said &quot;Oh, shut it. You're OK. I take that fall, I break a tooth.&quot; </p>
<p>She was right. I had scraped palms, but no soreness. I can't reach the top shelf for shit, but falling is no big deal for potato stubs like me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I KO'd myself one night.</p>
<p>Out drinking with a flat mate and his brother in London.  We were headed back, decently wasted, and I was telling a story waking in front of them, facing backwards.  I tripped over one of those short black traffic bollards designed to keep cars from cutting the corner and running up onto the pavement/sidewalk.</p>
<p>I twisted my torso around to catch myself, but didn't get my hands up in time. Took the full hit of the pavement on my chin.  They had to pick me up off the pavement and carry me back with one of my arms over each of their shoulders, like a wounded soldier on the battle field. I didn't feel &quot;normal&quot; again for another 5-10 minutes. Shit sucked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The hawk wears the hats from those</p>
<p>There’s a Santa hat
A dick hat
A rain hat
And a tiny pair of sunglasses I stole from a nieces doll that fit the hawk perfectly</p>
<p>It’s really cool, but the things creepy when we eat another bird, feel like it judges me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think as well with very young children they don’t have as much fear as adults. </p>
<p>An adult will probably tense up quite a bit and assume defensive positions means harm is concentrated in arms and tense muscles transfer this to bones quite easily. </p>
<p>When a child falls often they’re just a big floppy uncoordinated mess so it’s more distributed. </p>
<p>That could be an old wives tale but at least on surface it does seem to make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, except for the lack of fear bit. It's simply that the adult mind has faster reactions and so tenses up quicker.</p>
<p>Same reason drunk people don't seem to hurt themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing on the news of someone who was lifted by a tornado and carried miles from where where they were picked up, then slung to the ground. They survived because something hit them in the head and knocked them unconscious, so their body was relaxed when they hit the ground. Iirc he only had a few broken bones and a concussion from whatever knocked him unconscious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fall a lot. Like a lot a lot. Fell through stuff, over stuff, from stuff... Hurt myself in every way possible. Throughout all of that, I completely lost the fear of getting hurt while falling, and now I barely get hurt at 34. Still fall a lot, but somehow I don’t panic at all, just roll with it and I almost never get hurt severely anymore.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm 6'1&quot; and roughly 150ish pounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it weird and unfair that your natural reaction hurts you more? Like if you're falling you tense up as you said, which is worse for you as opposed to if you just let yourself go. Shouldn't the body's natural reaction be a safety measure and work out so you hurt less?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m super clumsy. You can actually train yourself to have calmer reactions when falling and to fall more safely. Judo, gymnastics, and other sports have specific techniques for handling falls.</p>
<p>However on the other hand, the body’s natural reaction is a good one in a lot of minor accidents and falls anyways. It’s so you’ll instinctively (try to) grab and climb the side of a cliff versus just sliding down to your doom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think when you tense up, it’s your body protecting important parts (like your head for instance) and while we may be more likely to injure our extremities, were less likely to bounce our noggin off the pavement than a drunk or a kid.  Coming from someone who falls a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it doesn't. Being tense is good for falling. But you need to tense up the right way. People who know how to fall roll. They don't do stupid stuff like having a straight arm that then gets broken. </p>
<p>So I guess the problem is that most people today don't learn how to properly roll. Heck, I'm not even sure I can still do it. It did weigh quite a bit less when I did judo. </p>
<p>The only thing you should not do is to try to prevent your fall once you've already lost your balance. That's usualyl not worth it. If you're already half way to the bottom due to an icy driveway or so, don't double the power of the impact by trying to stand up. Accept your fate and try make your fall as close to sitting down as possible.</p></div>		</li>
