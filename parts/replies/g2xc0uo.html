			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning the skin effect where the high frequency signal creates a high current density on the outer layer of the conductor. In some cases the center of the conductor does not even have any current so it could be simply removed. There are cables where the core of the wire is the cheapest steel and is coated with a layer of silver to conduct the signal with the lowest resistance possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The penetration depth of 50Hz is around 10mm so any solid conductor at that frequency with a diameter more than 20mm would have wasted material. That's why the cables on high voltage transmission lines are never one large but multiple 2cm diameter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plus, steel coated with silver will be much stronger (Due to, you know, being steel) and also lighter (a little) than solid copper/silver/etc.</p></div>		</li>
