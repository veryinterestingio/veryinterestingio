			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors work. They create a laser and filter the light to a very very precise wavelength so that it can interfere with itself, and then send it back and forth down a 4km tunnel hundreds of times. As gravitational waves stretch spacetime, they slightly change the wavelength of the light. This very slightly changes their interference and therefore the output measured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's look at a guitar string. If you give it a big pluck, giving lots of energy, the waves travel at a characteristic speed - same as if you give it a little pluck, giving only a little energy. What's different is the amplitude of the wave.</p>
<p>Sound works the same way. The speed of sound in air is constant whether you're whispering or a jet engine.</p>
<p>This is generally true for waves: waves in a particular medium travel at a characteristic speed regardless of energy content.</p>
<p>While within a specific medium, light travels at the same speed regardless of energy, and more energetic light has higher frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're speaking about media, then you pretty much always have disperson. So while you're in first approximation right, in most real-life scenarios, that's wrong though.</p></div>		</li>
