<p>The cooking process works in this way: Water molecules oscillate with the EM field inside the oven and rub against each other.</p>

<p>That is wrong! Microwaves work by adding energy to ALL polar particles, not just water. They work on the principle of dielectric heating, where all molecules (and not just water) try to align to the rapidly rotating EM wave, exciting them and heating them up.</p>
<p>Edit: To all the people saying that microwaves are tuned to the resonant frequency of water, that is the reason for this myth being propagated. Please read this comment by u/SolomonsFootsteps:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>The stuff said above should be correct in theory, but only approximately  correct in practice since the metal does not conduct perfectly</em> </p>
<p>If you run a microwave oven without anything wet inside it, then within a few minutes you will get a similar result to running it with a metal object inside - you will get an electric charge building up on parts of the interior casing where there are irregularities in conduction. Just like with leaving a metal object inside the oven, this will lead to sparking, damage to the magnetron (thats the part that generates the EM wave I think) and eventually cause the oven to fail catastrophically. I'm guessing running the oven with liquid water inside somehow smooths out these irregularities in the electric field inside the oven.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Water make it easier for the static to arc. That's why it can't build up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That smell is the worst. In college we had a brand new 1200w microwave in our common room. Someone set the time to the 3 minutes listed on the bag instead of the popcorn button (~1:15)</p>
<p>The whole floor stank for a week and the microwave was permanently stained. Luckily there were people in the common room watching TV who grabbed the flaming bag and ran it to the laundry room sink to put it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea why/how I ruined a microwave heating water? I used to use a microwave to heat water in a pyrex measuring cup for the french press (chill, Brits, I've since gotten a proper kettle and won't make that mistake again) and one day, about 3-4 minutes in, there was a loud-ish noise and the microwave went dead, wouldn't work anymore. I've always been curious about that one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was there water all over the inside of the microwave oven? You might have superheated the water, resulting in something closely akin to a BLEVE. I’ve done it by accident a couple of times, but it doesn’t seem to be reliably reproducible. If that was what caused your microwave to die, it could have something to do with moisture getting into the wrong places. Check out superheated water videos on YouTube, BLEVE on Wikipedia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming it wasn't a superheating issue as /u/wikey_jack suggested, it was likely just a fault somewhere in the microwave's circuitry. Microwaves are simple machines and should be reliable for decades, but anything can break down, and some designs are just crappy and failure-prone. A friend recently revived an ~2 year old microwave that died, and the cause was a tiny $5 switch component. </p>
<p>Heating water in Pyrex was not likely the root cause. The superheated water thing is rare, but is much more likely if you use distilled water.</p></div>		</li>
