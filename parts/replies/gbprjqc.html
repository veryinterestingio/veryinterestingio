			<div class="markdown"><p>I have suffered from panic disorder my whole life. Partially stemming from ADHD and my father's gene's.</p>
<p>This sounds like such an accurate and legitamite description to me, as I have almost no energy, EVER, more than likely because of how you said, the fight or flight response from stress takes up energy because your body prepares to fight or run...</p>
<p>Thanks for explaining that. Makes me worried about my general health moving forward though as I am only 25. I am trying to eat better and drink a lot more water, quit smoking, etc. It has helped a bit.</p>
<p>EDIT: QUESTION - is the increase of bloodflow to the limbs or heart from stress/fight or flight the cause of tingling we get when getting a panic attack? Leading us to think it is a heart attack</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man this resonates so hard with me. I’m 33 but only recently started dealing with Anxiety and panic attacks (last 2 years or so). Mine were brought on by my kids, I think I feel so much pressure to be there and provide for them that I am constantly in fight or flight mode. I am always exhausted and I get all the symptoms of a heart attack which makes everything worse. I have had numerous check ups and am in good health, but can’t shake that feeling, ya know. I guess I’m not the only one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just a bit younger than you but mine started very late in my 20's. The first one felt like what I'd imagine a stroke was like (Never had one, never known anyone who has). Hot but cold and sweating, ringing ears, couldn't see properly, limbs numb and I just wanted to run (I was in a packed supermarket on a Saturday night buying alcohol before a big night out). It ended in tears and me feeling completely numb for days.</p>
<p>I'm very anxious about my health due to some issues I had and even though they're sorted now, the anxiety stays and fucks me up.</p>
<p>Hope you're coping alright, it's a tough world out there especially with everything going on at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may seem simple, and it's definitely not an end all solution, but four count breathing has really helped me to calm down.</p>
<p>If you have time and you catch yourself feeling anxious, practice taking a deep breath in and counting to 4 slowly, then hold for 4 and breath out for 4. After a couple breaths like that, for me at least, I can usually try to think about what triggered my anxiety.</p>
<p>Why am I panicking? What about this situation is anxiety inducing and is my reaction necessary?</p>
<p>I hope this helps even just a little. Anxiety is awful. I wish you the best in your fight with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, from one parent to another, I get it. But you have to take care of you first, if you aren’t all there emotionally bad things happen. </p>
<p>Kids are much more resilient and forgiving than we are, and if mom/dad have to step away for personal time they’ll be ok. </p>
<p>If you need to head to a doc for help do it, you will all be better off with de-stressed dad in the house. I wish I had taken care of my anxiety sooner, it made everything worse, and your kids feel it too. So me trying to be a “strong mom” backfired a lot. Also, by getting help I was able to teach my kids that everyone needs extra help sometimes and they’ve taken the initiative to find relief from stressors and problems themselves with no shame attached.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a doctor and i might be wrong but doing a panic attack people usually hyperventilate which causes the level of carbon dioxide in the blood to fall which then causes that tingling sensation! So that’s actually usually not a part of the body’s fight of flight reaction but “just” a symptom of hyperventilating. Which happens because of panic... I can’t really explain it any better than that sorry! But it is not dangerous, and if you notice you hyperventilate try to breathe a littler calmer and slower if you can. I suffer from anxiety myself and panic attacks and asthma and usually when I panic I start to feel like I can’t breathe and I hyperventilate and I actually breathe too much. But it’s not my asthma it’s my mind telling me I can’t breathe, even though I can. The worst thing that has ever happened to me due to hyperventilation was passing out which was kind of a blessing because it forced be to breathe normally again, hyperventilating is not dangerous even though it is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Regarding your fear of dying when you feel the tingling, have you ever heard of the diamond in cognitive therapy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went through some... bad times... a few years ago that left me in an panicky mess.</p>
<p>The panic alone was enough to cause GERD and thousands of heart palpitations a day.</p>
<p>I went to cardiologists and to gastroenterologists, and while they found the signs of those two things, they never found a cause. This was after barium swallows, echocardiograms, holter monitors, etc...</p>
<p>My cardiologist said that he has seen a lot of 20-somethings (the same as me) come in recently with palpitations. He said the only thing in common with all of them is stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years later, and I've learned to work with my 'nerves' a bit better. I've learned to take care of myself and realize when I need a break or a rest. GERD is gone and so are the palpitations. </p>
<p>It is amazing how much the brain can influence the body.</p>
<p>Be kind to yourselves, friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. My mother has issues with anxiety and her doctor explained it in a great way that helped understand it.</p>
<p>Know that feeling when you almost fall and you get that rush of adrenaline? Imagine that was going for a long period of time, your body running at 120% percent. Inevitably, you will cause some damage, body is not designed to handle that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just energy, but blood as a whole.</p>
<p>There is a documented case where an individual was going into shock with grave abdominal wounds. It was observed that his abdominal organs went pale from blood being rerouted to other organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mad but very interesting!  </p>
<p>If I have a full blown panic attack, I go very pale and almost green looking. It's comical when you look back on it but it feels like death is imminent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a side fact that was not mentioned as far as I see, the human body, with all of its stretchy blood vessels and a shit-ton of smaller capillaries, can contain a very large amount of blood — way, way more than is actually sloshing inside of us normally. So, sadly without referring to sources ATM, the normal amount of blood present is approximately 5 liters,  and the total capacity of circulatory system, going from memory, is like 20 liters.</p>
<p>So it's a constant <em>rob Peter to pay Paul</em> situation in a human body — some body part vasoconstricts (narrows its blood vessels) and other vasodilates to receive more blood. If one organ receives blood in abundance, then other is slightly hypoxic and lacking blood flow. If you ate a huge meal, you want to lay down and de-blood most of your skeletal muscles, and your brain is sluggish as well, because some blood was redirected for digestion. If you experience great stress, then surface vessels constrict, sending all that sweet oxygen-carrying blood to vital organs, and making your skin go gray and cold (and sweaty, hence &quot;cold sweat&quot;).</p></div>		</li>
