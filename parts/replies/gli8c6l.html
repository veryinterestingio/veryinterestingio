			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're trying to say, but I have to partly disagree. The meaning of the term depends a bit on context. If you ask, &quot;What's the tensile strength of steel,&quot; then yeah, that's material based. If, on the other hand, you ask, &quot;What's the tensile strength of this rope I'm holding,&quot; you're now asking how much tension that rope can withstand before it starts to fail. It's still a correct use of the term, but the answer now depends on a bunch of factors including the material composition of the rope, what condition it's in, how dry it is, its temperature, whether it's baking in the sun, etc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there isn't any one value we can assign to the term &quot;overall strength&quot;, because any object or material will perform differently under tension vs compression vs shear stress.</p>
<p>So /u/DarkStarStorm's question makes sense as stated, though I do understand what you're trying to say as well. To elaborate a bit, OP, the rod will have more strength than the cable under pure tension; however, cable can obviously withstand far more stress from bending, and is thus preferred for applications where bending is an issue - like with suspension bridges, where the weight of the steel as well as the bridge it's suspending both introduce serious bending force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that what OP really wants to know is, what makes cables better/more resilient than rods in certain applications?</p></div>		</li>
