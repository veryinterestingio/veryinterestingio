			<div class="markdown"><p>So idk if you're just going for the super super simple explanation but you're on the right track. </p>
<p>Anyway this is one of the topics I really enjoyed in A&amp;P, so ill reply. First, I believe what you're referring to is how the sensation on your fingertips is more precise than on your quad, for example. This isn't because the nerves are not as good, its because that's not their purpose, your body is relatively specific about the way it designs things its rather genius right. So its almost like your body knew you wouldn't really need to be super precise with sensation on larger parts of the body like the thigh or back as much as your hands where thats your main source for your sense of touch. So how it works if I remember correctly, is basically the less precision you need in that are the more spread out the nerves are. Think of it like power lines right, if you have a town of 500 people let's say and hypothetically a power line can support 1000 people, you're not gonna set up a power line for every individual person, you're gonna build one for the whole town and the people closer have more access than the ones that live on the opposite side of town. Whereas if you have a major city with 30000 people you're gonna have to build more than just one power line, and at this point the numbers may hypothetically be high enough to consider future growth, you may put a few extra so you don't have to build more right away if more people come in. Basically your nerves are the power lines in that analogy and the number of people represents the desired amount of precision. Thigh = small town = less precision required = less nerves. </p>
<p>Second, when you really think about it your &quot;internal&quot; nerves are much better than your &quot;external&quot; well really, they're all internal nerves otherwise I believe you'd be in agonizing pain because oxygen on an open nerve doesn't feel good iirc. Back to my point they're better, in my opinion, because think about it like this. Your nerves know your body better than you do, you ever notice your internal organs don't itch? That'd be a pretty big flaw wouldn't it? Or when you get hungry you can feel it in your stomach because of your nervous system. Sensation and digestion are two different nervous systems actually. Sensation is your Central Nervous System, and digestion is your Peripheral Nervous System. Easy way to remember Central Nervous System (CNS) is what activates your &quot;fight or flight&quot; response in crisis. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) is your rest and digest response. If your fight or flight activates your PNS will shut off for the most part other than essential functions for other systems or life. Basically your &quot;internal &quot; nerves are smart enough to assess changes is levels of stress and realize that you're in a crisis. So now you fight or flight kicks in you get a bunch of epinephrine pumped into your system giving a huge adrenaline rush to deal with this stressor. In the meantime your digestive system has halted, all urinary and bowel movement too. Your body literally will change the way it runs so that it can allow you to use everything to deal with this stressor. I'd consider those some pretty &quot;good&quot; nerves.
I'm not trying to school you, I just thought maybe you knew it and were giving the simplest response and keeping it short. And if not its some really interesting things to learn, take it or leave it. Take care m8.</p>
<p>Hopefully you understand I just wanted to elaborate so people didn't get the wrong idea. Plus neuro is super interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I'm not entirely sure, but I do believe a panic attack is fight or flight, it would depend on how long you have it for and how intense it is. Its my understanding that a panic attack wouldn't really last long enough for there to be a need to halt functions.</p></div>		</li>
