<blockquote>
<p>© is Copyright. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's automatic and free. You wrote this post, so you own the copyright (in the US).  You can use the mark to let others know that you you are aware of your rights. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>™ is Trademark.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's simply a <em>claim</em>. You can simply declare that you own a phrase like, &quot;Explain Like I'm Five&quot;™ in a given context. Go ahead and use that &quot;™&quot; whenever you want. You're establishing a pattern and staking a claim. A court would determine if you actually do. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>® is Registered Trademark</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a legal claim. The USPTO will care if you use it and have not registered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The relevant bit is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Reddit the following license to use that Content:
When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you keep the copyright on your own post. However, you give reddit permission to use the content of your post, and publish your content to other users. Because you keep the copyright (and the license you give to reddit is non-exclusive), you are allowed to first post something on reddit and then post it on 4chan. Had you given the copyright on your post to reddit, you wouldn't be allowed to publish your own post anywhere else anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually you are granting unlimited use of your copyright including for their profit via advertising but mostly for their use in distribution and storage. You are not sure ending your right to share this same content elsewhere or challenge people who are not Reddit from distributing it. </p></div>		</li>
