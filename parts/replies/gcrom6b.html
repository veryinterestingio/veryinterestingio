			<div class="markdown"><p>Star Trek Discovery stole the idea of  using giant space tardigrades for instantaneous travel from an indie video game in development. Even some of the main characters of the show seem to be stolen ideas from that game. They did not give any credit or pay any money to the game dev, but they won in court because they have better lawyers. Very sickening.</p>
