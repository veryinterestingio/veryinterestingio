			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen an anaphylactic reaction to a dairy allergy. It was the scariest thing I'd ever seen. My son is severely allergic to dairy. A dietician spent 2 hours to convince me to give him a gtube formula that was dairy based but chemically altered to be broken down. I had huge doubts but the doctor said to trust the dietician.</p>
<p>Because of my doubts, I started with only 20 ml of this formula. Within 10 minutes, he started having hives show up all over him. Looked like ant bites at first, then they spread into larger splotches. The splotches grew bigger and started covering large portions of his body. My first instinct was to flush out his tummy. I pushed in 6 ozs of water thru his gtube, then pulled it back out. I did this twice. I then had to load him up in my vehicle and rush to the ER. He ended up getting dosed with epi-pens twice. They also had to give him iv benedryl and steroids. We were there for 2 days. He came close to having to be intubated because of the swelling. Super scary business.</p>
<p>Several people in my family have severe allergies like this. The odd thing is that each one of us are allergic to something different. My son - dairy. My mother - iodine/shellfish. Me - nightshade vegetables such as peppers and eggplant. Is there any research into following familial histories for allergic reations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The doctor just kept saying I'm so sorry over and over. I didn't give the dietician a chance to talk. I just flat out verbally reamed her out. I did fire the doctor from working with my son. Told her she wasn't getting a second chance to kill him. We have a fantastic special needs pediatrician now.</p>
<p>I didn't pursue anything legal. I understand they did what they did because they thought he was just lactose intolerant. Doesn't excuse them pushing something that a parent was uncomfortable with. I absolutely have confirmed medical tests showing severe dairy allergy in his permanent records now and none of his new doctors question me about it.</p>
<p>I don't know if their director reprimanded them in any way. I never went back there again.  All in all, the whole thing scared the shit out of me but he's okay now. I'm extremely strict on what dietary advice I'll listen to from any new dietician now and tell them no offense meant and spill the story. Our new one understands. She's helped me find alternative gtube formulas as back ups to the main one we use. We skin test everything in multiple locations on him now before he ingests anything new. She's also helped me calculate out a blended diet regime to help him with natural vitamins. He's doing great nutrition wise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate you had to experience that. Very terrifying.</p>
<p>Yes casein allergy is known as milk allergy, very different and much more serious than lactose intolerance.</p>
<p>Your family absolutely has a genetic predisposition for severe allergic reactions, you've just all over responded to different things, hah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was horrible. I called that doctor the day after we got home and chewed her out, up one side and down the other. I then chewed out the dietician. Finally ended with a 30 minute complaint session with their department director. I had photos and ER notes with me to back it all up. He was horrified for us too. Dunno what ever happened to the dietician but she never got another chance with us. I also found a new special needs pediatrician.</p>
<p>When I found out I was allergic to peppers and eggplants, it was because I had decided to become a back yard farmer. I kept getting hives and swelling all over my face every couple of weeks. Twice was so bad my eyes were almost swollen shut. The ER doctor that time said I probably got bitten by a spider. I vowed to be more careful. Kept on gardening. I used to graze while I was cleaning out weeds or picking veggies for the dinner salads. It was a lovely little raised bed garden. Apparently, from touching the plants so much (the oils) I'm now sensitive enough that my lips will swell up even if I eat cooked varieties... jalapeno, bell pepper, sweet peppers, eggplant, and any other kind of peppers. Sometimes tomatoes will do it too if I eat too many raw ones. If I eat raw peppers, I'm most likely headed to the ER for some shots. It's just so bizarre and completely sucks to have a pepper allergy and live in Texas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter is allergic to dairy as well and one story I read once sticks in my brain as an absolute worst case scenario. A kid at school had a severe dairy allergy and one of their classmates was being a bully and threw a cheese patty which landed on the kid's neck/ face.  The kid died. It's so scary! I'm glad your son is ok!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately there's <strong>A LOT</strong> we don't understand about the immune system. </p>
<p>Unfortunately you won the genetic lottery and developed an immune system capable of killing you, why it happened at the same time? No idea.</p>
<p>However there is a correlation between developing autoimmune disorders and entering young adulthood, there's really not a reason known for that either but it's taken into account for diagnosis.</p>
<p>I know allergy isn't the same thing but maybe it's something to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any correlation between hormonal changes And allergies? I developed an anaphlatic allergy to scaly fish with my first pregnancy. It stayed with subsequent pregnancies. My cat dander allergy went from strong to severe with my second pregnancy. So curious of the link between hormones (or something else?) and allergies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with me and the Celiac Disease. Ate wheat happily all my life, and suddenly in midlife I couldn't absorb iron. Got tired of them throwing me out of the bloodmobile with extreme prejudice. Supplements didn't help, but cutting out wheat did. Why at my age? </p>
<p>Then again, I didn't need my wisdom tooth out until midlife, either. Maybe I'm a late bloomer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg same with me. Used to love fish and eat it all the time. Then one day I ate shrimp and got sick and threw up. Same thing when I tried again. Regular fish (not shellfish) have a less severe reaction, but I definitely feel sick to my stomach. It'd wake me up at night. Eggs similar. I can eat a couple and feel a bit sick, but not too bad. Three is off the table. Oddly enough, I've had salmon a couple times and been okay. Human body is weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read before, IgE undergoes some culling stage when first produced in marrow, where if it reacts to itself its destroyed, then heads to the thymus? I think. All antigens are brought there and speed dating occurs. If IgE matches with any antigen(and big if, thymus is yuuuge for these things), its locked in and copied out to lymph nodes. From then, you're allergic to that antigen for life.</p>
<p>Then the most common guess being chucked around the office is kids aren't 'exposed enough' to various things while growing, leading to intolerances. However if total volume of IgE is highest during adolescence, then wouldn't a <em>lack</em> of exposure be actually better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm rusty on that specific physiology, but I think you're right on what happens in the thymus, but it's the development of T-cells (not IgE), and coding of the major histocompatibility complex, to differentiate between foreign and self.</p>
<p>And yes when APCs (antigen presenting cells) &quot;show&quot; proteins to memory B-cells the foreign protein is coded against and dissemination occurs, B-cells aggregate in the lymphatic system which is like the adaptive immunity factory, haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also for /u/philmarcracken</p>
<p>This does sound like T cells' central tolerance mechanism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From what I've read before, IgE undergoes some culling stage when first produced in marrow, where if it reacts to itself its destroyed, then heads to the thymus?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These T cells are generated in the thymus, and that involves randomly creating a unique TCR (not MCH) for each of them. Some of these random TCRs are self-reactive, and they are tested for that by stromal cells of the thymic medulla. These cells express the transcription factor Aire, which lets them express a whole bunch of normally tissue-specific antigens such as insulin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All antigens are brought there and speed dating occurs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, those antigens aren't brought in; the thymic medulla has this unique physiological function that lets it make antigens from all around the body, so that new T cells may be tested against them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If IgE matches with any antigen(and big if, thymus is yuuuge for these things), its locked in and copied out to lymph nodes. From then, you're allergic to that antigen for life..  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a reaction occurs, this information is <em>not</em> sent out to the lymph nodes. Quite the opposite: the self-reactive T cell is promptly destroyed to prevent them from being released into circulation to wreak all sorts of autoimmune havoc. On a sidenote, that wouldn't be termed an allergy -- reactions against an endogenous antigen are generally just referred to as autoimmune disorders, while &quot;allergies&quot; is reserved for reactions against harmless exogenous antigens (also called allergens).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>T-cells undergo that process you described in the thymus. IgE is a protein that is made by B-cells. B-cells (that will produce IgE) undergo that process you described in the bone marrow. Two separate but related processes :)</p></div>		</li>
