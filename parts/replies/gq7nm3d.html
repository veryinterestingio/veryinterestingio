			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a benefit to combining them?  When I worked out in my twenties I would do a short warm up set followed by a 3 rep max weight set and then I would do a middle area weight set that I would do max number of reps I could. I get big pretty quick but wanted a bit more endurance as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There can be benefit from a hypertrophy standpoint. A stronger muscle is a bigger muscle, usually. At the same time most powerlifting exercises are a skill and not just something that 1:1 relates to raw power, there's a lot of technique and motor unit recruitment happening in a very specific pattern. Opinions (even academic research) still differ greatly on what the perfect way to training for growth is, even though we know a lot more nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually just get decent in both areas but master neither. With lifting you can have three different goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be strong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get big</p>
</li>
<li>Be ripped</li>
</ol>
<p>Most can really accomplish one. If youâ€™re young with good genes you can hit two of those goals. You need good genes and extra help to get all three. Unless your goal is kinda big and kinda strong and kinda ripped</p></div>		</li>
