			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear you! I told my work I'd be back after a few days when I had a double inguinal hernia op ended up be ridden for 3 weeks. </p>
<p>Without getting too descriptive I had very severe swelling in my private parts to the point testicular strangulation was serious risk. I had to lie in bed with pillow under my hips to help fluid drain away. I had black and blue bruises all over my abdomen.  </p>
<p>Took me few months to regain physical confidence to walk quickly and to this day if my kids and climbing on me and they go anywhere near where I had the haematoma, I jump and shriek like a school girl. </p>
<p>If you are going through this right now don't be afraid, just be very patient and careful. You will heal and call a doc if anything gets worse.</p></div>		</li>
