			<div class="markdown"><p>You may carry the genes for a particular autoimmune disease but those genes may never &quot;turn on&quot; for you. Whereas when you pass that gene to your children they could be born with it turned on.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone knows yet what makes the genes turn on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the gene regulation itself. Gene regulation is very complex. One gene can be regulated under multiple different promoters. There is also epigenetics to consider. There are portions of your genome that are &quot;silenced&quot; because they are methylated and as such are inactive. This is why CRISPR is such a powerful tool because it can be used in more ways than just cutting and pasting in DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  For example, if your identical twin has type 1 diabetes you have a 35% chance of getting it too, which is much higher than the average person but hardly absolute.  There look to be many many environmental triggers that may be coming into play (exposure to different viruses, cleanliness of the environment, quite a lot of small lifestyle factors that are still under study, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of ways in which autoimmune disorders can arise. Obviously there are genetic predispositions that may encode cellular products that are non functional, harmful or result in defunct pathways that don't correctly protect against inflammatory processes. There are also environmental stimuli that can cause autoimmune disorders. For example some pathogens recognized by the immune system may also 'look like' or share certain features with other tissues in body. Streptococcal infections can trigger antibodies that mistakenly attack cardiac tissue leading to rheumatic heart disease.</p></div>		</li>
