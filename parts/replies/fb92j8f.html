			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the mass-5 roadblock really the fundamental problem? I don’t know what the numbers are but my impression was that even if there were a stable mass 5 isotope the universe would still be predominantly hydrogen, followed by helium, followed by trace amounts of heavier elements and still very few actual heavy elements.</p>
<p>The first bottleneck was deuterium formation which couldn’t really happen until the radiation dominated universe cooled down until few photons had enough energy to break it apart. Once that happened deuterium could fuse with other nucleons to produce Helium isotopes, but since at this point the universe was relatively cool, fusion into increasingly heavy elements would be strongly suppressed because of the growing Coulomb barrier that needs to be overcome. Of course, free neutrons don’t have to worry about the Coulomb barrier so neutron capture and eventual radioactive decay would be the most prominent method of forming heavier elements, but any neutrons already bound inside a nucleus would be very unlikely to undergo further fusion with other heavier isotopes. </p>
<p>If that’s not wrong (it could be, but that’s what I learned in my cosmology course in college), then I’d say the other posts do hit on the fundamental problem, which would be the interplay of time and temperature. Heavier Isotopes could only form when the universe was hot enough for nucleons and lighter isotopes to overcome the Coulomb barrier, with heavier isotopes requiring higher temperatures, but this process could only happen once the universe was cool enough for deuterium to be safe from photodissociation, meaning there usually wasn’t enough energy to fuse lighter isotopes into heavier ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a Universe with no roadblock, you'd be able to get to carbon reasonably quickly, and avoid the glacially slow deuterium step using the CNO cycle. Once you got your first bit of carbon, the helium production rate would explode, and you'd quickly work up the chain.</p>
<p>The energy produced by widespread fusion would not be negligible, and would help with getting to iron before things get too cold.</p>
<p>Editing to add: The timescale of the (hot) CNO cycle is like 2-3 minutes, and many instances would finish faster than this. This is more than fast enough to increase the neutron count meaningfully during BBN, while the neutron count is essentially fixed in a Universe like ours that didn't have the option of a carbon catalyst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has nothing to do with the mass 5 roadblock, though, since the CNO cycle completely bypasses that, anyway.</p>
<p>My point was that because of the deuterium roadblock, the mass 5 and 8 roadblocks are only of minor importance. Of course if there were no roadblocks at all things would look very different. In fact, if there were no deuterium roadblock but still no stable mass 5 or 8 isotopes things would look very different, too, but that wasn’t my point.</p></div>		</li>
