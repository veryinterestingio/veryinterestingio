			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they are generally transported in boxes with 20 or so to a box, and while there are ventilation holes they can't each sit at a hole to look out. And they are generally transported at night, to be released in the morning. I don't think anyone really understands how this works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was another test done with birds in Germany where they were put in a white, funnel shaped enclosure and not allowed to see outside. Ink was placed on the bottom. A species of bird that migrates from Germany to Britain was placed in the enclosure just as migration was beginning. The result was ink mostly in the correct direction the bird would need to fly (I'm assuming WNW). Even while enclosed the majority of ink was in the direction the bird needed to migrate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homing pigeons use the Earth's magnetic field by detecting the angle of the field relative to the surface of the Earth. If they say need to go north 5Â° (and this is just for example) a little level in their head is tilted at a certain angle that corresponds with that direction and distance. If they need to go, say, north 10 degrees, then that level will have a greater angle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how some worms find out where &quot;up&quot; is.  But I do not think it has been proven that pigeons detect the magnetic field in a similiar way? Or do you have some paper on that? I would be very interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. For those who want more detail on magnetoreception and baroreception in birds, Paul O'Neill has a relatively approachable review paper on the topic. Use sci-hub.tw to get the paper if this site won't give it to you for free. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dgd.12025" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1111/dgd.12025</a></p></div>		</li>
