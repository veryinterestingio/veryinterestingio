			<div class="markdown"><p>The size of the digestive tract supposedly has to do with diet. Long digestive tracts are typically found in herbivores since it takes a long time to digest and get all the energy out of plant matter (think of cows and their three stomachs). On the other hand carnivores generally have short digestive tracts since meat gives much more energy but you donâ€™t want raw meat sitting in your system for too long.</p>
<p>Humans have medium length digestive tracts which is basically the worst of both worlds. The reason it works for us is cooking - cooked veg releases energy quickly and cooked meat is less dangerous to have in your stomach. Our medium length digestive tract is optimized for cooked food</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Because humans started to cook food, our digestive tracts could become shorter, which left energy available for bigger brains.</p></div>		</li>
