			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard about the boosters. Are the boosters actually different than the original vaccine? I assumed they were the same just given at a later date and only 1 dose instead of 2.</p>
<p>I've been hearing that the current vaccines are less effective against the Delta variant so I was wondering what the pharma companies are doing about it. But I guess with trade secrets and regulations, we won't really know until a product gets cleared for market.</p></div>		</li>

You can find them on <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/.," target="_blank"><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a></a></p>

<p>It's hard to tell what will happen, however. We may start administering third doses by the time boosters against variants and multi-variant vaccines are available. We could be easily be dosing mRNA vaccines, as primary and boosters, against new variants now, we have the technology, we don't have the trust and confidence and regulatory mechanisms for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies out of Israel showed effectiveness against infection to be in the 40-50 percent range.  Which tbh given what I’ve read and what I’ve seen anecdotally makes more sense to me than 88 percent ... against hospitalization, I buy, but the Israel numbers make more sense wrt infection and non-hospitalization cases.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may rant slightly, it bugs me when people say that 88% is only a modest difference relative to 94%. It's actually half as good. With the mRNA vaccines, you had a 1 in 17 chance to get the COVID from the original virus with its ID50, and you have a 1 in 8 chance to get COVID from the Delta variant with its ID50. The protections for severe disease are similarly diminished, though the protection was so amazingly good against severe disease that it still remains excellent.</p>
<p>Of course there are confounding factors. In the US at least, the vaccinated population skews heavily toward older and sicker people, both because they were prioritized first for vaccination and because younger people have generally seen vaccination as less urgent because of their lower risk of death (never mind how incredibly awful Long COVID is and that it hits young people plenty often). The bulk of the people being hospitalized and dying from breakthrough Delta cases are elderly, suggesting that protection against hospitalization and death in younger people is still extremely robust, but unfortunately we don't have as much data to break it down by demographics because CDC stopped tracking non-hospitalization/death breakthrough infections. (I am overall still highly confident in CDC and laud their efforts and expertise. However, in my decidedly non-expert opinion, that was a mistake.)</p>
<p>I would still love to see more data on Long COVID from breakthrough cases (at this point with Delta, though previously I wanted it for original and Alpha). If the same percentage of breakthrough cause Long COVID as as unvaccinated, that ends up being roughly 98-99% effectiveness against life-altering debilitation, which is very solid but still leaves substantial risk of life-altering disabilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm definitely not saying that they're ineffective. Just not as effective. So I was wondering if there was a new vaccine on the way to target variants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second shot is a booster. The third will also be a booster and it will probably be the same vaccine. Seeing the protein spike multiple times improves your immune system's response to it. </p>
<p>Pfizer had already announced that they're working in a vaccine for the variants. Since the current vaccine is still very effective against variants, it's not as important to get a variant vaccine as it was to get the first one.</p></div>		</li>
