			<div class="markdown"><p>nice =) </p>
<p>so can I ask - is it that dna splitting in plants is subject to the same mutation that we get, but if a significant section does fail it will just be replaced by other bits of the plant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, plants are subject to random mutation as well. Mutation fits in three very general categories (still ELI5)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Harmful: the mutation makes survival more difficult. Plants generally live with the issue and simply grow wierdly, or may die if serrious enough,and will be replaced by another plant. Humans with harmful mutations often do not make it to birth at all, or if they do, live their entire life (however long) with what is generally referred to as a generic disease. Often people still live long lives dispite the mutation, but the severity and consequences vary significantly. Cancer can be cause by an active mutation, and is just one example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neutral: a mutation that does not inpact survival is simply interesting and not particularly noteworthy. One tree clone begins growing different on one branch than the others, but doesn't hurt nor help. In people there are thousands of examples, like how some people have no wisdom teeth, and some people have red hair, there are more examples of nutral mutations in humans than I could ever list.</p>
</li>
<li>Beneficial: you know this best by the name &quot;evolution&quot;. Mutations which give one organism an advantage over all others, and generally increases the chances of survival (in health and in its  environment). A tree may have had a mutation to have thicker bark, which could have allowed it to survive a forest fire, and now that tree is alone to repopulate the forest, is one example of evolution in action. In humans we have similar examples of mutations that historically gave us an advantage over other mamals, but again far more than I could ever list.</li>
</ul>
<p>edit: remember this is still ELI5 and it really is more complicated than this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the opposite of pointless, and that's the problem. Telomere shortening is easily explained (something involved in the cell division process gets shorter) and highly intuitive (when things get shorter they eventually disappear) and implies obvious solutions (find a way to stop the thing from getting shorter). If telomere shortening were the singular cause of aging, biological immortality would be a perfectly viable goal. Some people want to believe that's possible, and some people want to convince other people that it's a viable goal, so telomere shortening is sometimes presented in a way that implies it to be the major cause of aging.</p>
<p>That's worse than pointless, in some ways, and it's even more pointedly misinformation than the pointless kind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not all trees can be grown from cuttings.  some will never put roots out.  similarly, some trees will die completely if you cut them down to the ground.  not everything can resprout.</p>
<p>also, if i say to you, 'my granny smith apple tree grew old and died' and your reply is 'no it didn't. all granny smiths are clones so the tree can never die.'  you're just going to sound crazy.</p></div>		</li>
