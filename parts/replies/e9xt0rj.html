			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just it--it's not exactly a liquid. A colloid is a mixture. The components of the mixture can be liquids, solids, and gases. Milk is mostly composed of liquids (the water and fats) but also contains proteins, which are solids. </p>
<p>It acts like a liquid for most purposes, but that's just due to the medium of the suspension being a liquid. Fog is also a colloid and behaves more like a gas because the smaller particles of water are suspended in air. </p>
<p>The particles suspended in colloids are very small, but think of it at a much much larger scale. If you had a glass of water with some rocks in it, you couldn't very well call the entire contents of your glass a liquid. There's solids in there too. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, there are two main options for something that is &quot;neither&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It can be a liquid that doesn't behave the way we expect liquids to behave, like syrup. Syrup is liquid, it just has high viscosity.</p>
</li>
<li>It can be a mixture of liquid and solid stuff, which together behave like something in between. This makes it a colloid, and each individual molecule in that mixture is either liquid or solid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the word &quot;colloid&quot; is a lot broader than just this, and also covers things like aerosols, ultra-fine foam, emulsions, etc.</p></div>		</li>
