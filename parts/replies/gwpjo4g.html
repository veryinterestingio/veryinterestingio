			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think this is a double edged sword for me. Its possible I haven't noticed the cuts as much because of my constant tan thats taken a bit of a hit during the pandemic. I'm really careful not to be stingy with my sunscreen, honestly, but the lotion isn't as common for me. Thin skin on the shins means I probably should a little more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tanning IS damage, so if you want to protect your skin from cancer and aging, avoid getting a tan by covering up and using broad spectrum sunscreen when you can't.</p>
<p>That said, aging isn't a bad thing, and I personally think it's worth the risk to bask in the beautiful sunshine.</p>
<p>Edit: and to answer your question, I don't think adding oil over top of your sunscreen will have any effect on the sunscreen afaik, unless you're adding enough oil to dilute the protective layer.</p></div>		</li>
