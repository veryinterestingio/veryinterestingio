<p>Anabolic steroids are of the third class, when there is relatively little testosterone around, like in a woman, they will activate the receptor causing masculinizing effect but to a lesser degree than giving a woman straight testosterone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When given to a man, they will block his testosterone from acting with its full strength, so overall that man will end up becoming less masculine.</p>
<p>Not all anabolic steroids are less virilizing than testosterone. Trenbolone, fluoxymesterone, methyltrienolone, mibolerone are all more androgenic.   </p>
<p>Plus thatâ€™s not OPs question. He asks why some of them (including testosterone) cause enlargement of the clitoris in adult women but not enlargement of the penis in adult men.   </p>
<p>The answer is, that there are more factors limiting the growth of tissue under any hormone. Men have been exposed to all the growing potential during puberty, women have not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait no? Anabolics overload the feedback loop and shuts down testosteron production. That's why you get smaller testicles. Easily countered with a luteinizing hormone analog like human chorionic gonadotropin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Explained the original question and gave a clear, very easy explanation on why steroid use for men does what it does. Bravo.</p></div>		</li>
