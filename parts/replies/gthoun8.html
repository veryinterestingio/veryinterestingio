<p>Act 2 starts with Scott(Ant-man) showing up at the Avengers HQ, planning the time heist, and then executing it.</p>
<p>Act 3 is the entire fight with alternate Thanos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my understanding, Act 3 doesn’t go until the credits roll, right? There’s the climax, which is when the main tension is resolved (aka Thanos finally defeated once and for all), and then there’s another part that’s not actually Act 3, when loose ends are tied up and things settle again. What’s it called? Epilogue? Denuement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That movie fits the five act structure better.</p>
<p>Act I - Vince and Jules get the briefcase and delivers it to Wallace</p>
<p>Act II - Vince's date with Mia Wallace</p>
<p>Act III - Butch, Wallace, and the Watch</p>
<p>Act IV - Flash Back: Vince and Jules have a problem delivering the briefcase to Wallace</p>
<p>Act V - Jules get philosophical in the coffee shop.</p>
<p><strong>Or</strong> you could view it as three three acts.</p>
<p>Part I - Vincent</p>
<ul>
<li>Act I - Vince and Jules get the briefcase and delivers it to Wallace</li>
<li>Act II - Vince's date with Mia Wallace</li>
<li>Act III - Mia's OD</li>
</ul>
<p>Part II - Butch</p>
<ul>
<li>Act I - Walkin, the Watch, and <del>Esmeralda of the Wolves</del> the taxi ride</li>
<li>Act II - Butch's quest for the Watch and his battle with Vincent and Wallace</li>
<li>Act III - The Sex Dungeon</li>
</ul>
<p>Part III - Jules</p>
<ul>
<li>Act I - Jules witnesses a Miracle</li>
<li>Act II - The Wolf comes to clean up a mess</li>
<li>Act III - Jules get philosophical in the coffee shop.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha! Yeah, pulp fiction is hard to digest, but Tarantino is pretty well known for not following a 3 Act movie structure. Admittedly, I’ve only seen pulp fiction once and I was on Wikipedia trying to keep up with timelines the whole time (still enjoyed it a lot- I love tarantino).</p></div>		</li>
