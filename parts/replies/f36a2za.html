			<div class="markdown"><p>About bite marks, you've hit on a common challenge in bone surface modification studies called equifinality. In short - different processes can produce similar mark types. In general, we look for evidence of crushing and impact damage (cracking, compression, etc.). Once we have that, we start looking for novel structures associated with specific tooth shapes or behaviors. For example, theropod teeth are serrated, and they often leave a striated pattern in each tooth mark, crocs have prominent ridges on their teeth called carinae, and they leave subscores inside their tooth marks, etc. We are starting to get more quantitative with these identifications too. Several different researchers are starting to use statistical methods to compare cross sectional shape of different bone surface modification types, and preliminary results are being pretty successful at differentiating bite marks, cut marks, etc. in modern samples with known sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa neat. By statistical methods would you mean something like machine learning? Would this be image data, or something more advanced like scanning the 3d shape or even surface contours?</p></div>		</li>
