			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a description of the impact site from an investigation 19 years after it happened:
“Kulik led a scientific expedition to the Tunguska blast site in 1927. He hired local Evenki hunters to guide his team to the centre of the blast area, where they expected to find an impact crater. To their surprise, there was no crater to be found at ground zero. Instead they found a zone, roughly 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) across, where the trees were scorched and devoid of branches, but still standing upright.[26] Trees more distant from the center had been partly scorched and knocked down in a direction away from the center, creating a large radial pattern of downed trees.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, it was established that the zone of leveled forest occupied an area of 2,150 km2 (830 sq mi), its shape resembling a gigantic spread-eagled butterfly with a &quot;wingspan&quot; of 70 km (43 mi) and a &quot;body length&quot; of 55 km (34 mi).” [From Wikipedia] <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Per <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p>The explosion is generally attributed to the air burst of a meteoroid. It is classified as an impact event, even though no impact crater has been found; the object is thought to have disintegrated at an altitude of 5 to 10 kilometres (3 to 6 miles) rather than to have hit the surface of the Earth.</p></div>		</li>
