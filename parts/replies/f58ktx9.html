			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct on the large scale, but we are able to create divergence free beams over certain distances (for instance: <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-31-3-500" target="_blank">https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-31-3-500</a> ) by manipulating light in a special way with special TEM modes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual question for you. Is the far-field at all any sort of specific distance away from the point of emission, or does it just refer to the space &quot;far away&quot;?</p>
<p>Like, if we could build one of those special TEM things the other guy mentioned that was a light year long, does that just sort of inherently make the whole thing a really long near-field?</p></div>		</li>

Although not with a confined wavefront as most people would think of 'laser beams'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could that be used to create a vertical light clock that, from the perspective of a viewer on the platform outside the special relativity train, would miss the top mirror on the clock when beamed from the bottom, if the train were moving at a certain speed?</p>
<p>This has always been a hole in my understanding of that heuristic. If the beam is straight, why can the platform viewer always find an angled wavefront? And if it isn't, is there a fundamental limitation on our ability to collimate a beam so that special relativity holds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also do it with a plane wave, but like I mentioned elsewhere, just like a plane wave, you cannot physically create a perfect Bessel beam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As stated in the wiki article, it is impossible for a perfect Bessel beam to be created (i.e. zero diffraction over infinite distance in a uniform medium) due to it requiring infinite energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can mathematically exist, it's called a plane wave. But you cannot physically produce such a wave.</p>
<p>Though the larger the width of your beam, the closer it can behave to a plane wave. A demonstration of this is given in /u/srpskamod's comment where the beam divergence depends on how narrow the beam gets.</p></div>		</li>
