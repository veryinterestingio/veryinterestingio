<p>Those particles don't exist long enough to do anything - and in fact, since they don't interact with anything they arguably don't &quot;exist&quot; at all. But the fields are there, throughout the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is commonly said but is probably false. These particles do <em>exist in the physical reality</em>. In 2011 the Swedish university Chalmers <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/news/Pages/Chalmers-scientists-create-light-from-vacuum.aspx" target="_blank">managed to separate a vacuum-spawned virtual photon pair</a> from each other with a SQUID, detecting it as microwave radiation. You can essentially &quot;materialize&quot; virtual particles by kinetically separating them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa. Have we finally figured out how to harvest energy from empty space? Or does it take a lot more energy to SQUID the particle than you could receive from it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not violate the law of energy conservation. It takes the same or a little bit more energy to SQUID it than extract it. We're talking very strong current to generate a weak microwave effect. If you want a quantum microwave I guess it's cool but it lacks practical applications.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, quantum mechanics reveals that the entire universe is filled with quantum energy fields that have a little bit of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, obvious next question- are those fields separable from <em>space</em>, or are they an inseparable part of it? As in, could one hypothetically have an area of space without those fields in it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as my understanding, those fields <em>are</em> space. They <em>are</em> existence. The closest thing would be a field energy of zero, but I don't think that's possible, either. I'm not a physicist, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A perfect zero field energy seems impossible to achieve in our universe IIRC. Some theories claim that we are in a bubble of &quot;false vacuum&quot;, a field who has jumped to a &quot;hump&quot; in the energy levels and is now stuck at a higher-than-zero energy. In that case the universe might annihilate itself at any moment. Scary stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, &quot;empty space&quot; is still different from &quot;no space&quot;, right? </p>
<p>Inside our universe we can have space free of particles. &quot;Outside&quot; the universe, there is no space. Like our universe is expanding space into no space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that these fields have a value at each point in space.  The closest thing to what your thinking would be if the field had the value 0, but the field is still there, it just has a value of 0.  This is weird to think about, like: I don't have any apples if I have zero apples, but this is quickly brushed over by realizing that these fields by definition can't be equal to 0, there's always some background fluctuations inherent to the structure of the fields themselves.</p></div>		</li>
