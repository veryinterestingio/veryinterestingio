			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there's also an element of that unexpected result your brain was primed against being harmless.  A laugh is like the opposite of, &quot;Oh shit, this isn't right!&quot;  Humor seems to suppress a fear or anxious response, which is why some things seem to have a fine line between funny and scary (clowns, exaggerated physical features, etc.).</p>
<p>Also, in specific response to why we laugh instead of silently process a humorous response, this is clearly a social cue to others attempting to process the same information.  &quot;Unexpected, but no danger&quot; is the message you're sharing with your laugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laughter is kind of the “false alarm” signal. It lets people around you know that something surprising/unexpected happened but that thing is not dangerous or upsetting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When things happen that our brains weren't anticipating, it can cause all kinds of reactions, laughter to something funny, shock or horror at seeing something bad happen, making that face when something you taste doesn't taste like you thought it would, etc. . .</p>
<p>And we can be desensitized to many of those unanticipated results over time. With a joke, it can be the next time you hear it, you already know what the punchline is so your brain isn't anticipating something normal this time, but just the anticipation of waiting to see a newbie hear the joke and how they react for the first time can cause you to laugh just as much as the first time you heard it. After hearing the joke so many times and seeing other's reactions so many times, it just kinda wears off and isn't that funny to you. </p>
<p>Same thing happens to others that have seen too much shocking stuff, they just don't get that shocked anymore so no more gasps or covering your eyes when you see something bad happening.</p></div>		</li>
