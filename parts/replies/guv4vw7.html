			<div class="markdown"><p>I can add to this. Shells of a given species will all grow on the same side for breeding. Snails (and slugs) have one multipurpose hole on their side, and those holes need to be on the same side to line up properly when they want to mate. Their shells curl in a way that lets them not bump into each other when they come together! </p>
<p>To get a little more complex, any snail that is born with its curl the wrong way won't be able to mate with a normal snail, so the genes that made it curl the wrong way don't continue. However, sometimes other factors can lead to populations of wrong-way curled snails living and breeding with each other, separate from the right-way curled snails. This will almost certainly end in the two becoming different species (and they may be already, depending on your definition!)</p></div>		</li>
