<p>A doctor once gave me strong opiate painkillers for an injury and when I was taking those, merely closing my eyes was enough to start vivid dream-like hallucinations.</p>
<p>Some people just do that naturally without the need for medical intervention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when I was a heroin addict and be nodding out I would have these very vivid and even realistic closed eye hallucinations that seriously felt like I was in that place. It was really fucking weird but i also kinda loved it. And I wasn't asleep, I mean if you saw me you'd probably think I was but I was definitely conscious in a way that I'm not in my dreams.</p></div>		</li>
