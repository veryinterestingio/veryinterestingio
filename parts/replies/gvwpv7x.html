			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right, and I have an anecdote relating to it. I had a fungal infection of the heel of my foot, and it made the skin continually peel and slough off.</p>
<p>The skin of the heel was thick and had a spongy texture to it, because it basically had the fungus living within the layers eating the keratin. If I scratched the heel, the skin would just bunch up and then come off in thick pieces.</p>
<p>When I took a shower, the entire heel would just be a thick moist white mass because the skin wasn't forming a proper barrier any more.</p>
<p>It took ages to clear the infection, but after it was cleared the skin is so much tighter and thinner, I can scratch it and there is a proper barrier there, as it should be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just layers of dead skin, not necessarily a fungus. It peels of when moist because, well, it's dead skin. It's normal to have this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they often crumble and flake after cutting and will chip easier. But she also makes the nails brittle and dry, so they're more susceptible to the fungus... which makes them MORE brittle and dry...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first language is not English, why did you use &quot;She&quot; for a fungus?</p>
<p>Edit : It was a typo</p>
<p>Edit 2: As a French myself I'm aware that some language use gender for nouns. But, for what I know, English don't. And so I was wondering why it did in this case.</p></div>		</li>
