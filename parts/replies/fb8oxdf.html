			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It displays initial signs of whitening as it removes the slime layer from the teeth, but these results are only temporary and do not actually whiten the teeth (it does explain how your holistic crazy aunt sally swears that it works, but it doesnt actually whiten the teeth).The abrasive texture of the charcoal can also led to damage of the enamel with prolonged use. There are very safe and efficient ways to whiten your teeth that have been studied thoroughly, so wasting money on the few, low level of evidence charcoal toothpastes studies doesnt make a lot of sense.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Professional cleaning using hand or ultrasonic scalers to remove superficial stains and calculus.</li>
<li>Veneers to &quot;replace&quot; the front surface of the teeth.</li>
<li>Peroxide based whitening soloutions ranging from 3-40% depending on if they're home kits or administered by a dentist or hygenist. </li>
</ol>
<p>Do be aware if you're thinking about a peroxide based soloution that improperly applied solutions can permanently mess up both your teeth and the surrounding gingiva. Don't just go mouthwashing with medical peroxide designed for wound disinfectant.</p>
