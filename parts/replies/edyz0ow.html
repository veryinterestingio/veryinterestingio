<p>I would also check out a browser game called evolution. You create a creature using joints, bones, and muscles, and a neural network will test moving the muscles in different ways, eventually finding a movement that works well.</p>

<p>As I said in my first sentence, there are a lot of things under the AI umbrella and machine learning is one of them. I wasn't trying to explain an Artificial General Intelligence. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they though? What’s your definition of ai then? To me machine learning is the implementation of ai. We don’t really have any ai that doesn’t fall under the category of machine learning.</p>
<p>There’s generally intelligent ai but that doesn’t exist at the moment. </p>
<p>Edit. Actually analytical ais don’t fall under machine learning. Like chess solvers for example. Still interested in your opinion though</p></div>		</li>
