			<div class="markdown"><p>Vascular surgeon here. I’m sorry, but the latter half of your statement is just not true. Vasospasm and vasoconstriction is far more pronounced in the arteries. In some cases, it is the only thing that slows bleeding enough to allow for hemostasis and can give us time to find a more permanent treatment.</p>
<p>Now direct pressure is a good way to control any surface bleeding. In veins this can often allow for enough time for hemostasis to be obtained from local coagulation. For smaller arteries like radial, ulnar, and tibial arteries it can also allow time for enough vasoconstriction and coagulation to obtain hemostasis. Sometimes the plug gets ejected and bleeding will resume if the vasoconstrictor effect wears off.</p>
<p>For the record, veins are proof that god hates vascular surgeons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here. Everyone’s saying no, and the correct answer is probably no, but honestly if you are in the hospital and your blood pressure is low because you are hemorrhaging, and we can’t catch up quickly enough with blood transfusions to get your blood pressure up, we’re going to give you a medication very similar to epinephrine (probably norepinephrine aka levophed) with a very similar mechanism of action in order to keep your blood pressure up while we try to get control of the bleeding and transfuse new blood into you. </p>
<p>So honestly it’s not the worst idea I’ve ever heard. I can’t recommend it but if you’re about to pass out from hypotension due to blood loss and have an epipen on hand?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope in most circumstances. - anaesthesiologist here.</p>
<p>Adrenaline causes your blood pressure and heart rate to spike which would cause the uncontrolled bleeding to gush even more. </p>
<p>If you had massive haemorrhage a low pressure temporarily is theoretically beneficial until the bleeding is controlled</p>
<p>The caveats are if there is cardiac arrest due to the blood loss and we will give adrenaline regardless, as well as direct adrenaline injections to vascular beds to control bleeding sites eg in gastroscopy. It's all temporary measures though because adrenaline lasts for just 2-3 min before it's broken down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An epi pen is designed to deliver the drug systemically (throughout the body).  To reduce bleeding meaningfully, it needs to be injected locally (near the target tissue).</p>
<p>In your example, the heart rate and pressure would increase and there would be some constriction of arteries and less on veins (more in smaller vessels vs larger), but over all you would bleed worse.  Gushing or pulsating blood flow will generally indicate a larger vessel as well.</p>
<p>Best course would be a tourniquet as high up on the limb as possible and tightened until any pulsating bloodflow has stopped (almost all blood loss, ideally).  Then a pressure dressing over the top as long as the bleeding is well controlled, otherwise manual pressure as much as possible on and just above the wound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comments in this thread are amazing: Doctors and medical professionals demonstrate that they understand their areas of expertise so well, that they can talk about such complex, and literally life and death matters, in ways that a layperson like myself understands completely.</p>
<p>In short doctors, nurses, et al are over worked and overwhelmed but if you don’t understand, ask... they will make time to explain.</p>
<p>This was in response to /u/witty_ and /u/Magnetic_Eel in the context of this thread, but I observe it so frequently that these are just two examples of what so often leaves me in awe of whatever it is that makes a medical professional. It’s amazing how selfless dedicating one’s genius to healing actually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline will work on both arteries and veins.  Alpha receptors are located both on arteries and veins so adrenaline works on both. Technically it works on the vascular smooth muscle bed/capillary bed causing end arteriole vasoconstriction and hence increase in total peripheral resistance (and decrease bleeding) as well as on the venous reservoir decreasing their capacitance and so increasing apparent total blood volume. Both of these effects are not as pronounce on your large diameter vessels.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A subtle effect of adrenaline infusions is that at quite low doses it causes a bit of decrease of blood pressure and and a widened pulse pressure as the beta receptor effect is more pronounced at low doses and the alpha effect kicks in more at higher doses. Tho if you work as an ER tech you may not have had much of a reason to start patient on low dose adrenaline and notice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>β2 receptors on blood vessels cause dilation.  Epinephrine (adrenaline) at low doses primarily activates these. A side effect of this action is low blood pressure.</p>
<p>These are contrasted to the α1 receptors on vessels that cause prominent constriction. At higher doses of epinephrine these are activated and cause a <em>rise</em> on blood pressure.</p>
<p>β1 receptors in the heart are activated at most epinepherine doses and cause a faster heart rate.</p>
<p>The upshot is that systolic blood pressure (top number) may rise and at low epi doses the diastolic (bottom number) will fall from the dilation. The difference between the two is called the &quot;pulse pressure&quot; and will widen in this scenario.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget that including epinephrine with local anesthetic can also cause the anesthetic to last longer. Decreased blood flow to the wound means the local anesthetic doesn’t clear the area as quickly and lasts a little longer.</p></div>		</li>
