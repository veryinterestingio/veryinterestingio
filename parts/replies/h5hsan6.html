			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t. 20tons of water is being pulled down, but it’s not “just down”. When you turn on a tap there are a few grams of water being pulled down by gravity. It falls straight down. But put a mug under it and the water doesn’t form a column and jam up the tap. It “falls down” and spreads out to fill the mug. It spreads out because it has pressure making it move as far down as it can, and that includes going sideways when it meets an obstacle (the bottom of the mug). As long as there’s somewhere lower, it will try to go there, around any obstacle. So it fills the mug, but it’s still <em>all</em> trying to get lower - and so it’s also pressing in on itself and out against the mug. The pressure at the mug is the same all the way through the water. Including.. up. If there wasn’t the same pressure going up as there is going down then the water would be moving, down. It isn’t, so the pressure is equal all around. It presses <em>in</em> not down, but it presses in because it <em>cant</em> go down.</p>
<p>It’s the same in the sea. And the air. The reason you don’t pop with tonnes of air pressure over your head is because there’s the same pressure on the sides. Or else you’d get squashed like a pancake.</p></div>		</li>
