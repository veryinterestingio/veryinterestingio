			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, prosopragnosia is an impairment in recognising familiar faces. This effect is difficulty in distinguishing between faces that are dissimilar to what one encounters frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. They all share similar facial characteristics because of the disorder, but they all have individual faces and looks (even if we aren’t able to see it as well). The race example is a good one—thinking of Asian people in particular, they tend to have similar shared facial characteristics, as any ethnicity does, but that doesn’t mean they don’t look like individuals (even if it’s hard to tell if you haven’t been raised around Asians). From my perspective, it’s harder to tell them apart than the predominantly white peoples I’ve been raised around.</p>
<p>I know a good handful of people with downs, and there is definitely slight differences in facial features, and other things (ethnicity, hair color, etc.) can help clue you in to who’s who. It’s just harder to see because your eyes are immediately drawn to how different their faces look.</p>
<p>So yea. Your point, just said a little differently, sorry!</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're all insensitive to differences we weren't exposed to as children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question:</p>
<p>So basically the same as why some people will say: all Asians look the same. Because they don’t know enough Asian faces to recognise the differences?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Recognizing a face isn't a easy task for a brain (or a computer) and the differences between ethnicities is large enough that the tricks you have learned to do it don't apply to the other groups. That ability is built in childhood so if you grow up in an area with no other ethnic groups you will have problems telling them apart. Although that can be learned later on.
Your brain just relies on cues that are more similar in other groups while other aspects of the face are more diverse.</p></div>		</li>
