			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I’m from the Philippines and I would like to take your opinion on the supposed fatalities (<a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/980855/doh-list-of-dengvaxia-deaths-grows" target="_blank">List of Dengvaxia Death Grows to 62</a>)  caused by the Dengvaxia vaccine which was a hot national topic in the Philippines for like a year. Are the claims unfounded, how so? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because 62 kids died after receiving the vaccine doesn't necessarily mean the vaccine caused their death. One quick statistic that would have been useful for comparison would be looking at the death rate of children who received the vaccine compared with the death rate of children who did not.</p></div>		</li>
