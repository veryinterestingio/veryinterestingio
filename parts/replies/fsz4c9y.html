<p>How long until the anticipated plutonium decay where the probe can't send any signals?</p>
<p>Would it be feasible to extend the life of the probes' communication through relays from other probes, and or lunar / martian outposts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, I am <em>not</em> involved with Voyager or any other space programme.  I am <em>not</em> an expert, only (like so many others) a great fan with some acquired knowledge, along with great respect for, a deep interest in, and perhaps a bit of regret that I didn't study, say, orbital mechanics or even the info theory I wrote about. Please do fact-check me and definitely tag me if you find an error.</p>
<p>At first I remember having the idea that each Voyager went up with around 40kg (or was it 40lb?) Of Pt. Remember this was in the late '70s, with Carter in office at the height of US anti-nuke sentiment. There was considerable worry about the results of any launch accident at a time when nothing wemt kablooie unless NASA wanted it to.</p>
<p>So I went and checked^1. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHW-RTG" target="_blank">radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)</a> designed for the Voyager programme each carried 4.5kg of Pt and each craft had 3 of 'em, giving them almost 500W of power at launch. Due to radioactive dscay, it's expected that sometime in the next 5-10 years there simply won't be enough power to fire up even one single instrument, let alone transmit at full power. And as I explained above, we couldn't get any useful data unless some massive, Nobel prize-level breakthrough occurs.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia articles on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program" target="_blank">Voyager programme</a> and each craft will take you down a really interesting rabbit hole if you have an hour or three to spare.</p>
<p>As far as relays, while that's certainly a potential long-term solution, it's pointless with the velocities we can currently reach^2. Mars is only around 3 light minutes away, too insignificant for a relay to be of any real use. If you got a relay hanging around Jupiter, you could get more &amp; better data from the outer planets &amp; beyond, but doubtful we could ever get much from past the Oort Cloud, and even that's pretty optimistic.</p>
<p>Voyager I <em>might</em> get close enough to another star to possibly find something interesting in arond 40,000 years. It'd take a hell of a lot of plutonium just to have enough undecayed material left over if it did. Even with a relay network (chain, really), it would take <em>another</em> 40k years to get that signal back no matter what data rate could be transmitted.</p>
<p>I hope future generations come up with something. I expect the long-term future will be AI in autonomous machinery.Meatbags like us are just too short-lived and too difficult to keep alive for the duration. Space is <em>really</em> big.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% agree with all your points, I was just curious!</p>
<p>Though it does give me a small glimmer of reassurance that the probes keep moving away from us, and one I might like to extend as long as possible, that they haven't hit a wall out there proving we're in some interstellar version of the Truman Show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry. Apparently within a couple hundred years it'll be found by super advanced aliens, decked out with new hardware, learn millions of years worth of information and come back to us, destroying everything in it's path, so it can take over the body of a strangely erotic bald woman.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it'll be a box office bomb that almost kills the franchise.</p></div>		</li>
