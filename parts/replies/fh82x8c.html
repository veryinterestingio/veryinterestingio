			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the signal from the probe is radio, they should have been able to determine the temporal shift immediately based on the red shift of the radio signal. Assuming the signal could be received at all. If you're expecting a transmission at 1GHz and you get one red-shifted down to 500MHz, you won't necessarily identify it as the signal you're looking for.</p>
<p>But besides all that, why wouldn't they simply exclude the planet from consideration due to the temporal effects? Putting your species in the universe's slow lane doesn't seem like a strategy for success regardless of the planet's other attributes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Therese one way i can think putting your species in a slow lane makes sense, and thats if you cannot physically extend life beyond a certain number of years, but have AI.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Setup AI somewhere orbiting outside the temporal zone, live on the planet. AI does 10k years of research in 1 year, and your civilization advances at an astounding rate comparitive to lifespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure in that scenario you just make your AI 10,000 times larger rather than move an entire civilization down a supermassive gravity well. I could see it's use for low-entropy long-term storage though, for both digital and physical objects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Hmm, on one hand we have Earth, but its kind of hard to grow food.... and on the other hand we have a tidal hellscape bathed in toxic radiation with no usable surface.... alright alright alright&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>It'd make a great refrigerator. </p>
<p>Need to store some food? Send it down to the planet. Don't even bother refrigerating it. Need to get it back? Send it back to space. It's probably only been there for a few minutes. </p>
<p>It would also be WONDERFUL for studying short lived isotopes of elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, except the instruments you'd use to study the short-lived elements would also be slowed. To have a benefit, you'd need to be able to have the elements in a decelerated time while the instruments to study them remain outside the field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the visuals for the movie.  The entire basis for landing on that planet is nonsensical.  If we wanted to be realistic:</p>
<p>The planet wouldn't exist (because of its relativistic orbital speeds)</p>
<p>Would be stripped sterile or be dartboard for the accretion disk</p>
<p>No technology to land on it ( or even catch up with it) since it's orbit is several percent the speed of light.</p>
<p>Going anywhere near that planet makes no sense, but makes for a pretty 15 minutes in a movie.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Forget the accretion disk, because of the time dilation it would be vaporised by the Cosmic Background Radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this one is fairly easy to explain anyway.  Surveying a planet takes time and they were doing a rush job of it.  You <em>might</em> see an 800ft high wave, or you might assume, as they initially did on the surface, that it was a terrain feature.</p>
<p>While we definitely have the tech, even today, to do an analysis of surface features that should show that sort of discrepancy, it usually requires more sensors and time to analyze the data.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The spaceship and the landing crew would see nearly the same time dilletation! The only offset would be the small difference by the small gravity field of the planet and that would matter much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So their onboard lander hat enough Delta v to escape out of a gravity well that's causing such a huge effect...</p>
