			<div class="markdown"><p>Also just to add, orange is a pretty new colour name relatively. Before the fruit was widely available (from the 16th century onwards) there was no name for the colour and it was just described as bright red.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m just making a guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also an issue that many colours just kinda blend together, and in nature, a lot of things are a bit of a mix of reds and yellows and browns and oranges. </p>
<p>Depending on the style, care, and lighting, the same hair can look dark blonde, reddish/orange, or light brown. </p>
<p>More interestingly, carrots used to be purple, along with white and yellow. The orange colour was a nationalistic variety made by the Dutch that just kinda took over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all trying to remember from years ago but, the color orange didnt even originate with the fruits. It originated from the name of the tree. The fruits were essentially the &quot;apples of the naranja tree&quot; So if I am remembering correctly neither the fruit nor the color itself were the origin on the name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it was the English reading the Spanish spelling. (I can't see it being through verbal communication as the pronunciation is completely different. </p>
<p>Naranja or as they read it - N Aranje - An Aranje - An Orange.</p>
<p>Edit: I have been corrected, although I feel the way the word came about was the same. The word just evolved over time from other languages that made sense in other languages.</p></div>		</li>
