			<div class="markdown"><p>Only partly true. What we think of as a pet guinea pig is <em>Cavia porcellus</em> -- the <em>domesticated</em> guinea pig. That species does not exist in the wild. It's probably wrong to say it &quot;no longer&quot; exists, though, because as a domesticated species it <strong>never</strong> existed in the wild.</p>
<p>However, there are other related rodents also called guinea pigs, notably the montane guinea pig, which is most likely the immediate wild ancestor of domesticated guinea pigs and which definitely still exist in the wild.</p>
<p>Pet guinea pigs aren't significantly bigger or smaller than wild guinea pigs as far as length, though they are on the heavy side.</p></div>		</li>
