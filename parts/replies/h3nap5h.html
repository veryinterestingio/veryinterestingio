<p>Based on what Iâ€™ve read it involves a custom virtual machine that uses an obfuscated instruction set to make decompilation more difficult. This part is way beyond me so I canâ€™t speak to whether it is accurate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a little experience in creating bypasses for software (reverse engineering is fun, if you keep it to yourself you can argue it's for education!). These are a few things I've seen, though I'm no expert so take this with about a pound of salt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual instructions that are run on a VM who's binary is encrypted, basically means you have to learn a whole new low level language specific to the program just to work with it.</li>
<li>Standard debugger traps, creating code paths that only run if a debugger is attached.</li>
<li>Hashing the binary on start up to make sure it hasn't been modified. Easy to bypass but it catches basic attempts, while the more hardened methods weed out the rest.</li>
<li>Hashing random ranges of code and sending it to a remote server to see if anything's been hooked or modified at all.</li>
<li>Hooking windows functions and detecting if anyone calls any windows APIs against the game window.</li>
</ul>
<p>The worst part about all this is that half the time when a detection occurs, the engine protecting the software will actually wait a bit before crashing, just to confuse you even more about what it detected.</p>
<p>This is kind of the opposite of an ELI5 answer but, I just think this kind of stuff is neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much it in a nutshell for most pre-release anti-piracy methods. Developers anticipate, usually based on what's currently known about the current generation's piracy methods, what distinguishing features a pirate game will have that's different to a non-pirate game. From there, they can just run a check based on those features. There's no one clear method. It's an arms race between developers and pirates, each side finding new weapons against the other.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's within the game's content, sometimes it's something more physical. Gamecube disks had physical markers on the Burst Cutting Area of the disk (think of it as the disk's physical barcode) that identified it as a real gamecube disk. Making disks that included this was a level of complexity higher than just burning data onto a disk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favourites was designed by the creators of Spyro. If I recall correctly, initially the game wouldn't register a problem at all. Then, once you've started to play it a little bit, it would start to break. Areas/locations wouldn't load properly, saved files would become corrupted until, eventually, the game was literally unplayable.</p></div>		</li>

And a game about designing video games kept telling you that the sales of your video games are low because every is playing the pirated versions. Love the dedication to stop piracy, insted of &quot;you gotta be online and have a cd all the time&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The makers of Game Dev Tycoon intentionally released a full torrent of the game on launch day. Gradually through the game you would start to struggle to make any money as your games would be pirated, eventually this made the game unwinnable and your studio would go bankrupt.</p>
<p>Forums were full of people asking for advice on how to deal with the pirates, inadvertently letting everyone know they were playing the pirated game, and in many cases actually asking if it was possible in game to develop DRM for your games to overcome the pirates!</p>
<p>Of course, the real irony here is that Game Dev Tycoon is one of the most astonishing like-for-like copies of Game Dev Story, an old mobile game by Kairosoft. Although the visual style is different, almost every aspect of the game is breathtakingly similar, even down to certain visual cues when doing specific activities.</p>
<p>I've bought them and played them both and honestly thought GDT was a re-make with new graphics when I first played it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You realize that the game developers, at least these days, arenâ€™t typically the ones personally adding copy protection to their games, right? Thatâ€™s the entire point of packages like denuvo; itâ€™s an off-the-shelf anti-piracy kit that means the software developers can focus on the actual software.</p></div>		</li>
