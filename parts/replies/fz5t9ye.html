			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. We started doing this right after our daughter was born. She’s always been a light sleeper so we could watch our shows more easily without disrupting her. </p>
<p>4 years later and I can’t watch TV without subtitles even when it’s at a normal volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same.  The explosions and action scenes are wall-rattleingly loud, while the dialogue is all whispers.  I cant fucking stand it and i refuse to keep adjusting the volume.  So, captions it is!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I've been enjoying action movies less and less because i'm constantly eyeing subtitles, but if i don't then i'm left trying to translate mumbles or blow out my neighbor's eardrums. Shit's infuriating.</p></div>		</li>
