			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for the somewhat brief yet complete look at the FDA process.</p>
<p>So, technically speaking, the drug trials are already being peer-reviewed during the FDA process. Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could argue semantics and say it’s “regulatory board reviewed” and not peer reviewed, but yes, it is rigorously reviewed by a panel of experts in the field.
The scrutiny of minute details that might indicate poor experimental design or fabrication is much greater in FDA reviews than in peer review.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FDA review isn’t quite the same as how the term “peer review” is used for journal articles, but I would argue that it is generally more involved and more rigorous, especially for big, blockbuster medical products. A rigorously peer reviewed journal article may be reviewed by 2-5 people working in the same or similar field. They get to ask questions, weigh the strengths and weakness, make comments, etc. The article would also ideally be reviewed by a journal editor who would adjudicate the reviewer comments. In some cases, the reviewers or the journal may ask to see some data if they have concern about a figure, and many journals now require submission or raw data files (which is a great step forward, IMO).</p>
<p>Compare that to the FDA review process for a major new new drug or novel device. The review would likely involve multiple FDA clinicians with different areas of expertise, multiple scientists with different areas of expertise, engineers, statisticians, a veterinarian or two, a manufacturing expert, maybe a regulatory lawyer (who usually has a STEM degree, too). The review team could be a dozen people or more before it even gets to managers, who are usually also doctors, engineers, and scientists. The review team also has the ability to ask about anything and everything in the submission. If a reviewing clinician wants to know why patient 17452 had a slightly elevated creatinine level on day 12 of a trial as indicated by line 1975 of the raw data spreadsheet, the company has to provide an explanation supported by valid scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Nether system is perfect, but for the most part, the reviewers are people operating in good faith who want to do a good job to advance science and medicine, and help people.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that novel, blockbuster medical products are often also reviewed by a panel of independent experts who aren’t affiliated with a regulatory body and also undergo background checks to ensure they don’t have conflicts of interest for the product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your explanation. But can you explain the Logistics behind why Its going to take so long for it to be in full Circulation? News has been saying Mid Next year is when it will become fully available. And how big of a chance is there of it Mutating</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(a) We have enough time to see how this virus is or is not mutating.  While it does seem to have some drift, very little of it is the the protein that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are targeting (this isn't an accident - that protein recognizes a human protein and its what the virus uses to inject its information into the cell.  Change the viral protein and it may not recognize the human one any more and it stops infecting people).  </p>
<p>(b) I believe the other response very clearly addresses the manufacture of the mRNA vaccine material.  Add on top of the manufacturing challenges of just getting a life form to make what you want, but RNA is NOT stable.  That means it has to be handled very carefully or it decomposes (that won't make it unsafe, just not efficacious and if you send someone out into the world believing that they are safe and they are not, you've hurt them). Also, because of the shipping, handling and dispensation requirements you also need specialized equipment for each stage of the process, and you need them on an absurd scale (both mRNA vaccines require multiple doses, so think 16 billion dosing allocations).  Manufacturing those materials takes a TON of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a simple chemical process that is generally fairly straightforward to scale up. </p>
<p>You’re dealing with bacteria that need a very specific nutrient mix, incredible temperature control, hyper-sterile equipment, constant monitoring, etc. in order to produce what you want and not produce what you don’t and without getting dead in the process. None of this lends itself to scaling up easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mRNA is chemically synthesized all the time. Given that it’s a polymer and relatively easy to purify, that is something we have a pretty good handle on, though the scale needed for full deployment will be something of a challenge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooling and storage issues. Manufacture is manageable but storage is the main problem. Anything that requires refrigeration may cause complications for transport. Some vaccines need to be kept at - 80 degree celcius. Makes it a pain to ship. </p>
<p>Corona virus lacks a proofreading mechanism during its replication stage. So as it reproduces itself it there may be flaws in  the offspring's genetic coding. </p>
<p>It's always mutating.</p>
<p>Just have to minimize the spread of infection. It's the only way to reduce the chances of mutations that might  lead to a vaccine resistant virus.</p></div>		</li>
