			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment piqued my interest so I went looking for more source material.</p>
<p>According to this source a hitter might go through as few as 7 or as many as 70 in a season depending on their hitting style. This source places the average closer to 36 bats.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but they wouldnâ€™t need to order more if the other bats were never used. Meaning they probably going through that many in game bats rather just to have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're taking that information out of context. </p>
<p>First and foremost the source says, &quot;On average a player will <em>order</em> appproximately 120 bats in a season.&quot; That does not mean a player will go through 120 bats in 162 games.</p>
<p>Second, a key point you're ignoring is that baseball players take batting practice, hit off a tee, and do other hitting drills almost every single day. All of those batted ball events will degrade the wood quality/durability regardless of number of games that specific bat &quot;appears&quot; in. </p>
<p>For example, a player could theoretically have four at bats in a game without ever recording a single batted ball event (0 for 1 with three walks and strikeout, for example). But that same player could have broken a bat in BP earlier in the day.</p></div>		</li>
