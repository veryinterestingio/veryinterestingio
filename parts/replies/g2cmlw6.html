<p>Blocks &gt;99.9% particles 0.3 μm or larger and does so  even if you put oil on it (which is the distinction from N100).</p>
<p>And yeah, the smallest things you can smell are about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that 0.3 μm so simple filters are not going to have a lot of effect on many smells. The masks designed for solvents or other strong odors have something like an activated charcoal cartridge in addition to the filter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. N95 means that their <em>minimum effectiveness</em> is 95% effective. Things on the scale of viruses behave very differently than normal stuff, brownian motion and electrostatic forces are much stronger on these things, and that changes how filters behave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's almost true.  0.3 micron particles are used as a reference because it's convenient and easy to measure, and filters do have a relatively hard time catching particles of that size.  Now it's true that below 0.1 microns, particles become easier to catch.  But the hardest particle size to block is usually around 0.15 microns, and slightly different per filter.</p>
<p>Because of this, the newer definitions of HEPA filters don't just measure particles at 0.3 microns, but at many different sizes and try to find the Most Penetrating Particle Size (MPPS) and report the efficiency of the filter at that size range, which is unique per filter design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to maybe put some numbers on this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the larger molecules I could find in garbage is <a href="https://www.compoundchem.com/2017/06/22/garbage/" target="_blank">putrescine</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putrescine is a four carbon chain with a nitrogen on either end. A butane molecule is [8.24 angstroms long](<a href="http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~talimu/molecular_structure.html" target="_blank">http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~talimu/molecular_structure.html</a> ) Let’s just call it about 12 for the additional Nitrogen atoms for putrescine </p>
</li>
<li>A coronavirus is <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-n-95-filters-not-too-large-stop-covid-19-particles/5343537002/" target="_blank">125 nanometers in size</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So even the largest smelly molecules will be far smaller than a virus. This does ignore mechanically how a mask works, but an H2S molecule is going to be smaller still and has a very low threshold for smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does not account for the way these molecules are transported, though. Does it?
I meant that some of these chemicals are gases are air temperature and therefore would pass the mask. But I suspect that the smell of takeout food is often dispersed by large water droplets in the steam (you smell it above the plate). Am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you are right, u/EmilyU1F984 mentions the same thing. A P100 mask will capture 99.9% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. The way mechanical masks work is they just grab particles out of the air. 0.3 microns is the hardest to grab, they are small but have enough weight to move through fabric. Smaller particles begin to suffer fluid mechanics that knocks it around enough that it will likely be captured because it’s path is so chaotic. Once you get down to VOC size, I would guess that although a large percent do end up captured, there are so many molecules and so few needed for you to smell them that you don’t even notice. I really don’t know a lot about the chemistry of food smells, but I would imagine the steam doesn’t carry the smell directly as much as the volatile chemicals are given off because the food is so hot, and would travel in the same way as the steam. Not sure to be honest</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know the exact specifications of a P100 mask, but it's perfectly possible that it is able to filter out &quot;large&quot; objects such as viruses, while allowing smaller objects, such as the regular components of air as well as molecules that trigger a smell to pass through relatively unhindered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that filtration devices such as those used in HEPA and ULPA (such as the P100 filter) do not work like sieves; 0.3 microns is used as a benchmark because that particle size happens to be a weak spot in filtration. HEPA filters (and, therefore, the P100 respirator filter) actually do <a href="https://www.globalspec.com/ImageRepository/LearnMore/20135/hepacurv714dfffa4dd94b8abd9bd242a97bbb2d.gif" target="_blank">better above and below 0.3 microns.</a></p>
<p>HEPA filters work by <a href="https://www.globalspec.com/ImageRepository/LearnMore/20135/filtrationf5c9c92f9e8b41b4a303d3576848daf1.png" target="_blank">capturing particles</a> via inertial impaction, interception, diffusion, and electrostatic attraction. <a href="https://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/manufacturing_process_equipment/filtration_separation_products/hepa_filters_ulpa_filters" target="_blank">This site</a> explains more.</p>
<p>Interestingly, one test for a mask fit involves saccharin: a nebulizer that aerosolizes particles of a saccharin-rich solution is used to see if the respirator wearer tastes any particles that are not captured by the filter, indicating a poor fit.</p></div>		</li>
