<p>Not only is this possible, it's the fate of all planets eventually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on the amount of spin and orbital angular momentum in the system. In the classical 2 body problem the three scenarios are collision, tidal equilibrium or ejection. For n-body problems this gets significantly more complicated.</p>
<p>Essentially, while tidal evolution tends towards aligned synchronous states this is not the full story. Venus for example is thought to be in balance and will not perfectly lock into a 1-1 resonance as torque from the conventional tide and the atmospheric tide have opposite sign. This highlights that tidal locking is not always a perfect end state. </p>
<p>There is also the intriguing possibility of inverse tides. Two mechanisms (three if you count atmospheric tides having an opposing torque) can possibly cause inverse tides (which results in migration opposite to the conventional direction, excitation of eccentricity etc).</p>
<p>In general though tidal locking will be what astrophysical objects tend towards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does something ever actually end up tidally locked in equilibrium? Surely <em>eventually</em> something has to collide with the parent body or be ejected, even if it takes billions upon billions of years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto and Charon are in tidal equilibrium (that is both objects are tidally locked to each other). So it can happen. Of course in the limit of infinite time all objects evolve which then changes the the tidal forces. For example a after ~10 Gyrs Sun-like stars will evolve off the main sequence and expand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a show that came out recently on Netflix called Alien Worlds--it's sort of a fictional documentary series, where each episode focuses on a different fictional planet, and describes the life that might have evolved there given a set of circumstances and what we know about how life evolved on Earth. One of the episodes is about one such planet you're describing! It's a really, really neat little show and the CGI they use for the other planets and lifeforms is gorgeous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an ecological standpoint, a tidally locked planet would have interesting pressures. High winds due to the big differences between temps. Life would be the most biodiversity at the &quot;equater&quot;. Not a planet i would want to live on</p></div>		</li>
