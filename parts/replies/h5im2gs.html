			<div class="markdown"><p>The radiation dose at close range is roughly equivalent to a CT scan. And to get that, you'd basically have to be right next to it. At ground level, it's basically harmless. Humans have been on the ground beneath thunderstorms for as long as we've existed so it's probably fair to say that we've evolved to be handle those levels of radiation. </p>
<p>It's really only aeronauts that would have any chance of being affected and even then, they'd have to be flying right through it - which typically doesn't happen. Pilots tend to prefer flying above the thunderstorms rather than through them. There still is slightly higher levels of radiation above the storm than there is below, but it generally still isn't high enough to cause any problems.</p></div>		</li>
