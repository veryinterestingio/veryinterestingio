			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's what they're saying. Seedy peppers have a higher concentration of spice, so people who want spicy peppers breed for seediness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, he's super wrong. The flesh of most hot peppers is hot, just not as hot as the seeds; the flesh of very hot peppers, like habaneros, scotch bonnets, carolina reapers, and other variants of capsicum chinense is extremely hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be true for some peppers, but it's not true for super hot ones. Their flesh is just as hot as the seeds and lining.</p>
<p>In fact, recipes for ghost pepper hot sauce don't even mention removing the seeds because it makes no difference. You can't make it less spicy by removing seeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note: seeds do not actually contain the capsaicin. They just share the same area as the parts that do, so there's co-mingling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, okay that makes sense. If you eat a seed you are more likely to eat the veins and such and thus people have just attributed the hotness to the seed</p></div>		</li>
