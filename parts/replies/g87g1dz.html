			<div class="markdown"><p>A good illustration of how dim lights that you normally don't notice when there are brighter lights in the area actually do illuminate is moonlight.  In the day or in a well light outside area at night, you really don't notice the difference between the light from a full moon and a new moon.  If you go somewhere without artificial light at night, though, the light from a full moon is very obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a couple of weeks as a WWOOFer in Japan when I was in my 20s. Every evening me and the other volunteer would ride a pair of old bicycles up a mountain to get to the barn we slept in. </p>
<p>The first few nights, the Moon rose during dinner, so we had plenty of light. </p>
<p>Then the Moon started rising as we were leaving. </p>
<p>Then we started staying up later and later to wait for the Moon to rise. </p>
<p>And then, after a week, moonrise wasn't until midnight, and since the bicycles didn't have any sort of light we had to make our way up the mountain by starlight and the reflected light pollution of the town in the next valley over. </p>
<p>And those <em>did</em> provide enough illumination to make out the edge of the road, more or less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting thing about that is that lunar dust is &quot;retro-reflective&quot;.  If the moon was just, say, grey earth rocks, you'd see a much dimmer full moon.  The dust actually reflects light back towards its source somewhere on the area of 40% brighter than anywhere else, so you end up with the moon being a bit more than 3x brighter than it &quot;should be&quot; when it's full.</p>
<p>That's also why the full moon is so much brighter than even just a day before or after the full moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting part is that there's no blue hue at all to moonlight, it's near identical in color temperature to sunlight.</p>
<p>It's just that our eyes perceive darker colors as being more blue.</p>
<p>But if you set up a camera for example looking at a landscape, took a picture in full sunlight, then kept all your camera settings identical aside from cranking the exposure time when the moon is out...you'll end up with nearly identical images.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I walked around my neighborhood during a power outage one time. I saw a sharp, bright point of light about two blocks away. I don't want to exaggerate. It wasn't dazzling or anything but it definitely stood out. Like a beacon.</p>
<p>When I got close enough I realized it was a single candle in someone's window. I was kind of shocked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can see a single candle from much, much further away than two blocks. Basically the limit is the curvature of the earth, on a clear night with no light pollution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To exemplify this, if you live in a place that gets snow in the winter, you might notice that the hours of darkness don't seem quite as dark as during times of no snow.  That white covering on the ground and the trees and buildings reflects a lot of the light coming at you and makes it look much brighter at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your explanation misses one key detail.</p>
<p>imagine you turn on a light and the first handful of photons spreads out in random directions, creating a spherical shell of light particles around the light source- let’s say 100 photons in the first set of photons emitted.As time progresses that sphere expands very quickly. The formula for surface area of sphere is 4pi*r^2. So when r doubles, the net result is the surface area of that sphere is quadruple the original. But it’s the same # of photons in the shell, so it’s 100 photons divided amongst 4 times the area. </p>
<p>Since you have a constant surface area no matter how far you stand from the light, you’ll be hit by many less photons of light as you go further out. And if you get closer, you block more photons. That’s why you can project large shadow puppets if you get really closer to a light source.</p>
<p>Edit: to add to the last tiny bit, you are basically cutting out a portion of that sphere when it is very small, so as the area of that sphere grows so does the area of the shadow you make!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is a sufficient number of photons, wouldn't it also matter what chance there is that there are a number of them that are going in a straight line from the emitting object to your eye no matter how far you are (or that the angle is so small as to make it pretty much a straight line for distances of this scale)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is why stars start to flicker when they get further and further away.</p>
<p>Your eyes are super sensitive. When they've adjusted properly you can see objects only emitting around 5 photons per second to your eyes.</p></div>		</li>
