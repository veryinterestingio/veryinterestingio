			<div class="markdown"><p>In the developing world paracites are a big problem.
1 guys poop may contain tapeworm eggs, if it gets into the drinking water, the entire village will be infected.</p>
<p>Cholorea is spread through poop getting into drinking water.</p>
<p>It is exactly why we have evolved to be disgusted by our poop but not necessarily the poop of other species.
The human ancestors who ate poop died off and did not have kids, we are the children of those who were disgusted by poop.
There is a culture element to this of course as small kids will play with poop, but are easily trained to be repulsed by it.</p></div>		</li>
