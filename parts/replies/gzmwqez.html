Currently, academics work mostly as independent labs who compete for limited funding that lasts for a few years at a time. We train scientists who move on when funding runs out. We write grants continuously, and what we spend time working on is determined in large degree by what agencies fund. There have been more coordinated efforts to establish standing collaborative research networks that have the capacity to pivot when new diseases emerge (<a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-establishes-centers-research-emerging-infectious-diseases" target="_blank">NIH NIAID CREID network</a>) and to build global capacity for spillover response and prevention (<a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/sep-30-2020-usaid-announces-new-100-million-project-threats-emerging-infectious" target="_blank">USAID STOP Spillover</a>, and their newest program, <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/business-forecast/search/award/94fc8d0be7?search=&amp;location=Washington&amp;ouid=All" target="_blank">DEEP VZN</a>). There has also been discussion about establishing a national center for disease forecasting (see articles <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-06-29/how-forecast-outbreaks-and-pandemics" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-time-for-a-national-pandemic-prediction-agency/" target="_blank">here</a>) which would improve on things scientists have advocated for years (<a href="https://www-embopress-org.proxy-remote.galib.uga.edu/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201642534" target="_blank">myself included</a>). A silver lining to the COVID pandemic is that we now have a clearer view of the cost of being underprepared, and not being proactive about spillover prediction and prevention. </p>
<p>Another silver lining is that the technological advances applied to the COVID pandemic are being applied to long-standing problems like malaria, which remains a massive global problem for several reasons (also detailed very well in this post): <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/03/01/a-malaria-vaccine-candidate" target="_blank"><a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/03/01/a-malaria-vaccine-candidate" target="_blank">https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/03/01/a-malaria-vaccine-candidate</a></a> </p>
<p>Favorite disease-related pop lit book - there are some great ones (David Quammen's <em>Spillover</em>), but <em>The Hot Zone</em> by Richard Preston is close to my heart because I read it when I was quite young and it was formative for me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with Dr. Han that I'm hopeful, but we have made this argument while dealing with concerns of avian influenza, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the West African Ebola outbreak, Zika, and others, and while sometimes funding gets a short bump, agencies and the government seem to have a short attention span, and forget about the threat of these pathogens in a few years' time. I think I've become a bit cynical that anything long-term will come out of this, but hope I'm wrong. </p>
<p>Favorite pop press book on this topic is hard to decide. I also loved the Hot Zone and read it when I was young, but re-reading it as an adult scientist was a different experience (<a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-hot-zone-created-the-worst-myths-about-ebola-1649384576" target="_blank"><a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-hot-zone-created-the-worst-myths-about-ebola-1649384576" target="_blank">https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-hot-zone-created-the-worst-myths-about-ebola-1649384576</a></a>). In my area of zoonotic bacteria and farming/antibiotic use, Maryn McKenna's &quot;Superbug&quot; and &quot;Big Chicken&quot; are both great. &quot;Ghost Map&quot; by Steven Johnson is a classic about the story behind London's big cholera outbreak in 1854. &quot;The Speckled Monster&quot; is technically historical fiction but discusses the introduction of the procedure of variolation in England and the US. Many great books in this area.</p></div>		</li>
