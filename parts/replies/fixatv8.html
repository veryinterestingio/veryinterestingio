			<div class="markdown"><p>aren't wavelength and frequency basically the same thing though?
why would you give them separate names and symbols? (except for naming conventions based on their 'original formula')</p>
<p>EDIT: I meant that they describe the same property. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, so <em>lambda</em> and <em>f</em> should more or less cancel each other out, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They refer to the same concept, kinda, but they measure physically different things. Wavelength is the length between individual cycles of the same wave in space, while frequency is how many of those cycles pass by a single point in a second. These can vary independent of each other. </p>
<p>However, we're usually talking about light, and the speed of light is fixed. So, smaller wavelength must mean higher frequency and vice versa. But if the speed of the wave can vary, you can have, for example, faster waves with the same wavelength, which will give you a higher frequency while not changing wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is not fixed... a material's refractive index is defined by the ratio between speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light while passing through the material.</p>
<p>Frequency is not affected when light passes through a medium, but wavelength is reduced. The degree to which the wavelength is changed is proportional to the frequency, which is the reason prisms split light into rainbows.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important that they don't cancel in general; lots of waves don't have fixed speed. The frequency can be a complicated function (called a dispersion relation) of the wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Observed wavelength may change due to properties of the material the wave is passing through. Material matters for speed of the wave as well: <em>c</em> is the maximum speed of light in a perfect vacuum. Wavelength can also change due to motion by the source or observer - the Doppler effect, redshifting, etc.</p>
<p>It’s been more than 10 years since school, but I think we settled on the convention that frequency is the preferred measure because it “remains constant” as materials or motion change.</p></div>		</li>
