			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a long time since I read the primary literature on this, and I've flattened it a lot and left out quite a bit of nuance (including alternative theories about birth spacing). That said <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279436095_The_Evolution_of_Human_Growth" target="_blank">this is a good place to start.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems more likely that the brain needs a decade or two to mature and the body was hitched to that schedule cuz neoteny, doesn't it?  Like, adult humans have adapted to not be very physically capable.  Physical prowess is not what we've relied on.</p>
<p>Maybe i've read too much steven j gould.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't been able to find a clear explanation for what triggers puberty in the first place.  Any search on it just repeats the same things about hormones but doesn't explain what caused those hormones to be released at those years.  What is the clock and what triggers it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You haven't found a straightforward answer because it's complex and portions of it aren't well understood. We know that onset varies based on nutrition, sex, and some environmental factors (dairy consumption is one if I remember correctly, though I'm skeptical of the common assertion that growth hormones administered to cows are to blame). Genes probably play a role as well. Add to that the complex nature of growth and development, and you've got a serious puzzle to solve.</p>
<p>I don't know enough about the specifics of developmental biology to get into the nitty gritty of how it happens, but I can speak to general trends. Nutrition is an enormous factor in the timing of menarche (girls getting their first period), which is generally used as a good proxy for puberty in girls. For boys it's more difficult to measure precisely as there isn't as binary of a signal. Age at menarche has been decreasing in a lot of industrialized countries due, partially to better nutrition and increasing rates of obesity (fatty tissue produces a lot of estrogen and is thought to speed the onset of puberty on girls, not sure about how this impacts boys). Stress plays a role, and increases in age at menarche are expected for populations exposed to greater levels of violence (sort of, this gets complex). I'm sure I'm leaving a lot out.</p>
<p>As for the actual mechanism that triggers puberty, I'm not sure. That's a question better suited for a doctor, but given the complexity of the process and the number of inputs, you're likely to get a shrug emoji even from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the best info I can find closing in on the trigger is:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279070/" target="_blank">Physiology of GNRH and Gonadotropin Secretion (2018)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current evidence, accumulated since the discovery of kisspeptin‒neurokinin B‒dynorphin (KNDy) neuronal network in the last decade, suggests a pivotal role for this network in the regulation of pulsatile GnRH secretion by integrating nutrient, endocrine and environmental signals, and thus the control of the downstream hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is interesting from an evolutionary perspective too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GnRH neurons originate in the medial olfactory placode during embryological development...  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A relationship between these neurons and those used for smell?  Maybe how they react to signals or in the distant past they were directly involved in smell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The period of slow growth is hypothesized to give you a long window to learn things </p>

<p>You took that in a different direction than i expected.</p>
<p>I'm 6'3, and i have two 6'3 friends and we do sports together.  I was an extremely tall child, and stopped growing at 17.  Both my friends grew almost a foot in high school.</p>
<p>Although we are equals in practiced moves, when it comes to twitch reflexes and body awareness i am shockingly more adept than they are.  For instance mountain bike at about the same level, but i am much better at recovering from slides or ejecting gracefully.</p>
<p>I've always wondered how much of the difference could be attributed to my having more the same body when i was a child and learning coordination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an enormous amount of variability in terms of individual outcomes and much of this data is based on population level aggregations. It's also based a lot on observations of hunting skill among Hunter gatherer populations (which itself presents a lot of problems). It turns out hunters suck pretty bad until they hit their thirties or forties. The general idea is that the odds of a 12 year old being a good hunter are effectively zero, so it's better to wait until they are 20 or so before they join a hunting party (substitute parenting or a few other complex tasks for &quot;hunting&quot; and you've got the premise for some other papers).</p>
<p>That's a long winded way to say it's not necessarily about coordination or capabilities in a physical sense. I think we can all agree that we were morons as children or teenagers and probably shouldn't have been entrusted with anything complex. That's the basic idea. It's easy to keep an 11 year old fed, and keep them in line when they're half as big as an adult. It would be a huge pain in the ass if we had a bunch of fully grown 10 or 11 year olds running around.</p></div>		</li>
