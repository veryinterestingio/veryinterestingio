<p>I would say more like a law doing something like  requiring telecommunication companies to update infrastructure to require authentication of   phone call meta data so it cant be so easily faked. With more stringent verification of calls originating outside the country. Then require phone companies to take disabling fraudulent calls seriously. I'm no tech genius but there is a lot more that can be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/call-authentication" target="_blank">SHAKEN/STIR</a> and FCC chairman Pai has called for it to take effect by 2020. Unfortunately, getting other countries to sign on will be impossible but once it takes effect here, you could just not answer (or hopefully block) any calls that aren't automatically authenticated by the system.</p>

Is this not the case? Could service providers not require both a phone number and some secret hash of the phone number from the sim card?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incentivizing users to WANT spam and robocalls wouldn't ever even be considerable. Most people would start giving away their numbers to get free phone services. Shady orgs would spring up charging you $5 a month to robocall you however many times you wanted during hours you set.</p>
<p>Most robocalls are spam, not all are. There are quite a few legitimate uses for robocalls. Politicians frequently use robocalling to try to convince people to vote for them. Robocalling wont get banned or penalized. As somebody else mentioned there are other alternatives that could realistically mitigate the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree that there are legitimate uses for unsolicited robocalling. In fact, I sincerely think it should be classified as harassment, similar to someone following you through a public area incessantly demanding money. The only valid use should be for businesses to send automated reminders for appointments or other solicited services.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That can fuck right off, if I get solicited by a politician on my cell phone I will angrily put it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I'm saying. It's all bullshit. These giant companies allow all these scammers to contact their customers. They know it's happening, they know what numbers are responsible, and they do nothing. </p>
<p>We're taking about companies that buy and sell information on individuals as a normal source of income but I'm supposed to believe they don't know who the scammers are? Bullshit, lies, and falsehoods.</p>
<p>Today at work I answered the phone like 15 times and there was only a human being on the other side twice. That's ridiculous</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the % of people that understand tech is actually dropping. </p>
<p>Sure they can use an app great. But do they understand the guts even at a module level? Spend some time over at r/talesfromtechsupport/ and you will be amazed. </p>
<p>There will always be the geeks who love making circuits, robots, programming, etc. but this type of person would rarely even consider running for office. They are smart enough to know better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For everyone wondering, SHAKEN/STIR is the caller ID verification technology that is being worked on now (and being suggested as a compliance by FCC).</p></div>		</li>
