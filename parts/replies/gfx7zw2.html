<p>In brief, besides long-term effects on a wider range of people (only time will tell), main questions were: 1) does the current  vaccine also stop asymptomatic infection and shedding, 2) does disease protection begin to wan in a few months, and 3) what happens with a high boosted specific immune system under frequent exposure to challenge by a systemic affecting virus like SARS-CoV-2 virus while we are in the midst of a pandemic surge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>re: Point 1, is there any serious concern, or even a physiologic mechanism, for the vaccine to have different efficacy on &quot;asymptomatic infections&quot; as it does on &quot;symptomatic infections?&quot; That concept isn't making sense to me. There's no way to say with certainty ahead of time if a person's infection will be symptomatic or not, so if the vaccine has been found effective it seems that that would encompass all cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not a medical professional, but as far as I understand it, there are concerns that because the vaccine trials didn’t test for Covid unless a participant was symptomatic, it may ultimately be that a number of patients in both groups were asymptomatic, but if those asymptomatic patients were disproportionately in the vaccine arm, it would suggest the vaccine is not 95% effective as they claim it to be. I apologize if I’m telling you things you already know or misunderstood your question.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In total, the GSK shot was given to more than 30 million people in 47 countries during the 2009-2010 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. Because it contains an adjuvant, or booster, it was not used in the United States because drug regulators there are wary of adjuvanted vaccines.</p>
<p>“No-one wants to be the next Wakefield,” said Mignot, referring to the now discredited British doctor Andrew Wakefield who sparked a decades-long backlash against the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot with false claims of links to autism.</p>
<p>With the narcolepsy studies, there is no suggestion that the findings are the work of one rogue doctor.</p>
<p>Independent teams of scientists have published peer-reviewed studies from Sweden, Finland and Ireland showing <strong>the risk of developing narcolepsy after the 2009-2010 immunization campaign was between seven and 13 times higher for children who had Pandemrix than for their unvaccinated peers.</strong></p>
<p>Pandemrix was authorized by European drug regulators using a so-called “mock-up procedure” that allows a vaccine to be authorized ahead of a possible pandemic using another flu strain. In Pandemrix’s case, the substitute was H5N1 bird flu.</p>
<p>When the WHO declared a pandemic, GSK replaced the mock-up’s strain with the pandemic-causing H1N1 strain to form Pandemrix.</p>
<p>GSK says the final H1N1 version was tested in trials involving around 3,600 patients, including children, adolescents, adults and the elderly, before it was rolled out.</p>

<p>Are you saying that if there will be many Sars-CoV-2 in my environment and I was vaccinated my body might react worse to those viruses than if I have not been vaccinated? I am not sure if I understand this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your honest opinion, do you believe that any of those of queries makes the vaccine ineligible for emergency use given the substantial risks of sars cov-2 and the ongoing pandemic itself?</p>
<p>The first question is a bit of a moot point since immunity we have no real alternative in immunity even from natural infection.</p>
<p>On the second point, i understand the vast majority of adverse effects form a vaccine will materialise in the first six weeks, including extreme reactions like Guillain Barré. Yet the FDA required monitoring of patients for 60 days. Beyond that horizon there are countless confounding variables due to be able to robustly associate any issues with the vaccine unless they result in large numbers, which likely would have manifested by now. Unless there is something I am missing, on which case grateful if you could elaborate.</p>
<p>On the third point, am I correct in saying that your concern is that overactive immune systems like in people with autoimmune diseases there is the possibility that frequent immune responses arising from regular vaccinations for sars cov-2 over time may result in complications? If so, would you be able to shed some insight on similar issues with other vaccines or what you suspect could occur?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For Emergency immediate release approval, my&quot;No&quot; vote was not a never release, but &quot;No, not yet&quot; on what advisory committee members were asked to consider:</p>
<p>“Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do  benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older?”</p>
<p>From evidence presented and not asking or getting key questions answered 'the benefits did not outweigh the risks from unknowns of the vaccine&quot; for the many lives in the long run with the masses. Slower roll-out would emphasize wide use of available prevention, allow planning of equitable distribution while increasing the number of people vaccinated--- A  continuing controlled Phase III study expanded to healthcare workers and long term care residents and others would allow monitoring to address some unknowns. With Emergency release, people only self report Severe Adverse Effects to a care provider who reports them to the Health Dept or company. See below or videos for specific concerns.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A COVID-19 vaccine is in use starting this week. Information to employees from my university health system includes an extensive <em>Frequently Asked Questions</em> section that transparently addresses benefits and risks, knowns and unknowns of the currently available Pfizer mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>As in this AMA forum, people are asking questions, seeking insight to get to an informed decision. While there was no intention larger motive for the end of a long day head and heart &quot;No, Not yet&quot; vote, it has helped to <em>bring greater transparency and questions about the COVID-19 vaccine and research to ask for FDA Emergency Use approval--</em> we are not just willing consumers. For this we all can be grateful!</p>
<p>A slower roll out would have been an Enhanced Access Expanded Phase III Clinical study to continue current participants and enroll more people that are closely monitored as should occur in vaccine clinical trials. More people (health care and front-line workers, long-term residential home persons, etc) could have been added to current studies for two more months (through Feb 2021). Such would provide COVID-19 disease protection (a least for half of them) while additional useful answers would come from results with all expanded study participants. Some initial answers in an extended time to: is there protection from infection and spread; does the immunity begin to wan over a short time; what happens when those vaccinated are frequently exposed to circulating virus in the surge; are there contra-indicators revealed from a wider range of underlying conditions--even with previous COVID-19 infection and its resulting natural immunity.</p>
<p>This Enhanced access Phase III option was not made available by FDA and Pfizer in real time before the vote. In my thinking, a slower, controlled and monitored vaccine release would provide COVID-19 disease protection to the most vulnerable people while gaining key insight needed to reduce risks for every person in the long term. It could have happened without a massive Emergency Use Approval release where a COVID-19 vaccine (with its knowns and unknowns) goes into millions.</p>
<p>I hope this addresses your question. With vaccine roll-out, fast or slow, we still must all do what we know can to keep safe and to reduce current levels of infection, illness and death. 1) Do not gather with others not in your household, 2) Wear masks correctly and keep physical distance when outside of the family unit, and 3) Wash hands frequently. With emergency use released vaccine(s), we can get through this transition time with less loss <strong>if each person makes a commitment to prevention</strong>. &quot;The darkest hour is just before dawn.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
