			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I live near the beach and have always said sea water doesn't hurt your eyes. It's the crap that gets stirred up with the waves (where most people swim) that gets you. Swim out past the waves and you can see quite clearly underwater with no sting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same I've tested it in dozens of pools, oceans in various parts of the world, lakes, streams, bathtubs, jacuzzis, whatever. </p>
<p>My eyes burn 100% of the time if I open them under water. It sucks. I'm glad I never went for scuba instructions with this dude because I would hate to have this fight with a scuba instructor in front of the whole class. But I've had these eyes for a long time and I grew up on the water. I know how they work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true, but this can also depend on the sea: The Baltic Sea, for example, has a salt concentration that in places is very close to isotonic saline solution (0.9%). However, as you say, the average salt concentration of seawater is quite a bit higher (3.5%).</p></div>		</li>
