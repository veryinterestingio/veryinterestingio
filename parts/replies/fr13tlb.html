			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. The 18 May eruption of MSH generated many pyroclastic flows, particularly in the afternoon of the eruption. But none of these were deposited hot enough to weld and form a “true” ignimbrite. Within the deposits, there is fantastic stratigraphy - this layering indicates that the deposits were not laid down all at once (from one current), but rather through multiple currents.
