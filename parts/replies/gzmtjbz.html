			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to start from the second paragraph and note that yes, there are a lot of other ways that diseases can be transmitted from animals to humans other than via farmed animals. We know they can also come from animals hunted/butchered/consumed as wild game, such as Ebola, HIV, and the original SARS. We're not yet sure how SARS-CoV-2 entered the human population, but it's unlikely to be from farming. So there are definitely other ways for zoonotic pathogens to transmit to humans. </p>
<p>Back to the farming question, it's still tough to know exactly how many spillovers we see from farming, especially &quot;factory farming&quot;. Surveillance is notoriously difficult for a lot of reasons. It's tough to get on farms to acquire samples from animals and workers. In the US, many farm workers may be undocumented and in precarious positions regarding employment, so it's tough to get them to participate in studies if they don't necessarily trust researchers or worry it may &quot;out&quot; them to authorities. If they do get sick from something they may have acquired on-farm, they may not seek treatment for those same reasons. So we have incomplete knowledge in this area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer! It seems from your first paragraph that without eating any animal products (and therefore not farm, hunt etc. any animals in the process) there wouldn't be any zoonotic diseases in humans? I'm sure that I misunderstand that, but I can't identify other sources in your answer. Are other sources too small to be meaningful or are non known?<br />
This still does not really answer all my questions (ratio of dangerous vs. not so dangerous) but thank you very much for your elaborate answer! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zoonotic diseases, or diseases of animals that can also infect humans, can be transmitted between animals and humans by a number of mechanisms, one of which is human interaction with infected domestic animal(s). For example, avian influenza viruses are endemic in wild waterfowl in low pathogenic forms that do not seem to adversely impact wild birds. However, if there is a breach of biosecurity at a poultry farm and a low pathogenic form of avian influenza is transmitted to poultry, the virus can evolve into highly pathogenic avian influenza as it rapidly spreads among the domestic birds. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are lethal to poultry and present risk for zoonotic transmission to people.  Consequently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture routinely screens poultry farms for avian influenza viruses and removes infected animals from farms to prevent further losses to the poultry industry and to prevent zoonotic transmission. This was exemplified during relatively recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry that occurred in early 2015 and that were eliminated by summertime. Another mechanism to control outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza is to conduct routine surveillance for avian influenza viruses in wild birds. When wild bird surveillance indicates that transmission risks are elevated, poultry producers can be advised to increase biosecurity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting case analysis, thanks for your answer! This still does not give me a scale for what part of zoonotic diseases come from factory farming vs. farming in general vs. other sources, but maybe there is not enough data on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe most public health professionals would agree that we rely upon the food production industries to produce the safe food products we need to feed growing human populations both here and abroad.  While the food industries have their problems and they impact public health in multiple ways, it seems wiser to focus energy not on condemning the industries. but on finding ways to work together mitigate such problems.  We have written about this:</p>
