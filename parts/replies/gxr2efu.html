			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they meant to say mutualism, which is often casually referred to as symbiosis.</p>
<p>It's like mutualism where both suffer when seperated, but at the same time like parasitism where only one benefits when together.</p>
<p>Couldn't find any term that accurately describes this setup, the host has been damaged so much it has become dependant on the guest, a lose-lose situation.</p></div>		</li>
