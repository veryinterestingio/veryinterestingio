<p>Drywall is the biggest worry really.  They don't wood frame muh down here so I don't have a clue about that aspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would concrete be a problem if poured in the rain? All I can imagine is the rain could mar the finish, but I don't think it could affect the concrete itself. The concrete has a high concentration of water when poured.</p>
<p>Edit: ok a million construction people replies. My point stands - the concrete will be pretty much fine except for the surface. That water is not going to mix itself. I think they use big machines for that ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant like torrential rain.  It's still engineered to have x amount of water in it.  The guys have to walk around in it and screet it properly, which could mess up the water content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water content in concrete is controlled, referred to as the water/cement ratio. While other things also impact concrete strength (measured as a compressive pressure, or MPa), increasing the water/cement ratio in conventional concrete (which would be used in a house)  would lower the strength of the concrete. Realistically unless it is a heavy rain and mixed throughout the concrete you are fine and the bigger impact would be to the exposed surface and concrete finish. You could have a weaker surface, exposed aggregate, or a pock marked finish requiring repair and refinishing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As herbmaster said, concrete is porous, so it getting wet doesn't matter. But, we pour it in the rain all of the time. Rain will ruin a floor slab, but not vertical work, like a wall or column. We add water to the concrete mix, and concrete displaces water if it's not mixed in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'll still set up the same, but might take longer. But, when we add water, we do it in the mixer trucks. Rain on top of concrete won't really affect it, unless you mix it in. Concrete is heavier than water, so it'll keep the water on top when it's rained upon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it true that the wetter it is, the tougher it cures? Or if you keep adding water and make it cure a lot slower, that it will be stronger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So concrete continually cures. It actually gets harder for years. But, you don't want to add too much water when you place it. The best way to cure concrete is after it sets up, you keep it wet on the surface. We do that for government projects, when cost isn't an issue. Sprinkler hoses and a burlap blanket thing, with a white latex topping.</p></div>		</li>
