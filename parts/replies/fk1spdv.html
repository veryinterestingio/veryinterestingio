			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Also they make sure to use woods with grain patterns that work well for impacts. (For example, people think oak is a strong wood, and it is, but it's not good at taking impacts in the same sense that if you pull silly putty really fast, it just snaps.) I believe right now all MLB bats are maple, but that could be wrong. MLB bat manufacturers also must follow strict regulations regarding how many degrees slanted the wood grain can be, preventing breakages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  Hit a baseball with the grain of the bat and it's like hitting it with the edge of a board.  Turn the bat 90 degrees and it's like hitting it with the face of a board.  One is much more stronger than the other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your trying to visualize turning a bat 90 degrees to hit a ball with its weak spot, </p>
<p>I think that means hitting the ball with the blunt tip, head on like a pool stick</p></div>		</li>
