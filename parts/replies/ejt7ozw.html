			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD and I'll frequently forget to eat or drink anything all day if I'm really involved in...literally anything else. I guess my brain finds keeping me alive boring. That I've managed to do it this long is a small miracle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As Iâ€™ve said a few times in this thread, pain is more of an emotion than a sense because it is much more heavily modulated. And thatâ€™s pretty important to note. Pain processing for me was taught in the affective neuroscience class, not the behavioral neuroscience class.</p>
<p>Allocation of resources is a legit component here but there is way too much conflation with other things in this thread and not enough inclusion of the complexity of pain processing on a physiological level. </p>
<p>What you described in the last part is competitive inhibition, and you are stimulating different nerves to overwhelm the signals before it even reaches the brain. Thatâ€™s not about the brain maxing out itâ€™s bandwidth,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find if I keep my mouth shut when I kick my toe the pain is terrible, but when I yell out MOTHER FUCKER or some other curse or a string of curses the pain reduces. Is this me taking bandwidth from my brain to use as speech thus reducing my pain output ?</p>
<p>If so, MIND BLOWN!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im pretty sure there was a study somewhere about cursing and pain management. I think Dr. Peterson talked about it at one of his lectures. Yiu might wanna check that out. It might not be just bandwidth but also something else related to cursing.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently it's more than just one study.
