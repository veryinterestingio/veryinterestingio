<p>I have suspected TMJ/TMD - I go through cycles of a lot of clicking and my jaw getting stuck on bad days, and painful until release. You can often get relief with a bunch of exercises though, so i'd recommend searching youtube for TMJ exercises. I can generally keep it at bay with those, just struggle in the cold months sometimes with tensing in the cold.</p>
<p>TMJ/TMD is dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (bit of your jaw). I would hazard you've either got it or at risk of something a bit off about the joint there that needs loosening or mobilising a bit. Tell your dentist about it next time you see them, but they will basically start you with exercises so you might as well just do that first.</p>
<p>The shoulder is a bit more normal, and if it's not causing pain I wouldn't be that worried, but a bit of stretching/mobility sometimes alleviates it if it annoys you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No probably not.  I have tmj and it's because a variety of factors, braces when I was younger possibly, previous car accident possibly, grinding teeth definitely.  You should speak with your dentist about a night guard. You don't necessarily have a slipped disc or need surgery or anything like that so don't pay attention to the other poster lol.  Night guard, simple daily stretches, and if more advanced you can do PT for this.  Surgery is a last resort for people with severe, debilitating issues</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the jaw, you might be storing stress in your jaw muscles. Try at night to focus in on the cheek for a few minutes, manually letting it relax all the component muscles. Saved my teeth from clenching in my sleep when a night guard wasn't doing the trick</p></div>		</li>
