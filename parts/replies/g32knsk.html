<p>Edit: Yep, it should say protecting (fucking mobile devices), but I'm going to leave it, it fits the current environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The outer ear canal has skin cells that basically migrate over time as they grow. They migrate towards the outside of the ear. These skin cells help to carry the ear wax closer to the entrance to the ear canal, so that the wax can be cleaned out/naturally come out. </p>
<p>So the natural wax expulsion would be this process of skin cell migration. Think of it like a conveyor belt of skin cells that carries the wax out... just reeeeeeaaaally slowly! </p>
<p>It’s like the ear’s self cleaning cycle.

<p>Chewing, talking, and the like mechanically work earwax out of your ear over time, in addition to the pull of gravity. Once the earwax gathers in the end of our ear canal, most of us clean it out, either with swabs or tissue, or when we shower or bathe. If left there long enough, though, it will eventually dry and flake, falling out of the ear canal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same problem.  Before using the earwax removal kits, I tried Flonase, thinking my problem was allergy related.  There were days that I could barely hear (and tried reading lips; it doesn't help that my vision is poor also).  Flonase helped drain my ears for a couple of weeks but my body's chemistry adjusted to it and it became ineffective.  </p>
<p>Since using the earwax removal solution my hearing has been restored.  However, the rubber bulb that comes in the cleaning kit isn't ideal.  I'm going to get a Waterpik and avoid the issues of the bulb; not getting all the air out when filling with water such that it is forcefully expelled while flushing out the wax.  My doctor used a Waterpik and it worked like a charm.  I have to use the solution about twice a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've needed to do the same. But I'd only recommend this if you have truly severe impacted wax and are suffering from hearing loss and/or vertigo (this was happening to me). You can really irritate your ears if you do this too often if you don't need it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure if that's better or worse than the vertigo I've gotten. Actually fell over at work one time because my body thought gravity had changed direction and gravity then informed me it hadn't done any such thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know the answer and wondered myself, thanks for asking! </p>
<p>I recently had to see a doctor to help. They recommended using ear drops or a mix of hydrogen peroxide (a main ingredient in some ear drops) mixed with water in a tincture, laying on your side, one ear at a time and let it sit for a few minutes for maintenance once every month, or every other month. Hopefully that’ll be help someone!</p></div>		</li>
