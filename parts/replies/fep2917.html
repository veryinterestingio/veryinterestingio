			<div class="markdown"><p>Does a conventional hovercraft count as a flying machine? It relies on rotors or fans and ground effect, like a low-flying rotary wing, but I don't know that I'd necessarily call them rotary wing craft.</p>
<p>Ooh, and what about wingless rockets?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like, missiles and space rockets and shit? They aren't really aircraft, as they don't use the air to produce lift or forward movement. </p>
<p>Now VTOL airplanes <em>do</em> count as aircraft, and they fall under the powered lift category.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand a little on this, the rotor on a helicopter and the props on a propeller plane are significantly different. A rotor creates actual lift, rather than thrust. It is literally the wings of the aircraft spun around at high speed to make them go fast, while the airframe sits still. </p>
<p>I found that one thing which impressed this upon me best was how helicopters reach their maximum speed:</p>
<p>A helicopter's rotor blades are not designed to go supersonic. If a blade was to spin fast enough for its edge to go supersonic, that would disturb the flow of air over it and lose lift. So they go subsonic, and as you accelerate the helicopter near its maximal speed, you start placing yourself into a strange situation where as the blade rotates, on it's &quot;way back&quot; it's going backwards nearly at the same speed that the helicopter is going forwards. That means it's basically sitting nearly still in mid-air and cannot produce its fair share of lift. It's called retreating blade stall, and is the reason why single main rotor craft will start rolling to one side as they approach their maximal speed. They roll toward the side where the rotor retreats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting thing I learned about helicopters is that the speed of the rotors doesn't change during normal use - I always thought they sped up to increase lift and slowed to descend, but they actually stay at the same RPM and the angle of the blades is adjusted to increase our decrease lift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CH-47 Chinook is a tandem rotor helicopter, with one rotor behind another and the Kamov KA-50 is a coaxial counterrotating helicopter, with both rotors stacked on top of each other.  Both have significantly higher top speeds than their single-rotor cousins, thanks to not being limited by retreating blade stall inducing a roll.  They are instead limited by either the total lift of the rotor and/or the forward blade breaking the sound barrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One is currently in development! It’s called the Sikorsky-Boeing SB-1 Defiant. It’s been submitted for the US Army’s Future Vertical Lift program. It has two rotors on top of the fuselage that rotate in opposite directions (to provide lift) and one in the rear (to provide thrust).</p></div>		</li>
