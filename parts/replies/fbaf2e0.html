			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, there is a misinterpretation of the SALT Telescope specs here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SALT’s novel design as a fixed-elevation (53 degrees above horizon) telescope constrain the field of view to an annulus covering 12.5% of the sky at any one time, or 70% of the observable sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>does not mean that the SALT telescope images 12.5% of the sky at one time; it is poorly worded and actually means that only 12.5% of the sky is accessible to imaging at one time, or 70% over the year.  </p>
<p>This is to save a huge amount of money on physical costs of the structure and mount by constraining the elevation of the scope to a fixed 53 degrees, while adding complexity and cost to the aiming and drive structure.  Big overall win on cost.  Long story short, like the Arecaibo radio telescope, it only uses part of the mirror at a time. </p>
<p>So how much can it see at one time?  This is an image of the <a href="https://www.salt.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2014/08/PR47tuc.jpg" target="_blank">47 Tucanae Globular Cluster</a> taken by the SALT telescope.  The handy thing about this is that has almost precisely the angular diameter of the full moon (31 arc minutes).  So it can see this angular diameter, but most high resolution work will be done at higher magnification and smaller field of view (FOV).</p>
<p>By my rough calculations, the angular area of the full moon is about 7.4e-5 that of the full hemisphere of the sky, or in other terms, it would take about 13,500 full moons to fully cover the total visible sky. </p>
<p>If this sounds implausible, consider that if you hold a US 25 cent piece (24 mm diameter) at the end of a *very* long arm (1.43m), it subtends almost exactly the angular diameter of the full moon.  A very small amount of the sky.  </p>
<p>So at any given instant, the odds of a satellite popping into the image field of the SALT is extremely  small.  However, the satellite moves across the sky, and probably &quot;contaminates&quot; 1-200 full moon fields in its journey.  So still small, but maybe approaching 1%.  Depending on how long duration the image being taken is, several satellites may have a crack at getting into it.  Still small, but maybe a few percent now. </p>
<p>I'm not convinced that this is a greater threat than aircraft.</p>
<p>However, it will be an impact on the subset of telescopes that *do* look at large chunks of the sky, like for observing meteors and some atomic particles.  But these have to deal with aircraft as well.</p>
<p>As for humans looking at the sky, the satellites are apparently magnitude 5-7 (lower is brighter), and humans can see down to magnitude 5.5 in ideal conditions.  If you have good eyes and are in a very dark part of the countryside, you may well see one or more of these at any given time … as was shown, the whole idea of them is to be visible from any part of the earth at any time.   But in any kind of a city, or with any haze, forget about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds more reasonable, the 12.5% sounded way too large, but I was unsure of how to calculate the fractional field of view of an average telescope.</p>
<p>Do you mind sharing how you calculated that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Further if we assume that only 0.1% of those satellites will have an impact on astronomy...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why make that assumption?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just an arbitrarily small assumption to show that even relatively minute fraction of the satellites within the total whole can have a large effect. It's also there to take into account a number of other factors like that not each orbit will have the satellite in the right position relative to the sun to have a major impact on visual observations, observations only being performed at certain times, etc. It's conditional probabilities all the way down.</p></div>		</li>
