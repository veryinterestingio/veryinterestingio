<p>I‘m not 100% on this one but as long as the volume and pressure stays constant you shouldn’t loose any N2 nor the other gases (so no need to replenish it). The humans aboard the space station basically take away O2 and add CO2. You strip away the C (in diving we do that with Soda lime, not sure which way of scrubbing they use on the space station) and re-add O2 (from water as mentioned above) and you’re back at where you started. N2 is inert and therefore not part of our metabolism and not consumed.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed typo, added source. Fixed another typo. Edited the statement about my edits. Shit I think I’m in an unbound recursion...

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The atmosphere on the space station is kept fairly similar to earth's, a nitrogen-dominant mix (approx 78% Nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% misc. like CO2 and metabolic byproducts).</p>
<p>The 'explosive range' is a bit quirky; it's actually dependent on what materials/objects/things/gasses are also present in an oxygen-rich atmosphere:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you had an atmosphere of pure oxygen with no oxidizable impurities or materials contained within an airtight non-oxidizing container (i.e. a glass lined sphere with nothing in it) and suddenly exposed a spark inside of it, it would not explode nor catch fire. This is because oxygen itself does not burn. </li>
<li>If you had an atmosphere of pure oxygen <strong><em>with</em></strong> impurities/objects/materials present (i.e. common plastics/rubbers, cloth, organic materials), a spark will cause a rapid oxidation reaction of these materials (burning). The more surface area of combustible/oxidizable content you have, the faster and more violent the reaction will be; if you do not have very much surface area then the reaction will just be a very rapid burning/fire... A <strong>lot</strong> of surface area (i.e. dispersed particulate in the air) then you would have a rapid enough increase in air pressure from the oxidation that it would be an explosion.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion: increasing the oxygen ratio of an atmosphere reduces the lower-flammability-limit of everything else present in the atmosphere (which is why if you have nothing present in a pure oxygen atmosphere, there's no fire or explosion, there's nothing to burn). How 'explosive' the atmosphere is depends on what's also present in the atmosphere, what other gasses are present, what materials nearby can burn, etc. Nitrogen (N2) is a pretty inert gas on its own and doesn't like to react with stuff (granted it's not as inert as the noble gasses), and its abundance/ease of compression makes it ideal for making up the majority of a livable atmosphere... which incidentally is how it is here on Earth. Nature got it right.</p></div>		</li>
