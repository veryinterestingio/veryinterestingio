			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right about the BBB, but it turns out serotonin and dopamine do a lot outside your brain. 70% of your bodies serotonin is in the gut and plays a role in the enteric nervous system. Taking serotonin would probably give you the exciting benefits of diarrhea and flushing skin. Dopamine is used IV in intensive care. It can raise blood pressure while still keeping blood flowing to the kidneys so they don't die</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah for a little while after I started taking my ssris I had no problem getting hard but I could hardly ever nut. And if I did it was hardly worth all of the work. That problem has mostly gone away though but I don’t usually take my meds every single day anymore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serotonin sickness is from too much serotonin in synapses in the brain. It is certainly very serious, but it's unlikely taking oral serotonin can cause it because it cannot pass the blood brain barrier. There are tumors that make serotonin that goes in the blood, but they can't cause serotonin sickness for this reason (carcinoid syndrome). Definitely smart to always remember SS and it's cousin malignant neuroleptic syndrome though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that the end product is almost always indistinguishable from actual normal water (some still do less intense dilutions), believe it or not they <em>really do</em> go through their rather ridiculous process. This has led to some fairly amusing situations for grad students and such that are willing to work in their labs. Even though you can demonstrate that there is absolutely zero point in going through the steps, they are paying you to go through the steps. So, you go through the steps.</p>
<p>I guess the idea is that they are selling bullshit and dreams so the least they can do is play along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin easily crosses the blood brain barrier so that's why it affects you if you take it. The simple answer is that small, fat-souble molecules cross the barrier the easiest. And you are correct, melatonin is released by the pineal gland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because melatonin does cross the blood brain barrier. </p>
<p>Starting to turn more into an r/askscience post, I can’t really ELI5 it. But basically the ability for melatonin to cross the blood brain barrier is attributed to its amphiphilic nature and octanol-water partition coefficient (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255180426_Estimation_of_Melatonin_Blood_Brain_Barrier_Permeability" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255180426_Estimation_of_Melatonin_Blood_Brain_Barrier_Permeability</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin is more able to cross the BBB because serotonin's hydroxyl group is replaced with a methoxy and the amine has an acetyl group attached to it. In general a free hydroxyl group isn't the greatest for BBB penetration (though there are plenty of exceptions).</p></div>		</li>
