			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember the first time i heard of anxiety/stress when i was about 10 or 11. It hit me like a truck.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean, everyone else doesn't feel this way <em>all the time</em> ?&quot;</p>
<p>The anxiety became easier to spot since then(not really easier to manage, just more aware of it). </p>
<p>You cant even manage anxiety if you dont even know what it is or whats happening to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, almost precisely. However, I was fortunate enough that for me it actually became easier to manage.</p>
<p>Understanding that not all people feel this made me realize that I should be proud of how calm I can keep myself (externally) when I'm feeling incredibly stressed inside. It made me feel in control, and better at identifying anxiety triggers and accepting them, reducing their effects on me.</p>
<p>I learned to spot when I'm feeling anxious, take a step back and ask myself &quot;is there a cause for this right now?&quot;. Most of the time, there is. And by acknowledging it, my brain calms down quite a bit.</p>
<p>So be proud of yourself as well. It takes incredible strength to face anxiety head on and accept it, understand it, talk about it, and be in control of your actions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very often there are early signs of anxiety but you might need help to recognize them. For me, the pebble was getting kicked down the hill way WAY before I realized it.</p>
<p>There are also things you can do to mitigate it in advance. A simple one is to not drink coffee before or during a potentially stressful encounter. And never drink alcohol to enable yourself socially. It's a good way to get addicted.</p>
<p>It never goes away - it's how you're wired - but it can usually be managed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I'd prefer a stable career and a consistent outlook toward achievable goals over whatever wheel-spinning rut I've succumbed to.</p>
<p>Anything besides my thinking a storm of knives/sharks/sharks with fricken lazer beams attached to their skulls is coming around the corner tryna turn my shit out, yo... during every moment of every day, would be an improvement. My life is in tatters.</p>
<p>I'm so conditioned to think that every verbal engagement is either going to end in fighting or fucking that my whole worldview is soured to the point of putting up a brick wall of ennui coupled to a aura of nihilism in any social encounter. I want to fight every dude, and I want to fuck every girl. </p>
<p>My brain is so broken that I'm pouring a rambling assortment of thoughts into a reddit post at 1am instead of sleeping for my decently paying job that I am woefully under qualified for.</p>
<p>Today I fantasized about jumping in front of a truck. Thinking about the useless platitudes my social group would spew over my passing was the highlight of my day. I figure if I aim my head at either of the front tires of a fast moving vehicle, then the problems in my social and professional life would just disappear along with the soul crushing angst I deal with daily.</p>
<p>There's no point to the edge, I want relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have Chronic Fatigue Syndtome, have done for 20 years, and nobody had been able to explain what it is in that whole time. That was until I recently starting working with an expert in CFS who has strong theories linking cfs to anxiety and a perminant imbalance in the fight/flight response. Meaning you never leave the high adrenaline state and so never rest.</p>
<p>Funny thing is I didn't even realise how anxious i am all the time until i started with my therapist in the last year.</p>
<p>So yeah, anxiety is crazy tiring.</p>
<p>Edit: since this got 20 upvotes in under 5 minutes i will throw out my therapists name in case it helps any other people. He is Professor Stark based in Hamburg Germany. You can google him and he is the first thing to come up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, you might want to grab the book “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” and listen to the first couple hours.   As a psychiatrist told me, the human brain evolved over five thousand years to keep you alive.  It’s not designed to handle modern stressors.  “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” explains early on how the human stress response is the same, no matter if you’re hungry, tired, worried about failing an exam, or being chased by a lion.   </p>
<p>Best wishes meditating if you’re being chased by a lion, by the way.  It will help quiet your mind, just maybe not in the way your self-help guru would hope.  </p>
<p>Since the stress response is the same in all situations, it’s really hard to tell what’s gotten to you sometimes.  Traffic?   Social ostracization (humans are pack animals)?  Hangry?   What if you’re hungry and you fix that but you still feel crappy?   Oh well it’s maybe one or more of the other 10,000 real or imagined threats.</p>
<p>Finally, my personal theory, but the stress response is like a performance enhancing drug.   I think people get addicted to it.  In fact, I’d say many people are.  Helps explain drama queens, Type A personalities, and quite a bit more.  </p>
<p>Food for thought.  </p>
<p>If you know of any CFS support groups or helpful information, I’d love to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, this is random af I know, but have you heard of Ampligen?? I used to work for a company that was sending it out during it's clinical testings, I started there in 2010, never followed up on it so idk if it's market available now?
We had to go through pretty stringent measures regarding shipment with carbon copies of paperwork where the patient had to fill out insanely detailed administrations of the drug and its effect and so on and so forth....</p>
<p>I was hired as an independent contractor and after I fixed up the place, I was cross trained instead of them hiring outside of the company.  I learned a lot of biological pharmaceutical stuff for a kid in his 20s who knew how do carpentry.</p></div>		</li>

When you start feeling like you’re “fighting with your body” (at least that’s how I described it when I was in high school) where you’re trying so hard to do something you know you need to do by your body doesn’t listen, then it sounds like it’s time to get some additional help with therapy and medication or that’s needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phone calls can be even more exhausting because of the lack of communication through body language and facial expression. It forces us to work much harder to determine emotional state and content, and/or have more anxiety about whether or not we’re accurately gauging that stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phone calls are fine with me when talking with loved ones. But when I need to communicate to a customer service rep or to schedule something, that is draining/exhausting and I need to rest after. That never happened to me before, but now it does.  Another super draining type of call is that freaking zoom crap. I called into one for a social get-together (a friend’s bridal shower) since we couldn’t physically meet due to this wacky covid, and that was so not pleasant. Had to endure 20 minutes of fake smiling and wondering who to chat with. After the 20 minutes I just said I had to go.</p></div>		</li>
