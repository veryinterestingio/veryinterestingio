			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be true of a suppressed 9mm semi-automatic handgun using super-sonic ammo, but I've heard sub-sonic 9mm out of a suppressed bolt-action rifle and it's crazy how quiet it is. Never heard sub-sonic out of a semi-auto handgun before though but if it's anything like the rifle, sub-sonic makes a huge difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naturally, subsonic ammunition results in no sonic boom from the projectile travelling through the air.</p>
<p>However, it'll still be nothing like the soft pew sound in the movies. Suppressed subsonic 9mm is commonly around 125 dB, which is loud enough that you <em>ought</em> to use hearing protection when shooting.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good rule of thumb is:</p>
<p>Unsuppressed: Will deafen you.</p>
<p>Suppressed/Supersonic or possible Unsuppressed/Subsonic: Will ring your ears.</p>
<p>Suppressed Subsonic: Will startle you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s way more than just altering the sound profile. If you were put into a situation in which you needed to fire your weapon indoors at night in short notice (no ear protection), you would nearly incapacitate yourself from the intense volume and light. For a .45, it’s the difference between 130 and 160 dB. 130 is loud and can cause hearing damage depending on exposure, but 140 is painful and will cause hearing damage without ear protection. 145 causes blurred vision, 150 causes joint pain...</p>
<p>At 160 dB, psychoacoustics makes the perceived volume about 10x of 130 dB. That’s huge. The measurable sound intensity is 1000x. </p>
<p>There’s also the matter of the flash from the explosion potentially blinding you for a few moments. Think about someone shining a bright light in your face when you’re in the dark.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s true that the point is not to make the shot silent, or even “quiet” compared to volume levels of normal activities, but it’s <em>much</em> quieter than the normal volume level of firing a gun, and it makes the sound levels manageable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Automatic weapons, due to the recoil and the noise/flash, can cause your vision to go greyscale/black and white while firing due to this, even with hearing protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not surprised that hearing protection doesn’t help maintain vision ?. I haven’t ever experienced this but it makes sense. The intense physical pressure from the sound waves hitting your eyes definitely won’t be stopped by earplugs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to what source exactly? </p>
<p>I've shot a lot of machine guns and I'm pretty sure I was always seeing in color. In fact it's louder when you're the guy right next to the machine gun feeding the rounds and spotting. Definitely saw color then too.</p>
<p>I even had to do it with no ear protection and limited ear protection it was definitely loud and damaged my ears but I'd never say anything was greyscale or black and white. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Not only does it make it quieter, it also alters the acoustics of the report. Instead of a &quot;bang&quot; it's more like a loud &quot;pop.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
