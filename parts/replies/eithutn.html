			<div class="markdown"><p>We’re doing it by simply observing larvae in isotropic conditions (no stimulus) and letting them roam for hours. Over time, we collect enough data on an individual and parse out their preferences for turn and drift directions.
There’s another lab currently developing a Y maze for larvae - the larva comes to a crossroad and has to choose which way to turn, finds a dead end, and comes back to the crossroad, repeat for a while. </p></div>		</li>
