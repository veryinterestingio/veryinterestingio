			<div class="markdown"><p>[DG] Lots of questions about grids! This is great. I love power grids (weird thing to say and even worse to write and see written and decide not to delete), because expanding the grid and making it high-voltage direct current (HVDC)  is hugely important to the deployment of renewable energy. Can’t really be overstated. The Renewables GSR is a status report, so it doesn’t dig into limitations in deployment potential, but I can point you to a few key examples from the <a href="https://energynews.us/2020/09/29/grid-congestion-a-growing-barrier-for-wind-solar-developers-in-miso-territory/" target="_blank">US,</a> (bonus US example <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/9-transmission-projects-laying-the-paths-for-cross-country-clean-energy" target="_blank">here</a>), <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/germanys-power-grids-need-110-billion-euros-investment-2050-operator-says" target="_blank">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/grid-congestion-choking-australias-massive-renewable-energy-pipeline-woodmac/2-1-801535" target="_blank">Australia</a>. If you’re American, and even if you’re not, the work by <a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/transmission-month-everything-in" target="_blank">David Roberts</a> could be interesting here.</p></div>		</li>
