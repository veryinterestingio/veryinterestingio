			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that true though? I thought that at least some types of cancer cells did what they normally do, just also replicate uncontrollably?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are a replicating cell, you probably cant do any &quot;tasks&quot; since your in the process of mitosis (or preparing for it).</p>
<p>Cells in the process of mitotic division have their nucleus broken down, their chromosomes condensed, they have mitotic spindle fibers reorganizing the whole cell and its contents... It's like trying to do the dishes in the kitchen when a bunch of builders and plumbers are taking down walls, removing pipes, adding new pipes, installing a new foundation...</p>
<p>I'm only a biology student and my spec never covered this, but from my guess most &quot;tasks&quot; likely involve translation and transcription (to make amino acid chains). You can't do either of these processes if there is no nucleus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I'm too ignorant of the mechanics behind this to really have the ability to judge what would be accurate, so I have never dug into it much.  I can conceptually think it through in a variety of ways, so was curious what actual experts thought.</p></div>		</li>
