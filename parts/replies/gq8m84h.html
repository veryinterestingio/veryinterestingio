<p>Is there any difference between the way that the influenza virus mutates, year upon year, and the Covid virus? The influenza virus, also deadly to the vulnerable, has been contained n this way.  But are the covid 'mutations' likely to alter the virus within the same degree of change?</p>
<p>So we are not really going to see a complete new strain (the vikings) not responsive to any anti-virus, as some the media have been implying, appearing out of nowhere?</p>
<p>The unusually high infectiousness of the coronavirus, makes it different of course</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily the coronavirus cannot mutate in all of the same ways as the influenza virus.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is in the construction of their genomes. Both viruses have a genome that is RNA (we, like all cell based life forms, use DNA), but influenza has a segmented genome. </p>
<p>Segmented means that influenza has broken it's genome up into pieces, roughly one per gene (our genome is also kind of segmented into chromosomes). This segmentation is what allows for giant shifts in the circulating strains that cause pandemic influenza. </p>
<p>On the surface of the influenza virus there are two proteins: HA and NA. Each of these can be one of many subtypes (you've probably heard of H1N1). If some creature gets infected with two strains of influenza at once (like H1N1 and H2N2) the strains can mix and match like it's a swingers party inside your cells and then you'll get H2N1 and H1N2 viruses.</p>
<p>This is a really easy way for a segment from a virus that can't normally  infect humans to suddenly appear in a human compatible virus! Bam! You've got pandemic influenza!</p>
<p>Also, influenza doesn't have error correction built into its replication machinery so it is more likely to mutate. Coronaviruses do have some degree of proofreading.</p></div>		</li>
