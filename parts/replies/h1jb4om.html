<p>For example, the Earth's Hill sphere within the Sun is about 5 lightseconds (0.01 AU) in radius; compare that to the Moon being around 1.2 lightseconds from Earth (i.e. the Moon is inside the Earth's Hill sphere, so it orbits the Earth, not the Sun).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is misleading at best. The moon is influenced in it's orbit around the sun by the Earth but you cannot say that that the moon &quot;orbits the Earth, not the Sun&quot;. As a physics exersize in highschool, we were asked to show what might happen to the Moon if the Earth were to suddenly disappear. The Answer? So little as to be negligible. If you were to plot the moons orbit around the sun with Earths influence and put it side by side with a plot of the Earths orbit around the Sun, the plots would have to be rather large before you could see the difference. In fact, on a regular piece of paper, both orbits would look identical with the thickness of the line being unable to differentiate between the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you are saying about Hill Spheres you obviously don't understand the dynamics yourself as you continue to make incorrect statements. In this case one that is provably wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moon's acceleration towards the Earth is stronger, by a wide margin, than the Moon's acceleration towards the Sun. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact reverse is true and not only by a wide margin but by more than Double. </p>
<p>took me two minutes to find this 3 minute video illustrating the math. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM3gdTDSDNU&amp;ab_channel=AKLECTURES" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>Skip to 2:10 and listen until 2:45</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same would be true about the moon's orbit about the Galactic centre. If you plot that on the same piece of paper, it will look like the Galactic orbit dominates the solar orbit. What you are comparing is the radius of the orbit, not how strongly one object is bound to another.</p>
<p>I think it is most correct to say that the moon orbits the earth, the earth orbits the sun, and the sun orbits Sagittarius A*</p></div>		</li>
