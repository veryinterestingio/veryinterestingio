			<div class="markdown"><p>Hanna-Barbera cartoons were pretty much the ultimate exercise in animation cost-cutting.  They pioneered repeating backgrounds and the concept of using neckwear to hide animation seams so that they could animate just a head turning to look at things to avoid animating the whole body rotating.</p>
<p>There are also dozens of straight-up reused animation sequences so they could use existing batches of cells instead of creating new ones.</p>
<p>Hell, the whole chase scene schtick in many episodes was so that they could just reuse the run cycle for 3 minutes.</p>
<p>HB was a masterclass in budget and deadline management.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The old scooby doo cartoons were also made on the budget of a middle school lunch, so they can be forgiven for having some animation problems, IMO.</p></div>		</li>
