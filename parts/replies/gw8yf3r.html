			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible they do, but most animals are also a lot more active than many humans. So their &quot;atrophied&quot; state is still a large amount of muscle mass compared to our average.  </p>
<p>The adaptations we have for efficient running and heat removal (sweating) has allowed us to literally run prey into the ground (where they collapse from exhaustion), so our bodies are possibly better adapted at maintaining endurance efficiency over pure strength....which means smaller muscles for better efficiency.  </p>
<p>Some animals, like bears, don't atrophy muscle at all...they have adapted to maintain muscle mass while hibernating for 4-7 months. They still come out of it thinner, but studies have shown it's not a result of lost muscle. But they have specific adaptations that allow for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chimpanzees and the like in captivity still maintain much more muscle than a human. I think our ability to lose muscle is an adaptation, probably energy saving in that if we don't use it we lose it. Don't want to be running around carrying any more muscle than we really need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before civilized society when human beings would hunt they would literally just chase their pray down until it exhausted itself </p>
<p>Like we could never run up to a deer and catch it but eventually after miles and miles of the deers adrenaline and it sprinting away then stopping then sprinting away it burns itself out meanwhile the human(s) hunting it just keep terminator walking at it basically lol that's an oversimplification but yeah we abused our ridiculous endurance before civilization turned is into lazy gluttons (I am the laziest of gluttons so I ain't talking down)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense. There's no reason excercise is needed for muscle development. Our bodies know how to make muscle and the excercise is really there to signal to our body it needs to make the muscle. That's really only all needed because our 'use it or lose it' system has been an evolutionary advantage which lets us be more adaptable. A cat, for instance, is a specialised predator and so always develops the same muscles because they always need to do the same thing (hunt small animals quickly and destroy house plants)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  Persistence hunting, and a lot of experts believe it’s the only way we hunted- before we figured out spears, it was that, scavenging, and gathering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s terrifying to think about. Consider being surrounded be a pack of physically inferior animals you know is trying to kill and eat you. They stay just outside of your ability to catch them but also just outside of your ability to escape them. </p>
