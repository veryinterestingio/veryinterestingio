			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on what the exact differences are, both can be true, there are simple component characters that if flipped look like others and I can think of at least 2 or 3 characters with the same components that are swapped right/left, those would be easy to change the meaning of. Otherwise it would be kinda gibberishish</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A simple example would be 妈. Its made up of 女 and 马 so what you're saying is dyslexia might manifest as  马女 (but as one character). </p>
<p>You'd probably be able to guess they mean 妈 because its close enough but its still wrong because technically 妈 (in Chinese) is &quot;word that is pronounced like 马 but is thematically related to 女&quot; whereas 女马 would be that but the other way around. So while 妈 is mum, 女马 would be something yo fi with horses (probably).</p>
<p>That'd be a very simple and specific example and doesn't take into account characters or radicals which have to be written in certain locations in regard to others to have the correct meaning like 哭 which if it were written 大 over two 口s then it would loose its meaning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Occasionally dyslexics writing Chinese characters will space them out apart so it ends up looking like two words. Sometimes Chinese papers use a grid (for example, school essay papers) so it can be easier to guess what they were intending to write if it was on those, but if it was on lined paper it might be more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>龘 means &quot;dragons moving&quot;, contains 48 strokes and is pronounced tō. This isn't really relevant to anything, I just bring it up whenever I can. It's one of my favorite Kanji because when I was in language school, one of my classmates found this in a Kanji dictionary and asked our instructor (an elderly Japanese man) if they actually used it and he said &quot;no, we don't have dragons anymore&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>something like these. Good thing about Chinese sentences is that we usually for a verb/noun is consisted of two or three words making a phrase. It is generally easy to guesstimate if there is a whole sentence for you to guess what he/she is writing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American dyslexic here. Is symbol flipping or symbol recognition an issue too?  B,d,q,p,9 (9 depends on the font/handwriting). Give me terribly hard times since I'll flip the symbols and or be unable to recognize the difference between them. It sometimes even happens with similar looking words (definit, defiant/ discuss, disgust/ father, farther/ etc.). I assume that happens too for Japanese characters??</p></div>		</li>
