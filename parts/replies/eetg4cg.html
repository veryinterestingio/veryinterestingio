			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. Never thought that lab would be useful. You can access information about bird ranges by month and species if you're curious. My report had Snow Geese, but not Canada Geese though their ranges share similarities.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I’ve studied there’s more to it than that. </p>
<p>Migratory birds essentially have local meetup spots, these spots never change. Where I am in the north birds fly south for the winter but you’ll spot flocks flying in every direction before the big group migration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been seeing them every few days now, but just the other day was a huge flyover.  I'd say a rough guess of around 100 in about 8 or 9 flying Vs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly accurate, but doesnt answer OP's question.</p>
<p>Geese are no longer in migration mode in January. They're looking for food to survive the winter. They're still in flocks, and we can talk about the myriad reasons whys flocks are better for geese to be a part of. </p>
<p>What you likely saw was a flock of geese moving from one foraging patch to another. In the winter they have two choices: find open water (which Calgary has) or find unharvested agricultural fields to forage on wheat, or barley, or hay. </p>
<p>These birds aren't &quot;migrating south&quot; they're just looking for food. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, in other words, if you see geese flying around in January and February, you are probably in the “south” that they’ve migrated to, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Migration isn't just an arbitrary decision by birds. They're genetically wired to do it at certain times of the year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for you, since you seem to know your stuff.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I was watching groups of geese pass by. There's a spot where the river stops running east and turns north, and the groups would all follow the river to this point and turn south. What was interesting was one small group that turned the same way, but a couple birds turned around and started flying west. A couple of minutes later the larger group by far appeared, but instead of following the river to the bend they started turning much early to cut the corner. Afterwards five or six birds turned around again and fanned out, headed southwest to northwest, where I could watch them meet up with other groups that also cut the corner and started turning much early.</p>
<p>It got me wondering, do flocks like this use scouts of some kind? Or was it pure coincidence? It really seemed like they were communicating between groups.</p></div>		</li>
