<p>No hard and fast rule on whether fever reduction = always good or always bad - it's context-dependent. Ibuprofen and acitominophen act on enzymes that do way more than just &quot;cause fever&quot;. For example, these enzymes are also involved in production of inflammatory mediators that activate and recruit immune cells. In some instances, this immune response ends up being too much, and does the body more harm than good (look up &quot;cytokine storm&quot; if you're interested). With any infection, there's a sort of sweet spot  between enough to fight off the infection and too much. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12616" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12616</a> This is a cool example of where reducing fever can have directly affect the pathogen's ability to cause disease! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here and I agree with the doc. He or she is not invalidating the other post entirely, just the premise of how/why the fever develops. </p>
<p>The hypothalamus, which sits at the base of the brain, acts as the body's thermostat. It is triggered by floating biochemical substances called pyrogens, which flow from sites where the immune system has identified potential trouble to the hypothalamus via the bloodstream. Some pyrogens are produced by body tissue; many pathogens also produce pyrogens. When the hypothalamus detects them, it tells the body to generate and retain more heat, thus producing a fever.</p>
<p>Here’s a peer reviewed article if you’d like to dive into the literature. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be a subtle difference between what you said and the doctor's comment, and I'm hoping you (or he/she) can explain further.  </p>
<p>The doc said that the body does not raise its temperature directly to fight infection, but rather the increased temp is merely a byproduct of the inflammatory response.  You seem to be saying that the body <em>does</em> raise its temperature to help fight infection.  Unless I'm misunderstanding one of you (which is entirely possible), that seems to be contradictory. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Fever is not the body's primary method of fighting infection. And large controlled studies show no difference in length of illness between those that treat fever, and those that don't. So treat the fever if it makes you feel bad. And DEFINITELY treat it in children because febrile seizures are no joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Common misconception. There's no evidence that anti-fever  medications reduce the risk of febrile seizures. </p>
<p>Also, simple febrile seizures aren't that bad.  There's no evidence they cause long-term adverse outcomes or brain damage, and you have the same risk of developing epilepsy as the general population (about 1%).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doc here too.
^ I agree with the doc above^</p>
<p>I would like to add that fever can trigger convulsions in children (especially rapid rise and rapid fall of temperature). So we definetly want to treat fever in children &lt; 5 years.</p>
<p>In adults, I would say treat if it's not well tolerated (delirium, dehydration, tachycardia...) but otherwise don't treat because obtaining apyrexia is a solid marker of an efficient antibiotic treatement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry. I guess I used the term in a medical context and not in the ELI5 spirit. </p>
<p>Inflammation in the medical sense is different than in the layman’s sense.
Medically, inflammation includes any part of the body that shows:
-Redness
-Heat
-Swelling
-Pain
-Loss of function </p>
<p>When I say inflammation, biochemically I mean the chemicals (cytokines, interleukins, etc) that are released by the body that lead to inflammation, which manifests as the above 5 characteristics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation means the immune system response to harmful stimuli like bacteria, virus, etc.</p>
<p>Fever is one of the byproducts of inflammation, that's why people who are immunocompromised (very old age, SIDA, people taking chemotherapy for example) don't have fever as often as immunocompetent people.</p>
<p>WebMD has a nice layman definition:</p>
<p>'When inflammation occurs, chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues to protect your body from foreign substances. This release of chemicals increases the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth.'</p></div>		</li>
