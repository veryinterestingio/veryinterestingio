			<div class="markdown"><p>actually, the mediterranean is a remnant of the very old thetys sea. The reason its still around is that there aren’t any active oceanic subduction zones in the mediterranean, and these ocean floor remnants are not that large, so spontaneous subduction is unlikely to initiate here. eventually, though, they will be squeezed together between the african and eurasian plates, and some (most) will be subducted while some may become part of mountain ranges (like some ocean floor remnants in the north alps)  or form small remnant ocean basins (the black sea is an example of this)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are active subduction zones in the Med - see here - and of course there are all sorts of processes ongoing there at the moment - back arc formation, basin extension, subduction zone induced vulcanism etc etc. Fascinating place really, geologically speaking.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You are right though in one aspect - the Med will close eventually as Africa continues to pivot into Europe, it has about 40 million years or so left in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lot of approximations here. All the western Mediterranean is relatively young i.e. younger than 20Ma. The mediterranean area include also several active subduction zones. As a matter of fact, how subduction initiate is an intense debate in the community and large sections of the Mediterranean margin are currenlty inverted (eg the algerian margin). If it will lead to a subduction initiation is of course very speculative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is oceanic crust underlying much of the Mediterranean. Some of this makes up the oldest known oceanic crust in the world (that hasn’t been subducted) at over 300 million years old. For comparison, the oldest parts of oceanic crust in the Pacific and Atlantic are about 200 million years old, which seems to be the rough cutoff before it gets destroyed. </p>
<p>Plate tectonics is not a neat system though, and there are plenty of messy bits which have been deformed/jumbled about in complicated and multiple ways. The oldest parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceanic crust represent quite large sections of those ocean basins, but the bits in the Mediterranean are slivers of oceanic crust which have been shoved into their current spots as a previous ocean basin closed and have thus escaped subduction. They are leftover from the ancient Tethys ocean basin.</p>
<p>In the past, the Mediterranean has been cutoff from the Atlantic and largely evaporated, leaving a barren basin with a hypersaline lake at the bottom, but it has never been a savannah type environment. The multiple cycles of drying out and then reflooding of the Mediterranean is evidenced by the layered salt deposits in the basin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not answering your question, but it’s a very good question. Iirc continental players tend to be a lot older since they are lighter and do not subduct. The oldest rocks on earth are 3.5 billion years old in Canada</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes the idea of plates even more confusing... are continents just floating on top of their parent plates?  How can there be all this dynamic subduction &amp; rift zone generation at the margins of a plate, with the continents just sitting there for a billion years?  Seems either the continents are floating perpetually on top, or the continents do get carried to subduction zones but get jammed up or cemented to other continents without going down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a lot more complicated to sort that out for the continents due to their high degree of variability and the way they are typically much more deformed than oceanic lithosphere, but there are certainly maps out there. </p>
<p>Try figure 7 from <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/~nshapiro/PUBLICATIONS/Poupinet_Shapiro_Lithos2009.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>, which uses an indirect approach based upon seismic waves. </p>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/crust/maps.php" target="_blank">the Thermo-Tectonic Age Map from the USGS</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think OP is asking how long it takes for a plate to fully subduct. If so there are so many variables: size of plate, age of plate, rate of subduction, angle of subduction, definition of full subduction (is it when there's no remaining material at the surface, or when we can no longer see the subsurface structure via subsurface tomography e.g. complete homogenization with the mantle, which may actually never happen?) </p>
<p>In which case the answer is we don't know</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took it differently - that OP was asking how long does it take for a subducted plate to be diffused into the mantle and then re-emerge as crust from magma upwellings at plate margins or through mid-plate volcanoes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding on that we have seismically imaged slabs at the base of the mantle, so it really is plausible that complete homogenization doesn't happen, as you suggested.</p></div>		</li>
