<p>From what I remember of thermodynamics, you cannot have zero entropy, let alone negative entropy. (Only relative negative, compared to another local system, but the entire system must always be positive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what the question is asking though? If heat were to move from the colder source to the hotter source then the heating source would get hotter (Object A), not the colder object (Object B)? The reason this doesn't work is because of the first law of thermodynamics which says, &quot;the internal energy of a thermodynamic system must be equal to the heat added to it minus the work being done by the system&quot; so if Object B were to get hotter that would suggest thermal energy was being created from nothing, which as we know is impossible, because energy can not be <em>created</em> nor <em>destroyed</em>.</p></div>		</li>
