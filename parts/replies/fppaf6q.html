			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for answering.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could follow up a little on PPEs being provided to workers and worker to worker infection.  I understand PPE are hard to come by, but what PPE and changes in practice do you know are being provided to workers at major companies?</p>
<p>In your opinion, are the changes required to safely work in a meat packing plant possible?</p>
<p>Finally, are there similar issues for farm labor, grain processing, or fruit and veg processing?</p>
<p>Edit: I understand if these supply chains and questions are not your specific area of expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: I can't speak to what's currently happening, but I have visited slaughterhouses on multiple occasions as an observer and am familiar with the personnel on the floor and those overseeing operations.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind: slaughterhouses and other packing industries operate on fairly fine lines. The money is made at scale, and by hiring basically the bottom of the barrel - poorly educated people who will work hard for low wages and few benefits under poor conditions. It's essentially a step above (below?) incarceration for many of them on the floor. The rates of COVID infection here in Arizona can be seen <a href="https://adhsgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/84b7f701060641ca8bd9ea0717790906" target="_blank">here</a>, and it's worth noting that some of the highest rates of infection are in the zip codes right around the packing plant in SW Phoenix ( (85353, 85323, 85392, and 85037) - where people are poor - poorly educated, poorly insured, poorly treated, and absolutely need to work to stay alive.</p>
<p>Many slaughterhouses already require a fair amount of PPE - hair nets/helmets, overcoats similar to a lab coat, washable boots, gloves, and in some spots (like the trim lines and hamburger packing) face masks. It would not be too difficult or even overly-burdensome to require more/better PPE - many line workers are already familiar with the idea. The issue is that some are working very closely together, elbow to elbow in some cases, they tend to eat together, break together, they carpool and often this extends to living together as it's often a family or extended family sort of job. As I mentioned above, these are people who don't have great job benefits and often need to work no matter what condition they're in, so the idea of &quot;stay home if you're sick&quot; is not well understood and poorly received.</p>
<p>I think the necessary changes are possible, but there are a lot of factors at play.  To make things work:</p>
<ol>
<li>They'd need education for prevention both at work <strong><em>and at home</em></strong> - so people are aware of the risks, the symptoms, and the precautions they need to take both on the floor and when they leave.</li>
<li>They'd have to slow the production line significantly - right now the local slaughterhouse runs about 2,000 cattle a day. They'd have to cut that in half, slow line speeds and have people spaced further apart. </li>
<li>They'd have to stagger shifts and break periods better, so people can distance while on break or lunch.  That's getting harder here as it gets hotter (105 yesterday) and people are less likely to go outside to eat or break.</li>
<li>They'd have to provide very enticing benefits to make sure people can get tested regularly and stay at home if they feel sick in the least.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/tyson-foods-to-resume-limited-production-at-largest-us-pork-plant.html" target="_blank">Some of these things are already being done</a>, but knowing slaughterhouse operations they'll be doing the minimal required to meet expectations. <a href="https://www.delcotimes.com/first-pennsylvania-covid-19-slaughterhouse-worker-wrongful-death-lawsuit-filed-today-by-mongeluzzi-law-firm/article_4e2bebc8-27cb-5ddc-930b-db4d375b0f18.html" target="_blank">For some</a>, it's too little, too late.</p>
<p>In many ways this is a difficult proposition - meat prices are going to probably double, wages will get cut (let's just hope &quot;someone&quot; doesn't do something really stupid like abolish minimum wage standards), and no matter what you do these places are going to continue to get hit hard - people are people, these problems have been present for a long time and the barriers are going to be very difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>Although I'm less familiar with conditions for field workers or in fruits/vegetables, I'd expect them to be similar.</p>
<p>The USDA has a <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDANIFA/bulletins/287e5f2" target="_blank">grant opportunity</a> now to study the effects of COVID on various aspects of the food chain, but I think it'd be very hard to get companies like JBS to cooperate on projects like &quot;let's see how social distancing, regular testing, etc. help.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to reiterate that it's the lack of benefits more than anything that has caused this. The people working at these plants can't stay home even if they want to because they would be fired. Even if they do have sick time, they often don't use it out of fear of losing their job. The problem isn't education, the problem is corporations exploiting people.</p></div>		</li>
