			<div class="markdown"><p>you inherit a multi-million dollar property from your parents who have died. while you personally have done decently well you haven't quite lived up to the family name and you now earn less than what it costs to maintain the property. well along comes Johnny who never had much to his name but invented the new hot seller and now he's trying to rub elbows with the rich and famous. so you offer him a chance to rent your property while you vacation abroad. he pays to maintain your house for you since he actually has the income while you only have the deed to the property</p></div>		</li>
