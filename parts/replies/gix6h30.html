			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends if you are blocking via an app on your phone / in your phones settings, or if you go to your carriers website to block the number. The first will arrive at your phone but not be displayed to you. The second will not make it to your phone, it will stop at the carriers servers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the carriers nuke the message right away? Or do they continue to store it? If they store it I'm wondering how many unsolicited dick pics are on these servers lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As stated elsewhere, it depends on what you mean. SMS messages that you ask your carrier to block? Depends on the carrier, but they're probably gone forever. iMessages? Could potentially still live on the iCloud server but there's probably no way for you to petition Apple to get them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago, I unblocked a blocked person and all their texts came flooding through at once.</p>
<p>I did something similar last year but sadly no texts came through, I guess nowadays they don't get held onto. I don't know how it works, just my anecdotal experience with the same cell carrier over the years.</p></div>		</li>
