			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but HDMI is a bullshit standard and every manufacturer has their own spin on it. Anytime you want to run 15ft+ of HDMI <em>reliably</em> you'll need some &quot;special cable&quot; with a &quot;special chip,&quot; but sometimes those aren't HDMI 2.0.</p>
<p>Or you can pay $400+ to convert it into grounded Cat6 and then back to HDMI. As someone who's done enough professional installs with HDMI, I'd much rather everything be Cat6 and forget the dumb multiconductor as twisted pair is THE WAY TO GO.</p>
<p>To put it into perspective, HDMI and DisplayPort don't even compare to the IEEE foundation. As in they don't try jack shit for standards, or testing, or accounting for attenuation, etcetera. Peripheral inputs are total shit because it's just multiconductor with a new connector on the end. I'm down for USB-C to simplify, but at length (15ft+) every multiconductor is going to be garbage for high bandwidth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might. Redmere is likely what he's referencing but there's other options. 25 meters is actually still fairly short though, cables longer than 25 meters is where HDMI really starts failing. Cables without chips tend to be very thick and thus cost a fair amount. Cables with chips can go 50 meters and be thinner than your average 6 foot cord.</p>
<p>In general cheap HDMI cables under 25 feet don't have to be chipped and can work quite work well but $10 is a really cheap price for such a cable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ill disagree with you on the HDMI. I work with this kind of stuff for a living and have never had a problem with 50ft runs. At 75 it gets a little tempermental, and above that you need a booster. But anything longer than 25 feet we use SDI anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please tell me what cables you're running. No matter the brand we can't find anything reliable over 20ft. Ended up using $400 boosters for a 40ft run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have no ends of trouble with getting a decent setup for our meeting rooms at work. Some devices cant see the display so wont output a signal... Sometimes swapping between a macbook and a dell laptop breaks until you power cycle the display.....</p>
<p>We've ended up buying $1000 scalers with hdbaseT transfer to get things to work (mostly) reliable. You would think taking an HDMI signal from any personal device to a 60 inch that is 5-10 meters in cable length away would be a simple thing to get solved... but apparently not. As the fucker who gets called in to troubleshoot I just wish there was standards that would at least make the brokenness predicable &gt;.&lt;</p></div>		</li>

<p>OR  convert it to HD / 3G-SDI over Coaxial which can run long distances too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are by far closest to the answer. The answer is all about shielding for copper wiring. It gets bulkier and less bendy cause you end up with a FSFTP i think? Which is a Foil shielded Foil Twisted Pair which has a plastic guide in it to separate the wire paired twists.</p>
<p>Now throw that all out the window because Fiber exists for all connectors. And DP 2.2 has a data throughput of about 80Gbps using Fiber. Its less bulky, Fragile, comes in 2 modes, and takes way longer to terminate a end compared to copper. Atleast for CAT/RJ45 terminations on Fiber.</p>
<p>So the answer is well shielded cables or Fiber. And all it does is allow data stability and reliability. For video its to support the bitrate for the encoded video. You know like Twitch streaming? They limit you to 6000/kbps which is good for 720/60 but not so much for 1090p60. That bitrate is the limit on how much information is sent per video frame. So lets say you want 4K/120 well to get that to look good you need a cable to support that video data bitrate bandwidth.</p>
<p>Yes your average consumer with a 4k/60 tv might not need the best of the best cable. But lets now look at someone who owns a Valve Index. That's 2 Monitors at 1440p/144hz max. The cable it comes with is DP 2.2 and it needs that because of the amount of data needing to be sent down that cable reliably.</p>
<p>And for those talking HDMI last revision i do. Beleave puts out 40Gbps and is also Fiber cabling at that point. Specifics are hard to remeber, its why we can look shit up. So if you want specifics about data speeds and limitations, look it up. Their are factors that will affect cable speed.</p></div>		</li>
