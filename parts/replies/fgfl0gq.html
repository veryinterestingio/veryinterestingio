<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I basically only ever &quot;write&quot; Japanese on the computer or my phone now, so I'm sure I can't remember how to correctly write .... honestly the majority of the Kanji I read with no problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>English reader with dyslexia, and I wanted to say you gave a great description of what reading is like with dyslexia. It’s not that letters move around or any of those old tropes about it. It’s more like your brain assembles words that aren’t really there. Or, similarly, you might know a word is on a page but have a hard time finding it on the page.</p></div>		</li>
