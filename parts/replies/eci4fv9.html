			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah! So that is the ice expanding and warping itself right before cracking. There may be some smaller cracking happening to cause the sound.</p>
<p>From here it only gets louder and deeper, as well as less regular. It starts to sound like a thunderstorm that is far away when it gets really frozen!</p>
<p>These noises are usually due to a change in the size/shape of the ice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea smaller cracking. Not hearing individual molecules move, but a small enough scale that’s its analogous to hearing one long not instead of thousands of vibrations from a string or vocal cord. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that's crazy to hear that from a lake.</p>
<p>I've always heard that exact sound used as a sound effect in movies when there's something suspended by a bunch of metal cables that are now vibrating as damage is sustained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metal cables make the same sound actually. I once went to golf driving range that was parallel to powerlines, i once saw a dude hit the powerlines with a golfball and it made the same sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this thing where I’d tilt my head sideways, put one end of a slinky around my ear like a headphone cup, and then drop the other end onto the floor. Sounded like I was taking a direct hit from a laser blaster! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should ask the Swedish and Norwegian subs, they're the most likely to have an answer, all I can suggest is &quot;sound&quot;, derived from the Norse sund, a place where this phenomenon might happen, their word for sound is ljud, which is where you get the word loud. They're experts in this kind of shit.</p>
