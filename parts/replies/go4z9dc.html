			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. But unless I’m missing something, I’ve tried a number of different combinations on the calculator and the height potential of the child is never higher than the height of the tallest parent. How can this be the case when on average people have gotten taller in each generation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) The calculator assumes that both parents reached 100% of their genetic potential. That's not always true. Lots of people with &quot;tall genes&quot; are shorter than they could have been because of limited nutrition and/or poor medical care. They will still pass on their tall genes, and as economic and social conditions change/improve, their children might end up a lot taller because they're finally expressing those genes.</p>
<p>2) Evolution isn't just something that happened in the past and now it's over. Evolution means a shift in how common different genes are, and it is happening constantly. With that in mind... it's been studied and shown that taller people are often seen as more attractive and desirable (particularly men, but they pass on their tall genes equally to their female children too), and taller people have been shown to achieve greater success in their careers. So it's entirely possible that taller people have more babies, leading to taller genes getting passed on more often, which means more people today have &quot;taller&quot; genes than they used to.</p>
<p>3) The calculator is an estimate. Height is controlled by multiple genes, and it's possible to get a lopsided combination of genes, like getting all your parents' &quot;tall&quot; genes and none of their &quot;short&quot; genes, that makes you taller than your parents. This should be balanced out by the opposite (people turning out shorter than expected due to a lopsided combo of shorter genes), but it could accelerate the trend I described above.</p></div>		</li>
