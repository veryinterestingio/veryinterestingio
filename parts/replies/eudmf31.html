			<div class="markdown"><p>There are still many that we do not know about the pathophysiology of birthmarks and many other abnormalities/diseases. But it is likely that there are types of birthmarks that are hereditary since there are many ways that our biologically programmed mechanisms fail. It may be due to genetic (in our protein-coding genes) or epigenetic (regulatory sequences etc) problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NF was the first thing I thought when they said &quot;lots of birthmarks&quot;. NF can vary in severity and appearance for everyone who has it. 5+ birthmarks or freckles in odd places (armpits, etc) are typically the first signs. I have it, the other growths get worse with age/hormone flux.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Because neural crest cells as the name suggests - are neural, meaning they give rise to not only melanocytes but also some neurons.</p></div>		</li>
