			<div class="markdown"><p>Kendra here. This paper reports on our efforts to develop a tool that will allow us to run different interdiction strategies (see Nick's response to ElectricGears). Our next task is to run them! So we have no 'best alternative' yet.</p>
<p>What's exciting, though, is that we are even talking about alternatives! Drug interdiction in the transit zone has been something that has sort of been invisible to U.S. taxpayers, even though billions of $$ are spent on it every year. So stay tuned and be sure to ask your representatives where they stand on whether or not this is a good use of your tax dollars!</p></div>		</li>
