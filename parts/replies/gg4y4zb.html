			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the major challenges for solid state batteries is developing the solid state electrolyte; the electrolyte is the workhorse of the chemical reaction.   Generally, currently developed solid state electrolytes have performance that is much lower than conventional liquid electrolytes. This limits how fast they can be charged and discharged.   We also need to worry about the interface where the battery electrodes and electrolyte comes together.   If the interface isn't good, the battery will be heavier than it should be.     There is a lot of work happening to improve the interface with things like 3-D printing and other techniques, but for large improvements a better performing electrolyte is required to build the battery around.</p>
<p>Do you think improved fuel storage or propulsion efficiency is the bigger breakthrough for achieving commercialization? Both. We need storage methods which are lighter and take up less volume but propulsion efficiency ultimately drives how much fuel has to be stored.  - Cheryl</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this answer: the answer to the first issue is to find a solid state electrolyte that has a higher ionic conductivity than a wet cell. Current solid state electrolyte needs be in the 10^-3 S/cm range to compete with wet cells. However, studies by Wang et al and Wagemaker have found possible solutions in the 10^-2 range which is amazing.</p>
<p>In addition, we also need to make sure that the volume expansion within the cell does not cause the electrode to lose contact with the electrolyte either. Wet chemistry is really good for this since it will always be in contact with a particle if it can fit into the cranny. Solid electrolyte can lose contact during lithiation cycles and you just lose that part of the cell. Its good to see ALD and 3D printing techniques are advancing to try and mitigate these issues, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why has nobody developed a removable and rechargable, on the fly swap battery? With todays technologies it seems as if you might even be able to replace a battery in flight. Battery caches could be conveyed to aircraft at altitude either in towers or kinetically launched. A battery in free fall tethered to a cable trailing behind it is super easy to catch. The new batteries could be designed with minimal flight characteristics (toting high energy density bat..duh) and your airplane can have all the juice you want.  It would never have to land.</p></div>		</li>

You would crash the plane trying to battery swap in midair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers do not crash planes silly rabbit. Battery stacks will be in your neighborhood long before this density problem is solved. 3 stories tall with bats charging 24 hrs a day and drones flying off with charged batteries as they drop discharged units. Aerial snagging of mail is easy it will be done with batteries. The USN is VERY good at this. What would you crash the plane into btw? Picture a drag chute and a 250 foot cable with a battery at the bottom. Its a pretty picture anyway lol.</p></div>		</li>
