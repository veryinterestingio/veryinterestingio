			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait... so if there are things traveling away from us faster than c... does that mean c as the universal speed limit is relative to an object that is stationary in relation to itself?</p>
<p>For example. Let's assume a planet is moving away from us at .2c and an object launches away from us at .9c, this would mean that, to us, it appears to be traveling at 1.1c but it's actually traveling at .9c in relation to its planet or 0c in relation to itself. Is this correct?</p>
<p>If that is true, then how is it that we cant reach the edge of the universe by launching an infinite number of shuttles going at .9c assuming an infinite energy source?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because information can never be transferred for something beyond the Hubble horizon, it means for all intents and purposes... it doesn't even exist.</p>
<p>As for the conservation of the light speed limit, 2 objects moving at greater then 1C relative will not see it that way from their perspective.  Time slows and the universe contracts in the velocity vector.  So they would just see</p>
<p>v^relative = [v_1 - v_2]/[1 - (v_1*v_2/c^2 )] = 0.8536 C</p>
<p>The expansion of space, at the edges, is basically the universal equivalent of an event horizon, just inverted... where space time is expanding faster then light, rather then contracted to a singularity.  And afaik, space time warping is the only possible exception to light speed limits, but our math just breaks down at those extremes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relativistic velocities don’t add that way (ie not like simply 0.2 + 0.9).</p>
<p>Additionally, objects far enough away such their the expansion between us is growing faster than the speed of light (H*d &gt; c) are causally disconnected from us. We cannot ever interact with them because there is no possible path in spacetime connecting the object and us, since you would have to travel faster than the speed of light to “catch up”</p></div>		</li>
