			<div class="markdown"><p>One related point is that the more copies of the virus out there replicating, the greater the chances of a mutation arising. Each replication by each viron has a small probability of becoming more infections (and a much higher probability of becoming less infectious). So with more of them in the whole population the chances of a more infectious variant arising increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also virus' replicating machinery and complexes tends to be sloppier and more error prone. An RNA virus polymerase usually has an error rate of 1 per 10k to 100k basepairs while for us it tends to be 1 per 10M to 100M basepairs. A virus genetic strand may also be significantly smaller they reproduce at ridiculous rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have widespread infections in a country, whether you get a variant that is worse is essentially about luck. Mutations are random and you increase the risk when a country has many infected, but you can luck out.</p>
<p>The US has discovered a few interesting variants and keep in mind that sequencing has been low, although it is getting better (at least in some states in the last couple of months). Two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boston: Last year, an immunocompromised patient in Boston had COVID-19 in several months and during that period it <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/02/05/964447070/where-did-the-coronavirus-variants-come-from" target="_blank">mutated repeatedly</a> (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2031364" target="_blank">scientific paper</a>), eventually ending up sharing many of the mutations seen in B.1.1.7 (variant discovered in UK). The two are in separate clades/branches, i.e. they evolved independently of each other. However, it is possible that if this Boston variant had spread beyond the first patient it could have had the same effect as B.1.1.7 because of the many shared mutations. The Boston case also shows how most scientists believe B.1.1.7 emerged: an immunocompromised patient that was infected in months, giving the virus time to mutate repeatedly.</p>
</li>
<li>B.1.429 (CAL.20C), which was first detected almost simultaneously in July in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/health/coronavirus-variant-california.html" target="_blank">US state of California</a> (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.21249786v1" target="_blank">scientific paper</a>) and in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo (a frequently visited holiday destination for Americans, also during this epidemic). Here's the variant page on <a href="https://outbreak.info/situation-reports" target="_blank">outbreak.info</a>, which is maintained by Scripps Research who's heavily involved in California's sequencing (they were also involved in the first B.1.1.7 discovered in the US). You can click on each variant's name to go to a detailed page. B.1.429 stayed low in almost half a year after its discovery last summer, but it suddenly increased during the winter in some parts California. Note that it remained a minority of cases during California's large December-early January COVID-surge; it was only from mid-January that it became a majority in certain counties (so, despite the attempt by some people, you can't really blame the state's earlier COVID-surge on it because it was still a minority then). As mentioned by the virologists in the previously linked NY Times article, its increasing frequency in parts of California has resulted in some believing that it is more contagious, but others have expressed doubts and said that it is too early to say. Founder effect or superspreader events are alternative explanations; basically being in the right place at the right time (like the <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/article_e4095910-6af1-11eb-a3bc-336456794a5b.html" target="_blank">huge superspreader event</a> of last year's Mardi Gras). This is also why outbreak.info currently lists it as a &quot;variant of interest&quot; rather than a &quot;variant of concern&quot;. If it is more contagious, there are a few things that are peculiar: Why did it stay at low levels for almost half a year, only to suddenly increase? The B.1.429 variant is defined by five mutations, but many have focussed on its L452R mutation. This exact mutation has been discovered a few times, including once in March in Denmark (only two weeks after the country's first COVID-case at a time when most cases in the country were imports) and once in April in the Netherlands; these are in separate clades/branches than California's B.1.429, i.e. they evolved independently of each other (they're unrelated). However, if the L452R mutation makes it more contagious, why didn't the two early known variants with it, discovered almost a year ago, spread? Perhaps the combination of mutations seen in B.1.429 has an effect, which is the theory advocated by the virologists in the NY Times article, but we don't really know. Anyway, scientists are keeping an eye on B.1.429 and if it really is more contagious we'll likely know soon. Additionally, after its increase in California, it has been detected in several other US states and very small numbers have been detected in a handful of other countries. This includes some of the nations that are world leading in sequencing and they'll likely notice if it behaves differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary: mutations are random and the US might have lucked out. Or perhaps the US already have their &quot;own&quot; variant of concern, either ones already discovered (as the above examples) or other that still are undiscovered because much of the nation has been behind in sequencing (it's getting better).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. The brazilian one makes sense under that logic, as they've also had very broad spread, but it's random, so its possible that whatever mutations you've have haven't happened to help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a really generic version of natural selection, the viruses are aquiring mutations at random and a person's body is the environment 'selecting' fit the fittesr traits in the virus.</p>
<p>Different bodies might favor different traits.</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense that a body which can't destroy the virus quickly leaves a lot of time for random mutations to occur and proliferate.</p>
<p>Are there any other traits that would accelerate the evolution of new virus stains?</p></div>		</li>
