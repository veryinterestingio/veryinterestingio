			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice try of an analogy, except that's totally not how mailboxes work.</p>
<p>Maybe:</p>
<p>You could keep walking to the post office and asking if you have mail, or you could just wait at home for them to deliver it to you.  You use up less energy just waiting at home, and usually they'll deliver your mail eventually.  But sometimes instead of delivering your actual mail, they just leave a note saying come to the post office to pick this up.  Then you have to get up and use more energy than just checking the mailbox.</p></div>		</li>

<p>PS. Your analogy doesn't really work since it's not the server contacting the phone, the phone is doing the polling. So no delivery and no notes.</p></div>		</li>
