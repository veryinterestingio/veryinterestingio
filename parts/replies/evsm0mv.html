			<div class="markdown"><p>Targeted protein degradation is a powerful technology, and we are not the first people to realize this! Many others are currently working on methods to target endogenous proteins for degradation using tools such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.1858" target="_blank">PROTACS</a>, which are small molecules that recruit the cell's native degradation machinery to degrade disease-causing proteins. This therapy has a lot of potential because it can be easily administered as a drug using standard protocols. Unlike PROTACS, LOCKRs are proteins that may have difficulty making their way into cells as a therapy to modify intracellular proteins. We envision using LOCKR as a tool to endow cells with new functions by encoding the proteins in the genome using methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 or lentivirus. In the future, it may be possible to use LOCKR encoded in a gene therapy to modify cells in the body to fight things like prions and other misfolded proteins! -AN</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a very quick scan and it doesn’t look likely. It looks like this system utilizes allosteric modulation with essentially a cap that comes off in response to some signal (I.e rise in pH). In essence, it uses a lock and key model to maintain homeostasis of certain cell pathways.</p>
<p>To use this on prions, we’d need a binding pocket on the prion, afaik there are no pockets. It would also be more feasible to just develop a drug to do that. This system runs on genetics, which is tricky and expensive in and of itself.</p></div>		</li>
