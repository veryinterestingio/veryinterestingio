			<div class="markdown"><p>Please excuse my ignorance, but if the immune system had been trained to target particular surface proteins in HIV, then does it really matter that the virus may be laying dormant? Surely upon activation they would be detected and effectively terminated by the now trained immune system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trouble with HIV is not that the body cannot make antibodies against the specific strains, it’s that the strains mutate within the body, while devastating the immune system.</p>
<p>What many individuals have a hard time developing are broadly neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that will target various strains of HIV. Learning how to elicit a bnAb response rather than a strain specific response is one of the biggest focuses right now for putative HIV vaccines.</p>
<p>The most common issue with the development of vaccines for diseases mentioned is not how to make the vaccine. The bigger issues are <em>which</em> antigens are needed to elicit immunity to the disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our immune system does know and adapts accordingly. HIV wants the immune system to attack it and adapts throughout infection via mutations causing changes on cell surface proteins, cellular machinary, etc... Thus would not work. For example, later in the progression, small micro tears in the intestinal walls allow bacteria to activate an immune response which HIV will use as a means for replication, before this occurs the viral load is usually low simply due to the immune system “effectively”fighting the virus. The progression to aids is a result of persistant induction of the immune response the HIV induces and hijacks (actually kind of waves, in regard to immune activity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless it targets a VERY conserved region that is found on ALL virus strains in the host, then it will be hard to develop a personalized vaccine that can completely eradicate HIV in that specific patient. You also need to deal with a potentially exhausted immune system from over-activation against HIV, a chronic disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be a treatment option then, to develop a vaccine that mitigates HIV instead of outright destroying it? Like if I was vaccinated and somehow contracted HIV the body can then adapt itself to contain the virus below transmittable levels while eliminating or heavility mitigating the terrible effects of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. A vaccine wouldn't work there. HIV infects the immune system itself and uses it to multiply. At the same time it mutates into different strains (inside one's body) as such even if some effective antibodies are made they still wouldn't stop the infection. That's why HIV is so hard to create a vaccine for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not only that it integrates itself into the cells, is the fact that it is a <em>retro</em>virus. These viruses have very poor self-checking which results in really funky mutations as it goes from RNA to DNA. The reservoir in the body just exacerbates this issue further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this point it would probably be better if you use the combination of multiple antiretroviral drugs cocktail if you only want to mitigate HIV from spreading and not eradicate it. It’s currently being used by many HIV patients to live a normal life. </p>
<p>An HIV vaccine that prevents you from being infected will be hard to develop if an average cell produces 1 BILLION viral particles per day and there’s approx. 1/10000 (? Not fact checked, based on memory. Feel free to correct me) mutation of single base pair in DNA of virus, leading to large diversity of strains.</p>
<p>Also, the other responses to your comment are also valid points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This will probably get glossed over, but do you believe the vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer will provide immunity or just suppress severity? I know we cant say with 100% confidence either way, but are you confident they will?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t have the data from the companies so I am not sure, though I am hearing decent news about the results. We won’t know whether they provide long-term immunity until the vaccine has been administered and tested several months later to determine whether the immune responses are still strong against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccines usually provide immunity (Antibodies/Cellular-mediated immunities), never really heard of suppressing severity unless you count being immune as 0 severity. I do know that if the vaccine works then immunity should last years. A recovered SARS patient had immune cell responses (T cells) for up to 11 years (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115611/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115611/</a>)</p></div>		</li>
