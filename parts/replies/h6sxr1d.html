			<div class="markdown"><p>So could you bottle someone's farts and they could differentiate that and someone else's? Or is it related to the action more than the chemical composition? How about the build up effect as opposed to the sudden blast?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i really doubt they could. i suspect there's a huge psychological compenent to it where you just know wether it was you or not and that influences perception.</p>
<p>your nose should't be desensitised to your own fart smells unless you've been sitting in a cloud of it for a while</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can't really bottle smells very well, it has to do with their concentration in air</p>
<p>It's a proximity thing, the closer to the source of the smell the greater the concentration in air, and sense of smell is primarily to do with air sampling. You can bottle liquids which evaporate and become a source of a smell, but it's not quite the same.</p>
<p>As far as how well you can tell smells apart, that's due to memory. So if you think of a smell that you could recognise easily, like petrol or playdoh, it's because every time you smelled them in the past you knew exactly what it was, so the brain link between the name and the substance as it evaporates and concentrates the air around it is really strongly formed and reinforced. They're also consistent smelling, which helps. Even more so if you've got other associated memories, like happy childhood memories of playdoh, or scary memories of smelling petrol while having dealt with trauma of fire. Smells that are less reinforced, or that change more frequently but are 'named' the same, the link is not so strong. The better your sense of smell and the better your memory and associations, the more easily you will be able to differentiate - this is the basis behind training sniffer dogs - show them a smell, reinforce it repeatedly to show you are interested in that smell and want them to 'name' it and store it in memory, and then ask them to recall that memory and react when they smell it and let you know by leading you to where it's coming from</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BS! You certainly can catch diseases from yourself. You (like all humans) are an ecosystem with many microbiomes hosting a vast number of microorganisms. In many cases, bacteria which are harmless or beneficial in one microbiome are pathogenic on others if you eat a sandwich made with your own feces, for example, you will get sick.</p>
<p>But the op is just wrong. People find their own stool and urine unpleasant to smell. People with chronic halitosis are revolted by the odor, people who perspire heavily and then don‚Äôt bathe find the odors associated with microbial activity in the sweat very offensive. The only thing partially true in the idea that people are less sensitive to their own odors is the result of ‚Äúnose blindness‚Äù Prolonged exposure to an odor makes people temporarily less sensitive to it, e.g., cat owners.</p></div>		</li>
