			<div class="markdown"><p>I have songs stuck in my head all the time and often wake up like you do. For me it’s a function of OCD and anxiety - it’s a recurring, intrusive, unwanted thought; it just happens to also be the chorus of an ABBA song.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i eternally have “brain radio” going on in the background. it can be songs that i haven’t heard in years and my brain is happily playing music during any quiet moment. while read this post Winner Takes it All is playing and i had to laugh at the fact that your brain radio is partial to ABBA as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, brain radio, that’s exactly it! My brain almost always has a snippet of a song playing in the background. Right now it’s the bridge of “Supalonely,” but it is the chorus of “Angel Eyes” FAR more often than I care to admit. I’ve noticed music from the ‘70s tends to “stick” more than other eras - I wonder why!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, it's somewhat comforting to read other people have this too, and &quot;brain radio&quot; is certainly a good term for it. I've had it since I was around 12, now I'm 30. I remember I wanted it to stop for so long, but about five years ago, I remember hitting a milestone. I no longer want it gone, because it's now an integral part of who I am. I am certain I'd miss it. </p>
<p>Though, it IS nice to have a break from it every now and then. Only two things do that for me, which is actually listening to music or getting <em>REALLY</em> focused on a specific, brain-intensive task. Or better yet, both.</p>
<p>Let's start using the term <strong>Brain radio</strong> so much it becomes the common term for it!</p></div>		</li>
