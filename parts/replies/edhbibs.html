			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the biggest thing that really decided upon his declaration of DOWN being his orientation for the gate was based on how he shot. Once he made the correlation that the gun renders specific parts of the targets body immobile is when he made the assertion your legs were expendable. So when he kneeled and used his legs as a shield to shoot from between, or by traveling leg first towards enemies you presented them only with expendable targets until you had line of sight. This created a person orientation of always looking ‘down’ while progressing forward. I mobile legs were shields/fodder and useful arms could still shoot and provide mobility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, &quot;prograde&quot; and &quot;retrograde&quot; are important directions when talking about objects orbiting each other.</p>
<p>Prograde means a moon or spacecraft is moving the same direction a planet (or sun, or other moon, or other spacecraft) is rotating.</p>
<p>Retrograde means moving in the opposite direction of rotation.</p>
<p>This is important, as the only thing that is keeping objects from being smashed into each other by gravity is the high speed they travel around each other in an orbit. Increasing or decreasing prograde or retrograde motion means crashing to earth, or breaking orbit and flying into the void.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition often people refer orbits as &quot;falling and missing&quot;, meaning that you have earth's gravity pulling you towards the planet, but you just have enough speed to miss the planet and instead bend around the planet. This also means the closer you get to earth, the faster you must go around earth to stay in orbit, because gravity is stronger. </p>
<p>Also in Space you don't really think in what your speed is alone. It's always in relation to something, being the speed around a heavenly body, towards a target etc. </p>
<p>And when it comes to adjusting your direction etc, I'd like to think of it like vectors (X Y Z and speed). Where one of the vectors is gravity. Your going one direction and gravity goes another. If you sum these, you'll get your real path. This ofc changes all the time and includes a lot more than just 2 vectors. But as a basic principle I think it makes sense. </p></div>		</li>
