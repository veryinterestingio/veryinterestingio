			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in modern physics. Temperature is no longer defined from the ideal gas law but from the flow of entropy.  Not that it really matters, it gives the same result, except that the ideal gas definition does not in itself disallow temperatures below zero. The modern definition does, I think. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, liquid helium stays liquid even at absolute zero because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle means that the position of the atoms cannot be precisely known at the same time as the velocity (momentum).  And if the atom is immobile its velocity is completely known (it is zero).  This means that all atoms still have a tiny motion at zero kelvin. Helium is light, so this motion is a bit larger than for other elements. At the same time, forces between Helium atoms are unusually weak so they cannot maintain a solid crystal structure against the zero point motion at ambient pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. That is because the “real” quantity is beta = 1 / k T where k is Boltzmann’s constant. Beta is “coldness” and behaves nicely. Absolute zero is infinitely cold. As the temperatur increases to infinite, coldness goes to zero. A few weird systems can be colder than zero (hotter than infinity) so they get negative coldnes, and by the equation above their temperature is also negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. When I calculated 0K at university I did it by cooling a gas at constant pressure and then extrapolating to zero volume. As others have said, this is a theoretical value and is pretty unobtainable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ideal gas law is a description of a gases where the interactions between particles are negligible. This works for low pressure, high temperature system with no dipole-dipole or hydrogen bonding. As a rule of thumb volumes decrease with temperature and pressure, but ice is an exception. For modelling liquid helium you need to start from scratch.</p></div>		</li>
