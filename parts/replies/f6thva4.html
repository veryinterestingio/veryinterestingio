			<div class="markdown"><p>An alcohol is a generic name for a group of chemicals that all have a similar trait. They have a hydroxyl group (-OH) which is an oxygen and hydrogen off of a carbon. This gives them all similar properties. </p>
<p>The most common one to everyday folk is ethyl alcohol or ethanol which is 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens and the hydroxyl group. This is the alcohol found in alcoholic beverages</p></div>		</li>
