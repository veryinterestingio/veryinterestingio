<p>If oxygen's started flowing around the brain again, what has changed in the cells that prevents them from working again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If 2-3 minutes without oxigen makes the brain go bye-bye, how can people hold their breath for over 20 minutes? I get that they still have blood flowing so the brain technically still gets oxigen but im guessing eventually that dosen't cut it anymore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if anyone has ever thought of building some type of personal machine that stays straps to your body and if it ever detects your heart stopped then it will take over and just pump the blood through your bran so it can save a life while your heart is not pumping oxygen into it..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen deprivation. Without the heart pumping blood to all parts of the body the brain will not have fresh oxygenated blood coming in. No oxygen means cells can't do their functions to live, cells die, body dies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>brain tissues are very sensitive to a lack of oxygen and start dying off en masse very quickly after 3-5 minutes without oxygen. </p>
<p>Its why strokes cause brain damage - the region of the brain affected by the stroke suffers a die-off due to the lack of oxygen. its also why if you treat a stroke quickly enough the damage can be averted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping on this to promote CPR.  This is why CPR is important.  CPR is a way of artificially beating the heart and oxygenating the blood until you can get them to a machine that does it better.  CPR increases the time to cell death.  It gives time for EMS to get there and then to get them to a hospital.</p></div>		</li>
