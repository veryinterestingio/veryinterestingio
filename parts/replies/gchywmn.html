			<div class="markdown"><p>Not yet. We are looking for life in our universe through 3 different paths.   </p>
<ol>
<li>Search for technosignatures using radio antenna array and classical telescopes to detect a signa sent by a technological civilization which wants to tell us that they are here and wants to communicate with us  </li>
<li>Search for life in our solar system using NASA/ESA space missions mostly and developing instruments capable of studying life in extreme environment (so microbiological life most likely)  </li>
<li>Search for life on exoplanets, or planets in orbit around other stars. In this case we are designing ground-based telescopes and instruments to sniff the atmosphere of planets to detect biomarkers.<br />
No life yet, but I am really to bet  that in 10-15 years we will have an habitable exoplanets with liquid water on the surface and biomarkers in the atmosphere. I can explain why later.</li>
