			<div class="markdown"><p>Oklahoma casinos charge $1/play. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure they take it on a push. It's been a while since I've played BJ there. Usually stick with poker since at least there's a little more interaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens if all players bust but say the dealer ends up with a 12.  Do they still have to play out the hand so they burn up cards?  For other side bets like the 4+ card dealer bust thing I'm sure they'd need to play out the hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.</p>
<p>Everyone busts, the dealer stays at 12 and wins it all.  The rule that they hit only applies if they are in a losing position</p></div>		</li>
