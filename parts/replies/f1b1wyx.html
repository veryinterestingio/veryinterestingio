			<div class="markdown"><p>Stress, anxiety, not looking after yourself in general can definitely cause all that. Diet etc. Practicing good &quot;sleep hygiene&quot; can help, which is about getting into a healthy and consistent routine around going to bed, making sure things are tidy and you can relax properly etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, those are the answers I was kind of expecting and I get those are all the factors that go into quality of sleep but I was trying to zero in on that specific disparity. </p>
<p>We could be talking about a day apart in the same week with all else being equal. Yet, I could take a 20 minute nap and wake up refreshed and the next night can't fall asleep all night for the life of me, lay in bed for 8 hours and sleep maybe half, and wake up feeling like shit.</p>
<p>It seems like in one case your brain is accessing REM much easier than the other case and I was wondering if there's something that is known to cause that disparity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the main function of caffeine is literally exactly what you are describing, are you sure you aren't just drinking coffee/ caffinated tea/ soda/etc in the afternoon on those days? The effects of caffeine last easily for six hours, even though you stop feeling the &quot;high&quot; after 30-60minutes.</p>
<p>Also it is quite well established now that the blue light prevents the production of melatonin, maybe you're up working late on the computer or something?</p>
<p>Could be a lot of factors, just throwing a couple ideas.</p>
<p>edit: although laying in bed for 8 hours is not normal. if that's actually happening from time to time then it's probably worth investigating more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% waking up in the wrong part of the cycle. A sleep cycle is roughly 2 hours. If you take a quick nap, and wake up 20 minutes later, you have not yet entered deep sleep. Therefore you feel rested and ready to go.</p>
<p>If you sleep the entire two hours, by the time you wake up, your brain has left deep sleep and is in a state more ready to accept waking. There you feel rested and ready to go.</p>
<p>If you wake up in the middle of the cycle, it’s like going from “mild coma” to “wide awake” without taking the time to slowly achieve wakefulness. This is why you feel groggy! </p>
<p>TL,DR: if you’re going to nap, make it &lt;/= 30 min, or a full 2 hours, otherwise you’re gonna have a bad time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It differs from person to person. For me, I hit the limit at 20 mins - anything past that is a nightmare. 14-17 mins is my optimum .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense to me. I've had naps wander into 40 minutes and I feel like I've had a stroke when trying to wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the chance that you're waking up in different parts of the sleep cycle. </p>
<p>For instance if you wake up from REM you'll feel differently than if you wake up during the first and lightest stage. </p>
<p>This is why I hate setting an alarm in the morning. I let my body tell me when to wake up within an hour (so if I NEED to be up by 8am, I'll get up if I wake up an 1.25 hours before hand, because most sleep cycles take 1.5-2 hours to complete, and I know if I wake up in the middle of a cycle I'll be much groggier and generally in a worse mood).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been trying a few of those apps that supposedly wake you when you're not in deep sleep and idk if it's just a placebo effect kinda deal but I do feel like I wake up more refreshed than I do when I just set a normal alarm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started using timed lights gradually coming up starting 30 min before the time I want to wake up by.  It kind of eases you into waking up, I definitely recommend it.</p></div>		</li>
