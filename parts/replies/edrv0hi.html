			<div class="markdown"><p>That was very jargony, and I love it. But for the breakdown for non-astrophysics types: you can use the laws of motion (particularly angular momentum and the law of conservation thereof) to determine the speed of the disk of stuff the black hole is feeding on and reverse engineer the math to give you the rotation speed of the thing that disk is orbiting. Was their math right? No idea, as I havenâ€™t looked into it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. I was referring to Kelplers laws of motion, and factoring in relativity. But I was trying to keep it as simple as possible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that in the paper they show that either the angular velocity of the accretion disk is strongly coupled to the intrinsic angular momentum of the black hole in line with GR, or the black hole is unlike every other observed black hole and the rest of astrophysics. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Given that we can measure the mass and the mass gives us a radius with a little bit of tensor calculus they calculated the rotational velocity of the black hole, </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>also GR predicts frame dragging so there is an Ergosphere around this black hole which means that the intrinsic angular momentum of the black hole can be measured by the spin bias of any emitted particle, the group didn't do that but it should be possible to measure, see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Course-General-Relativity/dp/0521887054" target="_blank">shultz</a> for a full deveration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to understand the quasi-periodic pulse.  My guess is that the non-uniformity of the material in the accretion disk is sort of acting like an antenna, and we're seeing the side-lobes as this &quot;antenna&quot; swirls around.  Am I on the right track?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a radio burst associated with the event, but for this purpose they're looking at the X-ray band.</p>
<p>I don't think the paper poses or requires a detailed model of the mechanism. You just need to know that <em>something</em> in the disk is swirling around making X-rays. The paper discusses potential mechanisms and their problems in Section 7 starting on p11.</p></div>		</li>
