			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekman_transport" target="_blank">Ekman Transport</a>. Basically, as wind moves over water, the Coriolis effect will create a <a href="https://image1.slideserve.com/3089788/slide13-l.jpg" target="_blank">net flow of water</a> <em>perpendicular</em> to the direction the wind is moving. In the Northern Hemisphere, Ekman Transport moves to the right of the wind, in the Southern Hemisphere Ekman Transport moves to the left of the wind. Due to global wind belts <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth111/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.earth111/files/Module2/Hadley-Cell_0.jpg" target="_blank">converging</a> on the equator, this has the effect of water flowing southernly in the Southern Hemisphere, and northerly in the Northern Hemisphere. This divergence of water at the equator leads to upwelling, which leads to high concentrations of nutrients in the water, which leads to high levels of primary productivity.</p></div>		</li>
