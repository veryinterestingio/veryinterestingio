			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why pressing on a bruise with firm pressure somehow hurts less than like, bumping it? Something something the pressure on the skin sensation overrides the bruise pain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also why rubbing bruises as soon as you get them makes it hurt less in the long run. By stimulating a big amount of mechanoreceptors in the area around the bruise the signals synchronise and intermingle pre-synaptic gap and receiving neuron and you don't notice as much of the pain as you would if you'd just leave it alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>:o i don't know anything about mechanoreceptors but that's really cool information! So it doesn't necessarily cause it to heal faster (by stimulating, idk, cell division or whatever) but it numbs the pain? Is it a temporary effect or does it change how the pain is registered while the bruise develops? Sorry if these are nonsensical questions haha but I'd like to know more!</p></div>		</li>
