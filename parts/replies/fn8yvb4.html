			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a feeling of curiosity or excitement about something. Wanting to know more about it, seeking fulfilment or closure. </p>
<p>Perhaps you are interested in what is beyond the next rise on the hike, and that makes you keep walking to see.   An uninterested person would stop walking and turn for home.  </p>
<p>Perhaps you are interested to see what happens next in your show, so you hit yes when Netflix asks you if you’re still there.  An uninterested person would turn it off.  </p>
<p>Perhaps you are interested to know why exactly a carbon atom can bind to hundreds of different molecules but a helium atom cannot, so you turn up to your chemistry class to listen to your teacher explain it.  You lose your interest quickly when you remember how boring you find chemistry and sink into a stupor but for one shining moment you had the mind of a scholar.</p></div>		</li>

It amazes me how I remember names of varieties without effort but can’t tell you what I had for lunch yesterday!  Being passionate about something makes all the difference.</p></div>		</li>
