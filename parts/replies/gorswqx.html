			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s a valid way of looking at it. The fed in the US tries to keep inflation just above zero in the range where no one will expect deflation. Expectations are a key part of this - if everyone expects deflation to happen, deflation is much more likely</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Basically, trying to maintain 0% inflation is like trying to walk right along a cliff. It’s much safer to walk a few feet away. There’s positive good in low, steady inflation, but preventing deflation is really the big key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add: the goal is slow, 2%ish inflation but we've only recently (past 3ish decades) consistently achieved that. There was a period in the 1970s with quite high inflation in the US. Many other countries struggle with higher inflation today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Generally, inflation transfers wealth from those who have money to those who are earning wages through labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very <em>generally</em> and mostly theoretically. In practice the wages haven't kept up with the inflation while real wealth found ways to multiple through opportunities not available not only to wage earners (aka 401K holders) but even the &quot;middle class&quot; that is relying housing as the main asset class undermined around the country by shifting demand for city living. </p>
<p>Besides the true inflation is understated by a skewed selection of items in the &quot;consumption&quot; basket and is further depressed by heavy share of low priced energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's several reasons, although a bad fit for ELI5.</p>
<p>High interest rates mean wealthy people and businesses will keep their money in the banks. It is less risky and has a guaranteed financial reward. </p>
<p>Production creates value. Farm animals have babies, crops grow in the field, miners bring up valuable minerals, each turn labor into tangible rewards.</p>
<p>There's a complex relationship where slow production like annual crops mean high interest makes production less valuable. In the time between planting and harvest all the profits can be overcome due to inflation. </p>
<p>The ideal number is low enough to encourage business to invest in people and capital goods rather than sock money away, also low enough that farmers, ranchers, and others who need long-term returns can still get a viable return, while being high enough to overcome creation of value making the money concentrated around producers. In many western nations that is currently about 2%. It is different in different societies and varies depending on how much raw production versus non-production work like service economy there is.</p></div>		</li>
