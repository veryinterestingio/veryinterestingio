			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. The three channels that fluid flows through inside you ear canal use tiny hairs to detect the motion of that fluid. This is your vestibular system for balance. There are also hairs that detect and change vibration to electrical currents for the brain to &quot;hear&quot;. Hearing loss occurs when these hairs have been damaged or destroyed. I have tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, caused by these hairs being permanently forced down, therefore constantly sending a signal that isn't really there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge, typical dental anaesthetics don't actually affect mechanoreceptors at all - only nociceptors (pain nerves). Yeah, the feeling isn't the best but it's better than the alternative hahaha</p></div>		</li>
