			<p>Plus even if it was perfectly balanced, the inward forces on the very large hoop of steel would exceed the strength of the metal.

			<p>Yes, the elevator would first travel vertically to the top of the cable, it then switches to travel horizontally along the maglev rail part of the beam.  <br>Since the beam is already at orbital speed, the elevator/maglev-train only need to apply a braking force for it to start accelerating to the same speed as the beam.  <br>It might then even be able to accelerate itself to a higher speed than the beam, which would fling it to higher orbit once it lets go of the rail.</p>		</li>

			<p>Any force on the ring would cause a wave to spread through it.  <br>A stiff material would be like the high notes on a guitar. It would spread faster and have a smaller amplitude.  <br>A more flexible material would have waves that spread slower with a much larger amplitude(again, like the low notes on a guitar)<br><br>The faster spreading, low amplitude waves from a stiff material would probably be faster to dampen simply because it spreads more quickly through the points(like the cables running to the surface) where you can take corrective action.<br><br>You could induce stiffness by spinning the ring faster than orbital speeds, creating tension in the ring.  But I would prefer if the ring was completely relaxed, because if it broke in a collision or something, it won't fly apart catastrophically, potentially destroying the earth in the process, it would simply keep spinning where it was, allowing you time to repair it.<br><br>I have no idea what material should work best, but the Wikipedia article for orbital rings mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflatable_space_structures" target="_blank">Inflatable space structures</a></p>		</li>

			<p>I keep thinking through this, but I don't think this would actually apply. <br><br>Normally when we look at beam deformation, you integrate the forces to get shear forces then integrate again to get bending moment. <br><br>However, in such a case, the bending is actually opposite gravity more analogous to a cantilevered beam.

			<p>The curvature is so slight that the system actually boils down to simple compression.

			<p>Edit: this has errors.

The vertical component of these will be 2 T sin(theta), where theta is the angle around the earth that 1 metre makes, or 1 / 40000000 radians. <br><br>Hence, 490 = T/20000000, so the tension in the bar is 9.8 GigaNewtons. The cross-sectional area of the bar is about 0.006 m^2 , so we're talking about pressures of 1600 GPa. <br><br>The compressive strength of steel is only about 300MPa at most, so this enormous pressure will squish the steel like an elephant stepping on warm plasticene. <br><br>It will act like a liquid until deformities in the steel cause it to break up.

			<p>very good answer (actually using numbers). But the beam slenderness is huge considering the beam is practically infinitely long so any conceivable crossection would buckle before yielding under purely compressive strains. it would buckle in the least resisting buckling shape (one full sine for this problem) excluding any dynamic effects (assuming the beam has no mass) </p>		</li>

			<p>Your solution for the compression in the beam isn't quite correct - it's off by about a factor of 3. The compressive force is equal to &quot;density/length <em> gravitational constant </em> radius of hoop&quot;. With the density you gave (50 kg/m) and assuming the total length of beam is roughly the earth's circumference (40 million m), the compressive force works out to around 3.1 GN. Still enough to cause compressive failure even if it wasn't going to buckle - but not quite as high as your initial estimate.<br><br><br>See here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Qe3uX" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/Qe3uX</a><br><br><br>I was curious as to why your method (FBD of 1 m of beam) didn't yield the same answer as mine (FBD of half of beam), because it seemed perfectly reasonable - but I figured it out. It's 2 things: <br><br><br>1) Your estimate for the number of radians that 1 m makes was based off of the circumference of the earth, instead of the radius. So the actual number of radians is different by a factor of 2*pi. <br><br><br>2) The angle theta in that example is actually supposed to be the number of radians that 0.5 m makes, not the number of radians that 1 m makes. This changes the number of radians by a factor of 1/2.<br><br><br>If you multiply those factors together, you get a multiplicative error of pi for your estimate of theta. Correcting that ends up dividing your tension by pi, leaving... 3.1 GN. Mystery solved. :)</p>		</li>

			<p>I seriously doubt it - and as other commenters have pointed out, the beam would buckle before it compressed. I did a bit of light googling, and found compressive strength figures of 870000psi quoted for some Tungsten Carbide materials. That's about 6GPa. <br><br><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/410479/strongest-material-ever-tested/" target="_blank">This article</a> says a sheet of pure, perfect graphene would be strong enough to support the weight of a car balanced atop a pencil. Graphene's no use for making solid beams, and they aren't talking about compressive strength anyway, but we can still work out what pressure this is. If a car weighs 2 tons = 20 kN. I couldn't find the thickness of a pencil tip, but the thinnest mechanical pencils come it at 0.3mm. Let's say a really sharp pencil is 0.1mm, for an area of about 10^-8 m^2 . That's 2000  GPa, which is more than 1600GPa.<br><br>So, even though<br><br><em> I assumed the pencil was really, really thin,<br></em> The graphene strength quoted in the article was not compressive strength<br><em> Anyway, compressive strength is not the real issue here<br></em> We don't know how to make pure, perfect graphene sheets more than a couple of microns across<br>* Graphene is a 2D material, no use for building beams<br><br>This calculation shows that it may not be physically impossible to have such a material. It's just way beyond our current technology, but it may be just an engineering problem, not a problem requiring fundamentally new physics or magic. </p>		</li>

			<p>So, here is how I would look at it.  Assuming a circular ring there would be no bending stress in the ring, just hoop stress.  To calculate this I would look at it as a cylinder under a pressure load.  <br>  <br>The hoop stress in a thin walled cylinder is defined (approximated) by f = p<em>R/t  <br>  <br>Where,  f = hoop stress<br>            p = pressure<br>            R = radius (for this case I will just use the radius of the earth)<br>            t = thickness of the cylinder  <br>  <br>To obtain the pressure, take the weight of a portion of the ring and divide it by the area of that ring.  So, if the ring is 1&quot; wide, then each 1&quot; of the ring will result in a pressure of W/(1 x 1).  Where W = weight of the 1&quot; x 1&quot; segment of the ring.  <br>  <br>So, what is W?  W will be a function of the density of the material and volume of the segment of the ring we are looking at.  Lets assume that the material of the ring is steel.  Then the density of the steel would be approximately:  <br><br>den = 0.28 lb/in^3  <br>  <br>Since the segment of this steel is 1&quot; x 1&quot; x thickness, the weight would be:  <br>  <br>W = den x 1&quot; x 1&quot; x t = 0.28 x t  <br>  <br>the radius of the earth is  <br>  <br>R = 3959 miles = 3959 mi </em> 5280 ft/mi * 12 in/ft = 250842240 inches  <br>  <br>Then the hoop stress in the steel ring would be:  <br>  <br>f = 0.28 x t x 25082240 / t = 70,235,827 psi  <br>  <br>A stainless steel bar (say PH13-8Mo) is good for about 200,000 psi.  <br>  <br>So, what does this tell me and how does it answer your question?  Well, it tells me that no matter how big you make your steel beam, it will fail as the stresses are far, far above the allowables.  Now if you used a 1&quot; x 1&quot; beam, it would fail due to buckling long before you even got to the 200,000 psi.  Even a 1 ft x 1 ft, or 10 ft x 10 ft beam would buckle at much lower stress levels (due to the incredible length of the beam).   <br>  <br>So, I guess my long winded answer is that the beam would buckle, probably causing some tearing of the beam due to post buckled stresses and the whole thing would crash down to earth.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks! Very interesting. Is there any way to predict the spacing of the buckling points? It would only NEED to buckle in one place to find a way to rest on the ground, but it would take 100 hours for the &quot;sound&quot; wave to transmit this information through the rest of the beam, so if it needs to buckle, it's going to do so in lots of places with less lateral displacement. But over the whole ring, it needs remarkably little deformation to get to the ground--about 1mm sideways in alternating directions per km to get to the ground. That's bending, not buckling. My intuition tells me that looks like the beam just falling everywhere at once and being imperceptibly warped to absorb the slight extra length. </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure to be honest.  It's kind of like an infinite beam since it loops and has no beginning and no end.  I'm not sure what the buckling mode would actually look like.  <br>  <br>I would think it would take an &quot;S&quot; shape, but don't know what the wave length would be...  You're intuition may be correct in that it would have such a large wave length that you wouldn't even notice the warp.  But it would collapse and fall to the ground.</p>		</li>

			<p>It is also important to keep in mind that the earth is not perfectly spherical, so its gravitational attraction over the space between the beam and earth would fluctuate. </p>		</li>

			<p>Since gravitational force is not equally spread out along the Earth's surface (stronger some places, weaker other places) then balancing such a structure by itself would be next to impossible &amp; it would be like trying to balance a ball on a crooked and lumpy saddle <br><br><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110406-new-map-earth-gravity-geoid-goce-esa-nasa-science/" target="_blank">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110406-new-map-earth-gravity-geoid-goce-esa-nasa-science/</a></p>		</li>

			<p>A spinning ball doesn't fall from a finger because it has to rotate around the pivot point - the finger - to do so. A spinning ring could fall to earth without rotating apart from around the axis it is already rotating.</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't really matter that gravity isn't constant.  There would still be a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where the ring could be placed around an uneven gravitational well like the earth's.  It would simply have to orbit the planet geosynchronously.<br><br>The problem then would become that a) things on planet earth move, and b) other gravity wells like the sun and the moon exist.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Maybe? <br><br>Somewhat unrelated, but if I did my calculations correctly, it would take ~55 minutes for the steel on the opposite side of earth to begin moving once the point that was disrupted begins to move!<br><br>(Assuming a perfect sphere, not accounting for drag, and assuming the steel will not break or warp because I am horrible at math. Below I'm rounding but I used less rounding in my actual calculations).<br><br>1000 ft = 304 m. Radius of earth=6,378,134 m. Radius of steel ring=6,378,134+304m= 6,378,438. Circumference of steel ring= 6,378,438(2pi) = 40,076,910m = X.  It was at this point I realized I could have just done 304*2pi and added it to the total circumference of the earth.<br><br>Speed of sound through steel = 6000m/s. X/6000 = 6679 seconds = 1 hour 51 minutes. 1 hour 51 minutes/ 2 (because it only has to travel half the circumference) =~55 minutes. </p>		</li>

			<p>Fa i l - break. It would probably break in a few places at the points where it contacts the earth from the impact (don't know any specifics), then the rest of the ring would no longer be supported through compression as it breaks, warps and folds, and fall as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>Is this true though? Id need to whip out the old vector calc book to confirm, but if I remember correctly, this would not be a stable state. If one side is in contact with the surface, it's true that the force on the opposite end would be less, but remember there is more ring on that side because the ring is of center. So gmM/r has a lot more m on the other side, albeit r is greater.</p>		</li>

			<p>In a sphere there's enough more mass on the other side to cancel out the gravity completely (net gravity of 0 from any point inside a sphere). I wouldn't think a ring would work that way. Losing the 3rd dimension, you have a whole lot less more mass on the far side. Been too long since I've used calculus.<br><br><a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath402/kmath402.htm" target="_blank">Saved from doing math by Google!</a> inside a ring, gravity pulls away from the center.</p>		</li>
