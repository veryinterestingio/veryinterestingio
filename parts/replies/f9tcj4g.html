			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious. Would this mean that a pregnant woman who wanted to aim for a more regular or less disturbed sleep schedule would benefit from taking time during the day to lie down? Kind of like exhausting your kids earlier in the day so they actually go to and stay in bed at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works for me. If I'm too active during the day, the baby is doing flip flops all freaking night. If I'm less active during the day, they move more in the day and they are much calmer at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm I’m very curious now too. I’m 8 months pregnant and I work a comfy desk job. My sleep schedule hasn’t been interrupted at all this entire pregnancy. Baby is definitely active between 8-9 pm but when I’m in bed I almost never wake up. I will definitely be looking to see if your theory holds any water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I felt the activity levels go up in the last few months! Couldve just seemed that way because he was so long and took up all the space he could. A week before I was induced he pushed his elbow or knee out so far, there was a pointy lump protruding from my bump. That was a painful one</p></div>		</li>
