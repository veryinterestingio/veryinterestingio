<p>Even if an organism has a trait that is seemingly obsolete, then at the very least, that trait was once useful and is now just a residual characteristic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not necessarily true it could have always been just a characteristic.  As long as a trait doesn't prevent a creature from reproducing the trait will be passed.  The usefulness of the trait is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Good and meh get passed along.  Bad tends to get weeded out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are variations of the origins of major blood vessels that are entirely irrelevant. For instance, in most people the hepatic artery branches off the celiac artery. In a small number of people it comes off the superior mesenteric artery. These variations are meaningless except when doing liver surgery.</p>
<p>There are some variants that are dangerous and cause early death, but most seem entirely silent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's highly unlikely though. </p>
<p>Most of the time we just might not understand why it is beneficial. Or <em>was</em> beneficial. </p>
<p>The chance of an irrelevant trait becoming dominant within an entire species without having any benefits is just ridiculously unlikely. Less likely than a Yahtzee at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the mane is thought to be due to male lion duels over control of prides. The mane helps protect their neck - while big predators don't normally need to worry much about that kind of defense.</p>
<p>So a lion with a mane has an edge over those without - meaning more control over prides and more offspring.</p></div>		</li>
