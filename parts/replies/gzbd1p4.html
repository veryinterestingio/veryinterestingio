			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting this.  I was going to suggest something similar having to do with studies and how the math works to come up with the 95% effective number for vaccines.</p>
<p>You hit all the major points, essentially you can't do the math to come up with the percentage because you don't have a control group to compare to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point! I didn’t see that. Then you are right, a trial could be done be intentional infection. </p>
<p>The problem would then be the external validity. As you only infected young healthy people, you can only make conclusions about young healthy people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still hard to blind a challenge trial too (even assuming you find people willing to give genuine informed consent).</p>
<p>Do you infect 50% with COVID and 50% with the seasonal flu and just tell them they shook off COVID faster? Seasonal flu has the most symptoms in common with (a mild case of) COVID of any disease I'm aware of but even then they aren't the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not impossible, just morally dubious. Also I feel like I’ve been hearing about covid dosing experiments in the UK since last year but haven’t heard much come of it... either they failed to enroll enough people and still haven’t come to any conclusions or the ones I heard about were scrapped.</p></div>		</li>
