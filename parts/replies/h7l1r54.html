			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very good thinking. This is ruled out in the premises of a &quot;workable set of axioms&quot; as the set of axioms needs to be recursively enumerable. If this premise is dropped, Gödel's incompleteness theorem would not be true for precisely this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good observation to make! The theory you get if you assume every true statement about natural numbers as an axiom is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_arithmetic" target="_blank">theory of true arithmetic</a>.
As the OP said there is a technical condition for the incompleteness theorem to apply, which is that the set of axioms must be &quot;recursively enumerable&quot;. This roughly means that there exists some algorithm which you can use to write them down one by one. The theory of true arithmetic doesn't fulfill this condition, so the incompleteness theorem doesn't say anything about this theory!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an example: For some particular computer program P, we can consider the statement &quot;The program P does not halt&quot;. This is a valid mathematical statement (it can be formalized using the notion of Turing machines). For some programs this is trivial to prove or disprove, for example <code>print("Hello world")</code> obviously halts, and <code>while True: pass</code> (Python) obviously does not. Furthermore, we know that if some program P halts then there is a proof of it: We simply execute the program until it halts. However we know that there exist programs that do not halt, so the statement &quot;The program P does not halt&quot; is true, but for which we cannot prove the statement.</p>
<p>The proof of this paradox, that programs exist which do not halt, but we cannot prove they do not halt, is actually quite similar to Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. In short, if every non-halting program is provably non-halting, then there must exist a program H that takes as input another program P, and determines whether P halts or not. We proceed to show a contradiction: If H exists, then we can use it to construct a program Q which takes as input a program P and either halts if P does not halt, or does not halt if P halts. We then evaluate the program Q on itself: If Q(Q) halts, then Q(Q) does not halt. If Q(Q) does not halt, then Q(Q) halts. Both possibilities are contradictions. Therefore the program H must not exist, which implies that there is no way to prove that all non-halting programs are non-halting. I have glossed over some details here, but this is the basic idea.</p>
<p>So to answer your question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean for a statement to be &quot;true&quot; but not a consequence of our axioms?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case particular example, it means we can prove the existence of programs that do not halt, but for which we cannot prove that they do not halt. A natural consequence is that we cannot know which specific programs this applies to, we just know that some such programs exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question is philosophically 'meaty', but it's worth noting that we can sidestep it, because an even stronger version of incompleteness is true:</p>
<p>In fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can never get enough axioms to ensure that for every statement P about numbers, either P is provable or not-P is provable. (Unless you have so many axioms that you can prove P <em>and</em> not-P, for every P.)</p>

<p>This strengthening of Goedel's theorem is due to J Barkley Rosser.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn’t that going overboard? I thought this could be the case even if you can prove P and not-P for <em>at least one</em> P. Does it really have to be for every P?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question, and the source of some philosophical debate. What are the whole numbers? Are they just anything that satisfy the number theory axioms we have at the moment? Or do they have some independent absolute nature?</p>
<p>Most people would say the latter, that there really are infinitely many prime numbers (for instance), and if your axioms don't suffice to prove this then you need stronger axioms. But I personally know people who feel that &quot;whole numbers&quot; are just anything that satisfy whatever axioms we have chosen, and the only true statements about them are the things we can prove from those axioms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Given that numbers existed prior to the axioms defining them, they clearly have some independent nature, at least to me. I'm wondering what an opposing viewpoint might look like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The axioms we use to define whole numbers (usually called natural numbers) actually have a practical application and are not arbitrary. If we stray a little from set theory and move to type theory, these axioms define ways for you to count things in a computer program. We usually define a starting number (sometimes 1 sometimes 0,in this case we are using 0) then we define Nats (natural numbers) to be either 0 or S n where S is a function from Nats to Nats and n is a Nats. And we also give a &quot;induction&quot; property where a given a function P, a proof of P 0 and a proof of  P n -&gt; P S n is a valid proof of for all n : Nats P n. Now we can repeat procedures arbitrarily, which let's us count things, sort things...etc. you can define some other function like addition, subtraction,lcm, gcd,... but all of them only need induction and the successor function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice" target="_blank">Axiom of choice</a> is an example of such an axiom.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" target="_blank">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a> can stand-alone as a very robust axiomatic system itself, providing enough complexity to create real numbers and such.

<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA" target="_blank">Banach-Tarski paradox</a> is an example of a theorem that requires the assumption that the Axiom of choice is true to prove.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Axioms are usually organized in groups, and they describe their own mathematical &quot;domain&quot;, such as for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms" target="_blank">the Peano axioms</a>, which describe natural numbers in a certain way, or these axioms which describe <a href="https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Axiomatic_set_theory" target="_blank">set theory</a>. Each group of axioms defines a mathematical &quot;language&quot;, so to say, and based on them you can prove theorems about the thing they describe. You can, however, for example, describe the natural numbers with set theory[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers" target="_blank">*</a>], and then go on to prove facts about natural numbers using the axioms of set theory.</p>
<p>So, a set of axioms has the purpose to be &quot;self-contained&quot;, so to say, and to rigorously define the mathematical entity it's supposed to define, not necessarily to be able to express <em>any</em> possible mathematical theory or system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any answer to this is unlikely to be useful because:</p>
<p>> are there disjoint sets of mathematical axioms, each of which include whole ..sets of math, but which are separate from our currently chosen axioms?</p>
<p>Yes, there are absolutely different sets of axioms people use as foundations for mathematics. The contentious ones tend to revolve around infinity. In a real sense mathematics is the pursuit of finding what logically follows from a given set of axioms.</p>
<p>When most people think of math they think of things like basic arithmetic functions (addition, multiplication etc.), most of these follow from just about any useful set of axioms, it isn't until you get to the more involved things like calculus (limits) that the choice of axioms starts to matter (and even then outside of the very small number of people thinking about these things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" target="_blank">ZFC</a> or equivalents are pretty much the universal set of axioms).</p></div>		</li>
