			<div class="markdown"><p>As one of the oodles of boomers that hates these policies, I wanna say that it's not all of us.  I've seen CEOs give themselves multi-million dollar bonuses while laying off thousands.  I've seen politicians make policy that funnels billions to their corporate donors and destroy the little guy.  I didn't promote those CEOs and I didn't vote for those politicians.  Somewhere in the 70s, I think, a certain segment ramped up the idea that trickery and greed make money and not making things of real value.  That attitude hasn't gone away.  It's not all of us boomers -- most of us, I think, are on your side and most of us are getting screwed by the same people that are screwing the millennials, the Xs, and the rest of you. </p>
<p>Aim your ire not at boomers but at dickheads of all ages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason boomers get called out so much for the debt is all the reasons you just mentioned and the fact that they are currently blaming all of the worlds problems on millennials. Boomers blame Millennials for all. Everyone else jumps in and kindly points out that the people currently in debt are not at fault for this. It was dropped on them by the boomers.</p></div>		</li>

The boomer generation has been the main economic driving force since the day they were born and they will be until the day they die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that past policies were part of the problem, and yes it isn't completely the boomers doing. Life in the 70s was vastly different than it is now.
One could get a job only in the summer and save up enough to pay for a year of college.
A college education actually meant something.
Working a basic job out of high school was enough to buy a house.
Walking around town asking for work was all you needed to find work. </p>
<p>A lot of boomers still have that mentality, they don't understand the economy and life are completely different.</p>
<p>Concepts one learned in economy 101 don't hold up any more. San Francisco is the perfect example cost of living in town is too high for most people, but they can't afford to leave. So they get second jobs, find roommates, etc, as rent continues to grow.</p>
<p>Now even thinking about going to college gets you into debt. No one can afford rent. Phones are over $1000 for no reason other than companies know you'll go into debt to get one. </p>
<p>Then boomers sit there in the houses they paid off years ago enjoying their retirement on our dime and complain that we're lazy cause we can't afford to leave home.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honstly the more I learn about how businesses are able to get government, and even more so state and local governments to fund the expenses of their business ventures while also keeping 100% of the profits, I just...I get sick, sick, sick sick, until I start turning RED. RED....Red like the color of revolution.  </p>
<p>If WE THE PEOPLE are gonna pay for your new regional distribution center  Mr Megacorp owner...WE THE PEOPLE (the ones who fund the government with money we bleed to earn) are gonna get a fucking cut the the returns of that investment...COMRADE.  </p>
<p>Corporate socialism is has to end!  Its not capitalism if the state is taxing the people to give to the corporations so they can &quot;offshore&quot; the money.</p></div>		</li>
