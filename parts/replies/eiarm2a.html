			<div class="markdown"><p>The definition of an LBA you linked is a non-deterministic TM with a tape as large as the input. It would be more accurate to treat a computer as a TM with a fixed length tape (independent of input size) but this is just equivalent to a DFA in terms of computational power; reaffirming what the parent comment said.</p>
<p>EDIT: Information about why TMs are used instead of DFAs as the model of computation can be found <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/91773/why-is-the-turing-machine-a-popular-model-of-computation" target="_blank">here</a>. Another reason is that when we think of a computer, we think of a machine that can execute an &quot;algorithm&quot; that can be written on paper and DFAs are not strong enough to capture this notion of computability. In fact, the Church-Turing hypothesis is that TMs are computationally equivalent to our intuitive notion of algorithms.</p></div>		</li>
