			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that setting up a plan, &quot;agreeing&quot; with myself to do it, and then when the time comes just doing it without further deliberation as if someone else decided it for me. Otherwise I'll get to the thing that needs doing and I'll second guess myself or make an excuse, and then nothing will get done. I seem to be able to get up, go to work and meet other people's expectations and then totally flake on myself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know I'm there. I know I'm doing it. I just have to pretend I'm not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is way too far down for the comment that actually answers the question asked. Basically the area governing motivation is depressed too and not just the mood. Its believed that certain anti-depressants cause suicidal tendencies early in treatment because the person gets their motivation back before the mood is affected and thus gets motivated to do something they didnt have the motivation to do before but wanted to. </p></div>		</li>
