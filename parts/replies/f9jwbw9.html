			<div class="markdown"><p>If two lasers propagate alongside each other you just add up the em-fields. This will generate a beat frequency. Like it always does with waves. Look at the (Nobel prize winning) frequency comb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, I misspoke in my comment. But the frequencies won't add because the photons will just pass through each other. There will not be any up or down conversion process. You won't get a sustained wave of another frequency. You won't see red and green laser light become yellow orange laser light for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frequencies will add up during the time the photons pass each other (depending on the phase of the two coherent waves). It's just the sum of two oscillators. There won't be scattering of photons, but there will be a beat frequency. You will get a sustained wave of another frequency during the time both lasers are on top of each other. This is called interference. Two lasers produce an interference pattern. Look at the Michelson-Morley experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in a linear medium, it should beat, right? Beats are just interference. Though it would be a beat frequency -- not an actual frequency that you would see in a fourier decomposition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's right, see my other comment.
I should have said that while it beats this won't lead to frequency mixing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A comment: you can just try this with a green and red laser pointer. The ratio of frequencies is nearly a factor of 2. You won't observe beating.</p>
<p>Edit: I mean up or down conversion of light frequencies, not beating.</p></div>		</li>
