			<div class="markdown"><p>We often take advantage of silicon's transparency to IR light to align multiple layers of features in microprocessor fabrication between the front and back sides of the wafer.</p>
<p>Our own vision falls off with light around 0.7 microns in wavelength, and to see through silicon you need light of 1.1 micron wavelength, so you have to use a camera that picks up infrared light in addition to an infrared light source. With germanium you need to go a bit deeper like you said, to 1.8 micron photons.</p>
<p>But in this case it isn't too hard to pick up the infrared light, because this is still very &quot;near infrared&quot;; very close to our visible range, so the photons each have quite a bit of energy and we don't get too worried about needing to have a super-sensitive and noise-free detector like we do for thermal infrared (very &quot;far&quot; infrared, quite distant from visible spectrum, around 8 - 15 microns in wavelength, this is what FLIR sensors see).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, once you get outside of the range of InGaAs cameras, you are dealing with the same issues as you do in the LWIR range. For 2-5 microns you need InSb cooled cameras, which are just as expensive as the HCT cameras used for the 8-12 micron region. You can also used microbolometer detector arrays but they aren't as sensitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The range we call &quot;infrared&quot; is quite expansive. It includes the wavelengths that your TV remotes use to talk to your TV (so close to the visible spectrum that your cell phone camera can often pick it up), all the way down to the much longer wavelengths that our bodies emit due to heat.</p>
<p>Glass is transparent to the infrared spectrum that is close to the visible range, but it does not pass the portion that is very far from the visible range.</p>
<p>To give a numerical range here, visible light occupies the region of about 0.4 to 0.7 microns in wavelength. That's it, just this tiny little 0.3 micron window. The infrared light that TV remotes and security cameras use is around 0.8 - 0.9 microns, so it's literally just the tiiiiniest bit beyond what we can see with our eyes. Thermal photons, on the other hand, are around 10 – 30 times longer in wavelength, spanning from around 8 to 25 microns. Our thermal imagers that detect body heat are sensitive to the range of around 8 – 14 microns. </p>
<p>Beyond this region we leave the &quot;thermal photon&quot; range and enter the &quot;microwave&quot; range that our cellphones and routers emit to send signals and our microwaves emit (in far larger quantities) to heat food.</p>
<p>Glass stops being transparent to wavelengths longer than 3 microns, which is the problem you mentioned.</p>
<p>If you search Google images for &quot;security camera infrared&quot; and &quot;thermal imaging&quot; you will see that the images look very different. </p>
<p>This is because security cameras actually use infrared light emitters (usually a bunch of infrared LEDs) in order to light up the area that they are watching. Thermal imaging relies on thermal radiation emitted from the objects themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could, but it would be expensive. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit#Spectrum_losses" target="_blank">the majority of the Sun's energy is emitted at wavelengths shorter than 1.8 µm</a> so it actually wouldn't work well. Better to just use frosted glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we also double pane it and fill it with heavier, non lethal gasses, or maybe not even at all, though I don't know how well glass stands to a vaccum. Less collisions lead to less energy transfer which leads to less interference by outside temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it may not be that the plastic is transparent to IR but opaque to visible.  It may simply be that the LED behind it is only emitting IR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not germanium; it's just a darkened/translucent piece of plastic for aesthetics. On the side of your remote it's just an infrared LED anyway and doesn't need a filter.</p>
<p>But as a side note an infrared receiver like in your TV will also work with a white or red LED; doesn't need to be infrared but they are tuned to be most sensitive to that wavelength as a means of avoiding interference with more typical light sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's opaque to visible light and not IR though. I'm not sure exactly what pigments they use, but it definitely works like that.</p>
<p>In general &quot;true black&quot; inks will be opaque to IR, but multiple colored inks making a black color won't be. On an inkjet printer, if you print CMY you get a muddy black that is transparent to IR, while if you print K you get true black that is opaque to IR. I made a physical challenge out of this idea once!</p>
<p>Other things that work: fully exposed/developed color photo film, black permanent marker.</p></div>		</li>
