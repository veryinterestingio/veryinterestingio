			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it was almost exclusively Small tortoiseshells. </p>
<p>Edit. I just read in another comment here that Small tortoiseshells sometimes hibernate in houses so maybe my room seemed like a good place for that even though it wasn't dark at all. Now I'm wondering how many of those dead butterflies were actually just hibernating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We saw a bunch of butterflies in some bar (might have been a resort in Jamaica) where the butterflies followed around the syrup bottles and spills. Could have had a perfect scenario that they could sense it from outside and were attracted</p></div>		</li>
