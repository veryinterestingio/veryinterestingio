			<div class="markdown"><p>The scientific information about cannabis growing so we will identify scientific misconceptions. The requirement of plants for phosphorus, cannabis is considered to be hungry for phosphorus (P), we found that the requirement of this plant for P is not any different for any other plant. Though the optimal amount of P is still considered to be high.</p>
<p>Cultivation outdoors and indoors each have their own benefits and detractions. One of the considerations is energy demand. Indoor requires a high amount of energy, but you can regulate growing conditions, but the benefit is that it can be used to  create a standardization of the chemical profile of the plant. A major issue in cannabis cultivation is the standardization of the profile of cannabinoids and terpenes and other secondary metabolites. The concentration of the cannabinoids and terpenes and the ratio between them has specific medical effects (entourage effect). It is much easier to achieve standardization in the chemical profile under steady environmental conditions. These can be best achieved in indoor cultivation. What will determine the outdoor v. indoor cultivation in the future will be a matter of cost, among other determining factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have probably heard the names of different marijuana &quot;strains,&quot; even going back to the past with names like &quot;Acapulco Gold&quot; and the present with hundreds - check out leaf.ly to see how many there are.</p>
<p>Each of these strains has a different chemical profile, and (within broad categories) a different effect on the mind and body. This is true for both indoor- and outdoor-grown marijuana, and we are not talking subtle differences. Some can give you panic attacks and some can put you to sleep.</p>
<p>Any specific medical application would require a highly specific chemical profile. It is tremendously hard to do this. New strains are created by crossbreeding others. For growers, this is always a shot in the dark although they can create particular qualities. </p>
<p>That is very different from creating a highly specific chemical profile. I don't think there is any way to do that naturally.</p>
<p>But if a scientist can isolate all of the dozens of chemicals, they can make their own very specific combinations in the hopes of hitting on one that can do some particular thing.</p>
<p>Marijuana won't be a mature or scientific medicine until that can be sorted out - but that's exactly what OP is doing!</p>
<p>I believe that the future of medical marijuana lies in that kind of synthesis or in genetically-engineered plants. As it is, you might as well be trying to swat a fly with a sledgehammer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeast produces different byproducts at different temperatures. It's actually very sensitive to temps in that respect.  Would you say that there are environmental controls that can directly fine tune the profiles similarly? Or is cannabis more specific in its phenotypy?</p></div>		</li>
