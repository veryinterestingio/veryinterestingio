<p>Why? Is there a law requiring someone who got a placebo from getting a real vaccine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you can always withdraw consent, but the study is multiple years long to see how long the immunity lasts. You'd confound the data by getting a vaccine if you're in the study and in the placebo arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need two years of data on the vaccinated to know actual long-term side effects as well as how long the vaccination lasts. And if the vaccinated group has to wait two years, the placebo group does too.</p>
<p>No law. Just part of staying in the Phase 3 study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It would also be hard to get approval (by competent authority and ethical committee) for your protocol. Our favourite way to do offer these participants tge drug is via an open-label extension trial: people who participated to the shorter placebo-controlled 'main trial' get the opportunity to enroll in a longer trial without placebo: all participants get the drug. It's a win-win situation: you keep on getting treatment until the drug is approved and the company has long-term safety data.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this for all of the different vaccine trials?  Or just a specific one?  I'd like to read more on this but nothing is coming up on Google for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are still two outstanding questions that require the delay:
1) Is the vaccine effective for a longer period or only for a short period? The placebo group is needed to avoid confusing data that makes it unclear on the long-term effects of the vaccine.
2) Is the vaccine safe over a longer time period? While all indications are that it is safe, there is still risk of side-effects showing up after a year or more. Without the placebo group, it will be hard to tell if the vaccine is the cause or other factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further to your point, I understand most of the companies have been producing the vaccine as fast as possible during the trials - even though it could mean destroying millions of doses if the trials are unsuccessful.</p>
<p>By producing millions of doses before the vaccine is safe, it means rollout can start immediately after it is approved for use. If mass production only started after approval, the delay would be weeks or months after approval.</p>
<p>The disadvantage would be the wasted resources mass producing a useless of dangerous vaccine if the trials were unsuccessful, but I'd argue this is insignificant compared to the potential benefit of compressing timeline for mass vaccination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally phase 2 establishes safety and phase 3 is all about efficacy, or?</p>
<p>Update: According to wikipedia (with a few missing citations), safety is usually established in phases 1 and 2. (But of course, if safety issues are identified in phase 3 then this would disqualify the drug as much as efficacy issues.)</p>
<p>But the phase 3 trials can continue until and even after approval is given so that patients can have access to the drug (after signing a trial waiver). So I guess that answers OP's question.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phase III is about efficacy <em>in addition to</em> safety whereas phase I and II are only about safety (and finding the right dose). If a vaccine candidate ends up killing 1 in 5000 then a trial with 1000 people is unlikely to find that. But if you vaccinate the whole world with it you kill a million people.</p>
<p>Even beyond phase III people keep watching for possible side effects in vaccinated people, because 1 in 100,000 would still be a concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phase 2 is about efficacy too. 2 and 3 usually have similar primary efficacy/safety endpoints. There’s also phase IV which is post marketing monitoring, that’s what you’re referring to at the end</p></div>		</li>
