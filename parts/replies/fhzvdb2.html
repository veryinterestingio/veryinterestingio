			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, same here in Ireland.  Every card, from my perspective, it treated the exact same.  Behind the scenes they don't appear to be, so the card readers are likely clever enough to know which cards are debit and which credit.</p>
<p>I've only seen the question being asked when in the US.  It somewhat confounds me that in the US they are generally so, well, backward with regard to credit/debit cards.  Different laws, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>They are. I used to write software to test those machines. There's a lot of communication between both the card and the terminal to pass all sorts of information. You can tell from the card number which issuer it is (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) but beyond that the card and the terminal have to agree what kind of applet the card has. </p>
<p>If it's contactless,they basically shout at each other what they can both do, if it's contact the terminal effectively asks it one after the other &quot; Do you speak visa credit? Do you speak mastercard credit? Do you speak visa debit? Do you speak Amex? Do you speak discover?&quot; and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>But yeah, they're clever enough to be able to tell, they just do it in the dumbest way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does actually determining if the card is genuine work? If I were designing it I'd have the terminal generate a random string + timestamp, have the card encrypt/sign with its private key, and the CC company verify with the public key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Germany and everyone here has what is called an EC Card, and some/most people also have credit cards but the later are usually not used in daily lives. You just pay for stuff with your EC card (or cash).</p>
<p>What does checkings, savings, curremt etc mean, and which one are EC, credit cards etc? </p>
<p>For clarification: EC cards immerdiately take the money from your bank account, credit cards at the end of the month instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What card do you use to access your bank account at an ATM?</p>
<p>That's what a debit card is. But many places you can also use them to pay for things, often with lower fees for merchants than credit cards have. Some places (in Canada, at least) only take debit or cash in order to avoid the credit card fees.</p>
<p>Are EC cards directly connected to your bank account or do they have stored value that you reload (maybe automatically)?</p>
<p>I think last time someone mentioned them they sounded similar to IC cards in Japan, which are most often used for transit but can be used for some other things too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true anymore, with the DKB you normally would use the credit card since it's much more versatile and has lower fees compared to the EC card. I actually never had a terminal specify how to pay within Europe or China, I've only seen it in the US and Sometimes Canada</p></div>		</li>
