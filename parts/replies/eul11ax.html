			<div class="markdown"><p>No, energy is wasted by pushing against the ground in the very moment the sphere should expand as fast as possible to all directions. If i'm not mistake, it will also push up more than it does sideways, it would not be perfect semisphere, path of least resistance is still in effect. You have the whole Earth to push against on the other side and atmosphere and space on the other.</p>
<p>Also, i'm not sure but i think that shockwaves that travel parallel across the ground will also be go up, all the reflections that bounce from the ground will not go down, hills etc will also guide it up, never down...Unless we  explode it above you, then everything gets hit and the direction of the entire bottom half of the semisphere points directly at the target with no obstructions, no reflections and no losses. With ground detonation, you get only a &quot;band&quot; of that hemisphere to hit ground, the rest is going up and away.</p></div>		</li>
