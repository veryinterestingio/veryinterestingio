<p>Proxima will live much longer than the sun</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to put some hard numbers here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stellar lifetime scales as roughly Mass^-2.5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proxima Centauri is approximately 12% the mass of our Sun</p>
</li>
<li>That means the lifetime of Proxima Centauri will be 0.12^-2.5 = 200 times longer than our Sun</li>
</ul>
<p>So if the Sun's total lifetime is somewhere around 10 billion years, we can expect that Proxima Centauri will stick around for some 2 <em>trillion</em> years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, to be clear, Lifetime = Mass^-2.5 is only an approximation, and one that makes the explicit assumption that the total fraction of hydrogen fused is the same for each star. </p>
<p>In actuality, small red dwarfs like Proxima Centauri are fully convective (our Sun is only convective in its outer region), which means the core can be more easily replenished with fresh hydrogen, meaning it burns for longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was starting to take &quot;real&quot; physics in college the professor calculated the size of the observable universe for us, but he dropped a factor of 2 along the way. I pointed this out, and he replied. &quot;the number has 26 zeros in it, the 2 doesn't matter&quot;..... Later that week I asked if he was a theoretical or experimental physicist to another prof. They responded that he was absolutely experimental, and that a theorist would have felt that way about the zeros, not the two. Given the scale of the universe 8 VS 4 billion is almost infinitely longer than we live so the fact we care about the two is mind boggling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a point at which decreasing the mass of a star tips it over to being fully convective. Sol is not fully convective, so even when the hydrogen in the core is depleted, something like 80% (I may be mistaken in my recollection of that number, I can't find a source to refer to) of the the sun's hydrogen will remain unfused. Proxima C may be small enough to be fully convective, in which case 2 trillion would be a lower end estimation at the very least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So i went down the wikipedia rabbit hole and ended up reading about super giants, e.g. UY Scuti. How can a star with a diameter of ~1,700 sun radii, have only ~10x the sun's mass?!? How is there enough pressure/density for fusion to occur?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Giant stars aren't created as giants. They're formed on the main sequence, and then after they burn out of hydrogen in their core, they expand outwards as they begin to fuse hydrogen in their shells. Some Supergiants have repeated this process for helium, carbon, etc. and are fusing elements all the way up to iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the center is still enormously dense (what with that 10x Sols mass all gravitying away) its mainly an enormously tenous outer layer that causes the size. So our suns edge is quite defined but UY Scuti would be very billowy around the edges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some issues with setting up shop around a red dwarf star, if you're looking for a planet to colonize.</p>
<p>The Goldilocks zone is much smaller, meaning you have less chance of finding an appropriate planet.  </p>
<p>The Goldilocks zone of red dwarfs are close enough to the star that the planet would most likely be tidally locked and subject to the full force of solar flares.  Yikes.  </p>

<p>An artificial habitat may be the only option for colonizing a red dwarf system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more you read about astrophysics, the more insane it is. Most stars undergo what's called a &quot;helium flash&quot; later in their life where essentially they undergo a runaway fusion reaction in their core that briefly produces more power than all of the other stars in the galaxy combined. And none of this energy even reaches the surface - instead it all goes into what's essentially a huge phase transition of the core.</p></div>		</li>
