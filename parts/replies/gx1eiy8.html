			<div class="markdown"><p>^^Yes. The hard part is kids cost money and there are people who understand they literally couldn't afford to properly care for a child. This on top of not being paid enough to care properly for themselves long term without any chance at retirement. It's a multi facted problem, and is going to take more than just a temporary band-aid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. The point I was trying to make is that it is the restructure that is/will be painful, not necessarily the end result.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For people living in counties with sovereign fiat currencies the limiting factors are the real resources to care for an aging population: educated caregivers, care facilities, healthcare facilities, etc.   Such governments can always afford anything denominated in the currency they issue and revenue is never an issue, the existence of the things needed (read: inflation) is what looms over our heads, not any inability to pay for things.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unwillingness to pay is another issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is ratio of old to young, more so than total population. There will be fewer people yes but it will be fewer young people specifically, who can contribute, and the same amount of old people who canâ€™t. </p>
<p>Yes old people die eventually but then young people become old and take their place. And if the birth rate stays below replacement, even fewer babies to become young people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, but there are two issues: governments have borrowed money on the assumption that a growing population will lead to a growing economy, and so a growing tax income to pay off those debts. Secondly, during the period when the population is shrinking there are more old people than young and working people. For a society built on a certain ratio that will be a problem with fewer working age people to pay for and look after the old.</p>
<p>Of course there will also be fewer children to pay for and look after but nobody ever seems to mention that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Less consumption is also a problem in itself - this means companies managing to sell less products and services, seeing lower profits and eventually having to cut back the workforce or even close the business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, young working people today don't count on social security still being around when they retire. You have to take control of your own retirement and contribute to a 401k/IRA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a common accusation but at least in regards to population growth it isn't but you do need to actively manage demographic shifts. Most developed countries have a massive demographic imbalance as there was a huge baby boom in the post war years followed by the introduction of widespread contraception and increasing female independence causing birthrates to decline pretty sharply. This happened alongside significant improvements in life expectancy, meaning that older generation are now living for longer in retirement with a smaller tax base supporting them. Most countries use immigration to address this imbalance which is sensible as it minimises the tax burdon on younger generations and lowers the need to start cutting services for older citizens.</p>
<p>So the obvious question arises: isn't this an exponential problem? What happens when the next generation get older, won't we need even more people to support them and on and on? Well no because in a normal population distribution there should naturally be many more taxpayers supporting retirees if birth/immigration/death rates are relatively steady. <a href="https://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=https://d2mvzyuse3lwjc.cloudfront.net/doc/en/UserGuide/images/Population_Pyramid_Graph/Population_Pyramid_Graph.png?v%3D83538&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.originlab.com/doc/Origin-Help/Population-Pyramid-Graph&amp;tbnid=ion0kQfInVvliM&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=ztgHo8-_lXqSvM&amp;w=440&amp;h=300&amp;source=sh/x/im" target="_blank">Think of a population pyramid</a> - the chance of death increases as people age so it's always going to have a skinnier top. The issue is that so many significant demographic changes happened within a couple of generations which created a &quot;glut&quot; in the pyramid that needs to work its way through and be balanced with birth rates/immigration. A balance can be achieved that doesn't rely on exponential growth, or even any growth, once a more normal distribution has been achieved.</p></div>		</li>
