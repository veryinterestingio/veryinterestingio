			<div class="markdown"><p>A better question then: how do we even know that lets say 100km under that cover of turbulent atmosphere there isn't a big planet composed of similar stuff as earth? If we can't see under that initial atmosphere, how are we certain of anything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know the densities of the planets in our solar system. </p>
<p>Earth, Mercury and Venus are all quite dense, over 5 tonnes per cubic meter. Mars is slightly lower at just under 4 tonnes per cubic meter. </p>
<p>Pluto and other dwarf planets are around 2 tonnes per cubic meter. </p>
<p>Jupiter has a density of only 1.3 tonnes per cubic meter. Saturn is 0.7 tonnes (for reference, 1 cubic meter of water is one tonne, Saturn is less dense than water) </p>
<p>We know the gas giants are made of gas because of this.</p></div>		</li>
