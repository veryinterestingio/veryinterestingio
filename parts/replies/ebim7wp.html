			<div class="markdown"><p>We still have comets. Everything indicates that comets have a relatively short lifespan - something like a few tens of thousands of years - after which they will either be consumed by the sun or blown apart by radiation. There is no explanation why there are still comets in our solar system, billions of years after its formation. But there are, and there's a lot of them. So in the 1960s, Oort proposed a cloud of maybe a few billion comets that would occasionally bump into each other and knock a new comet towards the sun. </p>
<p>So it's pretty theoretical. We don't know if it's there or not, and we have no way of knowing. We just don't have a good explanation for the continued existence of comets, and science has kind of settled on the existence of the Oort cloud as a reasonable guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are comets (some famous, like Hale-Bopp) that we can see for periods of time as they pass closer to the Sun, but then they fly back out into the Oort cloud where we can't see them. We only know their trajectory based on when we last saw them.</p>
<p>For comparison, Pluto is only a few pixels on a Hubble image. The Oort cloud is much farther, and the objects in it are much smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if we're talking about &quot;every&quot; star it's probably not true.</p>
<p>Hyper Velocity stars ejected from binary pairs by orbiting too close to the galactic center would be highly unlikely to have something similar to our Oort cloud. But if we're talking about &quot;most&quot; stars then yes, it's quite likely most stars have their own collection of orbiting comets and asteroids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't one of the explanations for Tabby's Star (and another one like it) basically that there is an unevenly distributed Oort cloud (or I guess just dust/small bits of matter in general)?</p>
<p>Obviously that's not affirmative evidence of extrasolar Oort clouds, but it's possible, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems to me that what we could be seeing with Tabby’s star is the aftermath of a planetary collision - maybe something like what formed our moon - somewhere in her orbit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible. But remember that is only a theory if what causes the fluctuations from Tabby's star.</p>
<p>As someone else pointed out, we do not even have a way to directly detect our own Oort cloud, so the chances of detecting one somewhere else are slim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well theres one thing that make detection of an uneven Oort cloud easier in extra solar regions. You are having the star as a flashlight directly behind the dust. So fluctuations in radiation output would be much more noticeable.</p>
<p>Which is the opposite with our Oort cloud. To see it the dust would have to block light of a stars light-years away, with miniscule amount of radiation.</p>
<p>But that would require the Oort cloud to actually be dense enough to cause a noticeable variation.</p>
<p>Much more likely is a planetary collision with a big planet. Like two Jupiter's colliding would be able to dim the lights going our direction by 20% and would cause aperiodic dimming as the planets reform/disperse.</p>
<p>Kinda like we can easily see the pillars of creation with telescopes, but if you were somewhere inside you'd hardly notice.</p></div>		</li>
