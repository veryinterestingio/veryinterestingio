			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way (at least in some countries that have very low taxes for winnings) is winning lottery tickets.</p>
<p>So you win say, $500,000 at the lottery, scratch cards, or whatever. You go to the local mobster who will give you $600,000 for that ticket deposited in some tax haven. He goes and cashes it in himself. He just laundered $500,000, all clear, and it only cost him $100,000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laundering $600K is trivial. Although not trivial enough for me to trade $600K in black money for $500K in white money. I'd, hypothetically, ask for at least $800-900K for $500K of legit money if in the US.</p>
<p>If you do it reasonably well, you are not going to be bothered for anything less than $1mn.</p>
<p>Imagine you are 30. $600K is just around $20k/year for the next 30 years of your life. Spend it slowly on improving your life.</p></div>		</li>
