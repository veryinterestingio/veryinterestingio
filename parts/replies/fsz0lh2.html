			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s pretty amazing. -160dBm is around 1x10^-19 watts. Amazing they can pick signal out of the noise at that level it has to be below the noise floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>could they instruct it to start doubling up the bits it sends , effectively reducing the rate to 1/2 ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, I forgot about OSIRIS-Rex. They actually performed a rehearsal of the sample collection of the asteroid, dipping the probe down to 65m from the surface and accelerating away again. All the crap going on, it was easy for people to miss that happening in April of this year. I wonder when they will finally go down for the sample collection.</p></div>		</li>
