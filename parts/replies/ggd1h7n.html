			<div class="markdown"><p>Some clarifications for the layman. BIOS means basic input/output system and generally refers to the software that is installed in the motherboard. It helps get all the hardware up and running. (Technically this is firmware, not software, but for the purposes of this explanation, they’re similar enough)</p>
<p>ATX means Advanced Technology eXtended. It’s a standard for motherboards and power supplies and computer cases. Part of it, as mentioned by OP, specifies a 5 volt connections the motherboard that keeps it powered even when the system is “off”. This is often why some tech support places say to shut off your computer and unplug it for 30 seconds or a minute. It’s to stop that trickle of power and to make sure the capacitors (think little batteries that store a charge for a short time) drain. This ensures the whole system is actually 100% off and starting fresh. </p>
<p>POST means power on self test. For some of the older people, remember when you turn on your computer and you’d see a black screen with white letters that seemed to count upwards and output a few lines of text when you started the computer? That’s the POST - it’s checking the cpu (processor) ram (memory) and storage to verify they’re all there and working at a basic level. Once that completes, the computer switches to loading the operating system (OS) like Windows, Linux or Mac OS. On modern computers, POST is usually hidden by some sort of image. On the Mac, it’s that white Apple logo. </p>
<p>Hope that helps clarify some of OPs post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not old, I remember I got my first computer back in 2006 that had Gigabyte 945P S3 Motherboard and it had that scary looking POST screen. I think it’s from like 2010 that those screens went away. I always was admiring those asus rog startup splash screens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer OP's question, no, a PC that has been restarted doesn't fully shut down and then boot back up in the process.</p>
<p>The software processes that it was running do stop, so that it effectively starts fresh as if it <em>had</em> fully shut down, but it never actually stops supplying power to its parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stands for “Advanced Technology eXtended”, and it’s a type of configuration specification for motherboards and power supplies in your computer.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, also for the cases of computers. It’s the way that those three items are designed to work together in both physically fitting together as well as communicating with one another through having the correct connections for data/power transfer between them all for all of their different tasks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ATX is a form factor specification that attempts to standardize certain computer components. If you've ever gone shopping for parts to build a PC, you'll see it everywhere. Most commonly, it is used to describe the size of the motherboard and the location of certain components on it (specifically, where the I/O ports are located), the power supply (PSU), and the 20/24-pin power connector that interfaces the PSU to the rest of the system. There may be more aspects of the spec, but that is what I'm familiar with.</p>
<p>I think they're referring to the low power standby state implemented by ATX PSUs. The 24 pin connector includes a 5V pin that is always on whenever the PSU is plugged in, and there is another pin called PS_ON that must be tied to ground to turn the PSU all the way on (to power up the main 3V, 5V, and 12V rails). This allows connected hardware (the computer main board and its BIOS, in this case) to enter and exit a low power standby state by connecting and disconnecting the PS_ON pin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WarmBiscuit  said what it is, but the easiest answer is that it's a standard size for motherboards. Motherboards come in sizes like ATX (big) Micro ATX (medium), Mini ITX (small) etc. The most common cases used for typical PC/Mac computers (the ones with a separate tower, monitor etc.), like you see on store shelves usually fit either an ATX or Micro ATX. </p>
<p>These motherboards are designed to universally fit certain types of components, such as hard drives, power supplies, and GPUs (graphics processing unit, or graphics/video card). Other components, such as RAM memory cards or CPUs, will work with a range of models of motherboards. </p>
<p>To give an example, if I wanted to upgrade my computer, and bought a new, faster CPU, I would likely need to get a new Micro ATX motherboard and RAM, but I could use my current case, power supply, hard drives, disc drive, and GPU, if I didn't want to upgrade them at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a little more clear about the &quot;Residual current&quot; in the power supply for anyone wondering, it's stored current inside capacitors - Basically little batteries that discharge all of what they have stored almost instantly. Accidentally touching one of those would be less like a static shock and more like jamming your fingers into a power outlet, if only for a moment. NEVER open up a PSU unless you've got the correct training and safety equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, yet discharging is not instant, so if you know what you're doing then you're already measuring for 0 energy and not trusting some calculation based on 5 time constants for an RC circuit.</p>
<p>There might be an issue with the connection between the cap and the resistor, so, you measure.</p></div>		</li>
