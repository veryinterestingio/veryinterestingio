<p>I'll have to disagree with you on this one.  This is how GPT-3 generates text, not an author.  The process is a bit more complex (small C) than that.  AND i FOUND IT!  Woohoo!  Last, very last in a long long list of YouTube channels... Vi Hart.  This is such an excellent rant, exploration, essay, on the creative process.  If Stravinski gets too irritating, skip forwards to about the 10-minute mark.  Her description of the infinity trees and infinite library of choices, that's I think more along the lines of the creative process.  At least for me anyway.  You can stay on those time-worn paths and reliably crank out beautiful things, but with time one should blaze new trails, which will seem wrong at first, but someone with mastery and intuition can find the branches that lead to new lands.</p>
