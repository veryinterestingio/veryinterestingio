			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so SMB3 didn’t have the same space limitation of most other NES games? What was the expanded cartridge size? I thought the original was around 60KB or something like that, but not exactly sure on numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to crack open an NES cartridge, inside you'd find a circuit board. That means that not only does an NES cartridge contain the software for the game, it can also carry with it its own hardware. That means that over the years, clever engineers could stick hardware into the game cartridge to help make the games more advanced.</p>
<p>A good example of this is Star Fox on SNES. SNES was also cartridge based, and Star Fox had special hardware in the cartridge to do 3D graphics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's...a LOT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hardware changes as they relate to cartridge memory capacity are important but are not the most important. The most important cause for the observation is that developers had more time to build toolsets and gain expertise with the hardware and programming methods to.maximize the hardware.</p>
<p>When they wrote smb they were riding a bike without pedals or handlebars. By the time smb3 was written they had added pedals and handlebars and already rode the bike several dozen times. They were practiced and knew another more about how to use the platform and had built supportive design tools.</p>
<p>Also their dev environments were better too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. That's why the models in Super Mario 64 DS look so much better than the original, even though the actual amount of polygons is about the same.</p></div>		</li>
