			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna say if it's strong enough to slow the spin at all it's probably going to stop it immediately no matter what and not gradually. Like a False (0) True (1) statement its gravity pull either false 0 and there is no effect on the spin on the planet at all or its 1 and it's fully effecting the planet and stopping it, destroying it, or pulling it away from the star. But honestly who knows I don't think that's ever been observed.</p></div>		</li>
