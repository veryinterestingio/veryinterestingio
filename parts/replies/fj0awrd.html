			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally in pneumonia, unless it is involving both lungs or the person's lungs are already damaged, this inflammatory effect is helpful to resolve the infection.  There are multiple examples of why does the body do this?  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anaphylactic reaction to a bee sting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart continues to want to pump harder and faster despite a heart attack - injuring the heart more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persisting vomiting and diarrhea despite dehydration.</p>
</li>
<li>Compartment syndrome where the swelling from injury causes damage to the surrounding tissue because the fascia can not expand.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are outlying events for which the body has a usual compensatory mechanism - except the mechanism itself causes damage.  The body triggers a reaction but there is nothing to limit the response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to remember when you ask why something happens in our bodies that an acceptable reason is that it didn't kill everyone it can happen to. Inflammatory reactions can be useful and over reactions don't kill enough people to breed it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it's an equivocation when the term &quot;pneumonia&quot;, especially to the layperson, doesn't specifically mean an infection due to S. pneumoniae.</p>
<p>It's like talking about &quot;the cold virus&quot; when there are about 160 rhinoviruses that cause &quot;the cold&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
