			<div class="markdown"><p>My son was born with one on his cheek. Doc told us the same, that it would have to b3 surgically removed. We wrapped one of my wife's hairs around it to choke of its blood supply and it fell off after awhile. You can still kinda see the skin is sorta different around where it used to be even though he's 5 now.</p></div>		</li>
