			<div class="markdown"><p>So, related question thats not exactly the same. During exercise/heat, can your body remove water from the bladder once its already there? The situation i am thinking of, is you've drunk a bunch of water but have to pee during a hike in hot weather. You're sweating and out of water. If you hold your pee, will that help resist dehydration? Or once it's processed into the bladder, there's no going back? (This was an argument I once had with my dad...hahaha)</p>
<p>Edit: reading comments below, it sounds like you can't resorb water once its in the bladder, and that's the kidneys function. Any help confirming this is still appreciated though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite a doctor yet but just finished the renal module in med school. You cannot reabsorb any significant amount of water from your bladder. Your kidneys are full of incredibly specialized, very impressively fine-tuned structures that closely regulate how much urine you excrete and the exact salt content of that urine in order to keep fluid/electrolyte levels in your blood constant. Because of this you can make urine that's extremely dilute (almost entirely water) or extremely concentrated depending on your fluid intake and diet. If your bladder passively absorbed water back into your system it'd completely undo everything the kidneys spent all that time and energy doing. </p>
<p>It seems like there are a lot of actual urologists in this thread, though. So if I'm missing something I'd love to learn about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluid regulation is primarily achieved by the kidney. Once the urine exits the tubules of the kidney, my understanding is that it is made. If you become dehydrated your body's main defense is tell your kidney to preserve as much water and volume as possible and to stimulate your brain to provoke feelings to thirst (ie force you to drink). But you won't resorb fluid from the bladder in any significant way from the bladder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I found this on bladder permeability in mammals:<br />

I also found this thread:<br />

<p>I also found these articles about the Loop of Henle since drugs like lasix act on it:<br />

<p>If you think about it for a second, it's quite possible that the urine could be quite salty if you're eating a lot of salty foods. If <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/axqtel/why_dont_we_just_boil_seawater_to_get_freshwater/" target="_blank">it's expensive to boil saltwater to get freshwater</a>, it would make sense that it would be more energy intensive to absorb more water, which is basically what the r/askscience thread I linked about reabsorbing water from urine says, that our body strives a balance between water loss and energy consumption.</p></div>		</li>
