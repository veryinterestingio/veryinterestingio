			<div class="markdown"><p>I was brought into a power station for work once and they gave us a tour. The generators (at this place at least) have multiple turbines at increasingly smaller sizes and faster speeds. Apparently the smallest one spins so fast and is so hard to get to speed it takes 48 hours to actually turn them on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they use generators like that for base power needs, the amount that they will always generate. There are also generators for peak loads that are easier to start and stop, usually gas turbines. The base generators are more efficient but when you need extra power the peak generators get the job done. The trick is to have small peaks!</p></div>		</li>
