			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you're not hungry while using meth. So when you come down, you seek out high calorie foods -- candy, soda, etc. because you have starved your body for a few days/weeks. This excessive sugar is bad for teeth, muscles, kidneys, brain, etc. Meth damages so much more than teeth. It can cause life long , life changing physical and mental problems.</p></div>		</li>

Like one has this constant nervous tick where he snaps his fingers all the time, another is legit so paranoid he‚Äôs had to be put on meds for it..meth isn‚Äôt a drug it‚Äôs just a straight up poison.</p></div>		</li>
