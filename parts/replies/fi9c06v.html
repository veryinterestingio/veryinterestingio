			<div class="markdown"><p>For the average person password lockers are WAY better than trying to remember passwords. The fact that you can even remember your passwords inherently makes them weak. Using real words or numbers significant to you make your password way easier to crack. Another cardinal sin is reusing passwords. </p>
<p>With a password manager, you can have genuinely random passwords and never use the same one twice. I was worried about how complicated it would be when I first started, but now I couldn’t imagine not using it. Beyond making your passwords strong, it also makes life way easier for you since you never have to remember, or even type a password again. You just need to make sure you know / write down (and lock up) your master password. Once you have it set up, logging into things is as simple as using your Face ID. I haven’t had to type in a password in over a year haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The security of Face ID is another thing that seems really insecure to me. How well does the iPhone distinguish between a real face and a photo? I saw an article this week that said people afraid of catching the Wuhan virus were having facemasks custom printed with their faces so that they could use Face ID without removing their mask. I don't know if that was a spoof or BS, or whether it would work, but it certainly raised concerns with me,</p></div>		</li>
