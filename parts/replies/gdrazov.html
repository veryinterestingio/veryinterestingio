			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. I've personally found that I also trigger the reflex if I fall asleep while in a non-relaxed position - essentially if I have any muscle tensed to hold position (eg to have my arm around my wife without collapsing onto her and crushing her) then as I fall asleep that muscle relaxers and I get that falling sensation which jerks me awake. Obviously my wife doesn't really appreciate me doing this while in bed with her, so I have learned to find more relaxes positions to fall asleep in.</p></div>		</li>
