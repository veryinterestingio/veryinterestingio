			<div class="markdown"><p>So long as you do not burn or otherwise effectively decompose the old tree (i.e. you just bury it or construct durable objects out of most of it). This doesn't necessarily happen in practice with trees that have been cut down. Same is true of agricultural biomass - agriculture could be an effective contributor to the sequestration of carbon if we didn't burn the straw (unused stalks from cereal grains, usually) and other bi-products of large scale agriculture but in practice, this stuff is generally burnt and the products eaten so you just end up footing the carbon bill of the manufacturing and transportation that support it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would take a lot of inefficiency to produce that much carbon just to cut and bury a tree on the spot, but it certainly wouldn't add efficiency to the entire scheme. This is why when entrepreneurs get dunked on for talking about trying to invent machines to sequester carbon (&quot;Trees!&quot; the twitter mob yells in unison), it's ill informed. We've pulled massive stores of carbon, of global ancient forests, out of the ground and burned them. Mundane tree planting ain't gonna fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, all I'm saying is we just need to get everyone into a hobby building and racing ancient boat designs made out of wood. That way we can cut down all the large old growth trees and plant new ones, then trap all that carbon into giant wooden boats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the surface level, maybe. But there is a lot we dont yet understand about the second and third order effects of old growth forests. The deep root networks, mycelium networks and biodiversity they enable have a profound impact on capability of the forest soil to absorb nutrients/water/gases.</p>
<p>As with all things related to Earth systems, it’s complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are skipping over some of the most significant benefits to planting a tree, at least in the urban forest. Storm water purification and cooling shade from the  canopy.</p></div>		</li>
