			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an incredibly reasonable, logical practice. Despite potentially missing out on a discovery, you keep parts of the dig for future archaeologists? That's impressively forward-thinking! How long has that ethical consideration been common practice? Or is it not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s pretty universal, at least in my experience. I’d say it’s been common practice for at least the past 100 years but that’s a guess. Definitely at least since the 60s-70s. There are occasions when you have to break it, like say a salvage excavation where the site is going to be destroyed by a construction project or something, but those are the exception. The “not washing every artifact” thing is less universal and it’s something I’ve had to argue for with older-school archaeologists on many different projects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that there may be a tunnel built near Stonehenge.  There seems to be concern for what may be destroyed in the process.</p>
<p>Do you have any opinion on this?</p>
<p>Note: OP apologies for highjacking your post and thanks for your question.  I would never have thought to ask it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say wash do you mean you literally clean the object?  Like if you find a piece of jewelry you would clean a portion of it but leave the rest untouched?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda related, but NASA scientists intentionally left a store of Moon rocks from the Apollo missions untouched for fifty years for this very reason - they understood that science is always evolving and that future techniques would prove far more valuable than what they had at the time... especially knowing just how rare the samples are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>follow up question: how do they know where to dig? Is it always following a reasonable lead? Is it possible that the biggest archaeological finds are just waiting in the ground under the stonehenge but no one will know because we wont dig there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll just share one of my favorite digs. Over the course of 10,000 years, a mountainous river shifted its course a few miles. A geological survey proved that the river WAS there bc it had the same mineral deposits from the higher mountains as the current river, plus the topography made sense that a river could have flowed there. Deducing that hunter/gathering groups had seasonal camps, it made sense that they would travel along rivers. So we did test areas and, sure enough, found what had to be a regularly used camp with evidence of campfires (with arrowheads in them- roasting hunted animals) over many years with tons of scraps from tool making and pottery. Much of archaeology is luck but there is a systematic scientific approach to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what kind of stuff you’re looking for. I work usually on pretty old stuff in Southern Africa, 10-100k years old or so. For us it’s usually geology that guides us. You have to find the spots on a landscape where sediments are protected from erosion and where they can accumulate from other processes, a lot of shallow caves, rockshelters, hollows, things like that. We also sometimes look for things like aardvark burrows where animals have dug in and perhaps turned up some stone tool debris. Once you’ve identified a particular location with potential, we usually just try and find a spot with especially deep sediments to put in a test pit. From there it’s a little bit of luck and just following what’s under the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like others said, it depends on the region you're doing archeology in. </p>
<p>In the near east, archeologists will scan for low hills because ancient people in those days build thier cities on low hills for defensive benefits. The cool part is that a city would die and another group come along and build on the same mound. Then you end up with layered cities. Which means to fully excavate a cite you have to remove each layer. Which is another reason why they leave some stuff undisturbed, because they may have physically removed the rest of the layer to reach the one below it. </p>
<p>In the Americas, archeologists will sometimes use drone or satellite footage to look for lines or other evidence of buried cites. When I mentioned the technique to my professor who was interested in the Near East, he had never heard of the practice. But in the Americas, looking at small hills would insufficient. There are some sites that the hills are a give away (Toltec Mounds in Arkansas, for instance) but not many.</p></div>		</li>
