			<div class="markdown"><p>We talked about this years ago in my AP Psych class and we resolved to the fact that this is like a chicken-or-the-egg type situation. </p>
<p>Say I come across a bear in the wild. Sure, my heart rate would pick up, and that would signal you to run, but what signaled my heart to increase it's pace? A visual stimulus, processed by the brain. </p>
<p>It can certainly be a product of a feedback loop in <em>some</em> situations, but it isn't as certain as &quot;...in fact, the body reacts before the mind does.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but the visual stimulus that would tell you to run doesn't go through the normal channels. It skips your visual cortex and goes straight to the amygdala. Your body literally reacts before you are conscious of it. And yes it isn't always the case that the body follows the mind. Anyways thanks for the input, the relationship between the brain and the body fascinates me and I am always down to learn more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I see what you're saying. I initially thought you meant mind as in the CNS itself, not really your consciousness. In that instance I do agree. That's why Human reflexes can get ridiculously fast, something like 0.2 seconds on average or whatever. Imagine your life if your body didnt react to heat stimulus before your brain - far more burns, haha.</p>
<p>In the same vein, I have been into fitness for near 3 years now and nothing anyone has said has changed the way I stay in shape and how good my performance is more than simply working on developing a stronger mind-body connection. Crazy how 5 minutes of meditation a day before or after a workout can have a huge impact on physical performance across the board. </p></div>		</li>
