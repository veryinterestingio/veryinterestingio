			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I had a philodendron in water for years with never any rot. However they're specifically adapted for rooting in water. These water roots become tough and woody to resist rot. Also when planted in soil, these roots are of no use to the plant for absorbing nutrients so it has to grow new ones. </p>
<p>Pothos is one plant that will absorb nutrients from water. I have some in my aquarium and they're great at reducing nitrates. The roots do gradually rot away, but the plant grows fast enough that they're constantly being replaced. </p>
<p>Spider plants also readily root in water, that's what the plantlets prefer. However once it forms a root ball it needs to be planted in soil or it will rot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My aquarium pump goes to a planter with some rocks in it, and pothos rooted in the rocks, then drains down into aqarium.  I got vines that are like 30/40 ft but i keep breaking them accidently.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Rice is a crop that can flourish in flooded soils, whereas many other plants will die, so flooding of rice paddies is an important way to control weeds in rice fields. However, even rice plants can suffer yield loss or die if the water is too deep for a long time. In response to waterlogging, rice and many wetland plants form gas spaces called “aerenchyma” by inducing the death of cells inside the roots, allowing oxygen to be transported from leaves down to the roots. Aerenchyma thus play an important role in the survival of rice and other plants under waterlogged conditions. </p>
