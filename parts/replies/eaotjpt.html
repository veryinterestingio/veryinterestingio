			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. You can't refuse to accept cash for an <em>existing debt</em>, but you absolutely can refuse to accept it until you have verified that it is legitimate, and merchants are free to refuse to accept it at any time, because you don't have an existing debt to them. Terms of sale: no cash. If you want to pay cash, they simply refuse to sell to you, and there is no preexisting debt.</p>
<p>It's like selling a car to a stranger: we're going to your bank to get a cashier's check or fresh, bank-issued cash, and then we're going to mine to deposit it, and then I'll sign the title over to you.</p></div>		</li>
