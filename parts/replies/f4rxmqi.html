			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t disagree - but what’s crazy is when it takes so long to be profitable. Lyft started 7 years ago. When is it expected profits materialize and investors get money? What happens in some cases is an unprofitable but good loss leader company can’t keep going a company with a portfolio of complementary products swoops it up. Uber may not buy Lyft but what about something like Amazon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where math comes into play.  There more variables at play, but essentially, you look at your earnings and losses, specifically your past <strong><em>rate</em></strong> of earnings and losses over <strong><em>time</em></strong>. You use these rates to give a <strong><em>projection</em></strong> of where you're going to be.</p>
<p>Then you pray new market forces don't throw off your projection. A shitty businessman would pray and hope anyway , a good business leader would try to set up their company in a way such that it could flex with new market forces, usually by looking at how other similar companies fared over time.</p>
<p>There's still a lot of risk involved either way.</p></div>		</li>

To fathom “yeah our break even might be 10 years in...”. And they get millions in investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes so long in a lot of cases only because there is constant investment. For many companies who 'haven't made a profit in x years', the investment in the company each year exceeds their loss, which is a good place to be in (i.e. if they weren't growing the company through investment then they would have made a profit - so the business is viable). not sure if that's the case for Lyft, but certainly applies to Amazon</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I was in college, the start-up counselor presented the following typical time-table for a start-up :</p>
<ul>
<li>3 months to get initial funding from the 3 F's (Family, Friends, Fools)</li>
<li>1 year to have an initial product</li>
<li>3 years to have consistent sales</li>
<li>5 years to be bankrupt.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
