			<div class="markdown"><p>Every electronic kettle I've ever seen uses a thermostat to shut off at 100C, when the water is boiling. How aggressively it bubbles or how soon it starts to bubble doesn't change the temperature of the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there is a thermoelement at the top that is heated by the resulting steam, thereby shutting off the power supply as soon as the boiling point is reached.</p>
<p>You couldn't heat the water past 100 degrees Celsius in that situation anyway, might as well turn the kettle off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, but it's not the goal of a kettle.  The objective of a kettle is to make the water hot.  The bubbling isn't the goal of the kettle, it's just used as an indicator that the water is at maximum temperature.  Vibrating or not, the water won't start the boiling bubbling (at 100C) any earlier because the vibrating doesn't heat it any faster.  Once it gets to 100C the vibration might cause it to bubble harder, but that has no effect on the final temperature or speed of reaching that final temperature.  Having more water vaporize and bubble off is actually <em>less</em> efficient, because you are losing the hot water that you want for your tea into the air as vapor instead of your actual goal of having hot liquid water for your tea.  It doesn't really matter in a tea kettle, but if you were a chemical engineer designing a manufacturing process if you had 2% of your end product unintentionally bubble off as useless waste then that's a 2% revenue loss.  Sometimes the profit margin on revenue might be as thin as 4% (meaning the other 96% of revenue just pays costs, leaving 4% profit).  If you bubbled off 2% of your 4% profit you just sliced your businesses profit in half.  These are made up numbers and way beyond your comment but it's sorta interesting (to me at least).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, you would NOT want your water to boil in this case. It costs energy to heat water, obviously. But it also costs energy to change the state of water.</p>
<p>To take a small amount of liquid water at 100C and make it a gas at 100C takes a lot of energy. Even though the temperature doesn't change, think of this as the cost to &quot;liberate&quot; the water molecules from each other. They are cohesive, or sticky, and you are ripping them away from each other and putting them into the air, which is pushing down on the water's surface. So you have to overcome the cohesion and the air pressure (which is why water boils at lower temperatures in Colorado than in Florida).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite stat is that the energy required to change to melt 1g of water is the same as the energy required to heat 1g of water from 0C to 70C. That temp, 70C, may not be exactly right, but itâ€™s the same order of magnitude</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional to the other comments, let's also consider the energy required to vibrate the kettle. NPV-positive energy-saving seems unlikely in any case.</p></div>		</li>
