<p>Protons/neutrons are made out of quarks, electrons are made out of leptons.  There are other subatomic particles, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model</a></p>
<p>AFAIK it's currently believed those are the most fundamental units... but then there are things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory</a> that try to tie together how those fundamental particles work at an even lower level.  However, I don't think there is any experimental proof of anything like that.  Experiments with particle accelerators have (so far) agreed with the &quot;Standard Model&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just matter. There's no &quot;material&quot; like iron, gold, or anything else at that scale. It's kind of like asking what type of animal is a lone cell, not a perfect analogy but the best I could think of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. For all we know, those subatomic particles aren't &quot;made&quot; of anything, they just... are. Even if they are composed of a sub-subatomic particle, eventually you have to reach a baseline, where a thing isn't made of anything else, it just &quot;is&quot;. At that point, at least with current technology and understanding, it becomes more of a philosophy question, akin to asking how the universe was formed from nothing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you call <em>that fundamental particle</em> is just what happens when enough energy is concentrated in one point in that field. </p>
<p>Except it isn't really a point. It is a wave of probability.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An electron is a type of leptons, and they are fundamental particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no answer to that question, because at some point you'll always just run into something that &quot;just is.&quot; When it comes down to it, the fundamentals are just a property of our universe.</p></div>		</li>
