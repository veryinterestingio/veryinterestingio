			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incredibly helpful information. I’m a singer, and a bunch of the singers I like all take muscle relaxers and it changes their sound really significantly. I’d been trying to loosen up at the muscle level but wasn’t able to copy their sound. Now I’m playing with simply not sending a clear signal to those muscles and the sound I’m getting is much closer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rotator cuff pain is a broad diagnosis. The RTC is made up of 4 seperate muscles, any one of which can be the cause of pain. The most common RTC muscle to cause pain is the supraspinatus muscle, which usually results in pain in the top or side of the shoulder. This is often because of &quot;impingement,&quot; which means that the muscle's tendon is getting irritated from rubbing against the ceiling of the &quot;tunnel&quot; it passes thru at the top of the shoulder. The moreit rubs, the more it swells, which just makes it rub even more.</p>
<p>The primary treatment for this is to reduce tve inflammation using ice, rest, anti-inflammatory meds, and in more persistent cases steroid injection. </p>
<p>These treatments will help reduce the inflammation, but they wont correct the source of it. To do that, you should commit yourself to avoiding reaching overhead or lifting more that 10 lbs with that arm for 4-6 weeks. This will minimize the rubbing and help the inflammation totally subside.</p>
<p>Finally, consider physical therapy. They will help you strengthen the postural muscles that stabilize the shoulder blade down and back, which can help &quot;open up&quot; the tunnel that the tendon is impinging in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another redditor gave a good response below. But its also important to note that cortisone injections give good short term effects but no significant effect long terms. Proper loading of the structures through exercise will give you that long term change.</p></div>		</li>
