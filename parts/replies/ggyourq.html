			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true for much of what we know and take for granted in science.</p>
<p>For instance, basic kinematics start having somewhat significant error from basic models introduced as objects move faster that 12-15 mph (over 20 kph) due to air friction. So the model has to add friction to account for it as otherwise the error would overwhelm the data. </p>
<p>So there’s a range of conditions that our math explaining science work great. And where it doesn’t the model needs more parts, or new models need to be developed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air resistance kicking in at higher speeds is a <em>fantastic</em> intuitive analogy for how Newtonian mechanics give way to relativity. I'm gonna keep that one in my back pocket, thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this analogy is comparable to when we first discovered how far we could actually divide matter. From molecules to atoms to now quarks </p>
<p>The model is consistently changing in response to new evidence</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The threshold isn’t arbitrary.  It’s the wavelength where the Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius are equal. </p>
<p>The Compton wavelength is how spread out a particle is in space, and it goes down as the energy goes up.</p>
<p>The Schwarzschild radius is the radius where, for a given amount of energy, if you squeezed the energy into a space smaller than the radius, it would be so dense it becomes a black hole. It goes up when the energy goes up.</p>
<p>So if a particle had enough energy that its Compton radius was equal to its Schwarzschild radius, what would happen? Would it become a teeny tiny black hole? No one knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really wouldn't call it arbitrary. Instead it follows the physical boundary of each set of building blocks we currently understand. Visible objects made of cells, crystals, other conglomerates which are made of molecules which are made of atoms made of neutrons, protons, and electrons, made of quarks made of particle waves of energy. Each of these building blocks has its own properties. We struggle to unify the properties across macro to micro models.</p>
<p>Off topic, I think Spooky action at a distance in quarks is gravity and will explain most of the dark matter and energy issues in physics. Wish I was a physicist to study this!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is an extremely bold claim my friend. Care to elaborate?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The higher the energy, the shorter the wavelength. For a somewhat intuitive sense of this, you can consider that a single wavelength (peak to peak) carries a constant amount of energy. If the wavelength is shorter, you can fit more waves into the same space, and thus you have a higher energy. This is not actually how it works, but hopefully provides a good intuitive feel for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a better analogy: imagine a rope tied to a fence. You hold the other end. If you move your hand up and down slowly, you'll make a low frequency wave appear in the rope. If you move your hand up and down rapidly, you'll make a higher frequency wave appear in the rope. The rope's mass is the same in either case. Clearly, you need to put <em>more</em> energy in to the rope to make the higher frequency wave.</p></div>		</li>
