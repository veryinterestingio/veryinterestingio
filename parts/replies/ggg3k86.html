<p>And yes, if you're wondering, you can make homemade mayo, and yes its just oil and egg (although you're welcome to throw some extra stuff in for flavor)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair tho, I tried a couple of times and I never got the taste of the commercial mayo. It always gets too &quot;eggish&quot; tasting.</p>
<p>EDIT: thanks to y'all for the many kind suggestions, I guess I'll try making it again following them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many eggs did you use? Start with like 3 yolks per litre of oil. Once you get good at making it you can easily get away with using 1 yolk if you really don't like much egg, it tastes cheap to me though. </p>
<p>Some of the mayo flavour comes from acid too, I like to use lemon juice, but you can use whatever. Don't forget a little salt.</p>
<p>If you really don't like egg and really like garlic you can make aïoli with just garlic and oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 yolk can take 1 litre of oil without splitting. Emulsifying the mustard with the acid (lemon) first helps the whole process. Once the Mayo really starts to get thick add a drizzle of water. The colour will instantly lighten and will then resemble shop bought Mayo. Hellman’s type thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More oil, so.  1 whole room temperature egg to around 300ml neutral (vegetable or sunflower) oil, with 1 tsp of sugar, salt*, and Dijon mustard, and something acidic like vinegar or lemon juice, maybe a tbsp or so.</p>
<p>(* Salt according to taste, you might want less)</p>
<p>Use the immersion blender method for easy mayonnaise: <a href="https://youtu.be/j3xx8Bpau0E" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/j3xx8Bpau0E</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aioli traditionally is just garlic and olive oil. I guess yolk just finds its way in there, as it's good at keeping oil and water together.</p></div>		</li>
