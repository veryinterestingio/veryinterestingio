<p>We made gold back in 1941. <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.60.473" target="_blank">https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.60.473</a> it just takes more energy than you can sell the gold for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your matter production process will produce matter and antimatter in equal amounts, and they will typically be simple particles like electrons and protons. These could however be turned into heavier nuclei by nuclear fusion.</p>
<p>It's likely the primary purpose will be as an <em>anti</em>matter production process. The matter production will be a byproduct and it could be used, if it gets to the point that all the planets and stuff in a solar system have been used up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could produce specific atoms with enough energy but it would appear easier imo to take 2 already made atoms and make 1 other atom.</p>
<p>The problem with creating matter from my understanding is anti matter will also be created and they destroy each other in a nut shell.</p></div>		</li>
