<p>Christianity pushes other cultures to convert in a way that pagan religions really didn't do, so over time one side kind of pushed harder than the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is in fact the deepest cause of religion— it is an idea that reproduces itself. Like living things, some ideas die, and the ones that don't survive to reproduce more. Really, we humans are but hosts— an environment— for these idea-plexes to evolve in.</p>
<p>This idea is actually the origin of the word &quot;meme&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Memes/religions/other cultural ideas are more like viruses (not meaning it in an inherently negative way) than other living things as they actually <em>don't</em> reproduce on their own; they require hosts to make reproductions of them through communication, writing, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neater and more in line with the name (and Dawkins' intention) is to say that memes are like <em>genes</em>. They are the replicating unit, but they rely wholly on external hosts and the successful ones engineer their hosts and general environment in such a way that they replicate often.</p>
<p>Viruses are basically a subset of that (genes with a minimal host, that rely on a bigger host to replicate) but genes is a broader analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact the Vikings were known to worship foreign gods that weren’t part of their pantheon when they were venturing out far from home. Like they get to Africa or something and they meet people who have a sea god they’re not familiar with, they’ll go and pay tribute to that sea god because if he’s important enough to rule that people then it’s probably a good call to be on his good side as seafarers. </p>
<p>The Greeks did the same thing, where if they lost a battle to a foreign god they’d adopt that god into their own city’s pantheon. Most prominent example off the top of my head is the Isis cult, which was imported from Egypt and took on very distinct characteristics in Greece. The Greeks also didn’t all share the same deities. They were similar in name but had very different characteristics. Aphrodite was almost completely different in Athens, where the popular media depiction of her is from, vs Kythira and Sparta where she was worshipped as Aphrodite Areia - a goddess of war. Some seafaring city states were also known to worship Aphrodite as a goddess of the sea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am somewhat jealous of the Norse Pagans. It seems they were able to retain much of their lore and traditions. When Russia was overtaken by Christianity, so much information was completely erased, and now it is so difficult to find legitimate references to practices, lore, and accurate symbolism.</p></div>		</li>
