			<div class="markdown"><p>The best time, is usually an hour or so before sunrise, as far as I know. </p>
<p>Early enough that the plants get hydration, and water can seep into the soil giving all day protection. Also reduces fungal risks by not leaving them damp all night. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I hear different things, but in general it is 1-3 hours before the sunrise.  And a heavier stream of water (i.e. not a mister) is the best way to ensure it gets into the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I water just before sunrise/at sunrise but also just after sunset. Should I only be watering once a day? I also live in the Arizona desert. I let the sprinkler sit for 10 minutes in a spot before I move it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grass and other plants only take in water during photosynthesis. This is of course while the sun is up. It is best to water before sunrise. Watering after sunset can, like you said, cause more fungus. Another thing to consider is the heat taking the moisture out of the soil through evaporation overnight before the plants and grass can use it. Ive explained this to customers who insist on watering at night (because its more convenient for them) as it being like me going in and throwing water in their face once they are asleep. They arent drinking any of it. And the grass doesnt jump up yelling WTF, man. Otherwise, with the magnifying glass myth, you are spot on.
