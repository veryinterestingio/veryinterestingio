			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, that's like 1.4/2000000 of the calories we use in a day so it doesn't look far.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Food calories are kilocalories so 1 food calorie is really 1,000 calories.</p>
<p>If you look on the dietary information label you will often see it labeled as kcal or with a capital C.</p>
<p>You would need \~704 clicks to burn one Calorie (kcal).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's right to take energy or calories exerted to depress the mouse button as the basis for the calculation. Rather we should look at energy required. If we're carrying over mechanisms of action, any inefficiency should also be carried over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Where do we stop though? In order to click, we need the heart to be functioning. So do we count that energy? How about the weight difference between each person's finger? This is just a silly calculation to begin with. Nothing to gain by being strict.</p></div>		</li>
