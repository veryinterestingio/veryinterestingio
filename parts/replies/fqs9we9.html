			<div class="markdown"><p>Marmite, when I go to my in laws it's like the dinner bell rings for them, if I have a couple of slices of toast with marmite for breakfast, I get bitten a lot less, mentioned it to a few friends, they tried it and agreed, got no science to back it up, but it works for me</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just looked up what Marmite is. Yeast extract, so maybe this is some independent confirmation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bananas seem to do it for me. When we go to my mother in law's in <del>the willywags</del> Bumfuck Egypt , I usually eat a banana or two and it keeps the skeeters off me. Dunno how or why it works.</p>
<p>Edit: I get that bananas seem to make others get bitten more often. I posted what works for me, not what works for others. I can also eat a few bites of raw potato and they leave me alone. Also, for some weird reason... Slim Jim's.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm from the midwest and I never get mosquito bites while my mom and brother get eaten alive. However, when I moved to upstate New York I found I couldn't go out in the evening during the summer without bugspray because I would get dozens of bites on a short walk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m wondering the same thing. I get eaten alive in Virginia where Iâ€™m from, but a few states away now- hardly anything. Curious if we can also just assume something like a â€˜regional pheromone attractionâ€™ some folks posted</p></div>		</li>
