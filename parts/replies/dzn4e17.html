			<div class="markdown"><p>Atleast in my experience the dispatchers for my area are able to do what is called a phase 2 which is a much rougher assessment of where the cell phone is (which could be off quite a bit depending on the cell towers that it came into contact with) and also a phase 3 which is working with verizon (or other carrier) and pinning down with a greater degree of accuracy but at the same time cell phones are moving if the person is and time in delayed whether it be the most recent the cell phone ping to the tower or the human delay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. We didn't call it that but we could do the same thing if necessary and if the carrier wanted to cooperate. I never ran in to a time when they didn't. Usually came up with suicidal callers. I could keep them on the line long enough where it made sense to go through the whole process of contacting the carrier at the same time. It can be kind of time consuming (relatively).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an emergency dispatcher.
When I answer a 911 call, it only takes a couple seconds at most for the Phase 1, which is the tower location, to come up. I then refresh the ALI information until I can get a Phase 2, which is an approximate location of the caller. Sometimes Phase 2 will come up immediately and sometimes not at all. On average it takes less than a minute, normally 15 seconds or so. There are varying factors that play into Phase 2 accuracy, such as weather and connection strength. It’s usually harder to get a Phase 2 location on a cell phone that’s not connected to a carrier service, or when the caller disconnects before a Phase 2 can register.
Generally speaking tho, Phase 2 locations are accurate within about half a mile. It’s not great but it is usually closer than that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's instant but it only gives you a location radius each time. So that first ping is going to give me a distance of a few square blocks. Not super helpful. The longer I keep them on and the more times I could do it after a few times it would gradually narrow down that radius. Eventually I could guess at least what street or closer the cell signal would be coming from as long as they were static.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't even have to pay for landline service, all you need is a functional line and phone. Connect the phone to the line and it can ? call 911 even if you aren't subscribed to landline service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhh that's right. Cell phones work similarly too as a 911 call can use any phone tower and you don't even need an active SIM card.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely helped a number of times. Often someone would call who didn't know the address, like a friend who happened to be at the house, or a kid. Definitely helped to instantly have an address pop up to get a unit, ambulance or even me rolling right away.</p></div>		</li>
