			<div class="markdown"><p>The wrinkle is that a compression wave is transmitted by electromagnetic interactions between particles in the medium, and that interaction is via photons iirc - which are in turn limited by the speed of light in the material. So I don't think it's possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a common misconception. If photons were absorbed and re-emitted (the mean free path length argument) then you would not get coherent image transmission through transparent materials, because when photons are absorbed by atoms the photon that is re-emitted is released in a random direction that is not dependent on the incident angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they get absorbed and re-emitted. But the slow light effect is about the group velocity, which is a bulk property of many photons. That's not the same as individual photons slowing down, and doesn't directly affect the forces between atoms. Refractive index is about phase velocity, but I think it's also more of a bulk property that doesn't affect individual atom interactions.

<p>So sound can travel through something light can't. Which means there are many mediums sound travels faster... like a wooden desk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>even visible light will penetrate it a little bit. if you have a bright enough source on the other side of a brick wall you'll still see a glow, the wall just cuts down the light by a fraction, and so upping the brightness increases that tiny tiny fraction that make it through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound has very little difficulty traveling through solid objects. In the case of a wooden desk the light you see isn't being slowed, since visible light can't travel through it due to being absorbed or reflected. For most transparent materials light is slowed only a bit, perhaps from 300,000,000 m/s to 100,000,000 m/s or thereabouts. It takes a special setup to slow light to below a few thousand m/s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light can be compressed in a sense. If you send a pulse of light into a material where the propagation speed is slower that the vacuum speed, the length of the pulse will be shorter inside the material.</p>
<p>Audio cannot travel through light in the same way that it would travel through a material. Compression waves travel through a material via the interaction of discrete particles, but photons do not interact with each other under normal circumstances. In terms of direct physical interaction, no, but light does carry enough information to encode sound. This is how we get radio. We more or less wiggle electrons to create EM waves, and those waves wiggle electrons in a car's antenna.</p></div>		</li>
