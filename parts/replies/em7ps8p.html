			<div class="markdown"><p>Takata misblended or mispackaged the chemical that inflates the airbag. It's supposed to deflagrate, to burn very quickly but not explosively, pushing the bag. Instead, in some (hot and moist, IIRC) climates, it detonated, went off too fast creating too high pressures and scattering the packaging like shrapnel.</p>
<p>TL;DR: like asking for a boost over the fence and getting a hard kick in the ass. Same energy, different result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean there’s been a huge airbag recall lately because these defective things basically ARE grenades. My Honda Pilot’s airbag had a recall of the recalls replacement. </p>
<p>So that’s 1. Original defective airbag 2. Recall of defective replacement airbag 3. Recall of the second defective replacement. </p>
<p>Right now I’m only like 60% sure my airbag won’t kill me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple years ago I got in an argument with an Anti-Vaxxer. I tried to point out the flaws in his logic with &quot;look at the number of traffic fatalities, and compare it to the number of airbags. Clearly airbags cause traffic fatalities&quot;</p>
