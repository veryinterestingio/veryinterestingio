			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, we've had nuclear weapons for less than a hundred years, and are pretty damn lucky we havent accidentally nuked ourselves out of existence yet (we were one guy's decision away from things going nuclear over an erroneous radar reading once). Over billions of years, the chances of that not happening get pretty small.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think most people fail to realize just how short, cosmically speaking, our existence as a species had been. 2 billion years is the difference between pond scum and humans. Our species is only a couple hundred thousand years old, at the most. The difference between the creation of stone tools and super computers is 10,000 years. Our recorded history only spans a few thousand years. We went from the printing press to the moon in a few hundred years.</p>
<p>Where do you think we'll be in just a thousand years? Now ten thousand? Now a hundred thousand? A million? Ten million? Long before our sun undergoes any significant changes we won't be human anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>None of those things can drive humans extinct on their own. They can cripple civilization, but little short of making the planet almost totally uninhabitable would do it.</p>
<p>You could kill 99.9% of the people on earth and there would still be more people than there were when civilization started back in mesopotamia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not going to take 5 billion years. Stars grow hotter as they age. In &quot;mere&quot; hundreds of millions the Earth will be uninhabitable. In an earlier epoch the interior planets were at habitable temperatures. In a later epoch Mars will be at a more habitable temperature (though crucially still lack a magnetic field).</p>
<p>Still, we have hundreds of millions of years of paradigm-changing dynamism of the Earth before the Sun makes it uninhabitable. As a species we've been around for just tens of thousands. There's no reason to be pessimistic about the survival of our species based on the Sun's future.</p>
<p>For our personal experiences, of course, none of this matters. There isn't a cosmogony or belief system that I'm aware of that instructs that the consciousness of anyone now alive will depend on the status of the Earth in hundreds of millions of years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TDLR  I was in a class talking about Japanese Buddhism, and asked about the whole reincarnation thing.  &quot;How can I move up the chain in I am demoted to a toad and do a terrible job and end up as a rock.  How can a rock move forwards?&quot;  He said &quot;exactly&quot;, and moved on, and blew my mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Earth will be uninhabitable WAY before then anyway. Either by our own hand of by nature's. The sun will get brighter within the next 800 million years which will see the average temperature on Earth spike to between 60C - 100C.</p></div>		</li>
