<p>So, are the people actually talking to you &amp; it seems like it's coming from inside your own head?</p>
<p>Or is it that you're hallucinating them talking all together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experienced this when I was coming off drugs in jail. The voice you hear isnâ€™t your own. It sounds just like the people around you and it 100% seems like they are speaking telepathically. You would think they are actually speaking but their mouths are not moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the best course of action. Over time, you'll probably get better at adapting to it; most people with schizophrenia do. Remember that stressful times can trigger worsening of symptoms!</p>
<p>This blurring of your perception of the boundaries between your mind and other people's is a very distinctive schizophrenia thing that I wish was better understood. Hopefully one day it will be.</p></div>		</li>
