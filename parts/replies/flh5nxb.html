			<div class="markdown"><p>Khan academy is probably a safe bet starting out. In chemistry they go from basic chemistry (HS) through Biochemistry. I math they go from HS math to differential equations(a 3rd year math, most people don't take it) I believe. So if you were to do all their science courses you would be in a pretty good position, TBH you would know probably as much as many science majors. Of particular note is the statistics section which will be important for what I'm saying next. </p>
<p>After that I would learn as much scientific vocab and notation you can so you can read a scientific journals/abstracts so as to learn from a primary source of the research, not someone else's interpretation of the research. This is where the stats stuff comes in. All peer reviewed research of which I am aware is required to apply some type of statistic analysis and it is often the most important part in interpreting the results of the research. This is super important especially in the sociology and psychology research where small sample size often leads to bad conclusions. Just because one research article said x, doesn't mean x is true if their sample size is significantly small. I see this all the time and I wish people could be able to tell which journals to take with a grain of salt and which should be viewed more as fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, for any supply to sufficiently exist, demand is necessary. This means that step one for increasing scientific literacy is to promote interest in scientific literacy. NDT does a great job with Cosmos and his pop-sci videos, as did Carl Sagan before him. Answering the question &quot;Why people should *be interested in* science?&quot; is a challenge. How can it be made more fun, entertaining, and relatable?</p>
<p>Second, people need to have awareness of what resources exist. Khan academy is one. Crashcours is another that I've personally liked for teaching science, especially to middle/high-schoolers.  Richard Feynman's lectures and books are a great accessible way to break into advanced theoretical physics.</p>
<p>Third is in regards to statistics. I slightly disagree with u/Link7280. 1) Metareviews are crucial and are gaining popularity in social sciences. These reviews synthesize findings/data from various articles on one topic to make a better assessment of what is going on. In this regard, Link is on point. However, 2) if the sample size is small in a study, but the statistics reach significance, then the effect is still meaningful. This is because inferential statistics take sample size into consideration when rejecting a null hypothesis. The question is essentially &quot;What are the chances of gathering a sample of this size, using the same sampling procedures, and finding these results (which are generally an average based on some clearly measurable dependent variable, for example &quot;Depression&quot;).&quot; The distribution of sample means compares sampling distributions built on n-sizes, and larger n-sizes result in more robust distribution differences. See: <a href="http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/" target="_blank"><a href="http://onlinestatbook.com/stat\_sim/sampling\_dist/" target="_blank">http://onlinestatbook.com/stat\_sim/sampling\_dist/</a></a>. If we find a sample that the statistics suggest we could have found easy enough by random chance alone, then we don't have confidence that our effect truly exists. Small samples *can* however impact whether we consider the results to have high external validity (do they apply to everyone? Or only to a select group of people. For example, college aged students at an affluent private school who were included in this study.).  Finally, 3) some journals are indeed better than others. Checking their impact factors is one good start to addressing whether the journal has clout. Looking into the authors is the next step (h-index, CV, advisors, etc.).</p>
<p>My main point here is that we need to stir up interest before anything else. We need to prove to the average person that science is enjoyable to digest and that it is relevant to their lives. Part of this involves dissolving the elitism that surrounds a lot of scientific circles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course your right, but in your attempt to explain higher level statistical analysis I think you have lost the layperson and, as a result, lost the people to whom I was replying. I thought there was no reason to mention those techniques right off the bat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate that. But when you said &quot; ..small sample size often leads to bad conclusions. Just because one  research article said x, doesn't mean x is true if their sample size is  significantly small,&quot; you're being misleading. It's simply not true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just started listening to an audio version of &quot;the demon haunted world&quot; written by Carl Sagan. I've known the name Carl Sagan but this is my first introduction to any of his work. The book is about exactly what you're talking about and so far I've found it to be incredible interesting. </p>
<p>Highly suggested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a brilliant book.  Must-read, in my opinion, for any adult.  His book <em>Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors</em> (along with wife and co-author Ann Druyan), is a fascinating read as well, though not in must-read territory.  It explores all the things that might be supposed to separate humans from animals and shows that animals have essentially all of those traits, though in more primitive form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask how does it go as audio version? Do you feel like scientific book like this would easier to read rather than listen? I just know that books like this can be hard to digest verbally</p></div>		</li>
