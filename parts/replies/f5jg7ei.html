			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a reasonable number of cells that live the whole lifespan of a human. As others pointed out, most are neurons. But rest assured, peripheral nerves can and do get repaired. The biggest &quot;stop&quot; for this however appears to be scar tissue (that is generated faster than nerves often can reform lost connections)</p>
<p>However, the majority of our heart cells will usually also not be replaced and have to endure the whole lifespan. And the load that these bear is simply astonishing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are any human body parts living for 70+ years without complete cell replacement?  I'm pretty sure that most organs are essentially &quot;brand new&quot; every few years (it varies by organ) as cells are continuously replaced bit by bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect the difference is that plants throw away an entire leaf and grow new one from other cells, while we simply divide the existing cells and replace the old ones, thus accumulating DNA damage.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I could be wrong, but I don't think nerve cells regenerate/undergo mitosis. So your spine (and all the nerves connected to it going all over your body) and most of your brain.</p>
<p>If your female, you don't make new eggs, and instead just have a lifetime supply in your ovaries, not sure if that counts though.</p>
<p>Pretty sure there's 1 or 2 others as well I can't think of at the moment.</p>
<p>EDIT: Looked it up and looks like cardiac muscle cells also don't undergo mitosis (the special type of muscle your heart is made of)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the organ’s differentiation from stemcell. If it differentiate too much as in neuronal or kidney cells they dont get replacement when damaged, but instead replaced with scar tissue. Some other cells, such as intestinal epitelium cells, are replaced frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to see a plant get sunburnt, raise it indoors with artificial light.  Then take it out into direct sunlight for a day, the leaves will be sunburnt.  Typically, they gain a protective coating that will protect them from burning, but they must need it in order to gain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this process is called “hardening off” when transitioning a plant from indoors to outside. They have to have time to build up tolerance to the light levels.</p></div>		</li>

It’s covered in micro hairs that act as sunscreen to shield the chlorophyll from the intense UV rays at high altitude! The only place you find this plant naturally in the world is here on Maui at the Haleakalā summit!  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ElSA5Yl.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/ElSA5Yl.jpg</a> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FFLUi0t.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/FFLUi0t.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>
