			<div class="markdown"><p>There are tons of areas in the US that have a problem with access to care. There aren't too few doctors, but there are underserved areas because even for higher salaries, people just don't want to live in &quot;less desirable&quot; areas. Midlevel providers were supposed to help with that, but they also don't want to live in places other people don't want to. Right now there are enough residencies for American graduates, but the foreign grades (both US citizens and foreign citizens) are getting squeezed out.</p></div>		</li>
