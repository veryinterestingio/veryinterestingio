			<div class="markdown"><p>Ammonia is really good at absorbing and moving heat. We‚Äôve created some other substances that do a pretty good job, like glycol and semi-gaseous refrigerants, but ammonia is just naturally great at it as a natural liquid. Refrigerants take a lot of specialized loop processing (like refrigerators and window AC units) and glycol cannot hold the amount of energy you‚Äôd need to radiate it into space quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that this is just a joke but there is an interesting response to be had here. The radiator on your gaming computer mainly uses convection to dump waste heat into the air by forcing it past the metal plates on the radiator using a (often led bedazzled) fan. Space is a vaccum and so there is no air to force past the radiators, the ISS looses heat by radiating it away as photons. This is much less efficient and needs much more surface area than a similar capacity radiator on Earth but doesn't require any fans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I sure hope they figured out the heat thing before they tried going into space. I'd have thought it would be cold, but I guess it's more like an oven in space ü§î</p>
<p>So while you can't have the fans on the outside because it'd be counterproductive, is there anything particularly wrong with having sweet rgb fans on the inside?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in ISS Mission Control as an ADCO back in the early 2000s. Only thing I‚Äôll add is the pointing capability of the radiators. If you look at the solar arrays and radiators during a spacewalk they‚Äôre orthogonal to each other. The solar arrays should be hit ‚Äúbroadside‚Äù by photons, while the radiators should instead be parallel to the solar vector. Exceptions occur during specialized events like vehicle docking. </p></div>		</li>
