			<div class="markdown"><p>Truth. For me it was knowing that as soon as the lights went out it was maybe 10 minutes before feeding time. I dreaded sleep. 2 moves and 2 beds, sofas later we were rid of them. We threw every soft thing in the dryer and moved them into bags into our new place. It sucked. I get Goosebumps just thinking of those dark times..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our apartment complex had an out break, and were shocked when we threw out our mattresses that were covered in them.</p>
<p>I couldn't imagine sleeping in a bed they are using as their dinner table. That sounds horrible for you, I couldn't imagine going through that. You are a stronger human then I am. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was fortunate in that my flat was all wooden floors so they just stuck to my bed.</p>
<p>I bought some powder and powdered off the perimeter of my room. Took apart my bed and washed all my sheets at 90C then put them in a tumble dryer for 2hrs.</p>
<p>I bought a smoke grenade (was very cool) and let it off in the middle of the room..</p>
<p>I also bought some spray for residual damage.</p>
<p>Came back into the room an hour later and couldn't believe how many of the little fuckers were dead all around the room.</p>
<p>I had imagined they were all in the bed but there were lots around cracks in the wall.</p>
<p>Fortunately that was the end of it for me. I bought a heavy duty mattress protector and put another mattress protector on top of it. No more bed bugs.</p>
<p>I've since moved somewhere new but will always remember those 3 months where I was dinner for a host of bed bugs every night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was younger staying at a family friend's place in NYC my mom found tons on me while I was asleep. I remember us essentially packing anything of ours that didn't have them on it into a bag and leaving in the middle of the night, my mom was traumatized from that.</p></div>		</li>

I look up and see them worming out of the fabric headboard  FUCKING NOPE. all our bags are packed and I'm downstairs in a minute getting it fixed. They moved us over to the second tower, and we spent the next hour showering, coming through our belongings, and teething the become apart to make sure we didn't have any. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had mad PTSD for over a year after getting rid of  a bedbug infestation. I would break down crying if a saw a black-ish piece of lint on my sheets, if I saw any kind of resembling bug, and if I got any sort of itch. It was a real life nightmare and it took  lots of therapy to get it under control.</p>
<p>I'm doing a lot better now, partly because they are not an issue where I live, partly because life went on. But the PTSD it way too real and not talked about enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit. This is still me. I haven't had them in 4 years and every black piece of lint on my bed gives me a mini heart attack. Seeing an actual insect in my room is even worse. It's hard to believe how they still affect me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why am I reading this before bed. I'm going to sleep outside tonight. Naked. Buried in ash. Floating on a raft that was made in a sterile environment.  </p>
<p>I'll still cry and jerk each time I'm touched by a hair or anything, I'll freak out and think it's a bedbug and oh God I'll never sleep again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, I'd see a speck on my sheets I'd peel off the sheets, check the seams, and check the floor or crevices everything
Hotels or visits to somewhere and I have to scour each and every crevice to make sure that it meets my standards.
I never had to do therapy for it, but it still to this day hits me. I try to make lots of humor about it to lessen the load, but it still is always on my mind. I'm sorry to hear you had to go through that. It makes us all a big family sadly. </p></div>		</li>
