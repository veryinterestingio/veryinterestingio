			<div class="markdown"><p>The 200m WR time is almost exactly double the 100m time, with the 150m record being slightly faster for time / distance. </p>
<p>It might be slightly different for lower skilled runners.  My recollection is that high school track times for the 200m were often less than double the 100m times.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think The fastest race (avarage speed) is made by Usain Bolt in 150m. In 100m races acceleration takes too much Time and on 200m you slow down at The end. So for professional athletes around 150m is optimal but probably shorter for normal people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it could be possible to do a 100m with staggered starts that allows the runners to pick where they start running at but the time starts and ends at the same points.</p>
<p>That would allow runners to tailor the distance to when they hit top speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 200m WR would be faster than double the 100m world record if they didn't have to start by accelerating on the turn. The 150m record is quick because it's not an official event and was done on an extra long straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get about 30 seconds of full-on sprint before lactic acid buildup starts to effect performance.</p>
<p>400m is too long, so 100m/200m are the viable options.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, 200m times are less than double the 100m times. They're running the same speed during the race, full sprint, it's just that starting from 0 is a smaller factor for longer distances, so the average improves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do get penalized by the turn slightly though in a normal 200m. You need one of those straight 200â€™s to really see this effect fairly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lactic acid isn't endurance. You're body has several, overlapping energy systems. Just because it takes 30 seconds for your body to produce lactic acid, doesn't mean you can give maximal effort continuously for that long. In things like running, swimming, rowing, powerlifting and cycling (I guess cycling is functionally the same as running) you really only have 3-7 seconds of pure 100% effort before things slow down. Trust me, runners still have to pace out their 100m dash.</p></div>		</li>
