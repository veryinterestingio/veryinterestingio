			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment needs to be higher. The science is neat, but for the average layperson, what's important is this:</p>
<p>******If someone is experiencing cardiac arrest, you have access to a modern defibrillator, and <em>if nobody nearby is trained in first aid</em>, <strong>use the defibrillator.</strong> The defibrillator <strong>will instruct you when to perform chest compressions, when to sit back as it gives a shock, and when to continue chest compressions.</strong></p>
<p>Again, though, if you aren't trained to give first aid and someone else is, get out of the way. The best thing you can do is to look up CPR/first aid courses and take one, it's useful to know in literally every situation, but do keep in mind that performing untrained first aid is dangerous to the person you are trying to help. In the end, doing what you can in an emergency is the best you can do, and <em>if nobody else who is trained in first aid is around</em>, <strong>use the defibrillator.</strong></p>
<p>*Edit: changed &quot;heart attack&quot; to &quot;cardiac arrest&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fully agree. </p>
<p>AEDs were designed to be able to be used by untrained people. Several studies have shown (the specific one I cannot find now) that the outcomes of AED usage by trained and untrained people is virtually the same. </p>
<p>The most important benefit of the AED training is the situational familiarity by trained people which results in faster AED deployment. Each minute sooner increases the chance of survival by like 10%.</p></div>		</li>
