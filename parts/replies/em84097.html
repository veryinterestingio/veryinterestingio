			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I often have problems focusing on a conversation at a party and quickly get overwhelmed by simply the volume of a large group of people talking together. What does that say about me? I wonder if there is some psychological basis for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cocktail party effect is a bit different - it has to do with inattentional blindness and selective attention. In essence, we're constantly processing sensory input to scan for important cues (such as a predator's growl, or, as in the titular example, our name), even when we're not consciously aware that we're processing those things. When we hear one of those important stimuli, our attention snaps to it.</p>
<p>Similar things also happen with other senses, such as when you automatically step on your breaks while driving if you see a child move at the very edges of your peripheral vision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why many home theaters have &quot;night mode&quot;.  It compresses the dynamic range so that the quietest sound and the loudest sound are much closer to the same db level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At night you are also more accutely aware of the absence of noise. Specific focus goes into not making noise yourself, so as to not desturb any sleeping people. While in this heightened state of awareness any noise at all is more alarming then it would be durring the day when sound has no consequences.</p></div>		</li>
