<p>Thank you for the answer, but the strange thing is that <em>none</em> of the responses here actually addressed my question: namely how does IgG reach the mucosal surface -if it ever does in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Back in my PhD we did some experiments with intestinal lining -mucosal surface but not lung- and our results were sub 1%, so this is why I am curious how IgG treatments work.</p></div>		</li>
