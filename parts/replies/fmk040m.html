			<div class="markdown"><p>Ventilators do include humidity controls, actually, so they do incorporate this. However ventilators generally come in to play where normal breathing simply isn't getting anything to the patient's lungs, from what I understand - usually because they're filling up with fluid or other buildup as a result of the immune response to the virus. So, different problem. </p>
<p>Breathing in humid air helps most respiratory conditions when you have a mild case, to the point that it can make mild symptoms go away. It's not going to avoid a hospital visit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking what I see as the top comment to say that those atmospheric conditions aren't really what causes the spread to decline, it's an increase in UV energy as the earth tilts towards the sun in the summer.  Viruses are just tiny balls of proteins and nucleic acids, which UV fucks with.  COVID is a single stranded RNA virus, which means it's genome is extremely fickle.  It's enveloped which gives it a little extra protection in some regards, but a blast of UV is going to deactivate it.  </p>
<p>It's why grocery stores are so dangerous right now, they are indoors with lots of surfaces.  When people cough or breath, possible viral particles are not getting hit with UV, so they are not deactivating.  Outdoors during midday times the UV will likely deactivate the virus while aerosolized, and if not, on surfaces it's going to get beat up real bad by the UV.  shaded areas are going to be more protected, but UV is still going to bounce off and hit it.  </p>
<p>One interesting part of the virus is some changes in the biochemistry of one of it's surface proteins, suggesting it can stabilize on metal surfaces quite well with floating electrons over the lattices.</p></div>		</li>
