<p>I guess, either way, the importance is to still mask up, socially distance and sanitise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m vaccinated but I continue to wear a mask indoors in public places because I have unvaccinated kids at home - just worth it to take the main precautions of masking, distancing, and hand washing. I don’t want my kids getting this stuff, even though the risk of hospitalization and death is very low for them. We don’t know COVID’s long term effects and the precautions are easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it fair to say your chances of catching the virus are proportional to the (quantity) of virus you are exposed to is this the viral payload,  I assume there is is some measure of air volume to the about of virus, in my layman’s head if your in closed space like a ward full of infected people it’s everywhere and you will get a big load -  if your passing someone on the street it’s very unlikely your going to get any of the virus ?  So if we wear a mask the virus with our sneezing output (fine airborne Snot) will be mainly splatted against the inside of our mask ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct, this is the main mechanism.</p>
<p>Masks significantly reduce the amount of infectious particles that get into the surrounding air and probably will also reduce the velocity by which those few particles are expelled in the air, meaning they won't get as far before either falling to the ground or becoming so diluted by ventilation or outside air that they aren't as dangerous as to immediately infect the person standing in front of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The irony is wearing a mask helps others not yourself. Everyone who doesn't wear one isn't putting themselves in danger, per say, but everyone else. People legit can't put others before their own comfort. It's a mix of disappointing and absolutely infuriating. Infuriating isn't really a strong enough word for the feeling, though. World ending hatred maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in my area we haven't had a covid case for 2 months. No one wears masks anymore. It's only around 30 000 people but when is it enough to stop wearing masks? I'm afraid of new variants sneaking their way in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the best to listen to authorities, wearing mask is also good for heavy metals in the air and big molecules and dust. There are no cons for wearing masks except maybe uncomfortable on ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question. Not one I'm suited to answer. All I know is the same thing you do. I don't want covid or the delta variant. So, when I go out, I wear a mask.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the vast majority of people are vaccinated in your area, that's when it gets safer to not wear a mask. Also follow your area's directives, that is if you're in an area that still has directives. I know it's a free for all in Idaho right now</p></div>		</li>
