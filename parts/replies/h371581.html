			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent writeup. For those interested in further research on this, the experiment that conclusively proved the non-existence of the ether (or aether, for our UK cousins) was the Michelson-Morley experiment.</p>
<p>Essentially the experiment said, &quot;well, if there is an ether, and the Earth is moving through it, then if we set up an interferometer (to see how light interferes with itself when two beams of light are sent at right-angles to each other and reflected back in a mirror), and then turn the interferometer in different directions, it should show different interference patterns, since there will be a relative difference in velocity depending on Earth's speed through the ether.&quot;</p>
<p>But when they ran the experiment, there were no differences, no matter which direction or orientation they turned the interferometer. This conclusively proved the non-existence of ether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. </p>
<p>Like all other experiments, Michelson and Morley were measuring the round trip (closed path) speed of light. They found that it was constant. But this leaves open the possibility that light is faster on the way out than on the way back, or vice versa. In turn, that leaves room for a luminiferous ether. </p>
<p>Einstein also recognized this. The problem is that there seems to be no way to measure the one way speed of light. There is an excellent Veritasium video on this topic:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pTn6Ewhb27k" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/pTn6Ewhb27k</a></p>
<p>Thus, the proper interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment is that the ether is <em>undetectable</em>. Furthermore, Maxwell showed that it is <em>unnecessary</em> to explain the propagation of light. Hence it was not &quot;disproven&quot; so much as discarded.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't disprove what he said?</p>
<p>As long as you perform the experiment with multiple orientations relative to the Earth, any movement of the Earth relative to the medium would be shown in the difference between measurements.  No difference = no movement of the Earth relative to the medium = no medium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't it the Mickleson Morely (sp?) experiment that disproved the aether hypothesis? Einstein may have provided a replacement for it, but it was understood years before he published anything on relativity, that light wasn't carried by aether.</p></div>		</li>
