<p>For electrical contacts, gold is softer than silver. Therefore, for a given contact force, the quality of the electrical connection will be better for gold than for silver. (The asperities or peaks of surface roughness flatten under the force; the more they flatten, the lower the contact resistance.) This is also why a thin plated coating is pursued - it's only the surface that counts for contacts.</p>
<p>For micro welding approaches, the low modulus and softness of gold makes it very attractive for ball and stitch welding. </p>
<p>In the old days, people could tell the quality of a gold nugget by biting it, because pure gold is softer than teeth. You can't do that with silver. </p>
<p>The tarnish description is spot on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure gold and silver are about the same hardness, ~2.5 on Mohs (softer than the 5 of fluorapatite and hydroxyapatite in tooth enamel). This isn't to counter your main point as there are different ways of quantifying hardness. (Pure silver has a slightly higher, though still low, Vickers hardness than pure gold, and alloying further complicates things.) However, as a mineral, native silver is much rarer than native gold. Indeed silver is one of the common impurities of gold nuggets. But just biting a nugget of one or the other would physically have much the same outcome. Also, mixing metals tends to make the alloy harder than the pure metals, hence the crude test of purity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically to block most IR, and because it doesn't tarnish like silver would, and it still transmits about 60% of visible light.</p></div>		</li>
