			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful who you call disgusting! Killing and digesting old cells to fuel the construction of new cells is precisely what your body is doing all the time. What makes butterflies (and other holometabolic insects, including beetles, bees and flies) special is that they do <em>so much of it in one go</em>.</p>
<p>If you want a more detailed idea of what happens during metamorphosis, there's this excellent and publically available <a href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/84/20130304" target="_blank">paper from 2013</a> where researchers CT-scanned developing butterfly pupae. You can see how larval tissues are broken down during the first few days after pupation, and how adult structures are constructed later.</p>
<p>Incidentally, <strong>it's a very common misconception that no original parts remain</strong> (i.e. that no structures that existed in the larva persist into the adult). Although the gut is cut off at both ends, shrinks and is later rebuilt, it's present at all stages of metamorphosis. The brain is expanded, not replaced, otherwise adult moths could not <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001736" target="_blank">remember smells they learned as larvae</a>, and adult ants couldn't <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/82/24/8545.short" target="_blank">remember their nestmates</a> from their larval days. Without a working respiratory system at all stages of metamorphosis, the pupa couldn't breathe (and it needs that oxygen badly; metamorphosis is an extremely strenuous process). Without a working hormone system at all stages, metamorphosis couldn't be regulated and controlled. Without a nervous system and certain muscles, a pupa couldn't move (which many of them do, although butterfly pupae tend toward being quite still).</p>
<p>The extent to which larval tissues are destroyed and replaced varies between insect groups (I'm under the impression that flies are at the extreme end of differences between larval and adult body, while many beetles for example have quite beetle-like larvae, as it were). But for butterfly caterpillars in particular, you can clearly see all these systems persist through development in the CT-scan study I linked to. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thank you! So if I understand you correctly, some portion of the gut, the respiratory system, the nervous system and the endocrine system remain up and running during metamorphosis. </p>
<p>(I’m trying to imagine what it would be like to zip myself into a body bag, and have my body start digesting its own cells until my skin, bones and muscles turned to goo, while the insides kept working.)</p>
<p>Do you happen to know the answer to the other part of my question? How does the goo turn into the butterfly? Do some cells use the goo as food to fuel their growth? Or does the goo somehow arrange itself into working body parts?</p></div>		</li>

<p>And to it's telomeres? </p>
<p>Does it rewrite itself into something completely new?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So i wonder if there's ever a situation where none of the cells survive and it just liquefies itself. Like if the caterpillar has some sort of genetic mutation or deformity where the acids (what I assume are acids) that break down everything are too strong for the cells to handle and they just basically kill themselves. Just seems like there's a lot of stuff that could go wrong with that system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not acid, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis" target="_blank">apoptosis</a>, also known as controlled cell death. In other words, cells in larval tissues that are removed during metamorphosis are programmed to die on their own accord. When the insect has pupated, in response to hormonal and genetic signals, these cells will begin digesting themselves from the inside. Cells destined to stick around won't respond to these signals, so it's actually a very neatly controlled system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35037734" target="_blank">Here's a review article</a> about apoptosis in metamorphosis and other development, in case anyone's interested. Apoptosis is everywhere; it's the same process through which the gaps between our fingers appear, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the things that always strikes about biology (as someone who isn't a biologist). It seems, broadly, to be the same wherever you look. The further away your common ancestors are, the more there are differences, but the underlying mechanisms seem so similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, when I was at high school in the 80's, apoptosis was unknown. A friend of mine worked with some of the guys who proposed it at the University of Manchester, and they had trouble getting papers accepted as no-one really believed their theory. Now, thousands of papers are published each year on apoptosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dissolution doesn't need to require digestion. An animal's cells could just all unhook from each other and recombine back into a different form. Maybe immortal jellyfish do this when reverting back to polyp form. Point is even if it never happens 100% in nature, there's no reason that it couldn't.</p></div>		</li>
