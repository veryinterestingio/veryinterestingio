			<div class="markdown"><p>I take epsom salt baths and sometimes soak arms in it since as a musician those muscles can get very sore. I feel a big difference between a bath with or without epsom salt. I usually pour 2 full cups in a bath. Why it works, I don’t know, but I feel a lot more relaxed after using the Epsom salts.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Further reading has showed that there is considerable disagreement about transdermal application being effective. Apparently some studies show that sulfates can’t be absorbed through the skin, and some show they can. Some people may disagree that Epsom salts actually work in a bath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely the placebo effect coming into play, which itself is proven to be surprisingly strong. The salts have no proven impact, but simply in believing you will feel better, the ritual of taking a bath with those salts serves as effective therapy.</p>
<p>A quick edit because I nearly forgot: Salts do help to soften your skin, so this most likely enhanced the sense of healing and wellness from the bath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understood the salt was to cut down on skin cells lysing due to osmotic pressure. The salt helps make frequent long hot baths not harmful or irritating. </p>
<p>While the science sounds right to me, this is all hearsay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was because it kind of makes you float a little. Plain bath water takes some of the gravity off my body, but I’m definitely more buoyant with the salts and my larger muscle groups are really able to relax with basically no weight on them. This is completely speculation just from personal experience and why I prefer taking my baths with Epsom salts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Athletes do it to help reduce recovery time and/or reduce inflammation, but some research is actually showing that it is better to just let the inflammation be there and do its job. </p>
<p>Just because athletes commonly do some type of treatment; even those proposed by doctors/coaches/physical therapists; even at the olympic level; does not mean it is effective. There are a lot of examples of this, but typically they don't do much harm so it is &quot;worth it&quot; for them to try it to hopefully get any small advantage they can, even if the effect is just on their perception/psychological.</p></div>		</li>
