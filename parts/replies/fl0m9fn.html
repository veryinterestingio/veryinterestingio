			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have a symbiotic relationship with their gut bacteria, but this is actually not special, beyond how committed cows are to the relationship. You have bacteria living in your gut helping you digest your food and make vitamins too.</p>
<p>Cows are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant" target="_blank">ruminants.</a> They have many four-stomached cousins around the world, including deer, moose, yaks, antelopes, elk, goats, sheep, and giraffes. The fact that there are so many types of ruminants spread all around the world means that this particular type of relationship with gut bacteria is old. The earliest ruminant ancestors appeared about 50 million years ago, and genetic studies point to the four-stomach system being developed about 40 million years ago.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, they eat all day. We omnivores and carnivores don't have to do that because we get far more protein per pound of food than herbivores lile cows do.</p></div>		</li>
