<p>Marine, literally on their name, is designed around amphibious combat.</p>
<p>Going from transport ship to a beach is a VERY complicated task, from logistic to being extremely vulnerable during the transit. You will need specific vehicles for the insertion, Air support, and equipment + training on using them.</p>
<p>Typical army is trained on land based combat with their equipment geared toward land warfare. instead of training the entire army into people capable of amphibious combat (and using the specialized equipment), having a smaller but dedicated branch would be much more cost efficient.</p>
<p>As for Navy, they don't really have a need for &quot;soldiers&quot; ship combat is long. very long. guns and land canon would be pointless as the engagement range is far beyond their reach. Now its important to understand that Marine IS a department of Navy, however, for all intent and purposes. they are a separate branch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you go back far enough, all naval combat was boarding operations. Ships were more or less just barges that you could push together to give soldiers a surface allowing them to fight on the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are limitations on using long range missiles for any prolonged naval engagement. If a Arleigh Burke class lobbed the ~90-96 missiles at targets, there would be nothing left for anti ship and air defense.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why the zumwalt was prototyped was it was supposed to have a rocket assisted canon who would have given it the ability to have high capacity of precision fire.</p>
<p>The LCS and new constellation class frigates both have the 57mm and soon guided rounds for mostly hitting swarms of drones and suicide boats</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure, but if you need \~90 missiles at a target, your engaging against a battlegroup with complete CIWS net.</p>
<p>Which by then, wtf was the CO Thinking, why is a cruiser going up against a flotilla alone and where the fuk are its escorts.</p></div>		</li>
