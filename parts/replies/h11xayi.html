<p>Another vital bit to point out is why we believe light travels at the same speed from all perspectives? Especially if our intuition tells us we should add our speed to the speed of light.</p>
<p>The answer is, everyway we measured it, it is an experimental fact that light travels at the same speed in all perspectives.</p>
<p>In fact, scientist in the late 1800s, tried various ways to measure the speed of light against the earth moving around the sun, at at various relative angles. To their great confusion, they found the speed of light was constant. It took Einstein to resolve this</p></div>		</li>
