			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, it's called the east african rift, and will eventually separate the horn of Africa from the rest of africa.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still up for grabs if the East African Rift will ever create a new ocean. </p>
<p>Africa as a whole is being stretched. There is something called gravitational potential energy (GPE) - essentially elevated regions of continents have high GPE whereas  older, deeper oceanic floors have low GPE. Material flows from regions of high GPE to regions of low GPE. Africa is a continent (I checked) and it is being pushed up by Mantle material along the East Africa Rift which raises its GPE even further. And it is surrounded by very old ocean floor which has very low GPE. So Africa is inclined to rift.</p>
<p>*However* this is confined by two things, first of all, the majority of rocks in East Africa outside of the Rift, and especially to the South where it runs into Tanzania are very old and very cold which makes them extremely rigid. The Crust outside of the Rift is also immensely thick, so it resists rifting. The second thing preventing rifting is a force called 'ridge push' - Africa is surrounded on two sides by ocean ridges which are creating new ocean floor. As material erupts from the rift it creates an enormous sideways force - ridge push - which is helping to keep Africa from spreading.</p>
<p>The one part of Africa that might form a new ocean is the Afar Triangle in Ethiopia which sits almost on top of a rising mass of Mantle. Here the continental crust has been stretched and thinned and filled with a colossal number of basaltic dykes. Afar sits very close to sea level and some parts are well below sea level in part because of this thinning. It is also ferociously hot (on the surface) and unbelievably hot underground with widespread volcanism and geothermal activity.</p>
<p>Another example of a rift which is only just got going is the Red Sea whose creation is related to the East Africa Rift and to Afar. Here, Africa and Arabia have split from one another over the last 30 million years or so. The southern part of the Dead Sea is a true ocean with oceanic crust but things get a little less clear further north.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We cam easily meassure the tectonic movement today. So id say we can see it by our own eyes. Also we aee the results of the movement very often - eqrthquakes or vulcanic activity is a result of these movements. New vulcanic islands (which are result of a tectonic movement) are created very often.</p>
<p>Also height of some mountains is higher than when i was a kid.
Theres lot of local examples of these movements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, obviously you don't have a first hand account, but I assume it's a fairly gradual process? It starts as one land mass, but as it rifts does ocean water fill that rift like a river ? How would the process be carried out or how would it look if someone were to time lapse the event?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rifting is generally slow and gradual, yes. But it's possible a dry basin cut off from the ocean could form, and then fill up in a rapid flood when an earthquake or storm allows the ocean to break through. Such floods are known to have taken place in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean (though these are not active rifts). This would likely require an arid climate; in a wet climate a basin cut off from the sea would instead become a lake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to elaborate on a  great post - there are things called terranes which allow continents to grow by accreting slices of continental material (and occasionally chunks of ocean floor) along their margins. Terranes are marked by sudden changes in geology along major faultlines, often with huge differences in fossil assemblages across the fault, and occasionally completely different magnetic patterns.</p>
<p>Terranes broadly fall into two types:</p>
<p>The Pacific has a large number of island chains - such as Japan, the Philippines and the Aleutians called island arcs. These mark the point where two plates collide and one is subducted under the other. Material scraped off the subducting plate is mixed with volcanic material to create islands. Eventually, island arcs are swept up by continents and stuck on to the edges of the continent. This is what happened across the Iapetus Suture mentioned above.</p>
<p>A second process is called terrane docking. Here, faults along the edge of edges of continents move rocks horizontally (the San Andreas is a good example), so a slice of rock can be transported hundreds or thousands of kilometres before docking as a new terrane further along the coast. The classic example here is British Columbia which is largely made of a bizarre range of terranes including material that is most similar to rocks found in Japan and the Malay Peninsula; New Zealand and Colombia are also good examples where this has happened.</p></div>		</li>
