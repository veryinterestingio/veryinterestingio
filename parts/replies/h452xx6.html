			<div class="markdown"><p>Current helo pilot— this is a great response, the only thing I’d add would be the consideration between the main rotors and tail rotor.</p>
<p>Most helicopters can produce more lift than the tail rotor can apply “anti-rotational force” for. Meaning, at higher altitudes, if the pilot pulls up on the collective (the control associated with the overall gain pitch of the main rotor blades), the tail rotor needs to produce more counter rotational torque. If we go beyond what the tail rotor can produce, that is where the videos of the helicopters spinning like tops (normally before they crash) happens. </p>
<p>The other thing about helo flight at altitude is how “spongy” the controls feel. I’ve landed right at 10,000 ft MSL and you have to make larger control inputs than expected due to how thin the air is and how the control surfaces (rotor blades and tail rotor pitch) affect the thinner air.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>‘Thin’ isn’t a very scientific term…but in the use of ‘air is thinner’ it usually means less dense, so it’s just a matter of semantics. </p>
<p>People also use “thin” to mean other things, like less viscous, which may not always mean less dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No difference, it is just easier to say thin than the full explanation. DA (Density Altitude) is your PA (Pressure Altitude) that then takes into consideration the temperature and humidity of the air. DA is what is normally calculated and used, though PA is what is reported by any aviation weather stations. The worst positions for a helo to be in is “high, hot, and humid” because all of those things increase DA, making it act like you are flying much higher than you are. </p>
<p>For example (pulling numbers from mid air, not actual calculations) flying along at 5000’ MSL, the helo would “act” like it was flying “lower” (say 4500MSL) at 0 degrees C than if it was 25 degrees C (5500MSL) with the decrease in performance that the “extra altitude” creates. Same thing for humidity 95% humidity “hurts” performance compared to 20% humidity. All of these should be calculated prior to even getting off the ground so you know what the max PA/DA is safe for you that day, based of your planned weights (fuel, pax, cargo, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about a specialized high attitude helicopter With a hybrid EV engine to enable it to perform better in thin atmosphere, and newly designed rotor system with perhaps extra rotors. I mean nasa has a working drone helicopter on Mars .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So all of the things you mention are possibilities, and for specialize helicopters (Ingenuity for one) are designed for very specific conditions. The problem is that once you get to a very specific problem set, those answers don’t necessarily translate into the “daily drivers” that do most of the work. A old example of this would be cars and drag racers. You wouldn’t want the torque/power of a drag racer in your normal car, because it would cause you to have to change out the transmission almost daily. Comparing Ingenuity to a Bell 406, Ingenuity can fly in the extremely thin atmosphere of Mars, but can’t lift much more than its own weight whereas that wouldn’t work well for a medevac helicopter that needs to lift the pilot, at least 1 nurse, and the patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on why it failed. Mechanical failure (grinding, loss of oil pressure, you know something went into the intake), probably not. Fuel starvation, or intentionally turning it off (needed to do for some maintenance checks in dual main engine helos), yes. </p>
<p>Bottom line is the question on if you have the time to do it. From one of our training manuals, helicopters “glide like a set of car keys”. We’re normally not at an altitude that would allow us to restart the engine, while falling like a beveled brick. We are more concerned with creating a survivable “crash” landing (autorotation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it <em>can</em> but I wouldn’t want to be in that situation. Especially not as the only pilot. If they’re happened to be a co-pilot they could work on restart while the other performed the emergency procedure below. </p>
<p>You would be in a very rapid descent, performing a maneuver call autorotation which is where the rotor acts like a pinwheel driven by the airflow coming from below as a result of rapid descent—while also going through a checklist to attempt to restart. If you were at a really high altitude like we’ve discussed, it may be worth the time to make the attempt. </p>
<p>Usually a pilots time in that situation is going to be spent looking for a good place to land, making emergency radio calls, making peace with god, and trying not to shit their pants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the important idea in the statement is that people associate &quot;thin&quot; air meaning less oxygen.  Whereas the pilot meant that there's less everything.</p>
<p>It would be akin to saying &quot;that soup is watered down.&quot; And then someone saying &quot;its not watered down, it's just less dense.&quot;</p>

<p>All the comments are right-ish. The air isn’t “thinner” it is less dense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Merriam-Webster, definition 2 for &quot;thin&quot;: &quot;not dense in arrangement or distribution&quot;; definition 4: &quot;more...rarefied than normal (<em>thin air</em>)&quot;. How about &quot;'Thin' can be ambiguous, potentially meaning relatively oxygen poor, less viscous, or less dense. Precision is important in this problem because the oxygen composition, viscosity, and density are all important in different ways.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: Agree with your edit.</p></div>		</li>
