			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes...this right here is the exact reason why i refuse to get a wireless mouse.  Everyone at work gives me a hard time...until their batteries die...right before a presentation lol.  Wouldnt happen if you had a wired one ha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I see your point, I'm on team wireless mouse. I simply can't stand that awkward feeling of the cord tension, however subtle it may be. I'll gladly keep a pack of AAAs in my bag/pocket for emergencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the best wireless mouse I had was one that had two battery cartridges so one was always charging in the base unit. if it run out mid game it reloaded as quickly as a handgun.</p>
<p>but other than that one exception i only use wired mice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I spend a little bit more (£10 as opposed to £4 in my case) to buy a lithium ion internal battery (cannot be removed without deconstruction of the actual mouse) version. </p>
<p>Charge from USB and use whilst charging, so it just temporarily becomes a wired mouse when low battery. </p>
<p>The only major difference Li-ion batteries have is instead of getting spent when dead,  they have a half life.  </p>
<p>So within 8 years half of the max charge is possible,  within 16, another half of that,  etc, until you have to replace.  </p>
<p>Weirdly,  it's always cheaper to buy a whole new mouse than it is to buy the internal batteries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a PBX phone guy and I install systems with bluetooth cordless handpieces. I don't really see the point in them tbh, they're just a novelty if you're just sitting at a desk anyway, but they do work pretty reliably and people don't seem to lose them.</p>
<p>The expected lifetime for a phone system is about 10 years so it's to be seen if the batteries in the handpieces last that long.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that, the curly cord on your phone will get tangled up and/or fray and need replacing at some point, it won't last forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking and typing you would be better off with a headset (wired or cordless). What I was referring to was a normal phone, but without a curly cord, the actual hand piece is cordless ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use wired headsets for that.</p>
<p>They're actually useful for people who forget they have it on when they walk away from their desk, yanking everything off with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a doctor's office. We were offered free cordless phones when they did an upgrade to our system (part of the service contract, since our phone system FINALLY broke down and the pieces to fix it were no longer available. The upgrade was free).</p>
<p>The cordless phones were terrible. They always had static and the battery life was terrible. We stopped using them after a few months because they were unreliable. We continued to use the corded phones for another 15 years, though.</p></div>		</li>
