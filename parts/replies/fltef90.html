			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a doctor, so I can only give you advice based on personal experience and self observation. </p>
<p>Depression and anxiety go hand in hand, and frequently form a compounding feedback loop. This downward spiral leads to a feeling of helplessness and despair, which further compounds into worthlessness and emptiness. </p>
<p>Don't listen to your brain when you're depressed. Don't let it think about all the shit you haven't done, all the shit you could have done, all the shit you have to do... don't. That's not the solution. If thinking could make it so, no one would be depressed - they'd just think their way out of it!</p>
<p>You're sick. You have one job - do one thing at a time until it's done. Need to do laudry, dishes, pay bills, shower and the doctor back? Fuck it, you don't need to do all those things. You need to do one of those things. The rest of it can wait. They've waited already as you found other things to do so you wouldn't have to think about them. Fuck it, they can wait a little bit longer while you do <strong>one</strong> of them.</p>
<p>You can only do one thing at a time. And that's enough. If it doesn't happen today, make it happen tomorrow. Do one thing at a time.</p>
<p>Get up and use all everything to do one thing. If that one thing is calling someone for help, good. If it's doing the dishes, good. If that one thing is feeding your dog, good. You're sick, and no one who has been this sick can expect you to do more than one thing at a time. </p>
<p>Do one thing at a time. Don't worry about everything else. Write 'do only one thing at a time' on your fridge or your wall or your hand. Somewhere. Then do one thing. When you're done, look at what you've written. You only need to worry about one thing at a time. Life isn't even a marathon, it's one thing at a time.</p>
<p>Message me if you need any help bro, I'm a dopamine addict pretty well trained to check reddit frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a caveat. You can think your way out of it over time with meditation. But ofcourse that has a VERY high level of resistant trying to get into it regularly.</p></div>		</li>
