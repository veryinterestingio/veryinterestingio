<p>It really is. Also, over the last 25 years or so its documented effects have noticeably increased, but only in the US. There are drugs on the market that passed testing in the 50s and 60s that wouldn’t have passed if they’d been tested against the modern placebo effect. Nobody knows why. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more interesting is the nocebo effect. It is also less widely known. From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A nocebo effect is said to occur when negative expectations of the patient regarding a treatment cause the treatment to have a more negative effect than it otherwise would have. For example, when a patient anticipates a side effect of a medication, they can suffer that effect even if the &quot;medication&quot; is actually an inert substance.</p>

<p>That's <em>exactly</em> what it is. </p>
<p>Its a renamed placebo. You were handed a fake treatment and told it would help you, so you expect it to. Placebo.</p>
<p>The stuff that <em>does</em> work is just called Medicine, we drop the alternative.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I read the comment as:</p>
<p>placebo -&gt; tricks mind to do stuff -&gt; ??? -&gt; healed</p>
<p>alt meds -&gt; ??? (same as above) -&gt; healed</p>
<p>The distinction being that rather than tricking your mind to activate some mysterious biological process that leads to healing, the medicine triggers that process on its own directly.</p>
<p>No idea if that's a thing, but that's how I interpreted comment OP's point</p></div>		</li>

<p>and use double-blind protocols, so the people handing out the medicine have no way of knowing whether they're giving the placebo or the substance being tested to each test subject</p></div>		</li>

The so called patients were never diagnosed with cancer. No ayurvedic shaman can diagnose cancer via heart beat.
So, nothing was there to be treated, placebo or nocebo. </p></div>		</li>
