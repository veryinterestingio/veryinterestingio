<p>How does the ‘bent time’ result with the mutual attraction between mass?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You do have to remember, though, that in 4 dimensional reality we are not things in space getting older in time. We are physically long, static eternal non-moving objects, with each past, future, and present “self” simply being a cross section chopped out from their respective points of this object.</p>
<p>Like you can visualize a 2 dimensional cross section of a 3 dimensional object, like infinitely thin circles cut out of a sausage. The sausage is all those infinitesimally small circles that are glued together through the third dimension.</p>
<p>Now that you know this, and since you know we are also imbedded in the fourth dimension, if the fourth dimension curves, our long “sausage” will also curve. Like if you draw a line on a rubber sheet and bend it the line will curve too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>\^This.  A lot of the answers being upvoted here overstate our understanding.  The truth is we don't yet know why/how mass bends spacetime the way that it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree with this point. There are two perfectly symmetric pictures provided by the Einstein field equations. In the first one, which we can call the 'geometrical' picture, the density and flux of energy and momentum in spacetime are the source for spacetime curvature. In the second one, the 'material' picture, the curvature of spacetime is actually the source for the density and flux of energy and momentum. In other words, <em>the curvature of spacetime and the density and flux of energy and momentum are essentially the same thing</em>: the former manifests itself as the latter, and vice versa. So the answer to the question, 'how does mass/pressure curve spacetime?', would be: <em>mass and pressure</em> (or more generally, the density and flux of energy/momentum) <em>ARE the curvature of spacetime</em>. This is because, fundamentally, what General Relativity tells us is that <em>the gravitational field and spacetime are the same thing.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, science doesn't care about the why. It cares about the how. And we do know how space-time bends. It curves in correspondence with the stress-energy tensor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We understand <em>that</em> there's correspondence.  Not <em>how it is</em> that there is the correspondence.  The difference between only understanding <em>that</em> turning the key in the ignition starts the engine versus understanding <em>how it is</em> that turning the key in the ignition starts the engine.  Science is very much in the business of understanding such things.</p></div>		</li>
