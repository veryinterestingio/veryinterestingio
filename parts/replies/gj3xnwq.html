<p>Hi and thanks for joining us today!  </p>
<p>As a public health professional, I think that a major driver to most of the misinterpretation of medicine and public health science is this two-sides controversial style reporting. For example, running a front page headline story about a single anaphylaxis case with only a single sentence reporting millions of event free vaccinations as a simple statistic.  </p>
<p>How can we get more appropriately balanced and responsible science journalism when the majority of consumers barely even read the full headline?  </p>
<p>Not to plug but a great exception has been Ed Yong's reporting this year:</p>

<p>Great question. We know that the human mind thinks in terms of stories and narratives, and not (unfortunately) facts and statistics. This is why people can use a single story or anecdote to refute hundreds of peer-reviewed vaccination studies. </p>
<p>The trick is really to fight stories with stories, and highlight the individual suffering that results from not having someone vaccinated. Personal anecdotes were clearly effective back in the day when people knew close others who were affected by diseases such as polio. </p>
<p>So reporting needs to both use vivid stories of the impact of not vaccinating, and also strive to make it local, because the human mind thinks in terms of its close social networks, and not an abstract far-away individual. I think this is where local reporting can really shine. If there’s someone in your town who didn’t get vaccinated and then suffered because of it, it’s going to have an emotional impact.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this general topic, how do you feel about heavy PR and marketing campaigns from vaccine manufacturers?</p>
<p>As a government regulator who has worked with pharma companies heavily, I am well experienced in the expertise that they have in marketing and creating biases or attention in specific startegic directions. </p>
<p>However, I feel that the pandemic and vaccine efforts are such critical and sensitive topics that it can only be a credible and level playing field if the media attention is led by the science alone, on the parts of the manufacturers that is, instead of PR campaigns. Otherwise, the critical issue of public perceptions of vaccine or even just specific vaccines versus others becomes an ethically debatable issue of commercial marketing investment and PR spins. </p>
<p>We have arguable seen this to date to some extent with certain manufacturers who have been involved in abundances of interviews, media campaigns, extremely far-reaching claims, and numerous press contradictions in their public communications and it has, understandably, gone some way to creating public skepticism. I personally am surprised that this level of campaigning was even allowed by global regulators given the severity of the vaccine efforts.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this subject - do you feel that disproportionate PR investment / efforts detract from the level playing field for vaccine efforts? Do you feel they risk commercialising and potentially eroding public confidence, or do you feel that it is a beneficial endeavour?</p></div>		</li>
