			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct. The partial pressure of the oxygen determines if air is safe to breath. A partial pressure of at least 0.16 atm and at most 1.6 atm for a short period is considered safe. So your example should be okay.
For deep sea diving the pressure increases so the oxygen content of the gas is sometimes decreased to make sure the partial pressure stays within safety margins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can also use a helium mix for really deep diving since using air with nitrogen in it dissolves a lot of nitrogen in your blood that takes a while to come out, longer you are down longer you have to stop at a certain depth on the way back up (known as a decompression stop to avoid the bends, bubbles of nitrogen in your veins=bad time), to the point where you may have to do multiple decompressions at different depths for many minutes. Dive computers to tell you this are a very handy thing.</p>
<p>Edit: Trimix contains around 35% less nitrogen than compressed air, substituted by helium. Decompression stops are still required, thanks /u/Cavediver1858</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyperoxia is usually called Oxygen Toxicity, it's a huge deal with Scuba divers (see my other post in this thread for a full breakdown), but essentially as you go deeper the air in your tank compresses, so one breath of air at 33ft is the same as two breaths on the surface because of the air being thicker. So at 1.6 parts oxygen (normal air is 0.21 parts) oxygen becomes incredibly toxic, and the first symptom is usually seizures and death. Not fun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is oxidation bad? What mechanism makes it cause injury to the lungs? How long does it take to cause injury? What are those injuries? Why are those injuries not happening when I breathe fewer quantities of Oxygen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen is a very reactive element, too much isn't good for you. The reasons behind this and the mechanisms that cause the damage aren't trivial but here's an article explaining some aspects of oxygen's use as a drug.</p>

<p>It is a technical article and most people (me included in that group) will need to look up the meaning of a fair few words to get an understanding of the abstract, the introduction, and the conclusion. The main body of the article assumes a good understanding of biochemistry and physiology - I think the summary sections are a good starting point though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the lungs, it's all the organs. All cells in your body are sensitive to too much oxygen. Oxygen is a very strong oxidator, so it damages all the proteins in your body, as well as your dna just because it can interact with so much reductors. When the concentration is lower, the oxygen binds to whatever has the largest affinity for oxygen in your body : hemoglobin. As soon as your blood is saturated with oxygen, it starts leaking into tissue where it damages your cells, in the same way that oxygen makes copper rust. It destroys bonds in proteins and dna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. The amount of oxygen that can be carried in the blood after hemoglobin is 100% saturated is miniscule at normal pressure levels. This means that the partial pressure of O2 drops very fast once some of it is used. So peripheral tissues do not get the O2 exposure that the lungs get, even at prolonged time periods. The epithelium of the lungs, however, are exposed to very high partial pressures. This is known to cause first irritation, cough and with prolonged exposure lung fibrosis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oxygen is supposed to &quot;leak&quot; out of the blood into the tissues. Hemoglobin is very specifically evolved to &quot;leak&quot; as much as possible.</p>
<p>The tissues need oxygen to survive. But too much of it is toxic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why is oxidation bad?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oxidation is the general name for burning/rusting chemical reactions - hopefully it's obvious why that's bad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What mechanism makes it cause injury to the lungs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oxidation. Oxygen reacts with pretty much anything in the body. To get lightly technical, it involves removing electrons from existing atoms and molecules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How long does it take to cause injury?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pure O2 at 1 atm will cause significant injury from around 12 hours. A partial pressure of 0.21 atm (such as regular air) can be tolerated indefinitely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are those injuries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General damage/destruction (burns) to all tissues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are those injuries not happening when I breathe fewer quantities of Oxygen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because less of a harmful thing does less damage, and your body’s repair processes can keep up (also complicated homeostasis stuff largely prevents unwanted reactions below various concentrations).</p></div>		</li>
