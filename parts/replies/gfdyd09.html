			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason they stated that they abandoned it in media statements was because they dont want the general public to have any sense of mistrust in whichever vaccine is eventually rolled out due to trails of this vaccine causing a 'vaccines give you HIV' scare.<br />
Essentially they would rather someone else get the credit for a vaccine than to push their own and and cause damage to vaccine sciences reputation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the decision to abandon this vaccine would probably have been much more difficult if there were no other promising vaccines, or if this was the front-runner. It’s not like there’s a safety threat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Impeding diagnosis of HIV due to masking caused by a vaccine is a safety threat. It means some people’s HIV may be diagnosed later or not at all, and that is a harm. It is indirect but still a safety problem. (And I do not know if it fits some definition of “safety” commonly used for evaluating vaccines, but it does fit what humans generally mean by “safety.”)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not directly, but it's a safety threat when a non-insignificant part of the population uses it to justify &quot;vaccines give you HIV&quot; or some other nonsense then refuse to take any approved vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree.</p>
<p>Nobody was going to be misdiagnosed with HIV on the basis of anti-gp41 antibodies alone.  Lots of people have  antibodies that weakly cross-react with some HIV antigens on EIA.  That's why HIV isn't diagnosed without a more specific confirmatory assay looking for antibodies to very specific HIV antigens, not just general anti-HIV IgG or IgM.</p>
<p>The stigma against HIV remains so widespread that they couldn't risk that stigma contaminating the public perception of covid vaccines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;stigma&quot; is well earned.  Reverse transcriptase alone is deadly as it won't necessarily be the viral payload that kills you, but a mutation that creates new diseases/malignancies.  HIV especially likes to create a reservoir in the brain, with disastrous long term effects.  HTLV has been caught causing inclusion body myositis in addition to malignancies.  Bleeding edge research is suggesting that retroviruses are a common cause of inclusion body myositis as well as other immune mediated NMDs where the underlying cause was mutation from reverse transcriptase creating an immune response targeting that mutation.  This then results in autoantibodies against things like ATP and chromatin.  The body might clear the virus but the damage is done and the immune response doesn't stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't that enlighten us to an HIV vaccine in the future? Or, because there's just one tiny part of the virus (the gp41 guy), it wouldn't make us immune to HIV?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting antibodies against HIV (as has happened here) is not the problem. Getting <em>protective</em> antibodies against HIV has been the challenge, and there’s no reason to believe these antibodies are any more protective than in the thousands of HIV vaccines that have failed in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  We've tested and developed HIV  vaccines that create anti-gp41 antibodies before.  They aren't protective against infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, maybe, but the parts used in this vaccine are used in a couple different vaccines and drugs; the thing is the section of virus that is being used there doesn't have the part of the virus that causes the human body to stop having an immune response.  </p>
<p>As well, just because you produce the antibodies shortly after the vaccine exposure, doesn't mean that you will keep them for, say 6 months down the line (again, the same issue we have with the CV-19 vaccines is we don't know how long that will be)</p></div>		</li>
