			<div class="markdown"><p>Food safety. Have you ever had something in the microwave that had very hot spots and cold spots? This is because the microwave beams don't hit all of the spots evenly. (If your microwave has a spinning plate it can help a bit.) This is why many microwave items will have a direction to let it sit for a minute. This gives time for the heat to move from the hot spots to the cold spots and make the food have a more even tempature. </p>
<p>The problem is that the bacteria in chicken, salmonella, needs to be very hot before it will die compared to other bacteria. When you cook chicken the hot spots will be hot enough to kill it but the cool spots won't be. So even if it's tastes OK and is warm all the way through you could still get sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, 165 degrees F will kill salmonella instantly which is why the FDA guidelines say to cook chicken to an internal temp of 165. That being said, you can pasteurize it at a lower temp with longer cook times.  For instance, I sous vide chicken at about 140 degree F. As long as it’s held at that temp for the appropriate amount of time, it’s perfectly safe.  The FDA doesn’t take time into account though so as to make it “idiot proof”. </p>
<p>When microwaving, or even in the oven, it’s hard to know when you hit the correct pasteurization temp throughout due to how uneven they heat. That’s why chicken is often over cooked and becomes dry or rubbery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know how microwaves have the 'power' setting? That's actually used to control the interval of the radiator turning on and off to let the temperature to settle in the food. Depending on the food, this gives it a mostly even temperature throughout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say for certain, but a reason might be that it will heat unevenly in the microwave, so some parts might unexpectedly be not heated enough and still contain salmonella or something.</p>
<p>I believe you're supposed to thaw chicken in the fridge and then heat it properly and long enough to make it safe.</p>
<p>Just microwaving it might be not only unsafe but probably also not optimal for the texture and taste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding a helpful note.</p>
<p>Microwave ovens work by causing targetted molecules to vibrate.  In microwave ovens, the wavelength is set to target water (and fat) liquids.</p>
<p>So technically, a microwave oven doesn't irradiate the food.  It just sends waves through the food and water molecules happens to vibrate with it, heating up the food.</p>
<p>If you put really dry bread in microwave it will not heat up as fast.</p>
<p>So if you wet a paper tower and cover the food with it, or sprinkle some water on it first, you can heat it up more evenly.  </p>
<p>Water can become super heated in a microwave and can be very dangerous so don't put a glass of water in and zap it for 5 minutes.  The worse scenario is that the seemingly quiet cup of water is super heated and when you pick it up, disturbing the molecules it will explode and splash really hot water all over your hands.</p>
<p>This typically don't happen if you mixed coffee, tea or heating up milk as there are other particles that moves around as part of convection so the heat is distributed evenly in the liquid.</p></div>		</li>
