			<div class="markdown"><p>We do a lot of planning of upcoming events, so that we're ready when it's time for the spacecraft to do something.  It took us several years to plan exactly what data to take when we flew past Arrokoth, for instance.  We are also continually monitoring the health of the spacecraft, and checking its trajectory, and making adjustments to the trajectory by firing our thrusters when we need to.   Also, we observe other distant objects in the Kuiper Belt as we fly past them.  - John Spencer</p></div>		</li>
