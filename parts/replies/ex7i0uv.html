			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, Russia. Never used an electric heater except abroad, only seen gas heaters in country or vacation houses. Vast majority of people here live in apartment blocks with central heating. The hot water supply pipe in the bathroom also functions as towel dryer rack and bathroom heater (so that it's never cold in there, summer or winter). In the winter, radiators in each room warm the apartment. They charge for central heating the year round to spread the cost, about $20 a month; plus  a little bit for running hot water specifically.</p></div>		</li>
