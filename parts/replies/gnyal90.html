			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, the problem isn't just that the liquid in the pipe freezes solid. The problem is that water expands as it freezes, breaking the pipe.</p>
<p>At least, that's the problem in most residential situations.</p>
<p>And if you're very lucky, the pipe is the one entering the home with clean water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the sewer line has standing water in it, you've got much bigger problems. Drain/waste/vent piping in residential applications is filled with air at all times other than when you're actually running a faucet or flushing a toilet. And even then, a substantial portion of the pipe cross section remains filled with air. Really the only exceptions here are the p-traps at all drains, but those should have enough airspace on either side to expand into without causing any damage.</p>
<p>Water supply lines freeze and burst because they are filled and pressurized at all times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which they <em>ususally</em> will be: Dmoestic water supply pipes are typically made of copper, which contracts much more in the cold than the PVC or ABS pipes used in guttering and soil/waste applications respectively, exacerbating the expansion issue with freezing water. There's HDPE water systems too, but these weren't yet common when I left the building industry 20 years ago.</p>
<p>That's not to mention that the soil and waste stacks are typically empty of liquid where they enter your property, unlike water supply pipes.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For thermal power generation this is partly correct.  Even winterized plants have burst pipe problems in other states, frequently, just less frequently then what's going on in Texas.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin for Coal and Biomass plants is that the material being burned freezes/is the same temperature as the outside, there is no practical solution to this issue, but the result is that it is harder to ramp a boiler system up to full power and sometimes impossible.  The plant still operates but at reduced capacity.</p>
<p>For Wind turbines, the cold creates issues with lubrication and hydraulic systems that are required for turbine operation.  As it get colder the lubricants get thicker and so does the hydraulic oil making them harder to pump and they don't do their job as well.  This is partly why it is harder to start your car in winter for example.  You can winterize these systems by adding heating elements to the reservoirs.</p>
<p>In relation to Texas the larger issue for Wind turbines is freezing rain though.  There isn't to my knowledge a good protection against this it just is and you will lose large amounts of wind power to it.</p>
<p>For solar, Snow is well snow, it blocks the panels, you can clear them though, not sure if there is any protections designed for it though.</p>
<p>For Natural gas the cold once you hit a certain temp will cause the extraction wells to freeze up, or reduce the amount that can be drawn from the wells.  You can take steps to reduce impact (insulating lines, reducing demand, heating certain parts of the system), but it is not something that is completely preventable.  The Midwest has this problem occur in cold snaps as well.  NG turbines are frequently in my territory one of the first generation systems to go offline, though this is in part because they share demand with residential heating, which may not be a factor in the Texas scenario.</p>
<p>So in short, yes you can take measures to reduce the impact of cold, but winterization is not a magic silver bullet.  What it does do is help prevent failure occurring quite as widely, so the chances of the stars aligning for grid failure are less.</p>
<p>Edit: To expand an already long post, there is another side to this issue.  As it gets colder (or hotter for that matter) electricity demand goes up, while plant availability goes down.  Most grids are designed and operated around projections made sometimes 5 or more years ago.  So dispatchers call plants up to plan power requirements.  When you need another 100MW of power you often can't just flip a switch, depending on the plant type and how much spinning reserve you have it can take hours from dispatch to power being available.  If you can't get enough generation power fast enough you have to reduce demand, this is what is known as the rolling blackout.  If demand is increasing fast enough and you are losing production or failing to increase it fast enough you are in real trouble because if the grid is overdrawn you start physically damaging your distribution lines, transformers and substations.  To prevent that catrosophe you do what Texas did and just start dropping power like crazy. </p>
<p>The problem then is you have to bring the system back online, this is difficult and finicky work.  Even if you goy all your generation capacity back you can't just flip it all on.  You have to bring the system back slowly carefully balancing demand and supply.  This takes literal days.</p>
<p>If you remember the east cost blackout in 2004 (I think) that was a catastrophic grid failure.  That took actual weeks to get the whole thing back online.  The outage spanned from Canada to the Carolinas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ice on the wind turbine rotor blades will cause the blades to catch air less efficiently and to generate less power. Winterized blades are heated or they can be made from carbon fiber or have water resistant coatings which snow and ice does not stick to it. </p>
<p>The Princess Elisabeth Antarctica base uses nine wind turbines. These turbines use special polar lubricants that help them withstand the freezing temperatures.</p>
<p><em>For solar, Snow is well snow, it blocks the panels, you can clear them though, not sure if there is any protections designed for it though.</em></p>
<p>Winterization packages for solar panels in cold climates exist for those as well. They attach heaters that melt the snow and ice. Think of a windshield defroster. It functions in a similar way. </p>
<p>In 2011, 2/3 of Texas was without power due to a similar cold snap. A power audit recommended that Texas power companies winterize their systems. The legislators and power companies did not heed the advice. With climate destabilization, erratic weather will occur more frequently. Will they ignore the advice again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pipes carrying the water around in a power plant (for process reasons at least) are either feeding steam generators, or carrying cooling water. If the pipes are feeding steam generators you want pretty much pure water in them, otherwise you'd be trying to boil anti-freeze along with the water). If they're carrying cooling water, that water ultimately goes back to cooling towers where the water is cooled by evaporation. While you do add some chemicals for various reasons, anti-freeze wouldn't work for a number of reasons. In the concentrations you'd need to actually keep the lines from freezing, you would be using a LOT of it (it's not cheap) and you'd constantly be losing it to drift (water droplets that are lost from the cooling towers) and the EPA tends to frown on things like anti-freeze blowing off of your plant in the wind. Also, it limits evaporative cooling anyway. It's easier to manage freezing by the other ways listed.</p></div>		</li>
