			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if I’ve misunderstood your point, but aren’t  some of those secondary characteristics you listed directly related to reproduction rather than just attractiveness in finding a mate?</p>
<p>You (and the baby) are a lot less likely to die in childbirth if you have wider hips. There’s more room so the baby is less likely to get stuck. The extra fat is also going to help the baby survive if you’re pregnant and experience famine ( not rare).  Those two are certainly natural selection characteristics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are! Rereading what I wrote I realize the misunderstanding, I might’ve been a bit too general, definitely missed a few words, and got off topic at some points since I wrote most of this on a toilet break!  </p>
<p>I probably should’ve said something like:</p>
<p>Secondary sexual characteristics are not directly involved in the act of reproduction like primary sexual characteristics therefore are not considered sexual organs like the penis, vagina, and the associated organs that lead directly to reproduction. </p>
<p>However, they do have an impact on the full cycle of reproduction, pre and post-natal care, off-spring health and strength, etc. hence the attractiveness to such traits. </p>
<p>Anyway, it’s interesting how the necessity for these traits has changed with modern medicine, technology, and nutrition. Making secondary sexual characteristics significantly less important or even unnecessary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a little sad that you need to take the time to hedge your fantastic, scientifically minded post with a PS that basically says &quot;I'm not trying to be politically incorrect here.&quot;</p>
<p>I could see this post, in the wrong circles, being highly controversial despite it being perfectly sound and based in reason and research. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for saying that! I should’ve probably also listed my sources but Wikipedia does a good enough job at explaining it, probably much better than I did. </p>
<p>I generally like to avoid conflict! And this is a pretty hot topic in the US because of its relation to gender, assault/rape, and particularly to women’s rights. It can easily be misconstrued in arguments on things like breast feeding in public, dress codes in schools, and a whole litany of arguments with gender or sexual preferences. It can get really emotional even when it’s based in reason and research. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once got into an argument with someone who I suspected after the fact to be a very overweight trans female about biological attraction. I mentioned that things like how acne and extreme weight are indicators of hormone issues and therefore possible fertility issues, which is likely why they are generally unattractive. I was told to &quot;get my bio-troofs out of (her) face.&quot; She was highly offended and emotional about it all. People like to pretend that everyone is equal, and that only personality matters and that also no personality is better or worse than another, but all of it is feel-good dribble...</p>
<p>It really shouldn't be a hot topic. For hundreds of millions of years, heteronormative behavior has been the only behavior that has resulted in offspring and evolution. Anything else is selected against. That's OK in modern day, not everyone needs to have their own kids, but to deny that the evolution and existence of our species owes everything to heteronormative behaviors is lunacy. It deserves study, and it's not sexist, exclusionary, or discriminatory to publish findings. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Radical feminism doesn’t deny sex based differences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly trans seem to have an issue with the idea that people are biologically attracted to biological elements of sex, because their sex won't match their secondary sexual features.</p>
<p>Consequently, they're faced with the sad reality that many people will never be attracted to them because of their transsexuality, and that's a hard pill to swallow. It's easier to blame things which can change, like culture, than look at facts. </p></div>		</li>
