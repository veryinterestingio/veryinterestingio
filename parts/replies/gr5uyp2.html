			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you tear too many of the muscle fibers, like when trying to lift something way beyond your capacity, the rest of them start to tear as well and.... you end up with a complete muscle tear.  This isn't good and requires surgery to fix, but usually results in an almost 100% recovery when surgically reattached.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get this. After not working out for like 3 years I went to the gym with a bunch of bros and I went ham trying to keep up with them. Long story short ended up in the hospital with Rhabdo. I tore my muscles pretty much all over my upper body so much so that my muscles couldn’t regenerate so they literally went into necrosis and ended up getting pissed out one morning through my urine ...Piss looked like coke. It was terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Muscle fibers are cells. The myosin/actin bundles that make up the pulling force of your muscle are found inside myocytes. Otherwise they'd never get enough ATP to function, since ATP is produced <em>inside</em> the cell and can't easily cross the membrane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation. Weirdly enough I do sometimes get bruises on my thighs from a heavy leg day where I know for a fact I didn’t hit my leg anywhere or rest a bar on it. It’s rare that it happens but I definitely think it’s from lifting since it feels like a deep knot in my muscle for a few days. Also overheard another woman in my gym saying the same thing happens to her!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a fairly common occurrence in beginner runners so I imagine it's just from the force going through your legs when you lift heavy. It'll probably happen less and less as time goes on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly; muscle cells are a different cell type than epithelial cells that form your blood vessels. Angiogenesis is based on a lot of other factors including the physical properties of the surrounding tissue, and the presence of certain growth factors. So when you rupture a capillary, that section is permanently destroyed (which is why you see a bruise.).Your body may sense that it needs to oxygenate the tissue so growth factors etc will allow new blood vessels to form....so long story short, you get new blood vessels, not strengthening of existing vessels</p></div>		</li>
