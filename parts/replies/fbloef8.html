So maybe teaching animals language and communicating them would make them smarter and maybe even start asking questions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Famous linguist Noam Chomsky proposes the idea that humans have “universal grammar” built in. Don’t quote me on that exactly, but the gist of it is that humans must have very special brain structures that have evolved to facilitate language learning.</p>
<p>Language use isn’t just using words or signing symbols for communication, but rather, human language has grammar. It has syntax that allows us to form very complex ideas that have structural meaning with interchangeable parts. If you watch a video of what Coco and the other primates are signing, you will see that it is nothing close to language with syntax.</p>
<p>It’s a fun fantasy to imagine that animals can communicate like us. But be careful to not confuse wishful thinking with real facts and science. It shouldn’t be disappointing to find out that humans are probably the only animals with this unique ability. I personally find it fascinating, especially since I am a polyglot who will probably never stop learning new languages to fluency until the day I die or become mentally disabled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals communicate all the time - there are plenty of uses for language besides asking and answering questions. Giving commands (&quot;Go here&quot;) or providing information (&quot;There is food here&quot;) would both be entirely plausible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That animals communicate is not in doubt. Even honeybees (amazingly) communicate the location of new food sources to the rest of the hive with that crazy breakdance of theirs. But do any other animals have language?</p></div>		</li>
