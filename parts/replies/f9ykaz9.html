			<div class="markdown"><p>Solids are less likely to be aspirated, you are correct. Liquids, especially the thin liquids that 99.9% of the population drinks, probably enter the lungs and gravitate to the lower lobes more often than we realize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people won’t aspirate enough liquid to cause problems when drinking something with dinner. The problems with liquid aspirations occur mainly in dislodged tube feedings and aspirated vomit.  Sometimes this causes death, usually it causes pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia.  The cases I’ve take care of where people die in the ED are from food, liquid aspirations usually die on the floors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you refer to &quot;dislodged tube feedings,&quot; do you mean PEG or NG? The issue with aspiration pneumonitis, as it relates to alternative nutrition is moreso an issue of reflux entering the lungs.  And while I'm not aware of the statistics re: postprandial aspiration as a cause of death (certainly it <em>does</em> but I just don't know the numbers), far more individuals die each year as a result of aspiration PNA than of aspiration pneumonitis. One primary reason for this is the introduction of pathogens that exist in the oral cavity that are not typically able to survive in the stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, your body tries to actively dispel food and drink if it winds up where it shouldn’t, but sometimes the body just doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to. In people with dysphagia, the process of swallowing is impaired and so they may not have a coughing reflex. People who silently aspirate are more at risk for pneumonia because they’re not always aware that their food/drink has gone down the wrong way. </p>
<p>You’re right to not suppress a cough! Also take a break from eating/drinking after choking or coughing, don’t just try to wash it down with more water!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember there are two pipes - the esophagus and the trachea.  The trachea serves the lungs while the esophagus serves the stomach. If you’re not coughing and having trouble breathing, feeling like food is in your windpipe, etc..., you’re likely getting food stuck in the esophagus.  With the esophagus you want to get food down, with the trachea you want to get food up and out.</p></div>		</li>
