			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a research lab that (among other things) studies the lateralization of aquatic species such as fathead minnows and tadpoles. The prevailing thought is that lateralization (at least in less cognizant species) occurs as a sort of anti-predator response. (Note to others: Lateralization is basically an individuals left- or right-handedness)</p>
<p>Think of a school of fish under attack by a predator. Those fish are swimming together when something suddenly comes at them from nowhere and they scatter. Some will have a predisposition to turn one way, others another, increasing the odds of individuals escaping the attack and causing confusion, whereas if they all turned the same way, there would be an increased likelihood for them all to perish. In this case, differences in lateralization does not benefit the individual, but rather the population and species as a whole.</p>
<p>It's thought that if there is higher predation pressure that the lateralization split will be 50/50, leading to even odds of survival, while if there is less predation pressure, the difference may be higher, such as 70/30.</p>
<p>They were actually able to manipulate the lateralization preferences of coral reef fish by exposing them to high predation pressure from a certain direction for four days. This was an absolute change in lateralization preference, and remained even when there was no predation pressure. <a href="https://fishlarvae.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ferrari-et-al.-2015_The-effects-of-background-risk-on-behavioural-lateralization-in-a-coral-reef-fish.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>This shows that lateralization isn't only modified by chronic environmental factors, but acute factors as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has anyone looked at direct cultural ties to left or right handedness? I had temporarily lost the use of my right hand over a medical condition, and came to the realization of how much easier people that are right handed have it when I was learning to write with my left hand. In English, right handers drag away from the fresh ink, left handers have to lift and place, or float over fresh ink to not smudge.</p>
<p>In contrast, I have a Jewish friend that is left handed and grew up learning to write Hebrew first. Writing in opposite of English, from right to left, being left handed has the same advantage of dragging away from the ink and naturally not causing smudges. </p>
<p>I can hypothesize there being more left handed people within culture's that write right-to-left just based on ease, but I'm curious see some actual data.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Posted this in another reply, but thought I’d repeat it here.</p>
<p>Left handedness is more common when environmental factors are present during prenatal development- similar to autism and homosexuality. All of these “neurodivergences” are disproportionately more frequent together than apart. Age is a common factor here— more lefties come from older parents.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m bad at this y’all. Sourcing on. Phone is just the worst. Here’s a couple thiiiings.</p>

<p>Edit: you can see age, hormone levels, stress, and xenoestrogens (I forgot that article whoops) all impact neurodiversity in various ways. That these things are all common together suggest similar mechanisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Added some sources. Hormone levels in the womb account for most of these things. You can draw some conclusions based on the articles I updated my post with. All of these things are strongly correlated to environmental factors and frequently happen together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I missing something, or does this imply that there are specific actions women can taken during pregnancy (in addition to having kids at at younger age) that could reduce the risk of the child having autism? Since you also mention impacts to homosexuality too, has there been evidence of a lower rate of homosexuality in population that tend to have kids earlier (in addition to the other factors)? Sorry for asking about something other than right/left-handedness but the other details in your comment are really interesting!</p></div>		</li>
