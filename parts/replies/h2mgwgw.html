			<div class="markdown"><p>I really need to stop procrastining and get a diagnosis, the other day I was trying to explain to my mum that I know things need to be done, I know they're incredibly important, but it just doesn't even factor into my list of things to do because I have no interest in it and there's no immediate consequence to not doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immediate consequence is that everyone day you go without handling mental illness properly, you lose the full potential of that day. I got medicated at 23 and I'm 30 now. I felt like I wasted years of my time because I could have done so much more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now... step away from whatever you're doing. Go on to your insurance website (if you have one), and find a psychiatrist that is in-network. Or if not, just go yelp one close to you. </p>
<p>I suggest psychiatrist vs psychologist because they'll be able to prescribe you right away. </p>
<p>Now. Right now</p>
<p>Hardest part is step 1 because you have no urgency. I'm challenging you to do it right now, and to come back when you scheduled your initial consult. It's painless and the upsides are limitless.</p></div>		</li>
