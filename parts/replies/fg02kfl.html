			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that would only marginally help the issue, like how turning off your radio and headlights technically increases fuel efficiency.</p>
<p>Any numbers on how helpful using the heater is for engine cooling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not numbers, but I had a fucked fan clutch in my GMC Sierra 1500.  How those work is like a thermostat - as the engine gets hotter, it engages the clutch which causes the fan to spin faster.  When disengaged, the fan just spins at a slower speed.  It's a middle ground for vehicles where they have the fan mounted to the crankshaft on the engine, but don't want it decreasing gas mileage.  </p>
<p>So, that got stuck disengaged, which meant you could hold the fan still even while the engine was running and hot.  </p>
<p>Thus, the truck would overheat at idle when there wasn't enough airflow over the radiator.  Turning on the heat fixed that, even when stuck in construction traffic for extended times.... such as one particularly horrible trip over the mountains with 33C temps outside, not moving, and having to have the heat on full blast.  Windows down only helps so much when you're not moving.</p>
<p>Still, it was very adequate to keep the engine at proper operating temperature.</p></div>		</li>
