			<div class="markdown"><p>BECAUSE YOU ARE USED TO THE LOWER FRAME RATE AND THE FASTER ONE IS DIFFERENT. </p>
<p>ALSO, BECAUSE IT LOOKS SHARPER IT FEELS MORE REALISTIC THAN IT SHOULD BE AND TRIGGERS YOUR UNCANNY VALLEY RESPONSE. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with motion blur. Soaps are shot at 60fps while most movies are played back at 24 frames per second. (Actually it’s 23.98, but idk if dropped frames are a ELI5) </p>
<p>Our brains are so used to what movies at 24 FPS are and what that does to moving objects that when you watch something in 60fps your brain gets too much info and doesn’t give you the blur you are used to seeing. </p>
<p>If I remember correctly the hobbit was played back at an insanely high FPS and caused a lot of people to get headaches, but that might just been a rumor. </p>
<p>EDIT: I don’t think I was correct with the hobbit. And I’m helping lead to misinformation. Disregard that info. </p></div>		</li>
