			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking if you drilled down let's say, a half mile,  and built a habitat. I'd think maintaining the heat would be relatively easy. Small heaters here or there and it would outpace heat loss. </p>
<p>I'm curious about what it would take to hold pressure in an underground habitat. I dont think you could go deep enough to raise the air pressure to a tolerable level, but perhaps the Inability for air to escape could be an advantage at depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the main advantage of digging would be radiation shielding... but you shouldn't need more than say 10m for that.</p>
<p>In terms of heat loss... I don't know, I would expect your base's normal operations would heat up the ground around you after a while.  If the total volume were large enough, that might become quite a heat bubble... getting rid of heat might still be your biggest preoccupation.</p>
<p>In terms of forming a pressure seal... I'd think the type of rock would be everything there.  Dense enough rock and you'd be fine, right?</p>
<p>But what kind of rock are you going to find on Mars, and where?  I think we are just starting to scratch the surface of that question.  (Ha ha.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have aerosolized polymer based systems for air sealing leaky homes here on earth. A house is pressurized (usually after the main structure and windows are installed), and the polymer seals the holes as it escapes  through them. It can seal off holes up to ~1 cm across. Using a similar method for artificial caves on Mars would probably be much easier, since any gaps and cracks would be tiny by comparison. It might also be unnecessary, since the natural rate of air loss through the rock could already be tiny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, right?  We're so used to basking in the luxury of convective cooling, its absence is incredibly counterintuitive.</p>
<p>It's not too dissimilar to how interplanetary space is said to be -270C (or whatever it is)... yet everything we send up has massive heat radiators because otherwise they would cook themselves to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really for heat disapation on Mars we could just use a heat pump and geothermal cooling using long pipes drilled into the Mars. Could also use it to heat hot water and using Sterling engines produce power, or to keep any outside machinery like wind turbines from freezing.</p>
<p>And yes wind turbines would work on Mars they just have to be built bigger the lower gravity really helps with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for that you'd want to ask a real astronomer, but as far as I know, things in the sky can be deceptively bright (or not).</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it has to do with the deceptively amazing capabilities of the human eye.  When you switch from looking at, say, an empty clear night sky full of stars, to the full Moon, your eyes adjust to the huge change in brightness so effortlessly that you don't even notice -- and that is deceptive.  You might think they are roughly the same level of brightness.. when actually if you use a mechanical camera you will quickly see that they are kind of incompatible.  If you tune the brightness down enough to see the Moon clearly, the stars will just disappear.  And if you tune it up to bring out the stars, the Moon becomes a completely washed-out white disc.</p>
<p>The same is true of planets.  We think of Earth as a dark blue, green, and brown orb, just sitting there chilling.  But if you take a photo of Earth at that sensitivity level, you won't see anything else except a black background.  At a level sensitive enough to see stars, the Earth is another washed-out white disc.</p>
<p>So it's the same with Mars.  Mars is really bright and reflects a lot of light.  If you turn it down enough, you can see that mars is pink-orange-red and stuff, which is totally legit too, but don't forget that you've turned the brightness down to get that view.</p>
<p>TL; DR  Mars is simultaneously super bright and also a dusty planet -- it's your eyes that are amazing!</p></div>		</li>
