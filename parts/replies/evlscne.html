			<div class="markdown"><p>I can vouch for this. It's 40c today in Austin exactly, but I'm used to it. The year I moved here we had 100 days over 100F, many of which where above 110F. It's honestly not so bad. The air conditioning in any building is going to be blasting, I wear flip flops and shorts most days, and I grew up with this being normal. Europe and Japan aren't physically adapted to it, don't have the infrastructure to keep things cool, and probably don't dress very appropriately. </p>
<p>and people totally die here from the heat, especially old people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like, compared to what? Sitting in a sauna on full blast that's also on fire? 100F in Austin is fucking miserable and 110 is just absolutely intolerable. Yeah, you can hide in an air-conditioned building all day but eventually you have to go outside for something and it sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That summer I ate lunch outdoors every day, and I have done manual labor outside during the summer many times for work. Obviously compared to it being 85 it's not great, but compared to literally dropping dead, I would say... it's not so bad. Fuck, I see people jogging every day, I'm sorry you feel as though it's hell, but not everyone just stays inside 24/7 during the summer. In fact, the more time you spend outside the more acclimated you will become.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geez, imagine Texas heat in places where people don't have AC... That sounds like hell on earth. I know that heatwaves can wreck havoc on power grids as power usage shoots up. If there is a power outage, that would be extremely bad with the heat...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had my air conditioning go out for prolonged periods in summer time and air conditioning wasn't common till the 50's or 60's. I visited an elderly family friend many years ago and she would sit in her house without air conditioning when it was 110 outside. Back in the old days some houses were built with wrap around porches so you could find which one had a breeze and sit there instead of indoors. I'm not saying it's pleasant in any way shape or form, but you can survive it when you're used to it, and know how to deal with it. </p>
<p>Actually come to think of it, I come from a family of farmers and the (typically) Mexican labors (who actually had to be outside working all day dressed differently too. They would layer up, long sleeves, jackets etc. Supposedly it keeps the sun off of you and you're sweat close to your body where it can keep you cool. I think that is kind the idea behind a lot of middle eastern clothing too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened in LA last week. There was a power outage in Glendale that lasted many hours at the hottest part of the day. There are often power usage alerts etc, because people will blast their AC to drop the air temp to like 65 at 9am, when that's really bad for everyone and a huge waste of electricity.</p></div>		</li>
