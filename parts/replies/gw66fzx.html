			<div class="markdown"><p>Can your sleep depth change? I have a vague memory of sleeping through a hurricane as a kid. </p>
<p>But now? 15 years later, my girlfriend has made it a personal challenge to sneak across the room without me immediately sitting up like something out of a horror movie. </p>
<p>If i could get my sleep depth thatd be great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you mention that. I never thought of myself as an anxious person, but i saw a poster, i think on r/coolguides about symptoms of anxiety and had like 8 of the 10. </p>
<p>I thought it was a coincidence but maybe i just have anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been in therapy for anxiety &amp; PTSD for months now &amp; have already been sleeping sooooooo much better. The slightest noise or disturbance used to wake me up or prevent me from sleeping but now it's nowhere near as bad. And I couldn't sleep with headphones because I was scared of missing any sounds or alerts that may indicate danger. Therapy is a blessing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to be able to change. Before I went to prison I was a light sleeper. But after a week or two in gen pop, being kept up by chatter, clanking, flashlights in your face for head counts, gaurd boots hitting the grate walkways and stairs, big bob from Brooklyn snoring like a goddamn chainsaw etc (he was on a tier below me, but holy fuck he could snore, his cell did nothing to dampen the sound, instead acting like a big reverb chamber)... something in me just snapped. Now I can sleep through just about anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah. Similar but very different experience. Used to be a very light sleeper, and a very picky eater, and would get very motion sick if I wasn't driving, and we were on a bumpy road. Several seasons on a wildland fire crew later....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having mixed phenotypes are also beneficial to society (historically at least). In a tribal group it is beneficial for some members to be easily roused to be able to alert the tribe of danger, but it's also beneficial for some members to sleep through benign distractions so that they can be more alert during the day. So if you wake up to your spouse walking across the room, we can thank your ancestors for keeping us all safe from sabretooth tigers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad, 3 brothers and I all seem to have a sort of split sleep schedule where we‚Äôre up for around 2 hours at ~2am. I‚Äôve often wondered if this is just habit or something genetic going on. </p>
<p>We all still do it even though we live apart, but it is quite nice to have company at 2am at family sleep overs!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This aligns with myself. I love my one cup of coffee in the morning, and that's all I really need to kick-start my day. If I drink coffee too late in the day, I won't sleep that night.
I could never understand when someone says they have a coffee in their way home from work, or after dinner.... I just couldn't do that! Lol</p>
<p>I'm also a light sleeper. I have a fan going just to mute all the little sounds that could wake me up, but also it just sounds nice and helps me sleep.
If I'm ever in a new environment, like a hotel or something, it takes me ages to get a comfortable sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's wild to me. I could drink a coffee before bed and still get to sleep fine. Caffeine doesn't seem to affect me like it does others. It doesn't give me energy unless it's A LOT, but I also don't get withdrawals if I go without for a while.</p></div>		</li>
