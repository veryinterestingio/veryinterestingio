<p>That is not entirely accurate.  Their cranial capacity was <em>larger</em> than ours actually; but most of it was at the occipital lobe (back side of the head).   They had less brain above the forehead; the areas that deal with abstract thinking, symbolic reasoning, and creativity especially.  What this intelligence meant, we can only speculate; but most anthropologists believe while they have been very intelligent, in a way similar to us, it was probably much more <em>rigid</em> intelligence.  Less creativity, abstract thinking, etc.    </p>
<p>Neanderthal technology, for example, remained fairly static for a couple hundred thousand years, whereas AMH technology evolved at a significantly more rapid pace, and also coincided with an explosion of artistic expression (beads, carvings, lithographs/rock painting, evidence of pigment use, jewelry, musical implements, etc).   This is something we just don't see associated with Neanderthal sites.  </p>
<p>While there is some (fairly scant) evidence of neanderthals doing things like using pigment, possibly piercing shells (but not turning them into proper beads as early humans did).  But these finds remain controversial and the issue is far from settled.  There just isn't enough evidence to comfortably support the idea of Neanderthal art as more than speculation (or perhaps wishful thinking).  </p>
<p>There are Neanderthal sites containing artistic objects (a piece of a bone flute comes to mind), though these finds are very few and quite extraordinary--they also coincide with the arrival of AMHs, raising the strong possibility that these came from humans they interacted with.   </p>
<p>That said, if neanderthals were making cave paintings, the subject matter found in these caves. certainly is consistent with what Neanderthals would have been most interested in, since their lifestyle as best we can tell largely revolved around hunting migratory herds of animals.  However the sort of things depicted in early cave paintings are more or less the same things found in later cave paintings that were almost certainly made after Neanderthals had vanished.  </p>
<p>This is further complicated by the fact that the arrival of humans heralded a fairly rapid decline in Neanderthal populations.  The fact that humans pushed them out when they arrived on the scene suggests something about the difference between them and ourselves.  The last European Neanderthals we have found evidence of eked out an existence in Gibraltar, 30,000 years ago.  pretty much the edge of their world as they knew it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something you have to keep in mind when considering the rapid technological progression of modern humans is that our social capabilities were vastly different from that of neanderthals.</p>
<p>When you think of individual humans you often have to think in terms of potential innovators. Every single human being is capable of innovating, of creating something new or improving upon something old. If your local tribe consists of 100 members then that's 100 potential innovators, and all evidence points toward the fact that those 100 innovators oftentimes interacted and shared said innovations with other groups.</p>
<p>If a new technology was discovered by a group of modern humans in one part of Africa it rapidly spread to all groups of humans all across Africa.</p>
<p>In the case of neanderthals however they more often lived in tiny family groups consisting of up to 10 members, that's significantly less potential innovators already just in your own tribe.</p>
<p>So although the relatively slow technological progression of neanderthals possibly were due to them being less creative etc, there were many other factors that you also must take into consideration</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very good point.  Spoken language was an earth-shattering adaptation and <em>huge</em> in terms of impact.   What's uncertain is to what extent neanderthals had language or communication.  They probably couldn't speak like we do, their physiology apparently didn't allow for such fine control.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is another theory that goes:</p>
<p>Neanderthals where not less intelligent, also not in terms of creativity and abstract thinking. </p>
<p>But the main difference with homo sapiens is that they where much less social. Meaning that it wasn't in them to learn from each other and build upon each others progress. Social skills and teaching each other stuff and improving upon the work of others might have been the deciding factor in the success of homo sapiens. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that idea, it's hard to pass down ideas and have innovation when your isolated isolated. No friendly competition or drive and if your group has a bad run and a few people down then there knowledge is lost and it never got passed on to enough people to spread.</p>
<p>I have an argument that they were in fact &quot;smarter&quot; than us. They will likely be one of the more successful hominids in the sense they existed in a  longer window than we will. We have destroyed out planet because we are smarter and will likely cause our own extinction.</p></div>		</li>
