<p>I absolutely hated it.</p>
<p>Your first day you got some latin american woman talking a mile a min and would refuse to say anything to you in English. I finally got a Spaniard one year who didn't do that and actually started to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like as adults, you need a basic foundation first, and then immersion learning can be effective on top of that foundation. Also, any speaking needs context as well, like pointing at pictures, or videos of real-life scenarios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like your college didn't actually learn what the immersion method <em>is</em> before implementing it.</p>
<p>Immersion method teaching is not supposed to be refusing to speak in the students' primary language -- it's a technique that involves getting students to hear, read, speak, and write in the target language right away. Basically, teaching English speakers to speak Spanish using immersion looks like getting the students to speak simple sentences right away, saying things in Spanish before repeating them in English, and so on.</p>
<p>Immersion method, in other words, would be &quot;let's all speak as much Spanish as possible&quot;. It acknowledges that students won't be able to speak or understand much at first, but pushes them toward more.</p>
<p>I'm learning German using the immersion method. My first classes were <em>mostly</em> English, and now that I'm more advanced, it's about 90% in German -- but my instructor will drop back to English to explain complex things we're not ready to discuss in German yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I learned this way after a few weeks of preparation before moving overseas. You just hear the same words over and over and figure out what they mean. I also spoke to everybody I saw and accepted that I was going to be the village idiot for a few months. My language was very colloquial though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned similarly, and then said the equivalent of &quot;I don't give a fuck&quot; to my boss's boss because I didn't realise it was vulgar. Luckily he was asking me about personal stuff and not work so he laughed it off.</p></div>		</li>
