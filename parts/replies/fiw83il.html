			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fair to assume governments will be more willing to test on humans faster, depending on the pandemic. If not one country than another will.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it would fall into the category of 'better to kill 50 by rushing than 50,000 by delaying'.</p>
<p>Edit: to add though I don't think coronavirus will warrant such action though, since most the population is unlikely to die from it even if they get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc correctly they did rush a trial vaccine for Ebola during the last outbreak and go straight to human testing. There was concern though that if it failed and test subjects died they'd say &quot;look they're using them as guinea pigs to test unsafe products&quot; whether they died from Ebola or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if its currently at a 2% mortality rate then it doesn't matter right? Like they might end up being wrong but being significantly more deadly than the flu means just at 1% mortality numbers 6 million infected americans means close to the flus number dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, Moderna created and released a coronavirus vaccine for phase 1 safety trials in just 42 days. That's much much faster than normal, thanks to the fda fast tracking it, but the clinical trials are still expected to take up to a year</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acceleration isn’t the issue.  Clinical Trials infrastructure is already in place and there’s thousands of people with the time and expertise ready to do the work.   When creating a new vaccine there’s a ton of unknowns.  The regulatory burden isn’t going to be the problem.  The problem will be 1) finding a vaccine that works in people 2) finding a formulation that is also safe in people 3) manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a program in hs where we got to make visits to a pharmaceutical plant and it really opened my perspective to how much work, time, and money goes into not just research, development, and manufacturing of drugs and research chemicals, but <em>every</em> <em>single</em> infrastructural industry we rely on and sometimes forget to appreciate. Many of the very accomplished researchers told us stories of their projects taking decades to complete, or failing out of the development stage even if the molecule worked due to manufacturing issues or cost etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory yes, in this case that requirement might be more loose.  Also, in this day and age things can be peer reviewed and published quickly online.</p></div>		</li>
