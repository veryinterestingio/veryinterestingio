			<div class="markdown"><p>When they started out, the population was lower, and people generally only had one phone number. Eventually they started running out of phone numbers, and so they had to start making new area codes. So, your home number seems to have an original MA area code, but the cell has a new one. The systematic nature of assigning area codes seems to have gotten lost in the process.</p></div>		</li>
