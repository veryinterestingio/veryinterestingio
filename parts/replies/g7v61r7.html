			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's electronically very similar to headphones, too.</p>
<p>Headphones or speakers work by sending the audio signal through small electromagnets, that make the speaker membranes vibrate.</p>
<p>Those casette adapters have a pair of small electromagnets (one for left and one for right in the stereo signal). From the point of view of your phone or whatever device you're playing audio from, the casette adapter is indistinguishable from a set of headphones because an electromagnet is an electromagnet (assuming equal impedance) no matter if it drives a membrane or induces a signal in the casette deck's read head. </p>
<p>So, the device sending the audio signal doesn't know or care if there's a casette adapter.</p>
<p>The casette player also doesn't know or care. Its read head is designed to convert changes in magnetic field into an electric signal. Wether those changes come from a magnetic tape being passed in front of the head or from the electromagnets in the adapter doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are very similar. </p>
<p>I actually made an headphone to cassette adapter by following an online guide that had you Frankenstein together a pair of headphones and an actual cassette tape. </p>
<p>If you put the speaker driver at the right position in the cassette, the cassette player would pick it up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Impedance is resistance to changes in electrical current. A high impedance coil will act like a high value resistor if you try to pass alternating current through it, but will have much lower resistance to a dc current. More windings in a coil makes for higher impedance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The cassette part of the unit contains an electromagnet</p>

<p>It's actually a std cassette play/record head that's used. I used to make these from scratch with old cassette heads and an empty cassette case in the 90's.</p></div>		</li>

And those are electromagnets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, but also no. More of the read head is basically just a coil of wire and the write head is just another one. In close proximity they inductively link to each other and form a transformer. So it is more like &quot;wireless charging&quot; than anything else.</p></div>		</li>
