			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but in small rural towns like that, the problem isn't that people aren't having kids, it's that everyone leaves right when they turn 18. There's no one there to have kids, unless they get pregnant in high school and get stuck there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go back 40-50 years and those small towns used to have anchor businesses that kept the town afloat. Then we started moving those jobs overseas and these small towns withered away. What alot of people fail to realize is that the factory owners took the bag and didn't reinvest for the next generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing is happening in rural Japan as well. I had a friend who taught in iiyama and he had to drive to 5 different schools around the prefecture until they started closing some down. It’s both, people aren’t having kids and the kids are moving away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the townsfolk will eventually realize that nobody wants to live in a city with no forms of entertainment, zero job prospects, no affordable fast internet connection, rampant homophobia, denial that science is real, casual racism directed towards anyone who isn’t white, cronyism at every level of town government, and where all of the restaurants close at 8:30 pm.</p>
<p>What have any of those small rural towns done to make themselves attractive places to live that can compete with medium or large cities? Jack shit. They’re still hoping that kids will choose to live there out of a sense of nostalgia for a time those kids never lived through in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When most people say &quot;small rural town&quot; they don't think of somewhere large enough to have 7 fucking elementary schools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be talking about the county, maybe, or the number of classes.</p>
<p>In our county, the main town is 20,000 (the &quot;county seat&quot;), and supports 1 school with 7 classes per grade.</p>
<p>The satellite towns each have their own elementary school, I think another 6 or 7 with 1 to 3 classes each.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Alternatively, we could start thinking about living in a world where GDP is, like, the tenth most important metric for a society.</p></div>		</li>
