			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because radiation still exists. The iron can radiate away its heat (or capture solar radiation), changing its temperature. However, convection doesn't exist in 100% vacuum, because you need a fluid for that to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were in intergalactic space very far away from any star, the piece of iron would eventually reach a temperature about 3 degrees above absolute zero (2.7 Kelvin) due to the cosmic microwave background, which is the leftover glow from the hot early days of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the vacuum of space is never a true vacuum, and there are always a few molecules around, the thermometer would eventually reach equilibrium with those molecules. Then it measures the temperature of those molecules, which would be typically very, very low (-200 to -400 F, depending on the region of space).</p>
<p>So the vacuum itself has no temperature. Temperature is by definition the average energy of particles.</p>
<p>Now, in a perfect vacuum (which can't really exist in practice and arguably in theory either), technically there is NO temperature. But your thermometer would measure something very close to absolute 0 (-459.67 F) if you let it sit there for a very, very long and radiate away any energy it has (and the thermometer doesn't stop working or break down chemically in that very long time).</p></div>		</li>
