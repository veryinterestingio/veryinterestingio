			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally, governments will go into debt to finance infrastructures, schools, big projects that should theoretically behave like an investment to the state (ie. Have a return on investment). Obviously this is pretty hard to quantify and it adds to this very bizzare economic system that we have. Basically it works on the premise that there always will be inflation and eternal economic growth. </p>
<p>Sometime the state will emit bonds at a negative rate (like what is happening in some places right now). That means people are willing to pay a fee to have their money &quot;frozen&quot; for ten years for exemple.</p>
<p>In the end, governments bonds is a pretty safe way to invest because states don't die and if the let's say the US is default on its debts, you will have bigger problems than money at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Issue more debt!</p>
<p>It sounds crazy, but thatâ€™s exactly what happens with large countries with stable economies.  As long as there are enough people looking to buy the debt, they can keep issuing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Q: Where does the $100 to buy the bond come from? A: Debt. The US government spends the fiat money into existence. No government debt means no $100 in private hands to buy a bond.</p></div>		</li>
