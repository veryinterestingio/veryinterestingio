			<div class="markdown"><p>The Wikipedia on this is pretty layman friendly, but the general idea is that fundamental particles (electrons, quarks, photons) are one dimensional. They're &quot;points&quot; without spatial extension.</p>
<p>Molecules are made up of atoms, atomic nuclei are made up of protons, protons are made up of quarks...what are quarks made up of? It's easy to follow the pattern and imagine that quarks are made up of some even more fundamental particle that we could find if only we could slice them open, but this is not the case. Quarks an electrons and the like have no internal structure. They can't, because they're one-dimensional points.</p>
<p>The water gets a little muddy because these particles do have a non-zero volume. However, this is due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, this is the size of its wave packet. Once that is accounted for, as far as anyone can tell, the size of an electrons interior is zero.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't quite right (at least not exactly). The &quot;size&quot; of a particle isn't really a precise thing in the mathematics of quantum mechanics. A particle is just a statistically-described disturbance in a field (a photon, for example, is a disturbance in the electromagnetic field).</p>
<p>Put another way, we usually talk about particles having an &quot;internal structure&quot;. The most elementary particles (like quarks and electrons) have no internal structure while others (like protons and atoms) do. The problem is that these things don't have a precise position or size in the usual meaning of those things in our day-to-day world. You can't stick a ruler on either side of a proton, for example, and see how wide it is. We can, however, measure its effect on the surrounding environment and define a radius which could be called its &quot;size&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you get into regions where quantum effects play a significant role, size becomes a slippery idea. Distance is linked with other attributes such as energy. What that means is describing the &quot;size&quot; of a particle doesn't really mean anything like it means in our day-to-day world.</p>
<p>A &quot;particle&quot; isn't really a physical thing in the sense we usually talk about. It's a disturbance in a field in space that isn't exactly a &quot;thing&quot; like a ball or a planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but spin determines how particle behaves, right? So they don't have classic angular momentum, but their interactions will be determined by spin, as would classic angular moment act on macro objects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spin is one factor of how elementary particles behave, however they certainly do have angular momentum that is analogous but not identical to classical angular momentum, i.e. you can draw an analogy between angular momentum associated with the earth revolving around the sun and an electron revolving around the nucleus. To get the entire picture of a particle's angular momentum you must consider both this orbital angular momentum and intrinsic spin angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since spin is a QM phenomenon, talking about size is undefined, since the uncertainty principle would come into play. We instead talk about their state or wave function.</p></div>		</li>
