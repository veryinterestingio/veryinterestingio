			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worthwhile to point out that the gut feeling can be and often is completely wrong. </p>
<p>That’s true of everyone sometimes, but you see extreme examples of this in people with anxiety disorders, who experience way more “false positive” alarms. </p>
<p>On the most extreme end are people with “not just right experiences” (NJRE) OCD. They chronically have the “gut feeling” that something is off and engage in minutes or even hours of rituals to shake the feeling and move on with even basic tasks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had 2 gut feeling in my life that turned out to be correct. One at 8 years old and one as an adult. The one I experienced as a child was a particularly bad experience. So much so, that if I believe I am having a gut feeling, it sometimes consumes me. </p>
<p>Problem is, as I have learned, I can trick myself into thinking I am having a gut feeling about something (the ‘false positive’ alarms) if I get really nervous or uncomfortable. (Example, going to an important job interview.)</p>
<p>However, I have found a method that works for me, that helps distinguish these feelings. I begin to count numbers out of order. (23, 6, 14, 37, 21, 5 etc.) I do this for upwards of a minute or two if necessary.</p>
<p>Have no clue why, but if it’s not a true ‘gut feeling’, counting out of order makes it go away. </p>
<p>As I discovered as an adult, involving another incident that triggered the gut feeling while out for a walk at 2am that did turn out to be correct, counting out of order did absolutely nothing to stop it. </p>
<p>Sorry for the book. Your comment about needing to do rituals made me remember this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you might accidentally be doing some form of mindfulness meditation. You are drawing your mind onto something you have to focus on and staying there for a while.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is great for calming whatever part of your brain goes crazy with anxiety. Techniques like that are what I do to handle my own problems with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you remember why you tried counting out of order the first time? It's such an unusual thing to do, I'm curious how you came up with it and why you thought it might help originally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent relevant book is 'Why People Believe Weird Things' by Michael Shermer. He talks about how it was an evolutionary advantage for us to recognize patterns and make connections based on very small amounts of evidence. But the drawback is that sometimes this misfires and we &quot;recognize&quot; a pattern that isn't and connections that aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was one of the first skeptical books I read on the paranormal, a lifetime ago when I was 26 and before the Internet was ubiquitous. It was very illuminating and had great rational explanations. I had never heard of hypnopompic or hypnagogic dreams, yet he perfectly described “scary” experiences I had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m diagnosed with anxiety, and I can’t. Growing up I never really understood the whole gut feeling thing since I’m always anxious about everything and could never trust my “gut”.  I honestly thought it was just a tv thing for the longest time. Then as an adult I was diagnosed with anxiety and became aware that other people actually do get gut feelings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are aware of the feeling, not the process that causes the feeling. The subconscious is connected to the conscious mind - they're not two different computers working in your brain. It's all one big computer and some programs are running in the background. You don't notice them until they throw out a pop-up notification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every single answer here doesn't explain why the feeling is literally in your gut though. Like anxiety, or being excited, or being rejected and having your heart sink, it's all in your gut and it's all different but similar feelings. What about those emotions creates those physical gut feelings?</p></div>		</li>
