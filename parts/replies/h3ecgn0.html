<p>I've heard, and this is a long time ago so may not be entirely accurate, that once the new transplanted kidney takes some of the filtering load, the old kidneys sometimes actually start working better again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reflecting to the part that they said that they don't want to cut existing blood vessels away from the old kidney, but then how will the new kidney get all those blood vessels? Do they just place it in the body and hope that it will build the blood vessels?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They do this for pretty much everyone getting kidneys, honestly. As you said, it's cuz you just need to attach somewhere to a decent blood supply...but it's also because it's an easily accessible area and, when it comes down to it, our body doesn't really have a ton of spare room to just shove things into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For immediate dialysis, a temporary catheter is placed in the neck. Then that's removed and a more permanent one is placed in the chest usually, although it is possible to also place one in the groin. I have an AV fistula (don't google images) which is an abnormal connection between artery and vein. It's my left arm so now they stick needles in my left arm. Fistula is gold standard for dialysis because it has least chance of thrombosis and scabs are really good at preventing infection.  </p>
<p>So basically, your circulatory system is like a bunch of roads all connected together at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The kidneys do have a huge number of complicated blood vessels internally, but just one artery in and one vein out (plus one ureter). So tying those off isn't really time consuming or difficult on the scale of surgical procedures. But it is an additional procedure and unnecessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily.  They can sometimes have multiple blood vessels in and multiple out.  They did an angiogram on me (donor) to determine how many vessels in/out for each of my kidneys.  They said they wouldn't try the transplant if there are multiple small blood vessels.  They chose to take the left one because it did have just one in/out.</p>
<p>But you are correct that for the recipient, it is an additional procedure that is unnecessary.</p></div>		</li>
