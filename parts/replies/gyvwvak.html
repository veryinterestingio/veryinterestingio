			<div class="markdown"><p>Great stuff. Very informative. Do you know the rate at which mRNA denatures? Like, how fast will a nanogram (I assume this is the scale used in cells, but I can convert no problem) fall apart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bear in mind the vaccines are not using normal mRNA though. They are using modified mRNA, containing pseudouridine in place of uridine. This extends the lifespan of the mRNA.</p>
<p>That said, it's certainly still temporary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting stuff. Just as a note, disruption of the brains ability to auto-regulate blood pressure is a big deal, so if there was a clinically significant impact on this, we would know. See RCVS or PRES.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I agree. The body has numerous ways of controlling blood pressure. A mild inhibition of ACE2 would cause a tiny drop in blood pressure that would be imperceptible to almost everyone. ACE inhibitors are the first-line drugs for high blood pressure for a reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they do as it has been mentioned by the EMA and on several studies about LNPs. Given that they are injected intramuscularly though, there might not be a lot of LNPs that pass the BBB, but it seems like some does; mRNA contained by it as well.</p></div>		</li>
