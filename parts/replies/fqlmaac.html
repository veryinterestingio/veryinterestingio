			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thank you so much for the very detailed insights, I wasn't aware of the MACHO idea! Your reply prompts for further questions on the distribution of dark matter across a galaxy, but I have to read about these before making any questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The current rate sets a limit on the abundance of MACHOs, and we don't see anywhere close to the required amount.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When speaking of the current rate, are you refering to both black holes that form and those that do not form systems with nearby stars? If so and especially for the lonely black holes, does this limited number associates with the limited amount of time we 've been observing space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is for black holes moving in front of stars from other star systems - it's much easier to detect black holes that are in a binary. Microlensing events are rare but not super rare - we've seen thousands of them over the years, mostly from stars lensing other stars. Massive black holes should give off lots of very strong microlensing events, and we've got a big enough sample to run the statistics and basically rule out a huge unknown population of MACHOs.</p></div>		</li>
