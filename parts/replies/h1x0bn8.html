			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, people think/thought that about my little brother because every time he was eating, he ate much. They never realized that he never ate breakfast or snacked or drank soda or the like. He just ate one big meal a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One meal crew! I'm a bit less skeletal now (probably because I have better eating habits) but especially growing up people would tell me I need to eat more all the damn time, unless they saw me eating, then they'd tell me it's not fair that I can eat so much and not gain weight. Can't win.</p>
<p>It's practised as a diet plan now (intermittent fasting) which is kind of wild to me because I've always known it as a shitty eating pattern responsible for my BMI having barely ever crept into the &quot;healthy&quot; range. But I guess I'm at least proof that it's a good way to maintain whatever weight you end up at, I've not changed more than a stone since my teens. I've always wanted to gain and retain a bit of weight but I think I'll be absolutely aghast when I actually have to buy new clothes in a different size for the first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who was underweight for the first 30 years of my life, this is certainly true. I’m sure I overestimated how much I ate and underestimated how much I moved. HOWEVER, there is a drastic change in middle age that is absolutely physiological. I eat very healthy (very rarely have sweets), run several times a week, and run a marathon every year. I’m far more physically active than I ever was when I was in my 20s. Yet, I’m a bit overweight cannot lose weight without a huge calorie deficit. The one time I’ve lost weight, it took strict marathon training and limiting myself to 1100 calories/day (corrected for exercise) just to lose any weight at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in my case it's not a &quot;fast metabolism&quot;, I think my digestion is just very ineffective. I can eat as much as a fat person and don't be active, but I'm still a bit underweight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know alot of people say the 'I eat like a fat person yet am underweight' but no joke every single time without fail when we go in-depth together about how many calories their actually consuming in a day to day basis they were over estimating it because the meal feels large to them. I'm not stating that is the case for you for all I know you could genuinely have some kind if undiagnosed disorder that results in you being able to eat a rediculous amount and not gain weight, outliers do exist. Can you confidently say you've tracked every single calorie you consumed in a week and can say for certain you're eating like 3k + calories every single day and are still underweight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. I have a always-skinny-but-eat-normal friend who claimed to eat as much as me and when we were on a seven day holiday it very quickly became obvious that he underestimated my consumption.</p>
<p>No snacks, no in between meals, no alcohol in the evening, no real breakfast, always going for the lighter stuff on the menu - it was appearant that he could not keep up in the slightest and we both had a reality check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was underweight, I thought I ate a ton. Turns out I was only eating 1400 calories a day. I tried to increase the amount and I felt sick and way over full when I got to 1600.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that was the case with me. was 181cm and hovered between 56 to 60kg all through high school and college. people said i had a fast metabolism because i ate huge portions but never got fat. then i went to australia, and where i lived had a domino's next door. gained 20kg over 8 months without even trying. it was just way too easy to order a pizza on the app on my way back from campus then pick it up before going home. uber eats also contributed a lot. i spent ridiculous amounts of money on fast food due to how convenient it is.
after a lifetime of being called the skinny, sickly looking kid, now all my friends are making fun of my man boobs. i need to exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was working out with a very good buddy of mine for a year. And while I was eating 3.500 kcal + a day, he stayed under 3k. We both tracked our consumption, even both set the same macro nutritient goal. On the days we were not working out,  I was gaming. He was still going to Handball practice twice a week and going jogging an additional two times a week. We started at roughly the same weight. And guess who gained weight faster. Him. While he built up muscles fast, I hardly gained muscles. I also did not gain fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, outliers do exist I can't confirm your anecdotal evidence but that doesn't mean it's invalid. But for literally 95% of the population everyone has extremely similar levels of calorie expenditure when accounting for all outside factors (weight, amount of exercise etc).</p></div>		</li>
