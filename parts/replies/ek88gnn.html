			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, those super cold samples are so small that the simple answer is not much. We're frequently talking on the scale of atoms.</p>
<p>For these larger ones, potentially frostbite or similar localised cold exposure things if they stay in contact with you long enough and are large enough. Worth remembering though that the specific heat of water is over 10 times that of copper (and other metals), and the human body is largely water. Placed near to a vital organ (placed on chest near your heart) it could do enough to maim/kill, if it's at an extremity (hand/foot) you'd possibly get hypothermia (from the cold returning blood) but with medical attention I don't expect you'd die.</p>
<p>As an example, to warm 1kg of copper up from -273 to 27 degrees C is a difference of 300 deg. At copper's specific heat of 0.385 J/g/C that would be 115 500 J. For water's specific heat of 4.186 J/g/C, you'd cool down 1kg of water by ~27 degrees. Because your blood is flowing around it's hard to judge just how much water would be affected though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There could very easily be a natural anomaly that we have not yet discovered, or another intelligent civilization with their own super freezers. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On average. The CMBR doesn't 'heat' space to the exact same temperature everywhere but miniscule as the fluctuations are, the underlying reason for them might be the key to understand the matter distribution and general structure of the (observable) universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that false color map of the CMBR looks like it shows wild variations, but that really just represents fractions of a percent of a percent differences. </p></div>		</li>
