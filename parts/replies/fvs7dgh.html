			<div class="markdown"><p>I can not thank you enough for such a comprehensive layperson-friendly explanation. I was one of those insanely sick high risk group folks (happily fully recovered), and while antibodies haven't and won't change how I act in public I am  a Covid+ plasma donor and would like to think I can continue to be helpful for a while. </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean they don’t want your blood if they found antibody for Covid?  Or will they treat it differently?  Can you infuse some of those blood to get immune?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad you made it! Basically the insane level of immune activation you had would have driven the production of memory B cells to produce antibodies. An asymptomatic person doesn't have the inflammatory signals required to activate Th and B cells as strongly, so its possible asymptomatic people lose antibodies but like you see above, that needs more research</p></div>		</li>
