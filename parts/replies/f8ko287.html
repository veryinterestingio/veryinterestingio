			<div class="markdown"><p>Well explained. Many deaths that occur after taking ecstasy/MDMA happen because of drinking too much water. The condition is called hyponatremia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a pretty hard death to pull off unless you are in either of those camps. You'd have to drink about 6 liters or 1 1/2 gallons in a few hours to generally pull off water intoxication. You're going to be feeling pretty terrible around liter 4 unless you have bad kidneys in which you'd die from that much or if you are in great shape in which case it could take more than 6 liters to do you in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's multiple reasons for this cause. The first is that MDMA makes you feel more thirsty due to your mouth getting dry from its stimulant properties when you're not actually thirsty and don't need any more water.</p>
<p>The second is that it reduces your ability to urinate, so your body hsa a more  difficult time getting excess water out of the system.</p>
<p>The safest way to take MDMA is to not be active while taking the drug and drinking a normal amount of water that you would if not under the influence. Your body doesn't need any more water. Intense exercising is what makes people feel they need to drink a lot of water, and people are most likely to overdo it under that circumstance.</p>
<p>As a general rule it's important to take frequent breaks if dancing on MDMA. This is important particularly because the #1 cause of MDMA deaths is hyperthermia caused by the drug's stimulant properties coupled with using it in a badly ventilated room, or on a hot day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and when taking MDMA or psychedelic drugs, you should always do them near a sober person you trust (brother, friend, etc). Some people just react badly during their first time or be impaired and do something they’ll regret. It’s not like getting drunk, it’s a completely different state of mind. </p>
<p>And please don’t pop 3 Mollys at a daytime rave. Or trip on shrooms in public for your first time. Bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me several years ago during an MS150 ride (2 consecutive 75 mile bicycle rides, 1 each day).</p>
<p>Many people, myself included, party pretty hard on Friday night, and then wake up at 5AM to start the ride on Saturday.  I was pretty dehydrated, and was drinking water as fast as I could to feel better.  At about the 20 mile mark, I began to get VERY dizzy, with tunnel vision.  Luckily, there was a scheduled stop with a nurses tent.  She took one look at me, took my blood pressure, and demanded that I get into an ambulance immediately.</p>
<p>I lost consciousness on the way, and woke up with a bag of saline connected to my arm.  When I asked the doctor what would have happened if I would have kept riding, he said &quot;Oh, your organs would have just shut down and you'd have died.&quot;  Very matter of factly, and left the room.</p>
<p>From then on, I've rehydrated with Gatorade.  Much better plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or just put salt in your water. The main ingredient that makes Gatorade special is salt (carbs help with energy but really salt is the magic ingredient.)</p>
<p>I believe potassium helps too but... salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Props to the nurse who saved your life! I had a race volunteer notice me after a 10K looking odd. I just thought I was tired as I hadn't trained. Brings me into the med tent, take my temp: 108. Immediately dump me in an ice bath. I planned on just walking home after the race. Would have collapsed and died from heat stroke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to an air force boot camp recruit a few decades ago during their last field march before graduation. I remember doing the same thing a few years before the recruit passed and complaining to my drill sergeant that there is such a thing as too much water, as he was yelling at me to drink every last drop. Some of us ignored him and poured our canteens out while he wasn't looking so we could give our bladders a break. </p>
<p>The drill sergeant that accidentally killed this kid was only following the prescribed orders set down by good meaning people. But it was something that was a risk for years the way they almost waterboarded recruits by forcing them to drink shittones of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope they talked about supplements and taking them while deployed. When i was up north in 2004 it was not uncommon to see young soldiers and marines drop out due to kidney stones from all of the bullshit they were taking to 'stay fit'. I had to ground one of my guys from drinking gatorade.</p></div>		</li>
