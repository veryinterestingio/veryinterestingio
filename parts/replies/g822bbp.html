			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like Daniel Naroditsky. His chess is often critiqued by himself mostly as risky and wrong at some points, but his knowledge of tactics and maneuvers are top class and he’s able to take advantage of that against more historical/theory type players</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Long after Deep Blue was retired, Murray Campbell, one of the computer’s engineers, revealed that the illogical sacrifice was neither human interference nor artificial ingenuity. It was just a glitch. Deep Blue was designed to review every possible move and, using a rating system devised by Benjamin, pick the one with the highest chance of leading to victory. But the program was not perfect, and the developers installed a safeguard to make sure Deep Blue kept playing even if it couldn’t work out the best move. What Kasparov thought of as a spark of human intelligence was simply a computer algorithm getting hung up; unable to calculate the best move, the program instead produced a move at random.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of players do it in openings, mostly non-GMs. If you  and your opponent both know best lines of your opening, you will start actual game after move 10. But if you make slightly worse move earlier, you both start thinking for yourself, how to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah chess players study old games of chess. So when you start there is what like 20 possible first moves and everyone has a name. Now your opponent has 20 something possible second moves, and say 18 of those have historically ended up losing the game (at top level) so you don’t do those ones right. It cuts down the possible strategies quickly. As a game is in the middle you start to recognize patterns or patterns between key pieces compared to your key pieces and you try and predict what your opponent is trying to do and either bluntly counter to make them change what they’re planning or sneakily set a trap. So a lot is patterns and what move against a certain pattern is statistically going to win more often based on past games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did my undergrad at a university that had a national champion player (not US) in the department. So he would often do group matches for fun. I watched him play 9 people at once and win (almost) effortlessly. He'd just walk between boards and move, step, move, step, move, step and wait for the other person then immediately move, step... </p>
<p>The only time I ever made him pause was when I just started playing randomly, with zero thought or strategy. Things like, move my king out 3 moves into the game. You could see him stop and think &quot;wtf.... how do I respond to this&quot; I'm sure it was because he realized he was 6 moves closer to check-mate than he was before, but I still made him pause, which was a win for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is there a lot of “reading” people (like emotions, facial expressions, etc.) in chess like there is in poker? Or is it mostly just reading the pieces on the board?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way, this holds true of card games such as magic the gathering, or pokemon. Even though there is hidden information, the amount is small compared to games like poker. So given the player hands and the battlefield, only a few moves are correct.</p>
<p>Hidden information does allow strategies like bluffing opponents; for example there was a very powerful card called &quot;Settle the Wreckage&quot; in Magic: the Gathering. If the opponent went all in attacking you, you could spend some mana to get rid of <em>all</em> the attackers. The spell cost a lot of a specific colour of mana, but could make an opponent lose. So as long as you had that mana, you <em>didn't actually need to have the card</em> to get opponents to play cautiously.</p>
<p>Most games have enough public information that practice can be done alone. Chess is on one side of that spectrum, while poker is almost on the other side. They share some skills, but one is mostly a planning game while the other is a social bluffing game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A hard lesson I had to learn when I played magic was that it is always better to call the bluff. Every turn you wait is a chance for them to turn the game around. If they don't have that card, then you are just giving them time to draw it. If they do have that card, then you are boned anyway, so might as well make them use it and get it over with before they get a chance to set up an even stronger board position. There are always exceptions of course, but calling the bluff should be the default response unless you have a very good reason to wait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah, obviously. Playing against yourself is an exercise in analyzing your own strategies and weaknesses. It can be enjoyable in it's own right, but it's not really the point of the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, chess is fun because there is no right answer to every move. Theres an optimal move and then theres a lesser optimal. A grandmaster just sees maybe more moves ahead than a beginner. Theres strategies that doesn't make sense in the beginning such as sacrificing 2 pawns for nothing for an upper hand later down. Is it the right move to lose 2 pieces for nothing at that moment? No one can say until the end result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a stunt where a person can play 100 opponents simultaneously against any skill level without even understanding how to play chess.</p>
<p>All he's doing is taking the last opponent's move and using it as his own move on the next player he has mentally paired up.  They're actually playing against each other and he is only serving as a proxy between players.  </p>
<p>You do have to set it up so half the opponents move first so you can feed their moves to the other half they're paired with.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah the above stunt must end in a 50/50 win/loss rate plus an even draw rate, as you are just absorbing the sum of wins, losses, and draws of all the other players.  Against high caliber chess players, that would be impressive, if you were actually playing.  </p>
<p>It seems impressive to even keep up playing, with these multiple games and their strategies in your head to make sensible moves- which of course you're not actually doing.</p></div>		</li>
