			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a followup question.
Are neurons single information or whole memory? As in 1 neuron = the girl i saw at the party.
OR
The girl I saw at the party is compromised of several neurons connected together as in one neuron for date, one for party, one for girl, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, rather that girl is billions of nuerons firing in a specific order. </p>
<p>Consider this. I have multiple pools filled with water. Above that pool are billions of colors in capsules called nuerons. </p>
<p>In order to form the unique &quot;memory&quot; these nuerons fire in a specific order that changes the pool continuously. You never get 1 solid color as thr pool seems to reset at vivid points. That entire string of colors the pool creates IS the memory. That happens a near infinite amount in a day. </p>
<p>That same girl fires different nuerons in different people.</p>
<p>Nueros are just a switch that activates other neurons and parts of thr brain that make the girl actually real. Your memories are just those strings of firings. If your brain gets damaged that string.</p>
<p>I'm not a nuero scientist, but I love reading about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so technically this explains mandela effect. Since if you are fed info to change certain neurons, whole memory changes, doesn't it?
Also, wouldn't that mean that trying to remember things is best done by following neuron leads? As in a simple example - I want to remember the girl on the party, so I follow &quot;location neurons&quot;, &quot;other people neurons&quot;, &quot;whatever other distinct stuff happened there neurons&quot; to force neuron &quot;roads&quot; to connect where I want it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 neuron is like one pixel, if the memory is purely imagery. A specific pattern would be a larger shape.</p></div>		</li>
