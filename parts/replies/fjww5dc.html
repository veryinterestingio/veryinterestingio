			<div class="markdown"><p>Fyi, this is wrong. With PV=nRT when a gas expands, it cools. Since there is a difference in temperature between the gas end it's surroundings, it will trend towards equilibrium and the gas will absorb heat from the surroundings, cooling them down. </p>
<p>But in a can of compressed air that's not all that's happening. The can uses a liquid propellant, so when you release the pressure by pressing the nozzle, the liquid propellant boils off, absorbing heat during the phase change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>God dammit. This is what's actually happening, how did I mess that up.</p>
<p>I think what I did was just shorthand it...and lost a little of the precision in the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isnt the only effect that causes temp to lower, this occurs with just compressed gas cylinders and no propellant as well.  The primary driver is the conversion of internal stored energy into kinetic energy of the gas leaving, and the subsequesnt reestablishing of equilibrium which means the leftover gas absorbs thermal energy from its surrounding which we feel as the can getting colder.</p></div>		</li>
