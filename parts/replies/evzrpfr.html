			<div class="markdown"><p>Cardiac muscle can use lactate as an energy source. The problem is when you have severe hypoxia as lactate does not have enough energy to sustain ventricular contractions on its own. The result is heart failure but the lactate is not the cause, it's the lack of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aerobic respiration on the cellular level results in the production of 34 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules from one glucose molecule which is what our body uses for energy.  Without oxygen, the same glucose molecule results in 2 ATP molecules and lactic acid.  So aerobic respiration is 17 times more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re interested in reading more look up the “Warburg Effect”. I’m under qualified to do it justice, but essentially there’s two ways to use glucose: aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic uses oxygen to fully breaks down the glucose, and it’s used to provide energy. Anaerobic doesn’t use oxygen and produces some energy, but leaves some chunks of glucose. Those chunks are then used by cancer cells as building blocks to fuel their growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, cancer cela are generally largely anaerobic because the tumor develops without developping enough vessels so they have to be anaerobic. They can be aerobic though, they have all the genetic material to do so!</p></div>		</li>
