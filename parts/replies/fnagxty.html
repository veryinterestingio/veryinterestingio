			<div class="markdown"><p>We have had <a href="https://blikmobile.pl/en/" target="_blank">BLIK</a> in Poland for a few years now, and honestly it's a game changer. You can make instant transfers even if you only know the recpient's phone number. Also, anywhere you would use a debit card you can use a one-time code from your banking app instead. And it just works, it's amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I wonder what the factors are when it comes to adoption of new payment technologies. You'd think that countries with high GDP and urbanization rates would be the first to switch, but for some reason Central and Eastern European countries have the best adoption rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instant payments is still relatively new to the EU with not all banks participating yet. UK has Faster Payments too with all major banks and others accepting it.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it it's just old outdated systems that wouldn't be able to handle it I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 56% of all EU banks support SEPA ICT.
6% of all EU transfers are going through that system already.</p>
<p>Plus most individual countries have their own systems for fast national transfers. Spain has Bizum. Holland has iDeal/Tikkie. Etc etc</p></div>		</li>
