<p>Hi, happy to explain. We've developed a new Cas9 fusion protein (Cas9-HR), which specifically increases HDR rates (exactly like your 2000bp knock-in) by roughly 2-4X. It does this by manipulating Cas9 induced double-strand break repair choice to favor HR/HDR specifically at the target site, via a unique mechanism. Interestingly, we've also seen significant reductions of reduction in gene-editing induced toxicity (significantly less cells die using Cas9-HR vs Cas9, in certain cell lines), and we've also seen significant reduction in markers of genomic stress when using Cas9-HR vs Cas9. </p>
<p>Practically, you'd likely see a higher percentage of cells containing your desired knockin if you used Cas9-HR vs Cas9, at a bare minimum saving you time and money. It may or may not apply to your case, but increasing the knock-in efficiency 2-4X might be the difference between clinically viable vs non-viable levels of editing, and is something we're looking forward to investigating soon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, that clarifies it, thanks. I think the way you presented it in your original post is a little misleading - clearly the nonscientists in the thread are under the impression that long insertions are the new thing you're doing, rather than the increased efficiency. A few other questions, if I could:</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the fusion protein? </li>
<li>What HDR donors have you tested with - plasmid? Aav? Lnp/dna complexes? </li>
<li>Someone else mentioned you've done your testing so far in cancer cells. Have you looked at how it works in primary cells, specifically hpscs? </li>
<li>Obviously there are a lot of different processes in the knock-in that impact efficiency - if I for example used a really low AAV MOI then increasing it would have a huge effect, but at a higher level it makes little difference. What do the other parameters of the knock-in process look like in order for you to observe this 2-4x increase in efficiency - are they all optimised for max performance or do you have some other things below optimum in order to see anything? For context, depending on what we're putting in, we can get 60% insertion with spy-fy cas9 and AAV in hpscs.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, as a non-biological-scientist myself, I know the explanations can get pretty technical. We do have a simpler, more general explanation about the science on our website, here: <a href="https://crisp-hr.com/science" target="_blank">https://crisp-hr.com/science</a></p></div>		</li>
