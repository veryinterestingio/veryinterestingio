			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't really messing up the spelling of a word though. When you mess up the spelling or letter order of a word, you are still using valid letters in the language. If you throw random strokes all over the place, you are likely no longer using valid radicals.  </p>
<p>Instead of messing up stroke position, consider simply messing up a radical. For example: 情, 请, and 清 are all phonetically similar; a native speaker could recognize the intended meaning and also the mistake.  </p>
<p>Chinese can also misunderstand the intended character for a word they frequently hear. For example, on a shopping list, my mother in law wrote &quot;豆付&quot;, which is a misunderstanding of the second character &quot;豆腐“ (tofu). And no, it wasn't an intentional abbreviation. It was more like when an English speaker says &quot;mute point&quot; instead of &quot;moot point.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the second simplification phase? They planned on going even further!? After 4 years of chinese I hated it for its complexity but I always felt simplified was even harder as the characters start to lose their derivation, becoming seemingly random unrelated characters shoved togethor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do.  </p>
<p>They also describe the character by radial. For example:<br />
三点水的清: The &quot;qing&quot; with the three water dots radical.  </p>
<p>It is also common to hear clarification based on a word that the character is in. For example:<br />
清楚的清: The &quot;qing&quot; in &quot;qingchu&quot; (clear).  </p>
<p>I believe (from interactions with Japanese classmates) that Japanese speakers also clarify Kanji in similar ways sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally when there is a misunderstanding I usually go “no, it’s the character in (well-known name/phrase specific character appears in), not what you said”</p>
<p>An example would be 心 and 馨, both with the same pronunciation. I would go “I actually meant the 馨 in 温馨” or something similar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Chinese characters are very specific and each character has to be written as it is. You can't really play around with spelling the way you can with english.</p>
<p>For example, these two words mean completely different things: 日 and 曰. (Sun and &quot;said&quot; in old Chinese)</p>
<p>So yeah if you're jumbling up the actual strokes within the characters itself, it will mean something else and be complete gibberish.</p>
<p>Some other fun ones:
庆 厌 (celebrate and hate)
天 夫 (sky and wife)
未 末 (future and end)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>夫 actually means husband or man, for example in 丈夫 (husband), 农夫 (farmer), 姐夫 (older sister’s husband), and both 夫妻 and 夫妇 (both mean husband and wife). And in the common phrase 国家兴亡，匹夫有责 (for the prosperity or death of a country, every man is responsible). </p>
<p>What can be confusing is that 夫人 means lady (in the noble sense) or wife, for example 第一夫人 (First Lady).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think 夫人 as &quot;the husband's person&quot;, in literal translation, then it would imply the wife. It comes from the patriarchal mindset in some Asian cultures, and you can see it 內人 and in Japanese, 奥さん, meaning &quot;[my] person inside [the house]&quot;, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the difference in future and end just the swapping of the horizontal lines? If so, how incredibly difficult that must be? When reading Chinese does context of preceding words make one intuitively know that it would “end” in this instance and not “future”? “Start there and ‘”end” there. “</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it differs by the horizontal lines. The stroke lengths and positions are very important for all words and kids are taught since young to write them properly. Although technically it is no different from making sure your d does not look like a, or f doesn't look like t.</p>
<p>Also for the specific examples of 未 and 末, there is enough nuance between the 2 that intermediate speakers won't get them confused. To put it simply, they are usually paired up with completely different words, for instance 未来 means the future, while 末日 means the end of days. I can't think of any examples of the top of my head where either 未 or 末 can fit perfectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way: the only difference between h and n is the length of the vertical line on the left. Apart from some rare cases involving sloppy handwriting and overlapping orthographies, like &quot;now&quot; and &quot;how&quot;, are you ever confused which one you're looking at while reading English text?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>In Chinese many things that we think of as words in English are actually phrases. Actually OP was not precise enough in the exact definitions of the word.</p>
<p>未 signifies that something has not happened so when you pair it with 來(come,arrived) it will become 未來(has not happened to come/arrived, i.e. future) while.</p>
<p>While 末 signifies the last. So if you pair it with 日(day) to make 末日 it will be the last day.</p>
<p>The above example contains commonly seen phrases so many people will not confuse between them but when they are written(wrongly) not in a commonly seen phrase or singularly, the misunderstanding can be humourous or disaster based on your perspective. If written wrongly in a phrase that the reader knows, it's rather easy to know what the writer is conveying while acknowledging that the word was written wrongly.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Without empirical evidence, someone could just as easily draw that conclusion about English: that if you are mixing up the order if the actual letters, it will mean something else and be complete gibberish.  We need testing to know.</p>
<p>I suggest reframing the question as &quot;how much can you scramble the strokes within characters and have it remain readable?&quot;.   The fact that hand written Chinese is legible proves that legibility is robust against some minor variations.  To know how much more can be changed and have it remain legible we need experimental results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason it can be gibberish is because the end result could literally be a character that doesn't exist and cannot be pronounced because it has no pronunciation. If I mix up the letters in a word, say &quot;pineapple&quot; to &quot;ipnelpepa&quot;, the meaning is completely gone but technically you can still pronounce that. </p>
<p>I would say it's near impossible to get any quantifiable data from jumbling up chinese characters because the permutations can be so insanely large for just 1 character. You can look at a chinese character, e.g. 我, like a piece of canvas. You could shift the strokes around a small bit or literally all over the canvas and it could have wildly different interpretations.</p></div>		</li>
