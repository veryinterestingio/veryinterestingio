<p>Back when it was mono audio this was true, but there's usually a bunch of other shit in crammed in the upper half of the 200kHz band assignment for stereo audio, radio data system signals (i.e., how newer radios can scroll text for station identification and the current song playing), etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radio station 103.1 MHz is given a 200kHz band from 103.0 to 103.2.</p>
<p>The baseline monoaural audio (i.e. L+R) is broadcast midchannel +/- 15kz (I.e. 103.100 to 103.115).</p>
<p>Stereo is achieved by means of a pilot signal at 19kHz (i.e. 103.119) for recreation of the carrier for the L-R suppressed carrier signal at 38+/-15kHz (i.e. 103.123-103.153), and some signal processing.</p>
<p>Radio Data System signal hangs out at 57kHz (i.e., 103.157).</p>
<p>So.   In this example, when you tune your radio reciever to 103.1 and it starts scrolling a marquee that you're listening to W/K(XXX), identifies the genre as a Top40/Pop station, and notes what's currently playing in lovely FM Stereo, the receiver is processing four different signals at 103.100, 103.119, 103.138, and 103.157 MHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there is not actually one single frequency being emitted. In FM, they take the baseband (Audio stereo + the RDS (text display on your car radio)) and use it to modulate the frequency of what is called a carrier. The carrier is that specific frequency in the radio name. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Numbers are entirely made up for sake of example.</p>
<p>A frequency is an exact measurements of how often something happens. For example, a 2,100 kHz frequency is a signal being broadcast 2,100 thousand times per second.</p>
<p>A band is a collection of continuous frequencies. For example, a station could broadcast on the 2,000 kHz to 2,200 kHz band.</p>
<p>Realistically, you need a little buffer on either end so you don't get signals overlapping (in other words, to account for error in transmitting and receiving). If everything were perfect, we could have one station at 2,100 kHz and the next at 2,101 kHz, and nothing would go wrong. In the real world, however, the signals start to bleed together, so we give them a solid amount of breathing room.</p>
<p>If a station wants to broadcast text, however, they have to (or at least do) transmit that on a different frequency than the audio. So you could have the audio on 2,100 kHz, the station name on 2,150 kHz, and the song info on 2,050 kHz, which is three frequencies in the 2,000-2,200 kHz band the station is allocated.</p>
<p>That said, see /u/agate_ 's post for why the tech doesn't work quite like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not it.  Any signal carrying information will be spread out over a range of frequencies, whether it's TV or radio. (This is where the word &quot;bandwidth&quot; comes from.) Radio station 103.1 Mhz is actually allocated a range from 103.0 to 103.2 Mhz.</p>
<p>Radio stations actually do have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcast_band#ITU_Region_2_bandplan_and_channel_numbering" target="_blank">channel numbers</a> too, they're just rarely used.</p>
<p>One interesting side-note: American TV and FM radio channels actually occupy some of the same frequency ranges.  Channels 2-6 range from 54 to 88 Mhz; then FM radio runs from 88.1 to 107.9 Mhz; then there's some other stuff, then channels 7-13, starting at 174 Mhz.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't work nowadays with digital TV, but back when it was all analog you could actually get the audio from TV stations on a radio sometimes. Used to play Jeopardy on car trips that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why all the radio stations are odd numbers? Because they started with 88.0 to 88.2, and just went from there? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Odd numbers are used to reduce interference caused by harmonics.</p>
<p>They <em>could</em> have chosen even numbers, e.g. station 103.2 could have been allocated the frequencies between 103.1 and 103.3.</p>
<p>And in fact, in Japan, the frequencies are packed closer together and so both odd and even frequencies are used.</p>
<p>The reason we use odd numbers whenever possible is to avoid interference caused by harmonics. No transmitter is perfect, so if you're transmitting at 103.1, there's a little leakage at 206.2 and so forth. Likewise, if some other transmitter is transmitting at 51.55, there's a little leakage at 103.1. Thus, a nearby wireless mic running at 51.55 MHz could interfere with a far-away FM radio station running at 103.1</p>
<p>So frequencies are assigned so that their harmonics don't cause trouble further up the spectrum. There's nothing transmitting at 51.55. Instead, there might be transmitters at 51.5 and 51.6. Neither of those frequencies resonate at a frequency assigned to any FM radio station.</p>
<p>Likewise, you won't find anything using 206.2 (biomedical telemetry devices). Grandma's medical device would use 206.3 and be safe from interference from a nearby radio station.</p>
<p>You see this principle all over the place. The IF frequency in an FM radio is 10.7 MHz so its harmonics don't interfere with any nearby radios. With analog TV, the horizontal refresh, vertical refresh, and color subcarrier were all chosen so that their harmonics would miss each other.  It gets pretty sophisticated, actually. Read up on &quot;comb filters&quot; to learn how complex it could get.</p></div>		</li>
