			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah I was thinking energy and rationalized with ideal gas law, but cold air is more dense therefore due to nature of atmosphere, more pressure. Whoops, i totes thought about density but wasn't quite sure how it fit in, now that I've researched some I will admit am wrong</p>
<p>Edit: I will say that it is annoying thinking about that after taking physics knowing PV=nRt where V n and R are constant so an increase in t would be a increase in pressure, but it's not the case cause atmosphere doesn't have constant V. Instead it's a formula of density where (row) = P/(Rt). But P and density(row) are changing in relation to each. P wants to be 14.7psia or 101kpa, so if we keep that in mind we will have lower density with higher temperature and higher density with low temp. While I said P wants to be 14.7psia it actually is not, it really changes with respect to density, the more dense / cold air you have the higher the pressure just because of weight of the air. The only way I really grasp it is to assume everything is in constant motion and is always attempting to get to 14.7psia.</p></div>		</li>
