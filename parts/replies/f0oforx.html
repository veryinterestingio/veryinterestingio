			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think Earth will always refer to our home planet, since we don't go around saying we discovered other earths, but rather, exoplanets generally, or earth-like planets / super-earths to refer to specific categories of exoplanets.  But &quot;Earth&quot; seems to stand alone as a formal name for our planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't really need to use them at all, but they are popular in sci-fi. They are no more or less correct than other names. I guess you're calling them neutral because the language (latin) is dead? Maybe that would lead to them being more easily accepted, but who knows? It could just as easily be some other convention, or even a lack of convention, moving forward.</p></div>		</li>
