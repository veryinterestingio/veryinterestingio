			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It pretty much negates the means of a church. That is, you dont need a church to know God. For example, Catholicism makes a point about you must go to mass and you must listen to a Priest to experience God. Not the case here, you can know God directly and without help (and without giving folk your cash, and we cant have that now).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of but not entirely. Gnostics historically have been Christian (though the orthodox church declared them heretics), so they believe in Jesus as the Christ, but conceive of his role differently than orthodox Christians.</p>
<p>Rather than being a blood sacrifice for humanities sins, Christ is the saviour as a result of showing humanity the way to achieve gnosis, know god and return to the pleroma (the All or the Wholeness, kind of like heaven but not quite the same; essentially returning to oneness with god, but possibly still maintaining our individuality at the same time, depending on the sect/tradition).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding this is the central belief of gnosticism. As in you can still believe in a singular God, rather than the two, and still be a gnostic as long as you hold that such knowledge is accessible to any person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To any person who is capable of knowing it. In most ancient gnostic systems, you're able to access knowledge because your soul is a piece of God that dwells (or is trapped) in the world. Some systems also say that there are people walking around who don't have souls and therefore can't gain knowledge of God.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see how you can be a Gnostic without also believing in the fool god who created the material world. What would discourage differentiate you from any other monotheistic?</p></div>		</li>

They call it (Moni Sect). Quanzhou used to be the start point of the sea version of the Silk Road so that's how it got there.</p></div>		</li>
