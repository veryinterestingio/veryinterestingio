One of those might be floating out there randomly and you might just happen to collide with it since they are small and fairly hard to notice, and because there is no atmosphere in space they might have a relative velocity compared to you a sizable fraction of the speed of light, which could cause that collision to be very damaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats a good point<br />
seeing battleships fire just chunks of metal from railguns at hypersonic velocities and blowing through dozens of steel plates, how could we possibly go much, much faster and survive hitting /anything/ ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I’ve seen them explain it in sci-fi books is a bunch of lasers near the front of the ship who’s whole job is to destroy small particles before they hit the ship itself. This honestly doesn’t seem practical by today’s technology but once we start going fractions of lightspeed who knows I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about going appreciable fractions of light speed then even space dust is going to rip holes into your ship.  That's one of the reasons why science fantasy tends to have things like deflector fields to hand-wave away the some of the hazards of interstellar travel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A steep gradient doesn't mean a thing without a strong enough force to matter. A grain of sand has an extremely steep gradient close to its surface (because the distance to its center of mass is very small) but it doesn't have enough mass for you to notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was gonna comment this. The only way to tell if the planets gravity was effecting you is to notice your trajectory change relative to the stars around you. You would need hella advanced tec for that though.</p>
<p>It would be more likely you'd see stars getting eclipsed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't feel it, but you would measure the change in your velocity. Velocities can be tracked <em>really</em> accurately via the Doppler effect (the same thing that makes an ambulance change its pitch when it's driving past you).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Which wave would you be tracking though? EM waves from stars? Detecting redshifts and blueshifts? Or maybe using gravity waves from known twin stars or blackholes? Or even both?</p>
<p>I'm just curious as to how this would be made to work.</p></div>		</li>
