			<div class="markdown"><p>You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is so stupid because that could literally spell the end to our species. If you junk up low earth orbit with debris we'll be stuck on a single planet that, aside to being vulnerable to things we are doing/might do to it, would only take one decent asteroid/supervolcano/GRB/etc. to bring an end to our dominance on this planet. But that's fine, it's not like our planet has a history of catastrophic extinction events. </p>
<p>At least the next species that evolved would have a lot of fun with archeology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that's an attack though. There was no sweeping behave to suggest it was hunting, the bite itself was fairly lazy. If I were to hazard a guess it was just coasting along saw something new, maybe it's senses you mentioned picked it up so the shark gave a test nibble. I think the shark was just curious here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this: smarter every day just released a video about sonar and submarines in the US navy. Submarines would likely be the way that any country would try to sever internet connections. It may interest OP to look at the video and see how countries defend themselves from any underwater espionage. </p>
<p>Though not directly related to the question, it is interesting to see how submarines work and then extrapolate how difficult it would be to actually attack a countries fiber optic cables without being detected and intercepted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Encryption</p>
<p>The US Government including military uses lines that they don't own to communicate all the time.  They just encrypt the data so it can't be changed or read, much like your own computer does with banking (except theoretically better).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one is tapping at the underwater cable itself (with fiber). The days of tapping submarine cable was when they were all copper coax. It has been absolutely proven in some of Snowden's releases that Five Eyes countries were tapping fiber cable at the terminal land stations, but there it was with pre-built taps for them (things like Room 641A).</p>
<p>It was much easier to do with coax because of the cable design, and easier to patch up afterwards (or even use non-physical detection techniques of the field surrounding the cable). But with fiber, the actual fibers are surrounded by, among other things, the copper power conductor for the high-voltage DC to power the repeaters and branching units. One couldn't get around not having to shunt the cable to gain access to the fiber. And even then, to install a splitter you still have to cut the fiber before splicing it in, which would immediately alert the owners, whose revenue is in the 1000s of dollars a minute for submarine traffic.</p>
<p>Even boosting becomes an issue because of how sensitive these systems' optical power needs are. What's more, any splice and especially any amplifier (to cover up the degraded signal) are easy to detect with optical time-domain reflectometry by the terminal stations, which immediately would be run in the event of the aforementioned power and signal alarms going off. A COTDR trace would show the extra spike of the tap's repeater.</p>
<p>What we have absolutely seen is state-actor involved sabotage and deliberate cutting of cables. Still, it is so much more logistically easier for an intelligence service to attach a tap on land. Where you already have the fiber out of the cable and aren't working right next to kill-you-dead voltages and leaving very obvious physical evidence of alteration to cable. All the more so, since we know that landings like those next to GCHQ Bude such tapping routinely occurs already.</p></div>		</li>
