			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, thought i was forgetting something obvious. Thanks.</p>
<p>To ELI5; It's a fat layer attached to one side of the intestines. It looks something like a ruffled fan, holding the intestines in place so they mostly can't twist around or tangle up. It also holds blood vessels leading to each segment; damage to the mesentery may lead to ischemia (basically damage from blood loss), which is another not-so-fun outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ruffled fan is a good way to describe it. In monkeys, if the animal is kind of fat, you can peel the mesentery away from the intestines in one piece and get a kind of floral shape going on. <a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/images2/mesentery.jpg" target="_blank">Like this illustration kind of shows.</a></p></div>		</li>

I’ve heard they lift out the intestines to get to the uterus and then kinda just shove them back in, does this hold the intestines in the shape they should be?

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest this is exactly what my wife's gyno did. Not doubting other posters but I have pics, I felt like the videographer for a horror film. He quite literally cut her open, pulled out a fair amount of guts and sat them on her tummy. Snatched out a baby, then not so gently shoved them back in and stapled her ass shut. Whole thing took maybe 5 minutes. </p>
<p>Fun side note, while in there he found/cauterized a tiny something (smaller than a pea) on her fallopian tube. Charged $5000 for 'tumor removal'. It's good to be a OB/GYN I guess.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For anyone reading this that has been through a pneumothorax, or anyone who knows someone that did, there is a small but helpful subreddit that provides some support and discussion. </p>
<p>Some of the posts can be NSFL, and if you’re not exposed to the difficulties around the process of recovery then it can be hard to read. Just wanted to post this hear because it might help someone going through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. My kid had open heart surgery and I was so fucking worried about the x-rays showing air in their chest afterward. Took a lot of faith in the PICU cardiology team not to freak out on them about how seemingly-cavalier they were being, especially after we got home and the last radiologist's report showed up in MyChart talking about increased midline atelectasis. &quot;Oh no that's normal it'll be fine&quot; ughhh!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atelectasis is just lung that isn’t expanding all the way so it’s kind of collapsed down. People who have been ill and maybe aren’t taking deep breaths will almost always have a little atelectasis. Even healthy people can have small areas of atelectasis from time to time. It’s so common I call it on nearly every chest X-ray on hospitalized patients. If there’s a lot of atelectasis or of an entire lung segment or lobe is collapsed down that’s a problem but otherwise it’s usually not a huge worry speaking generally.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd like to be nit-picky about one small thing, sorry. The thorax does have air in it, and that is very much normal. It's the <em>pleural cavity</em> that must not have any air in it, or you get a pneumothorax. Otherwise every patient with a puncture (sharp object, GSW etc.) to the chest or open heart surgery would result in a dual-sided pneumothorax, which of course doesn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to be a little more nit picky and say that getting air in the pleural space would be a <em>tension</em> pneumothorax and that when your lung collapses (for a multitude of reasons), <em>that</em> is a pneumothorax. </p>
<p>A pneumothorax is life threatening because you don’t get air in the lung. A tension pneumothorax is life threatening because it compresses the blood vessels (vena cava) and the heart which can lead to decreased blood flow throughout the body (cardiac output).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. A tension pneumothorax is the result of the rupture of the pleura creating a one way gas flow and thus an increase pleural pressure which has the the result you described, so if the air has a way to escape the pleural cavity and not build up pressure (a big enough wound, needle, drain etc) it would not be a tension pneumothorax. Also, a &quot;normal&quot; pneumothorax always involves some sort of breach of the pleura, since the low pressure environment of the pleural cavity is what keeps the lung suspended in the thorax. As you said this can happen in a multitude of ways.</p>
<p>A unilateral pneumothorax (excluding tension pneumothorax) is generally a serious, but stable condition. Of course it needs to be treated accordingly (although sometimes monitoring is enough) to restore the function of the collapsed lung, but it's rarely life-threatening. One lung can definitely handle an adequate gas exchange at rest (which is around 6L/min, the vital capacity of one lung is around 20L/min at a calm respiratory rate in an otherwise healthy adult). Bilateral would be a critical condition, since the patient would have a severly compromized respiration.</p></div>		</li>
