			<div class="markdown"><p>Further, there is amazing conservation in brain structure and organization across all mammals. Much of the early work that informed how our brains process visual data was done in cats, and we have shown that most of the same rules guide organization down to mice and up through primates. Of course, how this basic feature extraction proceeds to and is influenced by higher order areas (stuff like object recognition and motion tracking) can be influenced by species specific needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Examining the eyes and brain of an animal helps us guess what they may be capable of seeing, and what types of things they used their vision for (e.g. birds of prey have excellent distance vision, many small mammals have good night vision, etc). Assuming that you can't visualize or conceptualize something you never experience (like trying to imagine a color that humans can't see), it gives us a start on guessing how other animals visualize things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, so basically if we know that the animal can see X amount of information, there's a possibility they can use it to visualize it?</p>
<p>I can see how it is relevant but we humans can visualize something we've never seen before and create our own constructs based on other things we have seen. Assuming animals can see what we see to some degree, isn't what they can perceive and understand more important and unrelated to the eyes at this point?</p>
<p>Of course, imagining a color is in the realm of impossible, so maybe we don't visualize things we haven't seen before but merely build them based on other information like material, feel, color etc.</p></div>		</li>
