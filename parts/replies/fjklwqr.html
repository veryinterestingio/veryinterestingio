<p>This is confusing to me. You describe the 'pathway to the memory' as being lost, but isn't that what a memory technically is--the pathway? Your comment implies that there is some tangible remnant left that constitutes the memory, but is not accessible.</p>
<p>My understanding is that 'thoughts' and 'memories' are simply neural pathways, complex connections between neurons that activate in conjunction with one another. Wouldn't losing that 'pathway' you described be, by definition, the same as losing the memory?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i understand what you mean sorry for my over simplification you clearly understand this more than i gave you credit for. yes while somewhat correct the memory itself is stored in the node ... while the pathway is the decisions that lead you to the conclusion.  The conclusion of course being your perception of events as they unfolded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a plot of land and the road(s) to get there.  The roads may deteriorate but that doesn't necessarily mean the plot of land is gone/destroyed.  You can repair those roads or find a back road you never really knew about to get there again potentially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you'll lose a lot of the nuance of the original destination, because you're driving in from a different direction. It will look <em>familiar</em> but not the <em>same.</em></p>
<p>Am I taking the metaphor too far?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, something I can agree with for a good description of this.</p>
<p>For most of my life I tend to lose the quickest path to simple facts relating to movies, places, and people (even stuff I just said 30 seconds ago!).  And half the time I end up having to play 20 questions with myself to find just the right alternative path to reconnect with what I know, but can't say because my brain has locked out the easy access. =(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except isn’t the memory a specific collection of roads to begin with. If an important road connecting two ideas (like an association) deteriorates, this fits your analogy. But it ignores the deterioration of the sub-network that constitutes the memory. At least that’s the way I always understood it, but happy to be proven wrong if someone with a background on this topic can chime in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think your description is more accurate to way the neurological system of memory works. Forgetting something likely involves the deterioration of of the neural pathway associated with the memory itself. Remembering it means reconstructing that pathway. This is an important distinction because it highlights they way we can modify or or even create completely false memories by reconstructing them in different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The road analogy seems to be good. From what I understand, memory is very much like highway networks connecting communities. Old roads that get used often are maintained and reinforced (daily habits). Old roads that are not travelled often will fall to disrepair to the point they may become unusable (specific events). New roads can be built which may become more often used than the old roads (moving to a new neighborhood).</p></div>		</li>
