			<div class="markdown"><p>The phone market is fairly recent, but the more time passes, the more you end up with Apple vs. Samsung with smaller brands dying one after the other. Even Nokia died. Same thing with computers, you had tons of brands back in the 90's, now you have Apple, Lenovo, and a handful of other ones. IBM doesn't even manufacture PCs anymore for instance. In both cases you have 10 brands at most more or less. With cars you have way more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That goes down to what you consider &quot;a lot&quot; of competition, I guess.</p>
<p>But even old, common industries, like pens and pencils have competition.</p>
<p>For cars, specifically, there is the fact that it isn't as easy to sell and ship a car overseas. And while some companies do make a very good business model by giving you a plane ticket to Scandavia just to test drive the car before sending it expensively by boat, it's generally going to be better to just buy a car made in West Virginia and have it trucked over.</p>
<p>But really, find me any industry that doesn't have at least 5 competitors (major or minor, excepting mom and pop operations)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries, they purchased them a number of years ago now so I don't expect everyone remembers. I think it was 2011 or so.</p>
<p>It's not a bad idea since Google owns the Nexus/Pixel, so all three phone companies own a brand just to push their software.  </p></div>		</li>
