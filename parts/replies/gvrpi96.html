			<div class="markdown"><p>In a similar vein, if you didn't store your food properly before reheating, cooking it again will kill the bacteria in your food.  It will <em>not</em> get rid of the toxins the bacteria made before you killed them, and will likely make you sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat destroys most bacteria and their toxin (metabolic byproduct), but some are heat resistant. Cooling the food quickly after it is cooked reduces the time that the food is in the &quot;danger zone&quot; which is usually 40F to 140F where these bacteria can grow a lot faster. Food infection is when you get sick from ingesting food with living bacteria that grows inside you, versus food poisoning where you get sick from ingesting the toxin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And FYI - those toxins actually exist. </p>
<p>For so long I've been treating the word 'toxin' as a dogwhistle for &quot;bullshit&quot; that I was shocked to learn that the toxins related to food bacteria are actually legitimate. That's why you can't leave meat out for a day and then cook it to 165F and eat it without getting sick. Shocked to learn there's such a thing as actual toxins after years of &quot;this juice cleanse will flush out those toxins! It's basically glucose water with some colorful pulp in it but it gets rid of all those toxins&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toxins are absolutely a real thing; it's getting rid of them where the bullshit comes in. Toxins are processed by your liver and kidneys. That's it. If there's something toxic in your body, your body gets rid of it via your liver and/or kidneys. You cannot drink juice to make it work faster or better; there is no such thing as a &quot;cleanse.&quot; If something is toxic to you (alcohol, for example), your body is already sending it out via your liver/kidneys, that system is already in place. If you ingest too much of a toxin, though, you can overwhelm the system and make yourself very ill or die.</p>
<p>Edited to add: you're also right that people claim lots of things are toxins that aren't, or you would have to ingest <em>such</em> a large quantity of them to reach toxicity that it's not realistically possible. Conversely, a lot of people get real upset when it's pointed out that alcohol is actually highly toxic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this lesson soon after I first moved off grid.
I was still getting set up and didn't have refrigeration. I made some pea soup with leftover christmas ham and thought &quot;well, I have to boil it every time I reheat it, so the leftovers should be safe even though I don't have a fridge.&quot;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No they weren't.</p>
<p>I gave myself the WORST case of food poisoning I ever had in my life. It was so bad that I had to confess my food sins to my boss the next day at work to explain that I wasn't leaving the job site every 30 minutes because I'd forgotten a tool, but because I had to go violently expel all the contents of my bowels. </p>
<p>Turned out okay in the end though because he dug an old propane fridge out of his shed he'd had sitting around for years, so now I have a refrigerator!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have three sponges, any sponge that gets used today is going in the dishwasher tonight. Sunday is when I take out the trash, it’s also the day I introduce a new dish sponge to the lineup. The old dish sponge, I snip a corner off it and demote it to counter duty. The old counter sponge gets a second corner snipped and demoted to floor/utility duty. The old floor sponge gets tossed in the trash. if I have to clean dogshit off my sneaker, I have a collection of former floor sponges that are now disposable. They’ve done their duty.</p></div>		</li>

Amazon is selling custom ones grown on the back of piglets. You just have to send them a 3D scan and you can get a regular supply every 10 days. For 10$ extra, you can even get the piglet too for BBQ.</p></div>		</li>
