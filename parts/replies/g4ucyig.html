			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this happen when basically the virus doesn't have an effect on the host, but yet still replicates within the body? Would an asymptomatic carriers discharge be as contagious as a symptomatic carrier?</p>
<p>And is this considered to be an evolutionary tool of a virus or just, something that seems to happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to all of the above and no at the same time...
Asymptomatic infections can be because of various reasons, you can be resistant, or be too weak to have a response, or have antibodies that limit the extent of damage the virus can cause and you never get to feel the difference and more...</p>
<p>And being more contagious or less if a matter of why you're asymptomatic and how the virus behaves so it depends on the particular virus...</p>
<p>Curiosity thing : many virus have infection cycles were the patient infected in contagious days before showing symptoms and remains contagious days after all the symptoms go away or complete oposite can happen, certain viruses, the patient stops being contagious days before the symptoms go away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can be infected by HIV to varying degrees, in fact, most infections could be considered asymptomatic and their effects are only seen in analítics...
Symptoms also vary depending on viral charge and other factors, these are what mostly makes someone be asymptomatic or not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The virus HIV causes the disease AIDS, in the same way the virus SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19.</p>
<p>There are many asymptomatic carriers of both viruses, but HIV posses a mechanism that allows it to lay dormant in the lymph nodes after infection and then activate as much as 10-15 years later.</p></div>		</li>
