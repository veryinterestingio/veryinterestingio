<p>Gallium and Aluminum are both group XIII and have similar chemistry. They both form a layer of surface oxide. </p>
<p>Failure mode with gallium is caused by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_metal_embrittlement" target="_blank">Liquid Metal induced Embrittlement.</a> </p>
<p>This phenomenon can also sometimes occur when steels are galvanized by dipping in molten zinc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't really say it's &quot;caused by&quot; liquid-metal-induced embrittlement so much as &quot;is an example of&quot; liquid-metal-induced embrittlement. The cause is that the gallium atoms penetrate the grain boundaries and disrupt the bonds between the aluminum grains by changing the bond energetics, which may either (the process is not fully understood) directly provide the surface energy necessary to split the grains apart, or reduce strength to a level where residual and other small stresses are enough to cause crack growth, or some combination of the two.</p>
