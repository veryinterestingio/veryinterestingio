			<div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely can measure &quot;scroll depth&quot;, and I'm sure many big sites do both.</p>
<p>If I had to hazard an educated guess of why the &quot;Read More&quot; is preferred over it, it might be something to do with it standardising nicer over phones vs screens of different sizes</p></div>		</li>
