			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op but it’s basically like your own personal Netflix you can run off your computer. You can add movies/tv/music files etc. to the directory folder on your computer and stream it from basically any device that has a plex app. </p>
<p>Only real downside is having to run your computer 24/7 if you want access all the time. I’ve used it for over 6 years tho with no issues and they keep adding features.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. 1-3 services is sustainable. People dont pay as much for the service as for the convenience.</p>
<p>Could I get the same movie for free? Sure. But id have to deal with broken links, exposure to viruses, pop up ads, and the slight risk id get fined, wait 5-10 minutes (if Im lucky), then hope its the correct quality and synced audio </p>
<p>Then id have to hope my homebrew plex server functions correctly so I can watch it on my TV. And on my phone? Forget it (doable).</p>
<p>Or. I can search ot up on Netflix or Prime.</p>
<p>But if you are telling me, I cant find the movie I want on either Netflix or Prime (or Disney plus).</p>
<p>Then it really is your own fault and I will pirate it.</p>
<p>And Im not gonna pay for your obscure service that has like 4 series.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would totally expect some of my friends getting viruses or low quality releases if I told them to just go torrent something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ease of access to content is the option consumers will choose. 10 different streaming services is not ease of access.</p>
<p>On another note re: music vs video, it's impossible to buy a digital copy of a movie or tv show and actually own the file, unlike with music.</p>
<p>I can buy a song on Amazon or itunes and download the file, copy it or move it anywhere and play it on anything.  </p>
<p>Movies and tv shows are locked to the provider you choose. Buying a digital movie on Amazon means I can only watch it via Amazon. I can't download the file and copy it to my nas to put on plex. So my only options are to buy physical and rip or pirate. </p>
<p>Video streaming services are a good middle ground for this issue, but now that they're spreading the content out, we're back to the buy physical or pirate debate. I'm not spending $50 a month on streaming services.</p></div>		</li>
