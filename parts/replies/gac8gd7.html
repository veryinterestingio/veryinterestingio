			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that the reaction to fuse hydrogen into helium (known as the proton-proton chain) is very unlikely to occur (we say that it has a low reaction cross-section), because it requires two protons to combine into a proton and a neutron. This means that the hydrogen is used up very slowly!</p>
<p>Edit: as others have pointed out, this is only the first step in making helium; I included it here as is the rate-limiting (slowest) step in the process. Overall, you need to combine four protons (hydrogen nuclei) into two protons and two neutrons to make helium. </p>
<p>This is usually done by H+H-&gt;D, where D is a deuteron consisting of one proton and one neutron. D+H-&gt;He-3, where He-3 consists of two protons and a neutron. He-3+He-3-&gt;He-4+H+H, where He-4 is a normal helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons.</p>
<p>I apologise for any confusion caused by omitting this detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right.  The core of the sun has about the same power density as a compost heap - the reason the sun puts off as much energy as it does is because of the core's sheer size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fascinating that any aspect of a star could be comparable to a compost heap.</p>
<p>But I guess you have to consider that most of the sun isn't really doing anything, it's just mater swirling around a bit, a lot of wind. Only (apparently rarely) in the core is anything actually producing energy; so on average it is relatively low power <em>density</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the perspective!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The part that blew my mind was how cold the gas cloud has to be to form a star.  I think it’s under 30Kelvin.  Anything warmer, and the gas pressure is too high to collapse all the way.  It just keeps swirling until it has radiated away enough energy from the hot spots (P=V/T), and when it’s cold enough (low enough kinetic energy for each particle/atom), it collapses.  Once it is heavy &amp; dense enough to fuse, the increase in radiant energy blows the rest of the gas cloud away, preventing it from gathering more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not a huge amount; gravitational time dilation only starts to become significant if you're trying to be really precise (such as the clocks running GPS), unless you're really close to something much more compact than the sun, such as a neutron star of black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, technically. the sun is a few minutes <del>older</del> younger (its easy to make a mistake in this topic, see everyones edits) than the earth.</p>
<p>while the effects of gravity on time dilatation are measurable, its very small until you get up to very large masses. like, black hole masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not by a number that's large compared to the sun's lifetime. The sun has been around for around four and a half billion years, and due to the core being in the center of the sun and thus affected by gravitational time dilation it is around ~40000^<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0143-0807/37/3/035602" target="_blank">1</a> years younger than the surface. That's a relative difference of ~0.0009%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fair enough point! The half-life of a single proton in the sun, before it's turned into helium, is about five to ten billion years, which is a long time. But the sun is really big and there are a <em>lot</em> of protons. The energy released from the reaction 4P -&gt; He is about 26.73 MeV, and the sun radiates 4e26 W, which means 9e37 helium nuclei are created per second, with a mass of 6e11 kg (approximately).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The rest is providing CRUSHING POWER to make the core high enough pressure and temperature to do its stuff.</p>

<p>When I was a kid in school, this fact was one of the very earliest astronomical facts to really make me sit back and think &quot;<em>Whoaa....</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The idea that the sun is literally a continuous thermonuclear fusion reaction in balance, where the ferocious quantity of energy released by the ongoing fusion trying to blast apart the core is continuously held in check by the immense gravitational crushing force from mass of the star itself.</p>

<p>I've known this fact about the sun since I was a child, and filed it away under the 'things in space are on a crazy scale'. But it's weird to think that the sun, which I can look up at and is just a relatively small point in the sky, is going to expand out until it fills up the entire sky (and they beyond).</p>
<p>That's really, really big.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but - the whole Helium-death, solar expansion, fuse-your-way-down-to-Iron is more intangible and so far off in the future that it seems very distant and unrelatable.</p>
<p>But the fact that this nuclear balancing-act of a dance is going on right now, and has been going on for billions of years and will continue for billions more - that really struck a chord in younger me for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that the sun produces energy/warmth by merging hydrogen atoms into helium atoms. This is known as atomic fusion. There are a lot of details to this I'm skipping but the basic idea is that two hydrogen atoms will have more energy than one helium atom. So when they merge that extra energy has to go somewhere, and thus we get energy production.</p>
<p>The sun makes this happen by being very dense and very hot. The gravity drags all the gas down, and it provides CRUSHING POWER to the core, as OP so eloquently stated. All this pressure makes the core dense and hot.</p>
<p>Thing is that fusion of two hydrogen atoms is very unlikely to happen. It's a rare occurance where they have to hit one another (using that term very loosely) so hard that they overcome the electric forces pushing them apart. Think of it as electric cars at a tivoli. If they crash at low speed they'll just bounce apart. But there is a very unlikely chance that it gets ugly.</p>
<p>This is where the dense and hot part comes in. Dense means there are a <em>lot</em> of atoms in a small area. Hot means each one has tons of energy. So you have a fuckton of hydrogen atoms zooming around at super speed in a small area. This means that very unlikely thing happens quite often. The energy produced in the centre will then push outwards, balancing against the gravity. Therefore you have a relatively stable sun. The gravity prevents it from being blown apart, while the energy production prevents it from collapsing.</p>
<p>A lot of this energy, in the form of light, will eventually find its way out through the cracks, so to say. This is the light and warmth that hits us. All in all the sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father!</p></div>		</li>
