It may not be just older, but chemically different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria is breaking down the milk  protein structures and it's the byproducts of this digesting that are the &quot;sharp&quot; flavor compounds. It's also the proteins that in part give cheese it's texture so as these proteins are broken down the cheese becomes crumbly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Dutch, it really depends on what you want to achieve and what you're in the mood for. We have a lot of varieties here, both local and from nearby countries (French and British cheese for example as well as Swiss cheese).    </p>
<p>Very fresh cheese still has a soft and creamy flavor, sometimes even &quot;grassy&quot;.<br />
I tend to like this as a breakfast cheese, with a slice of bread and some butter, sometimes with a slice of ham.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want that smooth and soft flavor. Sometimes you really want something stronger so you can take aged, sharp cheese. Especially if you're going to grate it over a dish, a nice mature cheese will do the job better than anything.    </p>
<p>If you want to have a desert you can cut up any cheese, hard or soft, young or mature. Good with some nuts, fruit and wine. Usually even a mix.   </p>
<p>And then there's all kinds of flavors you can get by getting herbs and/or spices involved or getting the cheese smoked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US we have a simple cheese called &quot;cream cheese&quot; that's like that. It's similar to Mascarpone but the taste is a bit simpler. In addition to basic cream cheese, it gets flavored in a million ways with veggies, sun dried tomato, jalapeno, cinnamon, fruit, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend recently lost like 50 pounds and she eats cheese all day long. The Keto diet has her eating fat all day, every day. At first she wasn't exercising but still was melting off the weight. I've gone to the gym two hours every other day since March and I haven't lost much. I've gained a lot of muscle and feel healthier but just haven't lost the weight I wanted to lose. Your body is built in the kitchen and she proves it. If only I could give up bread and cake :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what's the difference between the mild cheddar I buy in the store and then forget about for several months and the sharp cheddar that is sold? </p>
<p>Why is mine moldy and disgusting looking but the sharp isn't?</p>
<p>What is that clear liquid that builds up when you forget about packages of cheese?</p>
<p>Why am I asking so many questions about cheese??</p></div>		</li>
