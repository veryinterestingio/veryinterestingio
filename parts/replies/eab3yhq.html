<p>it's basically just re-spouted nonsense. if you look at those videos that try to overlay a golden spiral, there are actually very few of those spirals which are golden.</p>
<p>it might be aesthetic because we're told it is and because old art might include it, but even then they're just throwing shit in because they were told it is beautiful. </p>

<p>Yes indeed. Even Pacioli, who did extensive measurements of paintings for the golden ratio, conveniently ignored measurements that did not match his expectations. Sometimes he included the frame or ignored them to fit his 1.6 ratio measurements.</p>
<p>Before phi ratio, the whole world was infatuated with the pi ratio, 3.14, for 1000 years. Then there were other ratios after Renaissance.  More recently, we've seen some hyperbolic functions gain such notoriety.</p>
<p>In each case, the mathematicians who discovered these curves never claimed them as &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;magical&quot; or &quot;golden&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It reminds me a bit of Kepler's effort to map the planetary orbits onto the nested platonic solids. The idea was wrong, but he spent years trying to make it work. However he didn't ignore the fact that it didn't work and eventually he discovered the true laws of planetary motion. His misdirected obsession, combined with strict scientific self-discipline, turned out pretty well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a certain intrinsic geometric harmony to the golden ratio, apart from the fibonacci spiral thing. So I wouldn't call it complete nonsense, even if the theories about its prevalence in art and architecture might be nonsense.</p>
<p>It's the only way to divide a line segment such that the ratio of the whole length to the longest part is the same as the longest part to the shortest part. </p>
<p>And only a rectangle whose sides are proportioned to the golden ratio can be attached to an adjacent square to form a larger rectangle proportionate to the original.</p></div>		</li>
