<p>however, it's not JUST your brain that gets partially &quot;shut down&quot; during sleep.</p></div>		</li>

<p>See my reply above, this is not true. The brain doesn't &quot;partially shut down&quot; during sleep.</p>
<p>ed: That is to say the brain doesn't use much less energy during sleep. The brain uses quite a lot of energy during REM in particular.</p>

<p>The body as a whole only decreases in energy usage about 10% overall during sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly one third of your energy is expended on your nervous system (with another third for digestion and metabolic functions and the remaining for moving and such) source: Story of the Human Body.</p>
<p>The high energy demand of the brain is why humans are more prone to store body fat than other non-hibernating mammals. The brain cannot store energy reserves internal, so the body aptly stores fat to ensure a supply of energy dense material for times of famine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the weirdest part about going from a job that was 90% manual labor to a desk job that is 90% mental work. It's unreal how absolutely exhausted I am now at the end of the day and yet the only physical activity I do at work is getting up to go to the bathroom or grab a snack from the break room. </p>
<p>When I used to work in the restaurant industry, I would be on my feet during my entire 10 hour shift, constantly moving, always lifting things, in sweltering heat. While I would definitely be sore and tired after a shift, I was still very much awake and alert. </p>
<p>Now I get home from the office and my entire brain is trying to force-close any and all processes asap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Your brain produces adenosine, a kind of garbage byproduct of consciousness, which is detrimental to your cognitive functioning. The less you sleep the more adenosine you have in the aggregate, which leads to things like Alzheimer’s later on. The body is built to respond to adenosine with all the symptoms of sleep deprivation because it “knows” how bad it is for you. Consciousness is literally poison for you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. To this day, we don't have much more of a satisfying answer to why the need to sleep. There are theories, some more likely than others, and some leads as to what biological and psychological things happen during sleep, but at the end of the day, we don't have a firm answer other than this one: we need to sleep because we need to sleep, and if we don't, we die.</p></div>		</li>
