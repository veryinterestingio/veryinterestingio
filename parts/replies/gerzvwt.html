			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll also add something I haven't seen anyone say: Your brain is very energy-hungry. So any time you use it a lot, you will get tired. E.g. studying, or jobs that require frequent decision-making.  The simple act of thinking about the person you miss all the time uses a lot of energy. You might not be able to rest your brain as well as usual, even when you are physically doing nothing. </p>
<p>And on top of that, grieving people often don't replenish the energy used because they are sleeping and eating less</p>
<p>Edit: As some have pointed out, it is much more complex than this (as in not even a one-to-one correlation)! There are many many processes intertwined that affect wakefulness and energy use. Their comments are definitely more correct that mine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I used to have intense math classes typically involving proving some theorem or property. Always felt saturated after those. Like I couldn't react even when my best friend told me he was going out with a common friend. I just said ok and continued on my way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still have that issue for drives that are more than two hours or so. I'm usually so exhausted afterword I need some time to recoup.</p>
<p>I also find that if I'm training in a new job, I am much much more tired after a &quot;short&quot; 8 or 9 hours compared to a 12 or 13 hour shift where I already know how to do the job. Even if the new job is less physically taxing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just driving. Ever traveled to a new country and find travel days to be the most exhausting? It’s because you’re making a million of decisions doing unfamiliar things. Whether it’s finding the airport gate, checking in, trying to find your hotel, figuring out new languages, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I'm going to have to dispute that - during a neurology module I took in the 2nd year of my med degree, I had a supervisor who told me that in order for the brain to consume any more energy than its baseline, the individual would have to be in a &quot;horrific seizure&quot; (his words).</p>
<p>I think we need to remember that what we consider as &quot;thinking&quot; isn't necessarily &quot;new&quot; action potentials being generated but rather changes in patterns of excitability, since the neurones in your brain tend to have set firing patterns. I think you may also be overestimating how much of our brain is dedicated to the process of &quot;thinking&quot;, as opposed to monitoring physiological state or highly specialised tasks such as computing value judgements, motivation etc which then are all integrated into the experience we associate with thinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, wanted to say this too before I saw it. The physical exhaustion experienced with grief is nothing to do with an increase in energy demand by the brain caused by thoughts- that demand is pretty stable. Although there is probably a cognitive overhead to the grief process. The insomnia, anxiety, depression, dysphoria and reduced food intake all contribute to physical exhaustion. Grief cycles can persist for years, and you can go back into one years later. We also tend to sympathise with someone grieving a death of a person way more than someone in grief because of a break-up or pet death, when these events can trigger equally intense, distressing and long lasting grief cycles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, you’re right. Brain energy needs only go up by <a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/Brain-Anatomy-and-Function/Anatomy/2019/How-Much-Energy-Does-the-Brain-Use-020119" target="_blank">8%</a> at most. </p>
<p>Maybe the exhaustion might just be caused by stress and subsequent increase of heart rate?</p>
<p>Edit: typo</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm it seems like there's a bit of an argument amongst researchers, but I don't know enough to go into it.</p>
<p>In any case, most seem to agree with you, there's no big spike when thinking. However, you can still get tired from thinking, but it veers away from eli5 a little. Maybe eli11.</p>
<p>Firstly, energy usage does go up, but only slightly (5% of base rate but tbh that seems significant to me). I'll still maintain that if you're overthinking for extended periods of time (longer than your normal waking hours every day for several months), it's going to have some kind of effect.</p>
<p>Secondly, the energy used when people to complex tasks mostly comes from the stress response that is triggered by the situation - e.g. have to cram or I'll fail the test (or, how will I get through Christmas without loved one)</p>
<p>Thirdly, I may be misinterpreting this one, but higher energy expenditure in <em>a certain area of the brain</em> triggers release of adenosine, which makes you sleepy. So overthinking may increase adenosine levels faster than normal brain function.</p>
<p>But thank you, that was very interesting! Much different to what my child development lecturers told us 8 years ago lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, grief has a function. Emotions aren't just a chemical reactions happening haphazardly. They communicate things, to you and to others. So that reaction is happening because you're meant to slow down and process. Just like anger is meant to get your ass out of the chair and deal with a situation. And curiosity is meant to make you explore new things (which we're otherwise often naturally averse to).</p>
<p>So why is grief exhausting? Because you're meant to stop and reflect. Mourn. Process.</p></div>		</li>
