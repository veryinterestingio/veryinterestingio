I do. And it seems really weird/fascinating to me that some people don't.</p></div>		</li>

Maybe what is being talked about in this thread is kind of like talking to yourself silently. Like if you read a book?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i do have an inner voice but sometimes i can think of seemingly abstract concepts like that (in my mind its 100% understandable but if i want to think about it any further i more often than not translate it to words, again in my head)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I get what you mean.</p>
<p>It slides in and out of being a voice per se depending on what I think about, and mostly the language part of it is so fast that it doesn't manifest itself as something that could translate well to audio. It sort of integrates with other ways of thinking.</p>
<p>Other times it can be that literal &quot;voice talking inside my head&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, I have no problem reading with an inner voice or imaging conversations, but I'll often be thinking with no voices as well. I can easily think about things for which I don't know the word or when the word just doesn't come to mind, plus it seems immensely faster than thinking with words... But it makes explaining an idea sometimes difficult as I need to translate into words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that I'm incapable of &quot;hearing&quot; sounds in my head. If I'm remembering a conversation I had, I'll hear my own voice then. </p>
<p>Honestly, if I'm truly rehearsing a conversation I'll do it out loud alone well in advance. I don't have to do that very often though, most of the time the &quot;block of thought&quot; is complete enough that I just have to decide where to start with it and talk my way through it. Sometimes that means I forget to say something I meant to. Often I'll say things two different ways so it's more clear what I'm trying to say. </p>
<p>When I read, I don't really know. Words aren't really chunked together the same way. I don't usually need to go back and reread things, it's almost the same as hearing someone speak just without any sounds? Like going down a chain and each word is another link I guess. It never made sense to me that some people move their lips while reading or typing because that's never been how I processed written language.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think the words. There is no sound attached. Usually though, I don't thin about individual words, I think in concepts. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you literally have no idea what you sound like before you speak?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, yes. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>See above - I think the words, but there is no sound attached. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you read, what happens? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>My eyes scan the page, and concepts pop into my head. Imagine if, as your eyes moved side to side, a movie was being played, and youre watching the movie. The individual words never come into play. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many words are chunked together </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>how often are you at a loss and have to try again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, the only time this happens is when I'm reading difficult writing. And there's only two reasons for that... The first being when I'm reading <em>old</em> writing... Like when I was reading &quot;Opticks&quot; by Isaac Newton (published 1704), or if I'm reading Shakespeare. I have to put thought into what each word is and what it means. The other time is if I'm reading about a complicated topic... Like when I was reading a quantum physics textbook. There, it's not about the words, but I don't understand the <em>concepts</em> - so I have to reread it, or find a different book to explain that particular concept.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not thinking in speech doesn't mean you can't think about speech.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you literally have no idea what you sound like before you speak?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have heard my voice enough to know what it sounds like and what it will sound like. I can't really recreate hearing it in my mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have to rehearse a conversation, like with a boss or lover, out loud like they do in the movies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. I can think about what I want to say or I can think about what I want to talk about and even what I want to say, but I don't hear it as speech while thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you read, what happens? How many words are chunked together and how often are you at a loss and have to try again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read one word at a time. Never at a loss from reading. I've always been a good reader, but never heard anything. No comprehension problems at all.</p></div>		</li>
