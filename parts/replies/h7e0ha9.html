			<div class="markdown"><p>Against theme but +1 for being the first post on here that didn't simply say &quot;aspirin is a blood thinner&quot;.</p>
<p>My paramedic instructor made sure we all understood an antiplatelet wasn't the same thing as an anticoagulant and to clarify the difference when someone is like &quot;I'm on blood thinners&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For hemorrhagic stroke and cerebral aneurysm bleeding, knowing the specific type of anticoagulant used is important because they all have different reversal agents.  I learned this due to a family member who had a hemorrhagic stroke while taking Xarelto, which became a problem because there was no reversal medication for it at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a dentist, I often recommend ibuprofen as well as acetaminophen for my patients before I operate on them to reduce pain and inflammation. The difference in clothing ability is far from making a difference.</p>
<p>In the rare cases where it would, your surgeon will mention it.</p>
<p>TLDR ibuprofen's effect on blood clothing ability is very negligible.</p></div>		</li>
