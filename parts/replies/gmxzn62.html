They were telling my best friend to make end of life preps because she was showing symptoms of blood cancer. Nope, Celiac's. She's fine now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Celiac is possible to be triggered genetically, but it also can be asymptomatic for years all the while causing other problems under the surface. Additionally at the beginning of symptoms, when your body is getting gluten with celiac, you actually begin to crave gluten because your body releases endorphins to fight the effects. I say that because of your comments “the biggest pasta and bread lover”. Mid 30s is often when it strikes. That’s when it hit my dad. as for me, I finally decided to get diagnosed in my mid 20s. Saved my self a lot to future issues. But wish I started earlier.</p></div>		</li>
