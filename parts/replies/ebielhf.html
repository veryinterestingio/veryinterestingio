			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that the metal in an astrobleme deposit isn't thought to come from the meteorite itself. Most hypotheses about such deposits on Earth (like the Sudbury nickel deposits) suggest that it was the tremendous energy that caused crustal melting and metal differentiation. The meteorite is usually entirely  vaporized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very very little of the meteorite survives impact, not a feasible source of mineable metals at an economic scale. As the other commenter said the shock of very large impacts weaken the crust and allow for deep mantle metal rich (specifically Fe-Ni-Co with elevated PGEs) to reach the surface. The volume of metals recovered by this manner is thousands of times greater than the amount of astrobleme which survives impact.</p>

<p>Edit: I guess I need to also point out that not all meteorites are metallic. That’s one part most people seem to be confused about. I forget the exact stats off the top of my head but the metallic meteorites only make up about 5-6% of the total, the vast majority are “chondrites” which are actually just rocky material similar to earth rocks (and another class “achondrotes” which are even closer to earth rocks and most people wouldn’t even be able to tell they are extraterrestrial).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the story behind Meteor Crater in Arizona. The guy who bought it was basically prospecting, thinking there was a big ol' chunk of space iron in the ground. There isn't, because the rock was basically vaporized/pulverized on impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually, yes, but keep in mind, space is frickin' big.  There's a LOT of it, and we are not currently capable of tracking everything going on nearby.  So we'd have to be fortunate enough to spot the asteroid, and for it to be one that we can comfortably intercept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further reading: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis" target="_blank">Giant Impact Hypothesis (Wikipedia)</a> also known as the ‘Big Splash’!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The giant-impact hypothesis, sometimes called the Big Splash, or the Theia Impact suggests that the Moon formed out of the debris left over from a collision between Earth and an astronomical body the size of Mars, approximately 4.5 billion years ago, in the Hadean eon; about 20 to 100 million years after the solar system coalesced.[1] The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, from the name of the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon.[2] Analysis of lunar rocks, published in a 2016 report, suggests that the impact may have been a direct hit, causing a thorough mixing of both parent bodies.[3]</p>
<p>The giant impact hypothesis is currently the favored scientific hypothesis for the formation of the Moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Minor point - I’d take issue with the above saying a collision between “Earth” and another body: it wasn’t Earth as we know it!<br />
Better worded that there was a collision between a proto-Earth (often called Gaia) and a Mars sized body (often called Theia).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was with you until the last sentence, I thought you were going to say the opposite. As you said metals are heavy and heavy things tend to sink to the middle of the planet, particularly when the entire planet is molten like they are when they first form. On Earth volcanism brought most of the heavier elements that we find to the surface over billions of years. While Mars did have volcanic activity it appears to have ceased quite a while ago, so it's unlikely that anywhere near the quantity of heavy metals were brought to the surface like they were on Earth.</p>
<p>You're right that heavy metals from meteorites can still be found, but I'd imagine the vast majority of such material on Earth was here from the beginning and brought to the surface by plate tectonics and volcanism, not by meteors.</p></div>		</li>
