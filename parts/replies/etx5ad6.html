			<div class="markdown"><p>Speciation is messy and imprecise. It’s actually a currently debated topic on whether Neanderthals were a separate species from us or if we are subspecies of one species. </p>
<p>What you were taught is the most basic (and usually most correct and most useful) definition of speciation. The problem is that humans want to draw a hard line while in nature what actually happens is a gradual shift. If we pick two members of an evolutionary 1 million years apart, it’s easy to see that they are different species. However, pinpointing exactly when between those two specimen the change in species took place is messy.  No mother has ever birthed offspring that were a different species from her, but one animal and it’s direct descendent 1 million years removed can be different species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda.. we are the same species, homo sapiens. we're just of the sub-species sapiens sapiens.</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are not only different species who can successfully breed, but there are sometimes members of the same species who <em>cannot</em>.  Such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species" target="_blank">Ring Species</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case they’re considered separate species because of a distinct gene pool and low frequency of natural intermixing. </p>
<p>Different races cannot be considered different species because they do not have distinct gene pools and intermixing is common.</p></div>		</li>
