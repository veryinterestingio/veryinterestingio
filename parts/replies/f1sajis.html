			<div class="markdown"><p>There is disagreement about whether long and short vowels had different qualities in classical latin (Andrea Calabrese's paper makes a convincing argument for 5 qualities with a length distinction). Regardless, since vowel length is phonemic, it's technically ten vowel sounds.</p>
<p>Also, if you aren't already aware, vowel length was actually often <a href="http://tiny.cc/hghndz" target="_blank">indicated orthographically</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Spanish has updated its spelling to reflect changing pronunciations.

<p>While this <em>was</em> the case, nowadays the Real Academia Española is being more lenient and accepting as correct of newfangled, weird expressions, many of which most (excuse the pedantry) cultured Castilian speakers would say &quot;wait, <em>what?</em> at.</p>

<p>What? Where are you from? Again, excuse the pedantry, but, as a born and raised in Madrid Spanish speaker, I have not once in my life heard &quot;de natha&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the second point maybe de nada was a bad example for OP but some people from Spain definitely use a kind of 'th' sound sometimes, for example nacionalidad, and that &quot;dad&quot; at the end would showcase both sounds for the d. It's not as strong of a 'th' as the c in nacion (or an English 'th' where the tongue actually goes between the teeth) but about halfway in the mouth with the tongue right behind the teeth which is pretty far forward from the normal 'd' in a word like duro. Seems most typical of Andalusians but I've heard people in Madrid talk that way too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. I was kind of weirded out. I can't say I remember it ever coming close to sounding like &quot;nacionalithath&quot;. I guess stressing the d's would come close to that, but it still seems like a longshot to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all varieties of Spanish, /d/ weakens to a [ð] sound, roughly the same as the sound in the English word &quot;this&quot;. Say &quot;nada&quot; quickly, and feel how your tongue goes between your teeth. It's possible that you also unconsciously do this when you speak English, and thus don't notice the difference, but when English speakers say /d/ intervocalically, depending on accent it either remains a true [d] with the tongue against the alveolar ridge, or else it gets realized as [ɾ] which is the alveolar tap represented by <r> in the Spanish word &quot;para&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
