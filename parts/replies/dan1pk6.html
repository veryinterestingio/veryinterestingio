			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  I have a wound on my leg with a scab I've been picking at for 30 years.  Doctors tell me it looks like a skin graft.  I recently got a severe infection in my ankle, below the wound.  Never considered this some kind of OCD, I just thought of it as a terrible habit.</p>
<p>Maybe I should see someone for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No where near you on this level, but I love picking scabs. I'm aware of this being weird as hell.</p>
<p>I feel like the feeling of air hitting a freshly picked wound and the slight sting is heaven. It's not an itch I'm trying to satisfy. There's times where i wish I had a nice sized scab to pick at. </p>
<p>IMO, the best ones are the type you get from skinning your knee. For the record, I've never tried to cause harm in order to get a scab. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time I have a scab, it reminds me of the part in The Chronicles of Narnia when Eustace is describing how it felt when Aslan tore off Eustace's dragon scales to turn him into a boy again.</p>
<p>“The only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off.  You know — if you’ve ever picked the scab of a sore place.  It hurts like billy-oh but it <em>is</em> such fun to see it coming away.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What people don't understand about using the phrase OCD, is the D part. D means Disorder. If you were scratching a wound so badly that it stopped you from being productive, then you should see someone. I can relate to the constant picking of scabs and it often leads to me having even larger scars or scabs. Unfortunately this happens on my face a lot with acne. But I usually do it when I'm sitting around or don't have a better use for my hands. If I'm occupied or engaged in something I'm not doing it. Although I often find I'm scratching something and I don't realize it, or I do it in my sleep. I also have eczema and bad allergies so sometimes I'm just all around scratchy. </p>
<p>Anyway, if I was constantly picking at my scabs while socializing or needed to pick a scab as some sort of ritual, NOT as a release of physical sensation (meaning- you're picking at the scab for a reason besides it feeling good) then I'd have a problem. That would be the C part...the compulsion. You NEED to do it and you can't function if you don't. If it just feels good, that's not exactly criteria. Constantly picking at things can also be a sensory problem, or a disorder, or a sign of anxiety- but people throw around the OCD term a little much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all of that.  People throw around &quot;OCD&quot; and &quot;ADD&quot; as if they were small, normal personality traits.  I never would have thought to apply the term OCD to myself.  </p>
<p>But when I had to be hospitalized for an infection, and catch myself picking at the scabs even after that, it at least makes me wonder and worry a bit, and consider if I should seek out a psychiatric consultant in addition to a dermatologist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The OCD explanation is for extreme cases, don't think that is the reason, but I would see a dermatologist about that. I don't have clinical experience for skin ailments, but something that has persisted like that for that long of a time should be treated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I have that OCD! I have compulsive skin picking and frequently itch or tear at areas that I just picked at, most frequently my lips and legs. I do not feel pain from this, just a relief sensation.   </p>
<p>I found that this article is pretty interesting and might have something to do with this. Two different types of serotonin is released and one inhibits pain but exacerbates itch.  I am not qualified to say that this is for certain, so if anyone is qualified on the subject i'd love to learn more! :)

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have eczema that spiraled into what I would consider mild-moderate compulsive skin picking after 8 years (dermatillomania), though undiagnosed. Finally went to a clinic again and explained that I basically gave up on cortisone because I couldn't resist the itch, ruining the treatment and leading to more opportunities to pick. Got prescribed triamcinolone acetone ointment and it's been night and day in just days; managed to cut the itch and heal (but--oh my god how amazing it would be to scratch...not looking like an old record is what's keeping me &quot;clean&quot;.) No idea if this may help, but if yours is eczema related, I would really consider it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do have eczema and I have tried betamethasone, triamcinalone, and desonide cream.  All are wonderful.</p>
<p>But it doesn't have anything to do with my skin picking, that's just my anxiety at play. </p>
<p>Triamcinalone is wonderful at repairing my skin though. The say not to use it like that, but I put it on my face after a long session of picking at my face. Seriously, that stuff is magic.</p></div>		</li>

I've managed to keep my face and legs clear, but I can't stop with my lips for some reason -_-</p></div>		</li>
