			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest that sounds like it would be such a deep and relieving slumber, if you exclude any sickness felt from the drugs.  Like a week of tiredness all  flowing into you as you sink into a cozy bed, all set for a two day slumber filled with dreams of celestial prophecy’</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meth doesnt really have any physical effects aside from the lack of nutrients from not eating or drinking water. Plus lack of sleep, it really messes you up. But you don't really get sick from the drug. </p>
<p>Meth is more of a mental deteriorate. It induces anxiety, depression, memory problems, paranoia, etc. Well after getting clean. Most say it's because of the lack of sleep rather than the drug itself. But from my experience, it's a well mix of both. That extreme dopamine hit you get is unlike any normal person will ever receive plus the lack of sleep really messes up your mental state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it's more of a &quot;your body shuts down because you just can't stay awake any longer.&quot; Then you have a two day sleep, and since you're really dehydrated, your piss is yellow and you feel like shit because all the hunger, dehydration, lack of self care, and bad hygiene catch up to you all at once. So it's not the drug itself, but more of a side effect of a side effect. You stay up, Become sleep deprived, and then don't  take care of yourself because of that.</p></div>		</li>
