People compare the coronavirus pandemic to things like the black death and smallpox have no appreciation for how lethal acute illness was in the not so distant past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have it all wrong! The bird  fly will never cause a pandemic, because it is far too deadly! A disease’s “goal” is to get its host only a little sick so that it will survive for a long time, a disease like the bird flu might only make birds a little sick, but is super lethal for humans, so if the host dies very quickly, social distancing isn’t a issue, because there aren’t asymptomatic carriers, there is a pile of dead bodies.</p>
<p>You can’t have a pandemic if the disease is too lethal to infect a bunch of people. The video game pandemic illustrates this effect pretty well.</p></div>		</li>

It’s strange that people believe vaccines are a negative thing when they have eradicated many lethal diseases. </p>
<p>It’s quite a privilege to not have to worry about smallpox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti vaxxers need to be given accurate and honest information. I recently read a report from an American immunologist who when asked if a COVID -19 vaccine would be safe said &quot;nothing is 100% safe&quot;. The calculation that needs to be publicly done is the % risk from the vaccine V the % risk from the infection (and the chance of getting the infection). It is no use shouting &quot;herd immunity&quot; because these are individuals who see their kids at risk. If the risk from the vaccine is 1 in 100,000 but the risk from the infection is 1 in 1000 then the vaccine is easy to justify as a risk. A smallpox or polio vaccine is easy to justify. Measles is a lot harder because a) most people are not at risk of death or serious damage from measles and b) any risk from the vaccine in denied (yet &quot;nothing is 100% safe&quot;). We are clearly not given the full facts. Some of us will take the advice of our medical professionals, will consider others in the equation, will read research papers, will acknowledge that as intelligent people we have not much idea about this topic. Others will take the low road and believe the rumours and conspiracies. It has been shown that honesty in this topic from Doctors who take the time explain the risks and why we should take them increases the uptake of vaccines. The vast majority who don't vaccinate are just confused and are opting on the side of safety as they see it...and it really is a privaledge to not worry about smallpox (or polio)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact... there were three forms of plague during the black death and only one form (bubonic) had a chance for survival. If you contracted the bubonic form, you would have an 18 to 20 percent chance of recovery. The other two forms boasted a 99.99% chance of death. Of course, today you can recover from plague with the aid of antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>PS. smallpox had a fatality rate of 30% (and surviving it wasn't exactly fun), so unlike chickenpox people are not going to try and catch this deliberately...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually....smallpox had been around for so long that it was actually incorporated into some religions. It actually caused issues during the eradication of the disease because in some communities people with smallpox would not report it because they believed the disease was divine punishment in some cases. It wasn't necessarily spread, but it definitely helped to keep the rates of infection higher than otherwise may have been expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  It's obnoxious to children and deadly to adults.  As such it's much better to control to get it when you're young.</p>
<p>We used to hold pox parties where one kid would get all the other kids sick.  This stopped in the 1990s when a vaccine emerged.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Before effective vaccines, parents would send their kids to visit a kid who had either mumps, chicken pox or rubella.</p>
<p>A child catching those diseases is at far less risk than an adult. Odds in your favour if you caught them all when young.</p></div>		</li>
