<p>Some plastic soda bottles still have the plastic coin seal.  Some have a little &quot;smear&quot; of soft material in the groove in the cap.  Some non pressurized water bottles just have a ridge in the cap that acts like the seal.</p>
<p>I've seen chemical and drug containers have foil backed cardboard seals in the cap.  Those suck when they get wet-antifreeze and oil additives, I'm looking at you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember winning a free Pepsi with one and then going right back to the corner store to redeem it for a second Pepsi to share with my brother on our adventure to the playground. I didn't realize that It wouldn't seal anymore when it was in my bag and It leaked into my bag and we ended up with one Pepsi and a fond memory. Now it's all this &quot;enter your code online&quot; bullshit.</p></div>		</li>
