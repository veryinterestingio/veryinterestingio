			<div class="markdown"><p>The thrusters on the ISS are part of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module and use UDMH as the fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer. As soon as they're mixed together, they react and burn to create nitrogen and water that is expelled at high speed out the nozzles, which pushes the station in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The ISS is refuelled by resupply spacecraft a couple of times a year (mostly by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_(spacecraft\)" target="_blank">Progress vehicles</a>). There are connectors and piping for fuel and oxidizer built into the docking ring, so the crew doesn't have to handle the hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p>[EDIT] Had the fuel and oxidizer switched around. Thanks to /u/DeIonizedPlasma for pointing out my mistake.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the oxidizer (note the oxygen). UDMH is the fuel, as you can see it has carbon and hydrogen bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>generally, you have to throw something out of your ship to make your ship move, because of conservation of momentum. solar sails are an exception, because the momentum is coming from photons. although, if you were really clever, you could potentially use electricity to boost something like the ISS if you had the right physical configuration, because it's moving through Earth's magnetic field (because magnetic fields exert a force on current-carrying wires). I wonder how hard it would be to do that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's actually pretty common for cubesats to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorquer" target="_blank">Magnetorquers</a> for attitude control. </p>
<p>They aren't particularly powerful but cubesats are pretty small and light, plus they don't require any consumable fuel so as long as there is electrical power they can use them. Pretty neat, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I managed to find a bit of information on propellantless adjusting of satellites' orbits on Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are multiple applications for EMP technologies in the field of aerospace. Many of these applications are conceptual as of now, however, there are also several applications that range from near term to next century. One of such applications is the use of EMP to control fine adjustments of orbiting satellites. One of these particular systems is based on the direct interactions of the vehicle's own electromagnetic field and the magnetic field of the Earth. The thrust force may be thought of as an electrodynamic force of interaction of the electric current inside its conductors with the applied natural field of the Earth. To attain a greater force of interaction, the magnetic field must be propagated further from the flight craft. The advantages of such systems is the very precise and instantaneous control over the thrust force. In addition, the expected electrical efficiencies are far greater than those of current chemical rockets that attain propulsion through the intermediate use of heat; this results in low efficiencies and large amounts of gaseous pollutants. The electrical energy in the coil of the EMP system is translated to potential and kinetic energy through direct energy conversion. This results in the system having the same high efficiencies as other electrical machines while excluding the ejection of any substance into the environment.</p>
<p>The current thrust-to mass ratios of these systems are relatively low. Nevertheless, since they do not require reaction mass, the vehicle mass is constant. Also, the thrust can be continuous with relatively low electric consumption. The biggest limitation would be mainly the electrical conductance of materials to produce the necessary values of the current in the propulsion system. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean if mars (or any pre-existing habitable planet) had evolved intelligent life forms, a good indicator would be to look for floating space junk in its orbit? Meaning even if the entire plant was wiped or evacuated for whatever reason, we would still see its space junk orbiting around even if its been millions of years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most orbits aren't stable on the order of millions of years. Some aren't stable on much shorter timescales.</p>
<p>e.g. around Mars, Phobos will fall into the planet in maybe 40 million years. Deimos will drift away from Mars. It's hard to give accurate numbers on some of these things.</p></div>		</li>
