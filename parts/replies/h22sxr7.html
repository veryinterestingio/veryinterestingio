			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time you used “bacteria” you should have said “yeast.” Bacteria are used in alcohol beverage production along with yeast but do not create alcohol. They are used as a flavor-altering supplement, usually to produce acidity. Yeast is always the main alcohol producer in any type of alcohol. Also, vodka can be made from any sugar source, it just has to be distilled to the minimum required proof.</p></div>		</li>
