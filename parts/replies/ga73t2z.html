			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably have wet earwax. Wipe off your ear buds. You can clean the outer part of your ear canal, but don't go deep into your ear canal, as you can stuff earwax down to your eardrum.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to this.  I used to use cotton swabs until I got a series of ear blockages that ended up being fibres from the swabs basically turning the impacted wax into glue. I broke down and purchased a spray ear wax cleaner  (the elephant one I can recommend highly) and wow, the horrors that were visited upon my sink! I'll never use another cotton swab in my ear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did ask my doctor. I have always had problems with ear wax building up in my ears which then had to be removed by a doctor as it affected my hearing. I ask my ear, nose and throat specialist if there was anything I could do to fix the problem. He said I should carefully clean my ears with q-tips every day - just don't put them in so far it hurts. Since I started doing this 10 years ago I have had absolutely no issues with impacted earwax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. My ears produce sooooo much wax. My ENT told me to carefully clear out some on the outermost part with Q tips. Idk if I have weird ears or I just produce a lot of wax. If I skip a week I canâ€™t hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband and I both produce a ton of earwax... so when we had our son we knew what we were in for. He's 5 now, and our rule has always been: we will only clean earwax we can see. So we know it's all on the outside already. How can you hurt an eardrum if you're not even putting the q-tip in the canal? You can't.</p></div>		</li>
