			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of unrelated but I read somewhere the vagus nerve is responsible for hiccups and if you want to stop then you can stimulate the nerve but massaging your colon with your finger. Don’t know if it’s true but I am curious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes hiccups are diaphragm muscular spasms.; the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>Tbh people have a vague understanding of something and they start spreading that info as general facts... lately what's in vogue is assuming the enteric nervous system is responsible for everything they can think of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know, would this nerve be responsible for a similar feeling in the chest area?<br />
I’ve been having it for a while and the best way I can describe is like a wave going over my chest/ somewhat similar to the stomach drop</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happens to me too, and my doctor says it is. The vagus nerve: literally the fucking worst.</p>
<p>ETA: anxiety is what causes mine. If you're not often anxious or stressed you may want to talk to your doctor. Regardless, actually, may be worth talking to your Dr. If it is stress, worrying about what it is may be stressing you out more than you know.</p></div>		</li>
