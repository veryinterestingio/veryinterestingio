			<div class="markdown"><p>For the OP, in the US, there's a form called a W-4 that tells your employer how much to withhold. You're allowed to make it whatever value you want. If you're getting a huge refund or owe a huge bill, it's likely that your W-4 is out of whack (unless you did that on purpose).</p>
<p>The government doesn't particularly discourage refunds because those show up, to them, as a tax free loan from you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this:</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> fill the W-4 to withhold any sum, but withholding too little can result in penalties if you’re off by too much. They might let it fly the first year, but the second time you do it chances are they’ll hit you with a penalty.</p>
<p>IOW: Beat bet is to fill the W-4 accurately to minimize overpayment while avoiding penalties.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And people get WAY to scared of these mysterious &quot;penalties&quot; like it's going to be &quot;double your tax bill&quot; or something.</p>
<p>I underpaid like crazy once, when I did a shitload of 1099 work in the 4th quarter of a year. Ended up having to pay almost $7000 when I filed the next year. And (this goes back many years so I may be off) I believe the &quot;penalty&quot; portion of it was under $100.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taxes are actually due every quarter. If enough of your income comes from non-withheld sources then you have to pay estimated taxes quarterly. Most people don't run into that because withholding normally covers it. It's not recommended to set your withholding too low because if you repeatedly owe too much money when you file your return the IRS will fine you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taxes are due on different schedules depending on the size of your payroll.</p>
<p>My employer for example is required to make deposits within 2-3 days of every payday for all withholding. </p>
<p>We are required to reconcile quarterly and annually as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a guess. If you make a certain amount in a two-week period, a formula determines how much to withhold based on what your total yearly earnings would be if you continued to make that much all year. Then it adjusts that number using the filing status you gave them on your W-4 (single, married, etc.)</p></div>		</li>
