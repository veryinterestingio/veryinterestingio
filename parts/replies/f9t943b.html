			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and contrary to what I always thought, is neither quiet nor pitch black in the womb. Light manages to filter in though the mom's skin, and the sounds of the mom's blood pumping and organs working make it about as loud in the womb as standing in a bathroom with the shower running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a show talking about how a fetus hears all sorts of sounds from the mother, especially the talking.  Because of conduction, they can become very familiar with her voice.  The fetus can also become familiar with someone else besides the mother.  It's slightly different, but if there's a constant deep voice talking to that growing fetus, they can become very familiar with the cadence of that second voice too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mom's movement during the day tends to rock the baby to sleep. When mom lays down baby is no longer lulled to sleep and it's party time. It's also easier to feel baby when laying down still and without distractions.</p></div>		</li>
