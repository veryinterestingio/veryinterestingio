			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you that isn’t because when you’re cutting a tree, friction between the tree and the tool generates heat?</p>
<p>Also I think trees have “warmth” not because the generate heat, but because they store heat in places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah.  Not a lot, compared to animals, but they have enough metabolism to melt snow and the like.  dead trees also produce heat, but less so, and often not enough to melt snow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No no no. Cut his house down, use it to heat water to make steam to power a saw mill then we can cut down A LOT of trees and make every displaced bird a home. Of course we’d need a lot of trees just to make steam, that would require more bird houses as we’d be displacing more birds that way. Honestly, I think the future is in bird houses and bird house production related industries.</p></div>		</li>
