			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends what you eat, whether it's fluid or liquid, and what volume you need to shift into the small bowel. Japanese researchers have done a lot of work with ultrasounds and eating/drinking. </p>
<p>Anaesthetic guidelines (where I work) are 2h clear fluids, 6h food but these are almost certainly conservative, there is no clear reason to separate clear fluid from milk etc (according to the Japanese data, historically it was thought the higher caloric content per ml might make it take longer). Fluids will clear the stomach in under an hour in a normal person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish more people knew about gastroparesis, I feel like this is the only time I've seen it mentioned here. It's such a frustrating condition with very little safe treatment options. I would love for someone to do some awareness for it to try to try and find more treatment options. Ive had a mild to moderate case for 16 years and even I feel like it's pretty life running but talking to others with more serious symptoms I can't believe how people can live/survive with this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took reglan in the past and it really helped at first, I went from 85-115lbs in like 2 months and fully thought i was cured.  However it lost it's effectiveness pretty quick then they had to drop the dose after it was black boxed.  I finally had to stop taking it after it was giving me tardive dyskensia (I can never spell that).  Thankfully it isn't too bad my face is just a bit tense at times but it's so annoying that it's like the one drug that actually treats the problem. At least I still have Zofran for the nausea.</p>
<p>I do believe some people can have a gastric pace maker put in and have had success but I don't think a lot of places do the procedure (I think Cleaveland is the main one) and when it's mild to moderate it's hard to wanna have surgery.  I'm hoping with medical/tech advances they can make an easier/safer/more effective pace maker for use.  Fingers crossed for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had it when I was about 12 years old (not diabetic). It absolutely destroyed me. I don't know how, but through a cocktail of medicine I somehow recovered fully. I am so sorry that you continue to live with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine is pretty severe, my weight was extremely low and I could go several days still feeling full after a meal. I was put on 2 treatments though and I have put on 7 pounds in the last month. I was recently diagnosed and im super happy I can be normal bmi for once.</p></div>		</li>
