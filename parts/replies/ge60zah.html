			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the best food I ever tasted was after I went clubbing after not eating all day. It was like 4am and I got food from this hotdog stand. It tasted like pure heaven. I went back sober and not nearly as hungry and it was just meh at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I season nearly all my meals with hunger. Especially if it's something I don't think the kids will enjoy. It's amazing how starting to cook an hour later almost guarantees empty plates.</p>
<p>Occasionally there's the odd pre dinner fight if I misjudged the time, but usually it's worth it :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm one of the weird people who stress fasts. Not intentionally, stress kills my appetite but I've dropped 16 lbs I couldn't afford to lose in the last 11 months.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But I eat constantly when I'm not stressed. Ot probably balances out.</p></div>		</li>
