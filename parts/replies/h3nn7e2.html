			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs some addition. It's only possible with IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) . We cannot take an embryo out of a woman and then freeze it. It will not survive this.</p>
<p>But when we put spermcells and an egg together in a dish we can.</p>
<p>Also you're a little wrong on the cell count. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-many-cells-are-in-your-body?cmpid=int_org=ngp::int_mc=website::int_src=ngp::int_cmp=amp::int_add=amp_readtherest" target="_blank">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/how-many-cells-are-in-your-body?cmpid=int_org=ngp::int_mc=website::int_src=ngp::int_cmp=amp::int_add=amp_readtherest</a></p>
<p>We don't know but the estimate is roughly 5 to 200 billion cells.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My wife and I were going to start IUI. We went on a vacation first. Seemed the Dominican Republic is fertile ground as it was spontaneous. This was to my relief as I was almost declared infertile...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's trillions of human cells, but isn't the 100 trillion number the amount of bacteria cells we have? (which I don't think these estimates so far have taken into account?) humans= cells in the trillions, all I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have more foreign cells in your body than your own. I don’t know the exact amount of human cells so I stuck with a lowball of at least a trillion. </p>
<p>I thought it was important to note the difference between 40 million and 100 trillion.</p></div>		</li>
