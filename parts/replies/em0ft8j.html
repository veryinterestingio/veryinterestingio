			<div class="markdown"><p>One time after I got used to my eyes being open in a pool I figured Iâ€™d go to my high school swim practice without goggles. After a couple hundred laps and 2 hours of swimming I got out and my eyes stung a bit. Then after about 5 minutes I couldnâ€™t see whatsoever, any sort of light was way too much for me and I had to sit in the bathroom with the lights off until I cried all the chlorine out. Took about 25 minutes and was the worst pain Iâ€™ve experienced that lasted that long. Please donâ€™t make dumb choices like me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you have contacts you should avoid getting water in your eye since the contact tends to prevent the eye from naturally flushing and cleaning itself as well as it usually does. Bacteria can get trapped between the contact lens and your eye and give you an eye infection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pool water burns like fuck though...</p></div>		</li>
