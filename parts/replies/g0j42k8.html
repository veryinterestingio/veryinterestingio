<p>Remember, if you start speeding towards a distant object, such as a distant star, general relativity tells you that the space between you and that star starts shrinking from your point of view. At 90% the speed of light, the distance between you and that object is almost 2.3 times shorter. But from the star's point of view, it remains the same (minus the distance you already covered getting to 0.9c).</p>

<p>That is Ep 5 in minutephysics “Intro to Special Relativity” about length contraction and time dilation.</p>
<p>I highly recommend checking out the series from start to finish. Each video is fairly short (5-10 min).</p>
<p>Here is Ep 1, if you want to start from the beginning: <a href="https://youtu.be/1rLWVZVWfdY" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/1rLWVZVWfdY</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>The way I think about it is this:  if you're not accelerating, then from your reference frame you are effectively at rest; you can add some velocity by accelerating the same way you would in any other 'at rest' reference frame.</p>
<p>So let's say you continually accelerate at 1 m/s^2.  After 300,000,000 seconds, you haven't magically exceeded the speed of light.  In fact, from your point of view, if you stopped accelerating, you're now at rest (again) and the speed of light is still constant in your reference frame.</p>
<p>The only way this works is if the rest of space, from your reference frame, became contracted in your direction of travel.  (Time dilation also falls out of this thought experiment, too; from your point of view you can keep accelerating but from an external observer's point of view you can never exceed c)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how time dilation can occur without completely breaking observations made by a relativistic observer.</p>
<p>When accelerating to relativistic velocities the distance to be traversed to pass between two targets appears to shrink (if the targets are at rest relative to one another and along the trajectory of the observer).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don’t believe this is correct. The rocket ship traveling at .9c toward the distant star can easily treat the frame of reference as the rocket ship is sitting still with a solar system barreling towards it at .9c. Hence, both the solar system’s distance from the rocket ship’s perspective and the rocket ship’s distance from the solar system’s perspective are length contracted equally. What you may be conflating this with is how that solar system views the rocket ship’s origin, which is still the same distance away. Relativity is funny like that, but perspectives are always mirrored unless one of the frames is accelerated relative to the other (and in this thought experiment, the rocket ship is traveling at constant velocity .9c).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. His point remains though, that the same &quot;amount&quot; of space can represent different distances, depending on your frame of reference. That's counter to an intuition of &quot;quantised space&quot;. </p>
<p>When an object grows shorter or longer as it accelerates toward you or away from you, does it do so in quants? That would imply that changes in speed also happen in quants. That appears to make sense until you consider that the same amount of acceleration results in different speed changes depending on the angle of direction. If my speed vector points directly at one object, but has like a 60° angle to another object, then the same acceleration causes a higher change of speed toward the former than the latter object. So if I accelerate one quant of speed toward the former object, I accelerate less than a quant toward the latter, which isn't possible. So angles must be quantised too? This is kinda hurting my brain.</p></div>		</li>
