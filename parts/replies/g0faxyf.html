			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I got up to 120 in a 2016 VW Passat SE on a shitty county road in the Midwest. It was really straight and had a big hill and nobody for miles around so I decided why not? I hit that high and I thought I better drop back down to the speed limit, half that 😅</p></div>		</li>

<li>Perspective. It allows you to see how fast you're going relative to maximum speed, empowers the dark side and lets the hate flow through you far more effectively in rush hour traffic.</li>

<p>Speedometers are a Sith plot to induce anger. Change my mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>sales: ppl buying a Buick lesabre are probably not super stoked; seeing the car goes up to 140 subconsciously reassured them that it’s a powerful car, whether or not that speed is actually attainable.</p>

<p>Can confirm. The only way my VW Polo could reach the speeds at the top end of the speedometer would be by dropping it from an airplane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or a long, free stretch of slow downward incline. Of course you would not be safe doing it in a light car like Polo, the first sideways gust will fuck you up. (Did that in a 1986 Opel Corsa... adrenaline was off the charts and my arms were shaking for half an hour later)</p></div>		</li>
