			<div class="markdown"><p>My conclusion when playing with a little RK4 orbit simulator I made was basically this. You need the two moons to be rotating about eachother with an insane angular momentum to be close enough to eachother whilst maintaining a big enough distance from the main planet to not be quickly destabilised.</p>
<p>Edit for OP: loosely speaking, you need the two moons to be close enough together that they are each feeling the same gravity from the planet or they will decouple from eachother. Alternatively, you could say that the planet needs to only &quot;see&quot; one orbiting object and not two. In order for this to be the case, the two planets need to be spinning around eachother so fast that you'd wonder how it ever happened</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely the speed has nothing to do with what gravity &quot;sees&quot;. It's just that the moons need to be very close to each other to feel significantly more gravity from the other moon than from the planet. And like all orbits, the closer you are, the faster you have to go to avoid falling in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed is a symptom of the required proximity of the binary moon system.  In order to not be destabilized quickly by the gravitational force of the planet, the moons must not at any point be in a position where one moon is significantly closer to the planet than the other.  If this happens, the closer moon will be pulled away from the farther moon until the binary system is turned into a pair of simple satellites.  The closer two bodies are, the faster the orbit has to be, hence the high speed.  I’d imagine the only real way to achieve a system like this would require two high-speed interstellar bodies to happen to intercept each other inside the gravity well of the parent planet, which is (probably, guessing here) a statistical impossibility.  </p>
<p>A binary moon system, however, if the moons are of decent size, would soon tear itself into dust due to the incredibly high gravitational and centrifugal forces, right?  I’m not quite sure of the magnitude of these forces when compared to the gravitational forces holding the moons together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a possible interpretation: because the acceleration due to gravity is measured per second per second (m/s\^2), the longer one of the moons is exposed to ‘more’ gravity, i.e. a closer proximity to the main planet, the more it would be affected. Therefore, a slower rotation speed of the two moons results in a greater offset.</p>
<p>But would the offsets of both individual moons (after each half-rotation), just cancel each other, and result in no net change?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would definitely be possible, but I don't think such a thing would <em>ever</em> form naturally.</p>
<p>The reason is that the solar system formed out of a gas cloud rotating in the same direction, and barring spectacular collisions, the resulting bodies still rotate in the same direction.</p>
<p>AFAIK the only exception is Venus, which rotates <del>sideways</del> (and even Venus still orbits around the Sun the usual way).</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry, got the planets mixed up: Venus rotates in the opposite direction, Uranus is the one that rotates sideways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moons need to be in a very wide orbit around the primary and a very tight one around each other. Our moon is too close and too large to support its own moon.</p>
<p>In any realistic case where Earth has binary moons, they become asteroidal-size bodies between 250,000 and 600,000 km away.</p>
<p>So the impact on tides is that we lose lunar tides and only have solar tides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...  I can't figure out how to put this that makes sense..</p>
<p>So if the gravitational pull of the moon was an electrical current... And the ocean was a transducer....</p>
<p>The moon, as it is, could sound, maybe  like one of those manual firetruck sirens. A little higher frequency as it gets louder (closer), and a little lower frequency as it gets quieter (Further away).</p>
<p>So a stable binary moon system could then sound...</p>
<p>Like when you purse your lips to whistle and push your tongue up n down to make a sort of warbling noise.
But then at such a low frequency as to be infrasonic, and so quiet you'd need to be in a special room to hear... </p>
<p>The tides would be possibly so minimal as to be hard to measure. Especially with the cyclic change &quot;noise&quot; of the binaries orbitz getting in the way.</p>
<p>There's a 'the measure of gravitational pull is object mass in relation to it's distance from observer..' kind of mathy statement. So the binary moon system, it seems to me, would have to be nearly the whole  mass' of both moons AND the planet's worth of distance away from each other... So the 2 moons could continue to do the Uber spin. </p>
<p>Does the rate of change of gravitational pull  over distance soften with mass/density? So does like a planet that's big af, but super undense have a softer change rate than a tiny dense one?</p></div>		</li>
