			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been working for years to make myself to like fish and mushrooms (not together really, just those two food items)</p>
<p>I can eat more fish now than I could 10 years ago, but I still don't really like it.  I think my biggest success is 2 pieces of fried catfish with a fuck ton of lemon.  A little over half of smoked salmon fillet would be the second most I've ever eaten without pushing it away. </p>
<p>Also, I just gave up on Tilapia after about 4 tries.  Everyone suggests it for people who hate fish, but that shit is disgusting and I refuse to try it anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time I tried Guinness (age 19), I hated it -- thought it tasted like horse piss. Didn't drink it for many years afterward as a result.</p>
<p>Fast forward years later -- it is my favorite beer by far.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you didn't like beer, but forced yourself to drink it and kept telling yourself it tastes good until you started to believe it?</p>
<p>Sounds like Stockholm syndrome or something.</p></div>		</li>
