			<div class="markdown"><p>Intuitively if I have two bottles one absolutely full and one with a bit under full (air pocket) and I shake them to mix I assume the one with the air mixes faster and better. (Say I'm mixing in a ton of salt) Is that a true assumption? Why?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Similarly, When I clean a peanut butter jar I fill it \~1/2 way with water, a dash of soap. Shake it furiously and it's basically clean. If I filled it all the way up it would do a terrible job cleaning. Is the &quot;Sloshing&quot; effect more effective at disturbing the particles in the jar than if there was no sloshing?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And lastly, as another hypothetical tangent question that came to mind, would a river with tons of bubbles (think carbonated water) erode the riverbed faster than a river with absolutely no bubbles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bubbly river question is kinda strange to answer. The answer is sort of no, because bubbles alone won't make a river do anything new to the minerals in the bed. But, the ways that the water could be aeratedare pretty limited. It could be moving fast on a rocky riverbed, which would absolutely make it erode faster than if it were moving slowly. Or, it could, as you pointed out, have a lot if CO2 dissolved in it, causing it to bubble. But, CO2 can react with water, making it slightly acidic. That will also make it erode faster. But the presence of air bubbles won't make it erode more, no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah good question! What’s happening here is that you now have kinetic energy. When you move the bottle and there IS an air bubble, the water moves along with the bottle and then when the bottle stops and then reverses direction (I just mean from the movement of your arm as you shake it) then all that moving water will come crashing into the wall of the bottle. This only happens if there’s an air bubble... if there’s no air, then the water isn’t crashing anywhere because there’s already water in the way to cushion the blow.</p>
<p>This “crashing” process is important. There is a very high pressure in this moment (called the “stagnation pressure”) which is going to create a highly turbulent flow. Turbulent flow is just a fancy term for when the liquid moves according to momentum rather than viscosity... in other words it’s a very chaotic movement. The counterpart is Laminar flow, which is very calm, well-behaved flow. </p>
<p>This turbulence causes all the water to mix up quickly. </p>
<p>So you’re absolutely right - the water bottle with some air in it will mix faster.</p>
<p>This same thing applies to cleaning the peanut butter jar. That big instantaneous pressure will cause the peanut butter to dislodge more easily, and also cause more soap to come into contact with the PB due to the mixing I described before.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, some schmuck with some instant strawberry milk and a water bottle here. </p>
<p>Water does move around inside cus particles in the water form a whirlpool even with a full bottle. There's just a lack of force pushing against your hand because the water doesn't have the space needed for it to make a noticeable push. </p>
<p>Or at least those are my findings.</p></div>		</li>
