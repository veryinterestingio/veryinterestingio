			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you only have to tell what the children, class and teacher in your analogy means, how all of this applies to a real world display :)</p>
<p>Also, it would help if you told what advantages this kind of technology brings to the display.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><h1>PIXELS</h1>
<p>Imagine a crowd of rows upon rows of students in a stadium grandstand, all with cardboard cards of different colours. If there are enough of them holding up the right cards you can get a <a href="https://youtu.be/QXH1qhymxAw?t=20" target="_blank">very clear image</a>. Each student and his card is called a &quot;Pixel&quot; (which is a shortening of &quot;picture element&quot;).</p>
<p>Now, in this case all the students have been told which cards to show, and when. But when you use a computer you tell the computer what to show. When you type a word you expect the computer to show that word! </p>
<p>To do this we could have a teacher give instructions with a megaphone and their own stack of cards. Without the teacher the students have no idea what to do and start doing things like [//pick a bored student doing something they shouldn't and point to that as an example]. For example &quot;Hey you in row 10, 3rd from the left&quot; and then hold up their own blue card (I would then demonstrate this to the class). Not only that but we want all the students to be told what to do, so we start way at the back/top left and work our way through them. This would take a long time if there were a lot of students! Some of the students may become bored or distracted and not hold their cards up straight - so their card is a little darker - the whole picture they're drawing becomes darker overall. </p>
<h1>AMOLED</h1>
<p>So instead we could have a teacher for every row and every column, that way the 10th row's teacher and the 3rd column's teacher could hold up a blue card - nobody needs to yell into a megaphone and the whole thing happens a lot quicker. Not only that but our students are no longer becoming distracted during the long wait and so the image is brighter. </p>
<p>Sounds great, but there's still an issue, when you have this many students all lined up it's kinda hard to tell if you're in the 3rd column or the 4th. You see a teacher at the bottom hold up their card and think, &quot;Hey, is that my column or the one next to me&quot;. So some students who aren't meant to hold up their cards may start to hold theirs up - after all they're trying to be quick! So maybe we could put a grid of walls up so each student can only see the teachers for their row and column. (Transistor that specifies active pixel to prevent bleed). Oh, and while we're solving problems, let's give the student a card holder so that when they're waiting to be called they can just leave the card there and not hold it up all the time (Capacitor).  </p>
<h1>Extra credit - OLED vs LCD</h1>
<p>So this whole time we've been talking about OLED. But you also see screens that call themselves &quot;LCD&quot; displays. LCD is way cheaper, and OLEDs only seem to be in newer screens, so what's the difference?</p>
<p>Well, now we're talking about the cards themselves. See, if the student just help up a painted card the image would be really dim. In an LCD each student is holding a mirror, rather than a card, and we shine light on to them in a range of colours. When the student has to reproduce a colour we tell them to angle their mirror a certain way [//Use a mirror and a lightsource to demonstrate] and this reflects the right colour back at us. [Possible proviso that in an LCD light shines through the &quot;cards&quot; and is not actually reflected - polarisation, RGB and additive colour is a little bit too far for 5 year olds I think]. But when I shone that light on you all with the mirror, only some of you could see it at one time. If you're not in exactly the right spot colour and brightness on an LCD can look kinda weird [//Yes, TN panel only - gosh you kids are smart]. Plus we have to shine a whole bunch of light, and only some of it gets back to us - your parents tell you to turn off lights in rooms you don't use to save money on electricity, and now we're shining all this light only to use some of it!? And there's one more problem, say we just want a black image, so we tell all the kids to not reflect any. Well, we're still shining a huge light on them all, so we will still be able to see something. That's not really &quot;black&quot;, it's just &quot;as dark as we can get&quot;. </p>
<p>But scientists are really clever, especially when it involves finding ways to make movies and games look better at home on their tv, or on their phones. So they found a way for the cards themselves to emit light - and only in the colour we want. Now we have real black, and because the card is making the light I can view it from any angle. Plus we aren't wasting all that electricity on light we don't use.</p></div>		</li>
