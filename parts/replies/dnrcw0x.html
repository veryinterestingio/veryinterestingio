			<div class="markdown"><p>You cant unless you have an infrared thermometer, humidity sensor and then a handheld anemometer to get the wind speed. Even then you’ll only get measurements at a single point in your house. It’s worth noting too that the temperature can vary from room to room and even within rooms as well. Your thermostat only measures one variable in one spot, so it’s not a perfect tool.</p>
<p>In the end, the energy transfer in buildings is very complex, which is why we need simulation software and input of hundreds of variables before we can accurately estimate the overall heat transfer to +/- 5% or so.</p></div>		</li>
