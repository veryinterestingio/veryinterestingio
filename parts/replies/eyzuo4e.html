			<div class="markdown"><p>The first few times I got migraines all I had was the dazzle thing, scintillation whatever.  That was scary AF, thought I was stroking out.  Then I started getting the headaches to go with.  Go figure, work finally fired the evil bastard of a boss, the stress and my migraines went away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first got aura migraines I was 8, and the school nurse thought I was having a stroke because of other common symptoms with aura - left side numbing and aphasia. 30 minutes later the pain sets in.</p>
<p>I hate it, I panic when I first see the aura,  it's so uncomfortable not being able to see out of part of your vision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s an ocular migraine. I get them in different forms. One is like a closing tunnel vision, another looks like fan blades in my perif, another is clear haze (almost like heat off pavement). They last 20-30 mins and I get a physical migraine right after they clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, first migraine I noticed because I lost the ability to read due to tunnel vision. Then I lost the ability to form cohesive thoughts, genuinely thought I was gonna die lol I was just lying down groaning</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I first get blind spots and then loose my peripheral vision on my migraine side. Before i recognize that it’s blind spots and an incoming migraine- it freaks me out a little. Every time. After 30 years. As soon as I recognize them the pain fear sets in, but at least I know what’s going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My migraines come in without aura and from smells and tastes. I’m one of those lucky people that has without aura and with intractable migraines. So they have me Botox injections, prophylaxis meds and CGRP meds and emergency meds. I also the cocktail meds for when I can’t drive myself to the neurologist. Even got occipital nerve blocks when they have gone 4 days .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always felt lucky to get migraine auras. It’s a nice warning signal to get myself somewhere where I can hunker down for a few hours. My coworker gets intense migraines with no aura and often gets stranded places when they hit. Sorry you’ve been dealing with such terrible ones. Migraines suck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have epilepsy and bipolar II so I take Lamictal among other meds for anxiety and depression. Coincidentally the Lamictal prevents migraines. You should ask your dr about it. It’s a mood stabilizer with hardly any side affects.</p></div>		</li>
