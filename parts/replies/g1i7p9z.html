			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really it.  </p>
<p>Many of the policies introduced by the ACA are broadly popular.  When people are polled on how they feel about individual aspects of the law, without mentioning it's name, people overwhelmingly support it.  Mention ACA in an otherwise identical poll, and support drops considerably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. Sure, there are a bunch of people who were just opposed to President Obama and virtually anything he did, but for many of us, it caused us to both lose our healthcare and then be fined by the feds for not having healthcare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to allow insurance companies to afford covering pre-existing conditions and the removal of spending caps they were allowed to charge significantly more across the board. As a young, healthy person who  attends an independent practitioner who doesn't take insurance. My options when I wasn't covered by an employer had significantly higher premiums (more than double), higher copays, and higher deductibles.  Or, I could be taxed (since mitigated) for the privilege of not having insurance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obama himself stated numerous times that it would lower health insurance costs by thousands but the majority of those who actually paid for their health insurance saw radical increases in their monthly premiums, adding many thousands of dollars per year.  </p>
<p>He also said that if you liked your current insurance plan, you could keep it, but most people saw their insurance plans cancelled and had to shop for more expensive plans featuring services they didn't need or want.  With many health insurance companies dropping out of the market, and the restriction of the markets to state lines, meaning the insurance only allowed you to seek care within your home state, the lack of competition likely contributed to the increase in premiums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UK here too, can I ask how does a healthy person decide which insurance to choose? Surely you want to cover everything just in case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is one of the great challenges with healthcare insurance.</p>
<p>It is the case with ant insurance that you don't know up front how much you need, and that is kindnof hownand why insurance works.</p>
<p>With health insurance it is particularly tricky, though, because you ar far more likely to consume healthcare, and there is less of a known cap on your risk. And the dollar values can be very high.</p>
<p>One reason a lot of people were frustrated with the bill is that it required a certain level of care. Many young, healthy people would get &quot;catastrophic plans&quot; which were relatively cheap, didn't cover much, but would tgeoretically hep them out if something disasterous happened. Kind of a &quot;I'll cover everything up to 15k, but if it goes over that then i need unsurance to kick in.&quot;</p>
<p>Many of these had loopholes and would dump people when theybdid end up actually needing that coverage.... but since most people never experienced that it was hard to knownif you were losing a good option, or if you were losing what was actually a shit option but seemed a good option.</p>
<p>So a lot depended on how much you could afford, what mind of risk factors you had, how frequently you used healthcare, etc. And then you just gambled.</p>
<p>To an extent people also have to do this with employer provided healthcare. One hidden cost to our system is the amount of time, energy, and stress that goes into selecting plans. Even leople with work provided healthcare tend to have a few options whkch take varying amounts out of your paycheck. So you decide once a year basically how lucky you feel. Would you like lower premiums but more risk. Or higher premiums for coverage you may not use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, the fee or tax or whatever anyone chooses to call it for not having coverage was easily removed when filing taxes depending on family income.  That was not made as clear as it could have been and led a lot of people to dislike the act outright.</p></div>		</li>
