			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, ADHD comes with dysfunction in the areas of the brain that mediate Executive function. Executive function mediates working memory, inhibitory functions, and a whole bunch more. The main important ones for ADHD are the two I mentioned.</p>
<p>With poor inhibitory function the brain of someone with adhd is basically missing its middle manager, and really struggles to prioritise basically everything going on. This manifests externally as being poor at prioritising certain stimuli as important, so it is very easy to be distracted by an environment dense in stimuli. It also makes it hard to maintain a steady train of thought, for the same reasons, leading to the scatter brain effects.</p>
<p>The above is also impacted by impaired working memory, which is effectively your brains ram. As your brain is super poor at selectively attending to specific stimuli, your lower capacity of working memory is worsened by it also being more cluttered than the average persons. This contributes to all the short term memory problems in someone with ADHD.</p>
<p>When combined with the prospective memory problems, this can make procrastination a <em>bitch</em>. Though in reality it’s not really procrastination, it’s executive dysfunction. You can’t focus on the thing, which is stressful, you can’t inhibit your desire to avoid the thing, and the consequences of not doing the thing aren’t salient, AND you can’t inhibit your response to more direct stimuli (distractions, stress).</p>
<p>(To distinguish procrastination and executive dysfunction. The former is ‘the thing is lame, and I don’t want to do it, so I’m going to avoid it. However it’s important so I’m still gonna feel guilty/stressed.’. The later is ‘oh my god I WANT to do the thing, <em>so</em> much, but I just fucking <em>cant</em>’. Having experienced both the later is much, much worse for your mental state) </p>
<p>Plus the dopamine system is impared in people with adhd, so you don’t get that juicy fat reward cocktail that most people get on completing a task. This makes it harder to train your self that task completion is a <em>good</em> thing</p>
<p>There are more executive functions that are impaired, and greatly contribute to this, but I can’t remember them off the top of my head. Plus I’m currently avoiding an essay, which is the peak of irony</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This really spoke to me as I’ve been struggling with this for many years. I’ve never seen it explained so well...</p>
<p>Do you happen to have any tips for improving this sort of behavior without medication or therapy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Martial arts training helped me tremendously. Meditation exercise and mindfulness help, as do external constructs and systems that automate as much of your activity as possible. Apps, lists, and note taking. Cultivate a fundamental clinical understanding of ADHD in your close relationships so the people around you understand and can help support you. </p>
<p>In the end therapy and medication are best. You have a trained professional who understands the medicine behind your condition who can act as a point of support without feeling like you’re taking advantage of them because you are paying them to do that. As for medication, you are chemically supplementing an aspect of your brain function that neurotypical people manufacture naturally. It’s not cheating to try to level the playing field, and it may alter aspects of your personality, but that’s the point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This explains a lot about my husband. He always has <em>at least</em> a dozen projects going on. And he still starts more - constantly! But finishing anything is a monumental effort, he hates it, and it makes him cranky. As far as he's concerned he could be having way more fun starting something else. </p>
<p>Almost nothing gets finished. But saying &quot;no&quot; to something new and shiny would be worse for him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this! I hate when people compare executive dysfunction with being lazy or not wanting to do something when, while it does manifest in say not doing the dishes, it's all the time and everywhere. It's sitting working on something with your stomach gurgling and you keep thinking about the fridge full of easy to microwave leftovers in the next room. It's or &quot;just this one last ___ and I'll go to the bathroom&quot; until it's an hour and a half later and suddenly have to run there or else. It's getting a headache from dehydration with a glass of water in front of you because you don't consciously think you need it right now as much as your brain wants the little dopamine releases from an online crossword, until you've done all of them on several websites and it's three hours later and you have to out loud narrate the entire process to yourself of reaching your hand out, picking up the glass, etc.</p>
