			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m also curious about this. The 5 things mentioned (openness to new experiences, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) all seem, to varying degrees, to be traits that could change throughout ones lifetime. For example, I used to be very neurotic and closed off but am now excited to be put out of my comfort zone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting thing to me is how they might interact. There are correlations between traits, but some people are outliers.</p>
<p>For example, maybe you would have always scored very high in neuroticism, but also very high in openness to experience (I score on opposite ends on these). How does a highly neurotic, very open person act? It might seem like they change a lot, or are very contradictory, even if these large factors remain stable. </p>
<p>An anxious person is probably always going to be anxious, but what they are anxious about might change quite a bit, and it might seem to them and others like they have had a huge shift in personality. People are weird!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some tend to increase with age (agreeableness, for example) and others tend to decrease, but in general people don’t go from very high on a trait (neuroticism, for example) to very low. They typically change relative to each other.</p>
<p>Any big personality changes could be brought on by some sort of intervention: trauma, a life changing experience, drug use, or even intentionally deciding to be more X. If you notice this in a friend, they may need some support or you may inquire how they’re doing. It’s particularly telling in children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t have primary sources handy, this is just off the top of my head from textbook blurbs I’ve used in the past:</p>
<p>1) Stability of (measurable) personality traits increases with age—can fluctuate quite a bit when young, but becomes more and more set in stone as one gets older.</p>
<p>2) There are some “personality” traits that are especially evident even in infants (e.g. how baby handles separation from parents, how kids resist instant gratification, etc) and seem to be more stable than other personality traits, and generally referred to as temperaments.</p>
<p>3) As another poster commented, some big 5 traits change in similar trajectories change over time for most people: neuroticism decreases, conscientiousness increases, etc. This is probably the result of repeated socialization.</p>
<p>4) While absolute levels of traits can definitely change over a person’s lifetime, the relative levels don’t change as much when compared to cohorts. For example, if you were the 100th most extroverted person in high school, you can become much more extraverted over time when compared to your high school self, but probably not THAT much more different when compared to your high school peers—it’s unlikely your extroverted ranking will jump to 50th when compared to your high school classmates years later.</p></div>		</li>
