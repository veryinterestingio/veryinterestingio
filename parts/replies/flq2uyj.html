			<div class="markdown"><p>Wanted to add: &quot;toe to spinal cord&quot; and &quot;spinal-based calculations&quot; here probably refer to reflexes originating from the spinal cord, which give a faster reaction than movements directed from the brain. For example, a predator bites the tip of a brachiosaur's tail; it would take much too long for the sensory input to reach the brain and for the brain to then direct a response back down to the tip of the tail (on the order of whole seconds!!!). So instead, certain automatic reflexes can be directed from the spinal cord, meaning the impulse has to travel a much shorter distance there and back, and is therefore faster. The brachiosaur's tail twitches and smacks the predator before the brachiosaur even realizes it has been bitten. It's another way the nervous system compensates for large bodies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the sort of reflex like tapping on the knee, correct? </p>
<p>As a conscious being, I find it so fascinating when normally voluntary muscles act without my consent, or further, in defiance of my will. I can tell my leg not to twitch, but unless I flex prior to the test, my knee will react regardless of my intent.</p>
<p>Consciousness is such a tiny sliver of our bodies function, I'd say it's more apt for us to consider the &quot;self&quot; as just a fragment of being, along for the ride on this shoddy but surprisingly robust vessel we find ourselves in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sliver, sure, but we're not really &quot;just along for the ride&quot; if we're the one at the wheel, now are we? I mean, it's like a car. Yeah, the driver's pretty small compared to the whole thing, and (s)he's not personally rotating the pistons in the engine, but a car left running without a driver is just a waste of time and resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, it is theorised that larger dinosaurs had multiple nerve nodes throughout their body. Multiple spinal cords, so to say, for different body parts.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In summary, yes it takes more time for nerves to send information to and from the limbs, but the larger animal has a longer stride which allows them to compensate for this increase in firing time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But moving away from the specific application of reacting to changes related to their movement,</p>
<p>wouldn't that still mean that larger animals <strong>do</strong> actually react slower, and that this would be notable, i.e., when they are in a stationary state (even when disregarding inertia of mass, which would obviously disadvantage a horse over a mouse)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read of giant squid having unusually large axon diameters to facilitate faster nerve conduction. They are actually visible to the naked eye and relatively easy to manipulate for experiments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it should also be noted that invertebrates do not have myelin, which is an insulating coating that speeds up axonal conductance significantly. Instead, their nerves increased in diameter to increase the speed of conductance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of nerve impulses, or action potentials, depend on axonal diameter. The thicker the axon, the faster the action potential travels. Axon diameter varies in your own brain and between other species.</p></div>		</li>
