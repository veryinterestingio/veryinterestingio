			<div class="markdown"><p>Your credit is determined by three agencies. They are in the business of selling your credit information to others for various reasons. The only reason why you get three free a year is because the government determined that you have some right to see the information that agencies have on you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Companies that check your credit pay for each report. Ones that do it &quot;for free&quot; are earning advertising revenue to offset the cost of the reports, or possibly reselling that credit information. You can absolutely check it any time you want to, but you'll pay the fee that these institutions pay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can do it as often as you'd like.  You just have to pay for the service you're being provided if you want it more often.</p></div>		</li>
