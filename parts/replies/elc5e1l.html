<p>Note that there is a reason it's called grammatical gender and not just a noun-class distinction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, it's the other way around. 'gender', as a word was <em>originally</em> used to refer to 'class' and 'kind', with the first documented example of 'grammatical gender' being in the 14th century. It's use for biological gender wasn't until a century later, where it was used to refer solely to sex and manner of reproduction.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a matter of fact we speakers of Romance languages have started to use &quot;gender&quot; as in/instead of sex only recently through a calque from English. It's as if we were embarrassed of saying &quot;sex&quot;. Now to justify this usage people say &quot;gender&quot; is actually a sociocultural group whereas &quot;sex&quot; is our organic condition. Explanations may vary. 20 years ago &quot;gender&quot; was only related to words (masculine or feminine) together with &quot;number&quot; (singular or plural).</p>
<p>Edit: masculine or (not &quot;of&quot;) feminine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hum, I guess this depends on when the term &quot;grammatical gender&quot; started being used. In any case, though, you're  right that my comment was definitely wrong, even though it was a REALLY convenient explanation: just remembered that the animacy distinction of some languages is also called &quot;gender&quot;, despite having nothing to do with real-life gender. So I guess it's up in the air why English's noun classes aren't <em>technically</em> gender or what the formal difference between grammatical gender and a noun-class system is ü§∑</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a linguist, I only have a passing interest, so I can't answer that. However I think you're going about this the wrong way. Nobody said &quot;This word is masculine, thus it behaves like this&quot;. I'm more inclined to believe words naturally started to group together in to classes and later on we said &quot;All these words behave the same, thus they are masculine&quot;.[citation needed]. </p>
<p>Gender assignment is most likely tied to what sounded good and logical: Norsemen liked the sound of &quot;Sver√∞i√∞ mitt&quot; better than the sound of &quot;Sver√∞inn minn&quot;, so &quot;sver√∞&quot; became a neuter word. I suspect only a handful of nouns actually got assigned a grammatical gender that intentionally matched the natural gender. Most of the time gender is a descriptor of how the word behaves grammatically, instead of what that word actually means. </p>
<p>I assume that a french or german speaker would find it &quot;sound off&quot; if they use a word in the wrong gender, and I assume that loanwords when forced in to the grammar of the languages naturally sound &quot;better&quot; in some gender classes than others. In Icelandic loanwords naturally start gravitating towards certain genders when mutilated to fit other aspects of the grammar, so if no natural gender exists to ascribe their grammatical gender their meaning becomes irrelevant and the &quot;law of the ear&quot; takes precedent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One word that seems to be going through this process at the moment is the loan word for vapes. I use it in a masculine form(veip-inn), my girlfriend in a neutral form(veip-i√∞), and my mom in a feminine form(veip-an), with 'veip' being pronounced exactly like the English word vape. I personally think that it sounds right in the masculine form but time will have to tell which one ends up on top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. When these languages adopt a word from English for example, the gender is assigned by what sounds best and the word may even be slightly manipulated to fit the gender.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that's entirely true.  My kids when to primary school in French, and the whole class did a lot of exercises that involved putting the right article in front of nouns. If they could just tell by how the word sounded, they wouldn't have needed to fill out so many of those worksheets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think if things like this: every language on Earth right now has undergone millenia of evolution, they used to have different structures that they might not have anymore except in vestiges that seem irregular to us today. But if you looked into the language's past, you'd find that things started out regular and then got irregular by accident so to speak</p>
<p>Now the oldest language we can kind of reconstruct that German came from, Proto-Indo-European, also had grammatical gender, so we don't know of a time where it was regular. But something like the French verb <em>aller</em> has lots of irregularities (<em>je vais, j'allais, j'irai</em>) that don't seem to have a reason, but in reality what happened is that several Vulgar Latin verbs &quot;collapsed&quot; into this one verb which made it irregular nowadays</p>
<p>So at one point, maybe that was 8000 years ago for all we know, an ancestor language had genders that were regular (meaning, they had consistently predictable forms), but since then, it's become an irregular thing through sound changes and the like, even if there are some patterns you can latch on to</p></div>		</li>
