			<div class="markdown"><p>The rods made the core critical because they wouldn’t go back in. Because of the graphite they were stuck and wouldn’t go back in to stabilize the core so the reactions inside the core were at that stage uncontrollable. In a different reactor built without the graphite tips on the rods the answer to your question is most probably different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well no, the rods made the core critical because they <em>did</em> go back in.</p>
<p>It is commonly thought that something broke, and the rods stuck in place. But that is really just a surmise. It is equally possible that the rods kept moving but the sensor broke when things in the core starting bursting. Point is, in ten seconds the rods were blasted into the stratosphere anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know. </p>
<p>The rods did go in, just partly though. That's why core go critical because rods stuck as soon as they started to go in. The graphite tip accelerated the process.</p></div>		</li>
