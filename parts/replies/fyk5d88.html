<p>and that yellow circle representing Sun is bigger than the sphere human radio waves got to since invention of radio...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really the same as anything you look at though, whether stars or yourself in the mirror.</p>
<p>All sight is dependent on light travelling to your eye and that always takes time. It just takes more time the further away it is from your eyeball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, even looking at my phone right now, it’s in the past. </p>
<p>My favorite thing about being a human is that I can understand all of this in just a little bit of space. Like how Neil deGrasse Tyson made it sound, that no matter how minutely small we are compared to everything, we have the power to know and hold so much information</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silly question here; So are the pictures we see of our galaxy real pictures? Or just mapped out images to the best of our knowledge? I wonder this because when people take long exposure shots to capture the stars we see the part of the galaxy that I’m assuming is where we are/our POV (pls tell me if I’m wrong) But how would we get those outside shots that we see?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would take a ship traveling at the speed of light 200,000 years to travel across our galaxy plus another 200,000 to send that picture back to earth, so yes - viewing a picture of it is not something we'll be able to do any time soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any picture you see of our galaxy is an illustrated representation of what we think it looks like be in CG or whatever media the artist chooses to use. We would need to be millions of light years away to get a photo of our whole galaxy in one shot. We have seen other spiral galaxies with our telescopes to compare it with.so we know more or less what it looks like. This is a vast simplification.</p></div>		</li>
