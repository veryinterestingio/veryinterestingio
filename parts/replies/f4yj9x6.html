			<div class="markdown"><p>Im familiar with the show, but haven't seen it. I'm gonna go ahead and <em>not</em> watch that episode. I think I've called myself that, but I've got plenty of similar &quot;catch phrases.&quot; Fat useless sack of shit, I've got nothing to offer you or anyone else, failure is my stock and trade... on some level I know these aren't true, but it still feels that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along the same basic lines as the other commentor, I know of the show but haven’t watched much. Opposing although, I think I do need to watch that episode. It might be good for me to stop being so goddamn spiteful inside my own skull. Have to see a pattern for what it is before you can break it, right? Maybe if I prove the narrative as a false delusion that everyone goes through at some point in time, I can convince myself that it is not to be listened to. In that moment, I gain power over it, and it begins to subside. It’s been a while since I’ve had one of those moments.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Replace drinking with video games, and that's my weekend. My wife comes home and wonders why I haven't accomplished anything, and this is why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't usually get that, so I guess it can vary.</p>
<p>When I have depression I feel utter emptiness, like a long, rainy weekend at an ugly seaside town with nothing to do and where the only sound is a clock ticking, but each second takes a minute, and there is nothing to do and it feels like your soul has been scooped out and discarded, like something very, very important is missing and there is no way to get it back.</p>
<p>I get very sad, but not necessarily the feelings of inadequacy or lack of self-esteem. Some people don't get sadness with depression; just the emptiness.</p></div>		</li>
