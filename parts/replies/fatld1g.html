<p>I’ve been noticing in my area they’ve been laying some type of new underground cabling but given how quickly tech is developing they’re still able to use existing infrastructure to implement it. I can’t say for certain but from what you’re describing it sounds like they’re putting in fiber cables. </p>
<p>Side note- those machines that are able to bury cables without having to dig beyond the initial starting point is pretty brilliant ideas and cool to see,</p></div>		</li>

<p>The cables, for the most part, have always had ridiculous amounts of capacity. However, older amplifiers didn't always support the higher frequencies now commonly in use. 15 years ago, when I got into cable, we used 5 - 550 Mhz. Most systems now commonly are 5 Mhz - 1 Ghz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to the SDI standards, they still use the same cable, but have gone from a max of 576i feed to the current max of 2160p60. You definitely need to check the specs of everything before setting up your video world, because the oldest spec gear has the same connector as the new gear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physical cable itself isn't so much, but the technology on the ends of the cable is improving greatly.  The standard is called DOCSIS, version 4 will start showing up within the next five years or so.</p>
<p>In fact they have 100gig symmetrical speeds working over coax in the lab.  Which is faster than any fiber to the house standard right now.  (Coax from the pedistal and fiber to the head end). Though I'm sure we can expect new fiber standards to develop too.</p>
<p>That makes it a lot cheaper for cable ISPs to offer better speeds.  The technology is pretty sweet.  It's just too bad the politics of ISPs get in the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;path&quot; is a little bit confusing. The photons bounce around the core of the fiber significantly more than in singlemode, but they all arrive at the destination in roughly the same order they left. The distance between pulses does very significantly more than singlemode which is why multimode is only supported over short distances. If you use multimode over too long of a run, the device will have a harder time distinguishing between &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; because they'll start to blend together. </p>
<p>This phenomenon is called &quot;dispersion&quot;, specifically of the chromatic variety. This has everything to do with the quality of the laser used, but really it's not a laser, it's just a fancy LED with a filter, making it much cheaper. The trade off is it's bad in terms of what light frequency (or more specifically, how precise the frequency is) it spits out. It's not exactly 850nm, it's more like a range, 849.9-850.1nm for example. The wider the range, the less distance you'll get out of the run because the frequencies will disperse more. This is also a problem with singlemode, but the distance at which this starts to become an issue is orders of magnitude greater.</p>
<p>Further reading: &quot;NRZ&quot; is the technical term for the &quot;on/off&quot; encoding of 1s and 0s, but there are several more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but these things are all relative. Lots of different paths means that, relatively speaking, one is limited by bandwidth and distance prior to poor s/n. Essentially, the path delta's are engineered to such a degree that within a given distance data symbols will not overlap by more than a factor x.</p></div>		</li>
