<p>Otherwise, good contribution. Our systems are complex, and different parts of the system can need different solutions for speed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Moving away from binary coding.  Having only on or off in each piece of information is limiting if simple to engineer and code.  Moving to a system that had more states (trinary with off, on and kind of on) can help with processing speed if done properly.  But also not easily integrated into our current system.</p>

<p>Binary isn't simply &quot;easier to engineer&quot; it has worked out to be more efficient in practice. Making two states is pretty easy. Making three states is a lot harder, you need a more complex and thus bulkier part. As it stands we've made transistors so small that even having two distinct states is hard. Something of comparable size with more than two states, which is also highly reliable, doesn't currently exist and is actually pretty hard to imagine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These approaches could speed up computing, but at the cost of size, materials, price, energy efficiency etc, and are nowhere near achievable in the short term.  They also would take a lot of development before they could begin to complete with current transistor architectures that have already had decades of optimization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s likely that optical circuits would still use electricity, just less of it. Optical circuits using Mach Zehnder interferometers would still make use of electricity to alter the refractive index in one arm of the interferometer. However, this should still be much cheaper than charging mosfet gates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true.  I should be more clear that the signal won't be electrical, even if some of the mechanisms still use it.</p></div>		</li>
