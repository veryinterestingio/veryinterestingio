			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually they move quite a bit. The kidneys for example move up to 4cm every breath!!! Like little elevators, up and down all day. The liver is pulsing, and the stomach inflates and deflates every meal. Thereâ€™s endless movement, and yet the resilient nature of the connective tissues allows everything to dance about without really altering the vasculature much at all.</p></div>		</li>

She said she had noticed things were different but just chalked it up to the awesomeness that is childbearing</p></div>		</li>
