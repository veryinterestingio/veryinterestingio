			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds to me that what you're really asking is, &quot;Does time pass more slowly at different regions of a massive object such as the Sun?&quot;</p>
<p>If that's the case, the answer is yes; in fact, the effect can be observed even here on Earth: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>No, the ways which we measure time are, time itself has existed at least since the big bang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting fact too: GPS satellites have to take these time changes in consideration, since all of our electronics rely on the time the signal was transmitted to accurately calculate the distance between you and the satellites ?!</p>
<p>This article from <a href="http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=77" target="_blank">physics.org</a> explains it pretty well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPS satellites travel at approximately 8,700 mph (14,000 km/h) with respect to Earth. This means time runs 7,200 nanoseconds per day slower for a satellite relative to us on Earth as described by Special Relativity.</p>
<p>However, if the GPS satellites didn’t correct for the time difference due to relativity, then the signals sent to your device from the satellite would read a false time, your device would calculate the distance wrong and wouldn’t know where you were.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, to add to this--the corrections that need to be made for GPS satellites are due to TWO types of time dilation that occurs--one for the higher altitude above the centre of Earth's mass, and another for the speed with which they are travelling with respect to the &quot;observer&quot; (i.e. a GPS receiver)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetical: if you could fall into the sun and not die, how much time would you perceive to have passed before you to sink to the centre of the star? Would it <em>feel</em> like 39,000 years to the person having fallen in, or just to us experiencing earth time?</p>
<p>For clarification my question assumes you are in a dive suit of sorts sinking straight down to the centre of the sun like being weighted down in a swimming pool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much.... much slower. If you could go to a place with SUPER high gravity without dying, you could effectively travel forward in time. You would age more slowly than people on earth. Alternatively, if you could move at an extremely fast speed, you'd receive the same effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if you were dropped into a black hole, the outside would perceive you to age slower, but if you were theoretically able to be extracted from the black hole, wouldn't the outside perceive you to age much faster as you leave, such that once you completely leave the black hole's gravitational field, you and the outside world would have &quot;re-synced&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would they perceive you aging faster as you leave? If their gravity is 1 and your gravity is 1000 or something as you come towards them out of the black hole you'd simply age at a gradually increasing rate relative to them but never faster then them. </p>
<p>If you age say, 0.001 years to their 1 year, you'd eventually reach their aging of 1 year of aging per year as you leave the black hole from their frame of reference, never surpassing their aging. </p>
<p>(Assuming being able to get someone out of a black hole wouldn't subject them to insane speeds, in which case I don't know what'd happen) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it works like that.  It depends what frame of reference. For the person walking into the black hole it might be a couple of minutes. But for us waiting outside might be a couple hundred years. There’s an equation to calculate time dilation somewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you would NOT re-sync. When I say &quot;travel forward in time&quot;, I mean it.</p>
<p>If you stayed long enough, all your friends would be dead, all of your family would be dead. YOU, in earth years, would be hundreds of years old (in their eyes.)</p>
<p>Interstellar got this one right surprisingly. </p>
<p>EDIT: But then yes, once you have left the black hole and joined with the earth folk again you would, once again, be aging at 1 year per year. </p>
<p>The ender's game books (specifically the 2nd one) deals with this pretty well, except not with gravity. They have close to light speed travel in that universe. When one of the main characters (who has a sister) decides to travel to another world, it's a huge decision because of how it affects his sister. SHE would be without him for many many years, while for him it'd only be a few days. So when he reaches his destination he's still young, but she's aged quite a bit. But when she decides to come visit him on that same planet, they are then the same ages again. </p></div>		</li>
