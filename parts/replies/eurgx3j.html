			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely no. Being largely submerged in water somewhat increases your blood pressure, so perhaps very marginally. As far as I am aware (doctor) it wouldn't contribute in any meaningful or beneficial way to increasing your circulating blood volume. If any meaningful amount of water was absorbed it would worsen electrolyte imbalance as you wouldn't be absorbing electrolytes, even if you were bathing in isotonic saline.</p>
<p>Being in water is a legitimate problem in retrieval medicine recovering people out of the water, you pull them out of water and they can be dead by the time they get up to the helicopter on the rope because they cant compensate for the sudden drop in blood pressure they experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Injections straight to the shin? That sounds like it would easily be the most painful moment of most people's lives.
It also sounds like how Jessica Jones got her powers in the show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually quite common. Usually used for treatment where a normal IV can't be put in or keeps falling out (significant blood loss, unstable environment such as a vibrating helicopter, elderly etc.). </p>
<p>It's usually done in either the shin just below the knee, or into your shoulder. I've heard some say it's painless, while others scream when it happens but it's quite quick. Just a very quick punch with a drill and it's in. Usually the people are in such a bad state that's it's just par for the course and are likely already on morphine (ie, legs blow off in a battlefield injury).</p></div>		</li>
