			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone else stated, the &quot;edge of the solar system&quot; is more related to magnetism and solar wind than gravity. Is there a more precise name for this boundary where the sun is no longer the dominant gravitational force than &quot;edge of solar system&quot;?</p>
<p>Secondly, is there a name for the boundary where gravity is less dominant than expansionary forces?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sagittarius A* is 4.6 million solar masses. Gravity falls off with the square of distance.</p>
<p>To find the midpoint you are looking for where the squares are equal, so
4600000*a^2 = b^2</p>
<p>If a is 1 (Edit: It has to, here, but if you want you can re-run this equation with raw numbers and using a fixed distance like a light-year), b is ~2,145</p>
<p>b is about 27,000 (distance the Sun is from Sagittarius A*), so we need to multiply a by 27,000 / 2,145 = ~12.6 light-years or ~4 parsecs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The supermassive black hole is about 4 million times as massive as the sun and about 8,000 parsecs away. Gravity is proportional to mass/distance^2 , so we have to solve 4,000,000/8,000^2 = 1/x^2 , which means x=4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity, since the universe is expanding at a faster and faster rate, would that mean there’s a larger gravitational force outside of our known universe? Or that the interplay of all of the gravitational forces is causing the expansion to quicken?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone who can answer this question definitively will win a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>The best answer I can give is &quot;probably not, because the expansion is uniform&quot;. However, the odds of me, and the rest of the scientific community, being completely wrong on this are immense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity obeys the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem" target="_blank">shell theorem </a>. A uniform spherical shell pulls on everything in its interior evenly in all directions, cancelling itself out, i.e. no gravity. At the largest scales, the universe is uniform, so there isn't any gravity from the distant parts of the universe. The only gravity we would feel is from the local universe where the nonuniformity is noticable.</p></div>		</li>
