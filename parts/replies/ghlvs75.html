			<div class="markdown"><p>Ant man bugs me on that score, as they describe the process to shrink ant man ad reducing the space between atoms. So the mass doesn't change. Assuming the reverse is true big ant man should be 12 stone and that mass distributed over a much bigger surface area, his kicks and punches should be pathetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ant-man is extremely flawed in several ways. Not only does the explanation for his shrinking completely contradict his increased strength as Giant-man, but it's also just completelt impossible because of the ending of the first movie. How is it possible for Ant-man to go subatomic and shrink down to a size smaller than an atom, if his shrinking makes him denser by packing the already existing atoms in his body closer together? His shrinking functions notby changing the size or amount of atoms in his body but by simply moving them all closer to each other, so his absolute minimum size should be no smaller than the total amount of atoms he has in his body, let alone smaller than <em>one</em> single atom</p>
<p>And if his shrink is fuelled exclusively by making him denser, then small ant man should be extremely heay. He shouldn't be able to run up peoples' arms without them noticing because he should be the weight of a regular person. When he punches someone he should be acting like a bullet, killing them. And you could just say the explanation is lack of foresight, but at the beginning of the first Ant-man movie, he falls in a bathtub and cracks the bathtub floor, showing he really IS denser. None of ot makes any sense</p>
<p>They might have explained all this in that video but I didn't watch it lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't mean to say &quot;there's no such thing as a big animal&quot;.  I'm just saying big animals pay a structural and kinesiological price for being big.  More oxygen in the air would definitely help them cope.</p></div>		</li>
