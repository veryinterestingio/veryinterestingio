			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a mole on my arm about 4 inches below my shoulder and I get long black hairs that are thick. Let me tell you, I‚Äôve been plucking that thing for 20 years and it‚Äôs my secret pleasure to do so. I think since I‚Äôve done it so long the follicles don‚Äôt send any message to my pain receptors because I feel nothing but joy from doing it. In fact, it‚Äôs almost time to do it again ü§†</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The great thing about plucking a mole, if you‚Äôre extra determined at getting a hair, it will probably bleed and the hair will recede out of fear of trauma, and then it will scab, and then when it‚Äôs time to pick the scab it‚Äôs comparable to pulling carrots or potatoes for harvest, as it will bring up your intended hair that you tried to pluck and also some extra budding mutant mole hair with the scab since they tend to have 3 hairs per follicle. ü§´</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there cowboy. I don't have a mole with hair, but I do have one very weird thick prehistoric looking hair that grows slowly in my beard. My girlfriend says she owns it and only allows herself to pluck it but sometimes I can't resist so I do it first. That's when we have our biggest fights</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I call those spidery hairs.   My husband lets me pull them out so I can put them under a microscope and ponder the mysteries of the human body.    They're so wildly different from every other hair on him -- why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few moles that sprout hair. They're slightly more painful than plucking a regular hair just because they seem to be thicker. Because they're thicker, sometimes they cause the mole to bleed (and boy can moles bleed!).   </p>
<p>Mostly I don't pluck mine much because they just grow back <em>insanely</em> fast. I can pluck em at the beginning of the week and by the end of the week it's back to how long it can get. I just don't see the point of faffing about with them for the sake of a few days of hair free mole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a mole on the lower right side of my face that started sprouting hair when I was like 10. I would actually borrow my dad's razor and shave it because I was getting teased at school about it lol. But I had a little bit of a head start when it came to shaving my face a few years later ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a girl who had a long dark hair that grew out of a mole on her face.  It was very unfortunate, she was made fun of growing up because of it.  Her parents told her it would become cancerous if she ever plucked the hair, so she left it like that out of fear.  Pretty sure that's just an old wives tale some people believe.  </p>
<p>I've heard that repeated by several people in my life, so it's a common enough belief that scares people from removing mole hairs.  And other people are just indifferent and don't care enough to remove stray hairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure moles having hair is a sign that they're not cancerous.
A mole that <em>doesn't</em> grow hair isn't inherently cancerous, and pulling a mole hair definitely doesn't <em>make it</em> cancerous. </p>
<p>I can definitely see where the confusion came from, but also, the idea that pulling a mole hair makes the mole cancerous is ridiculous lmao.</p></div>		</li>
