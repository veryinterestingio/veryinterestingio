			<div class="markdown"><p>8-digit barcodes are also issued by GS1. They're mainly used for products which are too small to comfortably fit a normal barcode (like a pack of chewing gum or something). Because there are fewer 8-digit codes possible, GS1 is a bit tighter about giving them away, so you can only get one if a 13-digit code would cover more than a certain proportion of the packaging.</p>
<p>The 8-digit barcodes have the same country codes as the 13-digit ones (e.g. 40 for Germany, 50 for UK e.t.c.) but they don't include a &quot;manufacturer code&quot;.</p>
