<p>The OMG particle was a particle with an exceptionally high energy but we have measured particles at over 99% the speed of light for decades before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, electrons were lighter in the LEP? Can you explain that? I was under the assumption that all electrons were the same, and that’s what allows them to form bonds between different elements; The electrons and the protons don’t care <em>which</em> atom they’re bound to, as long as they’re balanced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question on.. relativity I guess.<br />
Earth is moving relative to the universe and spinning.<br />
Is there a max speed we can achieve because of this? Relative to our and our sensors existing motion?<br />
Would sending the particle in a particular vector/direction address this?<br />
I.e. if Earth is moving in one direction could we send it back the other direction at c+earths speed.<br />
I'm aware colliders are circular or oval so it would only be momentary. Just curious. Or is relativity factored in for these measurements already</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Moving relative to the universe&quot; isn't a thing. There is no absolute motion, only motion relative to other objects is well-defined. This relative motion is limited by the speed of light - for all objects, for all observers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the implications of Relativivity is that time is measured differently depending on where you're standing and how fast you're moving. If you're on a space ship moving at v (relative to earth), and you fire a beam of light at c out in front of you, then you will see the light move away from you at a speed of c.</p>
<p>An observer on earth would measure the light moving at c, you moving at v, and so see the light moving away from you at c-v. And someone over taking you would measure an entirely different number.</p>
<p>The point is that no matter how fast you're moving, light (in a vacuum) will always move at ... light speed. Distances and time are adjusted to make this the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth is moving relative to objects within the universe, and relative to the cosmic microwaved background, but there's no objective &quot;universe&quot; reference frame that the Earth is in motion relative to. Other than its rotation, and orbit around the sun, it's entirely valid to consider the Earth as stationary and everything else in motion relative to us. </p>
<p>We will never observe a particle travelling facter than c relative to us, and the same applies to any other observer in any reference frame. Though we can, for example, point lasers in opposite directions and conclude that in our reference frame the photons are travelling away from each other at a combined speed of 2c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't. The energy to accelerate a massive object increases the closer it gets to c (the speed of light). It would require infinite energy to actually reach c, you can only get closer and closer to it. An object without mass, like a photon, <em>must</em> travel at c all of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't possible to accelerate any particle with any mass to 100% of light speed. (at least not to current knowledge). </p>
<p>Particles with zero mass (photons) MUST move at light speed, particles with mass MUST move at less than light speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving &quot;faster&quot; at these relativistic speeds, really just means adding more energy, and hence mass. You can keep adding energy and approaching the speed of light but never reach it as the energy needed to accelerate the ever growing mass is exponential. </p>
<p>In accelerators it is practical to add more energy so we get a bigger &quot;bang&quot; when we collide the particles. More energy in the collision allows us to create heavier and more exotic particles from the wreckage.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Physics doesn't really use relativistic mass as a concept any more. It's problematic to consider objects gaining mass the faster than move, so these days they're just treated as having higher energy. The whole can't-reach-the-speed-of-light thing is more easily explained with time dilation and length contraction.</p></div>		</li>
