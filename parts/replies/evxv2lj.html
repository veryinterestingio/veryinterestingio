			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at comparisons of skulls. The Neanderthal jaw slopes backwards from the front teeth while the human jaw has a bony projection outward. This projection is what we generally mean by &quot;chin&quot;. Obviously all hominids had similar jaw structures including a prominent lower jaw, but they lacked chins per se. Some humans have very small or even more or less absent projections and we tend to notice when they do- saying they have receding chins or are &quot;chinless.&quot; Neanderthals could probably pass for humans on a subway, but they'd be noticed for having traits that are a little weird looking.</p>
<p>Here's just one article you can find with anthropologists saying that the only hominids with chins are humans: <a href="https://www.futurity.org/modern-human-chins-897652/" target="_blank">https://www.futurity.org/modern-human-chins-897652/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently what I think of as a chin doesn't qualify. I just thought it meant the bottom of the lower jaw towards the front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both is true, a lot of ppl from our species have very weak chins, it doesn't make them look &quot;different&quot;, not really. Just less sexy i guess. </p>
<p>It is one of the first things a plastic surgeon will &quot;fix&quot; to make you look more beautiful.</p></div>		</li>
