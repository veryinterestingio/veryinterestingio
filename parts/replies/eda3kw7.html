<p>Extreme example is people leaving Greece and Greece being unable to tax enough people to pay back their own loans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that make the government in turn worthless as well?</p>
<p>No services, no infrastructure, unable to pay government employees.  It sounds like a recipe for a foreign nation to come in and occupy what's left of the country.  Could that actually happen or am I letting my imagination get too wild? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A broad question but has any country completely stopped existing because they ran out of money and absolutely nobody (well most) didn't want to either be there or deal with it anymore? Or has this always lead to war or some kind of physical/military conflict? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a person or a corporation borrows, they put up assets as collateral. Those assets can be repossessed if they become insolvent.</p>
<p>You can't repossess the assets of a sovereign government. Governments' collateral is their reputation and their standing in the global financial market. Governments that have had issues paying back their debts will pay higher interest rates on future debt. I haven't personally heard of a case where a government was straight up unable to find investors, but perhaps that's happened.</p>
<p>What happens to investors? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_government-debt_crisis" target="_blank">When it happened in Puerto Rico, investors were basically left holding the bag.</a> Bonds are supposed to pay face value plus interest, but investors (a large portion of whom were ordinary Puerto Ricans who had their retirement funds in Puerto Rican government bonds) ended up getting pennies on the dollar.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s happening in Venezuela right now for all intents and purposes, forcing printing money to be the ONLY way they can finance themselves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they can't pay back the loans they are essentially in default as an organization. Anyone who purchased a bond or loaned them money doesn't get their money back (especially with bonds as the only claim that they are backed by is the faith and credit in the government). Of course, defaulting on loans will make it significantly harder to find people in the future willing to loan you money, and if they are willing, then they will ask for really high interest rates (returns) on those loans or some sort of collateral guarantee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, from the highest rating of AAA to the second highest of AA. That was mainly because of political showdowns over the debt ceiling, investors feared there might be the possibility of a default. But that didn't happen and it's most likely not going to happen any time soon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and it there was large backlash against the credit rating agencies that did so. Many thought it was irresponsible of them because the US government is obviously going to pay it obligations. US regulators went after the credit ratings agencies after though which I also don't agree with. </p>
<p>The impact of a credit rating downgrade are pretty severe. It could mean higher interest payments which is a lot of money US taxpayers would be on the hook for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually about half of the debt held by the public is held by foreign investors. However government agencies also hold about 1/4 of the total debt, but still it isn't that the &quot;vast majority&quot; of the debt is internal, but a simple &quot;majority&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Actually</strong>, foreigners and foreign governments together only hold about 30% of the total debt.</p>
<p>Foreigners and foreign governments own 42% of the <em>public debt</em>, and the public debt is 72% of the total debt. The rest of it is held by other agencies in our own government (e.g. social security holds a lot of treasury notes. That is, they have loaned the treasury money, and expect it back some day.)</p>
