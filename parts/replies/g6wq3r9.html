			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, the process of cooling and reheating rice makes the rice more healthful-- each time the rice is cooled, some of the calorie-rich starches are converted to resistant starches. Resistant starches are resistant to our own digestion, but act as a source of fiber (which we all could use more of) that is digested by our gut flora.</p></div>		</li>
