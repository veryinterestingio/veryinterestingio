			<div class="markdown"><p>While there are a lot of behaviors that can put people at risk for infections, there are a couple that are pretty common and also pretty risky. These include sleeping or napping in lenses, topping off solution in the case (adding new solution to old solution in the case), and exposing your contact lenses to water either by storing or rinsing the lenses in water. Our recent publication talks about some ways eye doctors can communicate these recommendations to their contact lens-wearing patients: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6832a2.htm?s_cid=mm6832a2_x" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6832a2.htm?s\_cid=mm6832a2\_x" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6832a2.htm?s\_cid=mm6832a2\_x</a></a></p>

<p>Not entirely on-topic, but I tend to have dry eyes and find that they get severely dried out if I take even a short nap, which is odd because my eyes are closed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>contact lenses also reduce ths amount of air reaching the surface of the eye</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) so topping off the solution is bad? Good to know.</p>
<p>2) if my contact falls out during the day and I don't have any solution on me, is it worse to try and wash it with some water and put it back in than to just go half eyed for the rest of the day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely worse to put it back in. Water would only rinse off dirt or large particles, it won't disinfect it. It'll even increase the chance of getting acanthamoeba since they live in tap water. Going without a contact in one eye will just cause headaches/nausea which is just temporary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use the dailies and always keep a spare contact in the zippered change compartment of my wallet, just in case mine were to fall out and I needed to drive or something. I ALSO keep my old old glasses (like 2 prescriptions ago) in my glove box since theyâ€™re better than blindness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like it is. I do the same thing, but after googling acanthamoeba keratitis, I think I'm going to start keeping water away from my lenses and case. </p>
<p>I think soft lenses are porous enough that they sop up bacteria like a sponge and transfer it back and forth between your lens case and eye. The best defense against dangerous bacteria is to keep your lenses away from sources of it in the first place. Sources such as water and your lens case can be difficult to avoid. </p>
<p>In the case of water, you should avoid it altogether. Possible sources of water contamination include</p>
<ul>
<li>wet (with water, not lens solution) hands while handling contacts</li>
<li>washing lens in water</li>
<li>showering with contacts in (water will run into your eyes and some will make it into the lens)</li>
<li>touching your eye with wet hands (again, wetted with water)</li>
<li>cleaning your lens case with water</li>
<li>storing your lens in water (duh)</li>
<li>hot tub (if you're cool enough)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of your lens case, you can avoid it by wearing daily disposable lenses. If you wear reusable contacts, you will need to focus on keeping your lens case clean and replacing it every three months.</p>
<p>Cases are made of a harder and less porous material, making them a less hospitable environment for bacteria. Of course, as a case ages, it accumulates scratches, micro-cracks, mineral deposits, seams of ore, etc., which serve as footholds for bacteria. Hence, the strategy of keeping it clean and replacing it before a population of bacteria can populate it.</p>
<p>Sources of bacteria include water, unclean hands, unclean lens (e.g., dropped lens), unclean tissue, contaminated contact lens solution, eye infection, contact lens worn by an animal, etc.</p>
<p>The CDC recommends cleaning your lens case with contact lens or multipurpose solution, drying with a tissue, and storing upside down with the lids removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heads up moving forward in school. MAKE SURE TO TAKE YOU CONTACTS OUT HEFORE GOING TO ANY CHEMISTRY LAB. Getting anything in you eyes is 1000x worse if you have contacts in.</p>
<p>Edit: The biggest reason you want to avoid contact lenses in a lab isn't entirely because of splashback (though thats a big part). Some chemical vapors (especially strong acids) can can condense on your eyeball and cause the plastic contact to bind to your eye. Most Universities strongly recommend you don't wear contacts in a chemistry lab if you can avoid it. Just bacause it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean it won't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you never take off your goggles, you should be alright. I am serious though, your splash-resistant goggles donâ€™t come off, ever. Only when you have left the lab with your hands scrubbed clean should you take them off. This is CDC/Niosh policy, and if you think thousands of people are losing their sight in labs because theyâ€™re wearing contacts, youâ€™re believing a myth: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-139/default.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-139/default.html</a></p>
<p>If you are someone who cannot follow a rule to a T, it would probably be safer to get a pair of glasses. Me personally, I feel much more comfortable wearing contacts and I dislike the feeling of glasses with goggles on top. The discomfort of wearing glasses would likely increase my risk of an incident occurring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My advice is geared as much to lab personnel as to chemistry students and I'm obviously not the person answering this AMA, BUT:  </p>
<p>As a habitual contact wearer who has given themselves first degree chemical burns in the lab...  </p>
<p>Wear your contacts, if you want. But be aware of how to wear your lab's designated PPE and what any potential limitations to that PPE are (in my case, looking up while mixing chemicals allowed splash to hit my face while wearing a splash mask; I should have been more aware of where I was opening my face up to splash through my motions).   </p>
<p>Be aware of where your lab's eyewash station(s) are/is and know how to use it/them. Make sure your lab keeps careful maintenance records of any/all eyewash stations and that any issues are promptly dealt with. Our lab assigns personnel to check functionality of the eyewash stations weekly. Our supervisors are then assigned to follow through with those checks monthly.  </p>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the MSDS for your work space. A lot of labs/schools will keep an MSDS binder or database handy in case of accidental chemical contact. Make sure your MSDS is current and accessible. Know what's in it!   </p>
<p>Familiarize yourself with the chemicals you are likely to come in contact with. Know their potential hazards (toxic, corrosive, etc.). Know how to neutralize them. Know your lab's procedures for dealing with accidental contact. Know who to call in case of emergency (whether your teacher, emergency staff, your PI....  whatever). The urgent care specialist who handled my chemical burns had literally done her doctoral thesis on chemical toxicology and still had to Google search the name of the common quaternary ammonium compound that burned me; had I not known it, we'd've been playing guessing games with my eyesight for a while until we figured it out.   </p>
<p>YES! to having a spare set of glasses (contact wearer or glasses wearer- it doesn't matter; if you need assistance seeing, you need a spare set of assisted seeing eyes in a lab setting). Some labs will shell out for this expense (mine does). Contact personnel or the school resources to see if they'll cover this. For college courses, goggles are often covered. For professional lab settings, safety glasses are often covered. If you are given the option for safety glasses, side shields are really nice!  </p>
<p>Keep a spare set of contacts/solution/case in your purse/locker/desk/car. Familiarize co-workers/classmates with its existence in case of emergency.   </p>
<p>You can totally be a contact wearer in a lab setting. Just be aware of the dangers and have back-up plans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what I'm talking about.  When I first got contacts I was very nervous, so I looked up all this information online before my appointment. I distinctly remember asking the optometrist if it's true that I shouldn't wear contacts in the shower and he said (drum roll, please) that NO, it's not true, and that wearing them in the shower should not present any danger.  I also asked him about swimming, and got the same response.  I would like to know what is being done about instituting guidelines and making sure providers communicate these messages to their clients, especially if you're just going to a place like Lens Crafters (which I do) to get all your prescriptions done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great. Iâ€™ve been wearing contacts since 1980, showering in them daily because my prescription is -11.5 and Iâ€™m crippled without them. Now my wearing time is decreasing and eye irritation is increasing, and for the last several years Iâ€™ve been seeing optometrists rather than ophthalmologists, because I donâ€™t want to wait two months for an appointment. Looks like I need to make some changes.</p></div>		</li>
