			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that explains a lot actually.  Always assumed those Hertz horns were large &quot;buttons&quot; which were pressed in to cause detonation.  </p>
<p>This made me wonder about the individual water-tightening of each horn and how much of a pain that would have been.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conceptually, they sort of work like a button.  They are just a button that requires being smashed by a heavy ship to push down all the way, so a ambitious seal doesn't blow it up trying to figure out if it tastes nice.  The acid over electrodes creates a closed electrical circuit analogous to what happens inside a button.  But, where a normal button pops back up when you stop pressing it, these are single use.  This makes sense, because making  a mine trigger that pops back into place so you can press it again after it gets hit probably would be very useful after the very large explosion destroys everything near by.</p></div>		</li>
