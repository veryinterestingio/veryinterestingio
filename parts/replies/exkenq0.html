			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been 4 definitions of the meter through history:</p>
<p>&quot;The metre was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole â€“ as a result, the Earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 km today. In 1799, it was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. In 1983, the current definition was adopted.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line" target="_blank">hydrogen line</a> would be an excellent choice, for both distance and time. We have even used it for that purpose such as on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque" target="_blank">Pioneer plaque</a>, which gives the size of humans and our solar system in this unit, and times nearby pulsars to help ETs locate our star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From 1960 to 1983, the meter was defined based on the wavelength of the 606 nm line from krypton-86. The speed-of-light definition was chosen to replace the wavelength definition. One key advantage is that if new techniques make it easier to measure the speed of light using a different element, the definition doesnâ€™t have to change again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one meter away from the event horizon.  If you took a measuring tape or a meter stick and (somehow) put it one meter away, it would still be 1 meter to itself - space itself is warped, which warps the objects with it.  There'd still be that 1 meter of space - even if an observer calculates it as several million kilomters in &quot;real&quot; size.</p>
<p>Certainly under the previous definition - the wavelength of a krypton-86.  That wavelength would be stretched.  say it became a million km to an observer - the meter is (was) defined as the length of that wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is there any method of measuring that would not be stretched?<br />
aka i want a 1 meter long stick at the event horizon, and appears to be a 1 meter long stick to all observers.</p>
<p>if not, is there a way to account for that difference? like i (an observer) see several million km, but i could calculate that its actually a meter.</p>
<p>do my questions make any sense? idk. probably not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If measured at one meter away it would still be one meter. One meter measured from further away would maybe give a different result. Within a frame of reference it should give the same result, but if you use diffentent frames of reference it should give different results corresponding to the difference in time? ðŸ¤”</p></div>		</li>
