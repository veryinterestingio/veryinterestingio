			<div class="markdown"><p>So when you eat something that disagrees with you does the stomach realize it can’t kill the pathogens and need to get them out? If so how does it know that?? </p>
<p>Wondering because I took an antibiotic today that made me projectile vomit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ceclor makes me projectile vomit as well, but its always been on my list of allergies, so I'm not sure if its truly a pathogen thing or an allergy thing (or whether it's just easier for doctors to categorize it as an allergy since I have an adverse reaction to it). I'm interested in the mechanism of this response as well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered: how is it we don't feel digestion, biologically? We don't feel our stomach churning food (unless we're full or have indigestion), we don't feel it going through our intestines, the only part we feel as far I can tell is the end. Do other organisms feel digestion? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A hole in the stomach means a direct route for bacteria and air to get into the abdominal cavity. So a bowel or stomach perf almost always leads to infection. </p>
<p>But yeah it also leads to incredibly profound pain and tenderness. The acid is very very irritating to the lining of that cavity and the organs inside. Leads to what we call an &quot;acute abdomen&quot; and it's pretty unmistakable. It's a surgical emergency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can a stomach get a hole internally without piercing the serous membrane? Or would the acid just burn through the membrane and thru the abdiminopelvic cavity?</p></div>		</li>
