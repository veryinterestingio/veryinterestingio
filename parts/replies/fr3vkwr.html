			<div class="markdown"><p>Sequoias are extremely resistant to fire—in fact they rely on fire for reproduction. As the ranger said, sequoia seedlings grow slowly and need lots of sunlight, so they don’t compete well with other ground plants. Sequoias evolved to ONLY open their cones and drop seeds after they are exposed to the high heat of a forest fire—this ensures the seedlings will have bare (fertile) ground in which to grow. The trees have very fibrous bark that grows up to two feet thick and doesn’t itself burn well, allowing it to survive fires that consume the rest of the forest.</p>
<p>This works great in an unmanaged forest where fires are a normal phenomenon and sweep through every few years clearing out ground plants and debris. But for most of the 20th century, human forest management meant no forest fires at all. This prevented new sequoia seedlings, and also allowed debris to pile up, providing way too much fuel. In the early 2000s we started seeing forest fires that would rage wildly out of control, burning much wider, hotter, and longer than would ever have occurred without human intervention. Even the sequoias couldn’t withstand fires that burned that hot and for that length of time, and some very ancient trees were lost—not to mention damage to human property and lives.</p>
<p>In response, forest management practices evolved, and now the approach is to allow periodic controlled fires to clear out sections of the forest in something resembling a more natural cycle. We’re still seeing some massive wildfires, of course—you can’t just clear out a century of debris from all of those forests, no matter what the President believes a rake is capable of—but over time this should benefit the sequoia population and help prevent catastrophes. If humans in the area would modify their behaviors (like building homes with fashionable-but-flammable wooden roofs, and foregoing ornamental trees in fire-prone areas) that would really help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen this thing about the seeds only being released from fire in a few comments. While fire will trigger seeds to be released it is really the drying out of a cone that allows seed dispersal. So if a branch is pulled down due to heavy snow, all of the cones on that branch will dry out and release their seeds (approximately 200 seeds per cone.)</p>
<p>If you take a fresh cone (really cool bright green when they first fall) and leave it on a plate it will turn brown, open up, and drop a pile of seeds even in the absence of fire. Probably all of those seeds will die without germination since they are only viable for about 15 days exposed to sunlight, and without a fire the conditions wont be conducive to sprouting. A sequoia seed is about the size of a single rolled oat, and has basically no nutrient reserves to get started, they need conditions to be essentially perfect to survive... which means a recent fire.</p>
<p>But <strong>please</strong> don’t take our cones!!</p></div>		</li>
