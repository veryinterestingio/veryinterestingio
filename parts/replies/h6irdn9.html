			<div class="markdown"><p>Could also be flat due to glacial scouring.  And then if you got below the gravel and silt to the bedrock or found some outcroppings by a natural ravine, those rocks might be truncated folds of any age.  Such as if you had a mountain due to upheaval (like the Rockies or Alps or Himalayas) and then sliced it off horizontally with a saw, and buried it in a thin layer of gravel from elsewhere.  Such as the Great Lakes region of North America.  There is a &quot;driftless area&quot; where glaciers missed, which provides a hint at what the surrounding flats once looked like before the scouring, and is a bit more like the Ozarks and starkly not-flat since you can view them side-by-side.</p>
<p>Or a dry lake bed, the literal flattest land known.  Such as the salt flats where land speed records are attempted because it's flatter hardened mud than any pavement could ever be.  And then add some million years and that mud would be sandstone or other sedimentary formation, which also tend to be very flat (slate, flagstone...) and if there was no upheaval it could still be flat-and-level today.  Or you get something like the Anvil mountains in Colorado which are very clearly flat sheets of sedimentary rock (once level) jacked up at an angle on one edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So wierd. I live near Seattle which was also covered by glaciers during the last glacial maximum, and the land is made up of north-south running valleys and hills leading up to the mountains. Literally the opposite of flat and I think glaciers are responsible for carving out the valleys and ridges that made up our rugged landscape!</p>
<p>The mountains are due to plate tectonics and being on the ring of fire, but they predate the last glaciers by quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's cool to see the difference in glacial action in Minnesota and Wisconsin,  There's the Driftless Area where you can see the transition from the undrifted to the driftless.  Small rolling hills turn into craggy hills and valleys in the span of a few miles.</p>
<p>You can go out to ND too and you can drive on the flat forever, then, all of a sudden, there's a tall butte that didn't get worn down by glaciation.</p>
<p>I also enjoy glacial erratics.  There's one the size of a small cabin at Louisville Swam state park in MN.  It's not on the main trail, but there's a tree next to it so you can climb up on top.  It's pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Columbia Basin is flat mostly because it's a series of giant flood basalts. The ice age floods didnt really flatten it out much (although they did remove the topsoils.) There are mountains buried under the basalts - Steptoe Butte, southeast of Spokane, is a mountaintop made of granite that protrudes up out of the basalts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was weird to see a pin dropped in a place I drove all the time years ago. That area is super fascinating. You have ancient mountains, the whole thing is covered in up to a mile thick of lava basalt, and then the scabs, channels,  coulees. And then rolling hills of fine silt we have no idea how it got there are where it came from. It's a series of super fast processes, like days or weeks. 1,000s of years processes. And then continental drift pushing parts of Mexico up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was not meant to be an exhaustive list of how you get flat (or rugged) topography and there are a whole range of mechanisms and environments beyond what either of us listed (if you want a more complete breakdown, find yourself an intro geology textbook, or better yet, a geomorphology text). Most erosional mechanisms can either generate relief or reduce relief depending on the situation, e.g., glacial processes can also be primary causes of relief generation (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X01000691" target="_blank">Brocklehurst &amp; Whipple, 2002</a>, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JF002068" target="_blank">Ward et al., 2012</a>). More importantly, glacial scouring as a mechanism doesn't really get you any further in answering the question (i.e., is the flat topography old or young). The examples you're describing are tied to the last glacial maximum (so very young), but there are glacially scoured areas that were scoured in much older periods of glaciation. Thus, the original point stands, i.e., topography is not a great indication of age without a lot of additional geologic context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point was that it depends on what a &quot;landform&quot; is.  And age of the bedrock itself or age of when chunks of bedrock from elsewhere were deposited as gravel, or if &quot;landform&quot; includes topsoil, or silt, or gravel.  If it includes topsoil then the landform is not that old at all, maybe hundreds of years, since there is a constant gain of material from atmospheric fallout or life and death processes of flora and fauna atop the land, so if you mean the top millimeter of a landform then that's probably a couple of years &quot;old&quot; unless it's naked bedrock.  In which case most flat land is flat due to deposition by gravity in water, or mechanical smoothing (and it's only smooth due to the bedrock undulations being packed with smaller formerly mobile concretions, and final skim coat of silt and sand and topsoil deposited by water).  </p>
<p>Or at global scale, if the Earth were the same size as a billiard ball, the Earth is smoother.  So really depending how you look at it, everything is flat.  Or if you zoom in on the billiard ball with an electron microscope it looks mountainous.  So I guess it also depends on what they mean by &quot;flat&quot;.  Thus the mention of the flattest, salt flats.  </p>
<p>Also around the Grand Canyon is very flat desert, except for the enormous crevice right through the plateau, and I'm not sure if I'd call that flat or not-flat.  It's very much a combination of both with a sudden transition.  And the landform of the plateau is ancient while the crevice is &quot;new&quot; in comparison.  So it also depends on where the borders of a landform are.  If you had a square map of the entire canyon it would include enough surrounding flatland to make it mathematically &quot;mostly flat&quot;, just watch your step...</p></div>		</li>

<p>For &quot;old&quot; and very flat, classic &quot;peneplains&quot; (though is a deeply problematic term that pretty much any modern geomorphologist would cringe at using)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This part of your comment sent me down a rabbit hole. So I went and learned the origin of the term with W.M. Davis and the theory of the cycle of erosion. I found two different scholarly abstracts that mentioned the hotly debated nature of the peneplain concept reaching back over a hundred years. But I haven't quite been able to nail down what the controversy is, and I don't have access to the journals.</p>
<p>My best guess is that it is a question of plausibility, whether long erosion cycles would actually produce peneplains. If it's not an obnoxious amount to explain, could you summarize the debate over the term?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less controversial (at least anymore, the concept was largely abandoned &gt;50 years ago) and rather just an antiquated term. The intro of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X15002275" target="_blank">Calvet et al., 2015</a> provides a nice summary of the history and issues with &quot;peneplains&quot; (and specifically &quot;raised peneplains&quot;) Ultimately though, it's a term that at the simplest level is descriptive (i.e., a broad, flat, gently sloping plain) but has baggage in terms of the implied mechanism of formation and as that mechanism of formation isn't really considered plausible, the term is avoided. There are lot of similar types of terms in geology (or science more broadly), i.e., a descriptive term but that is associated with a mechanism that is no longer viable. Another good example would be terms like &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miogeocline" target="_blank">miogeocline</a>&quot;, which really is just a descriptive term for the sequence of sediments deposited on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin" target="_blank">passive margin</a>, but the term was developed as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosyncline" target="_blank">geosynclinal theory</a>, an antiquated precursor to plate tectonics that focused on vertical, as opposed to horizontal, movements of the Earth's crust to explain the origin of various geologic features. As a descriptive term or short hand, miogeocline persisted in the literature beyond geosynclinal theory, but it eventually stopped being used, largely because it didn't really make sense to keep using a descriptive term that was developed as part of an antiquated theory (just like peneplains, etc).</p>
<p>You still see peneplains discussed every now and again, sometimes even in the original context proposed by Davis, mostly in the context of &quot;Look, Davis might have been right for this one weird place!&quot;, but it's pretty rare.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Correct. Generally, ruggedness (or more specifically slope) can be a proxy for the rate at which rocks are uplifting but there are a myriad of complications. The first is that the the proportionality between slope and uplift rate is filtered through a variety of other factors (how resistant the rocks are to erosion, how wet the climate is, the details of the hydrology, etc) such that you can have places uplifting at the same rate generating very different topography. Similarly, because topography takes a long time to decay (e.g., <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2001JB000550" target="_blank">Baldwin et al., 2003</a>) and a variety of mechanisms can &quot;rejuvenate&quot; topography (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X18302322" target="_blank">Gallen, 2018</a>), slope or relief or ranges is a poor proxy for the age of the topography.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we accurately date geological features which are 5 - 250 million years old?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another extremely vague question. If you're asking how we date material that is of this age range, there are a wide suite of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating" target="_blank">radiometric</a> dating techniques that give reliable ages for material in those age ranges. If you're asking how we date topography, this becomes much trickier. We can date various materials within mountain ranges and if we can tie these dates to key aspects of the range (e.g., dating metamorphic episodes, or directly dating the rate of rock uplift through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochronology" target="_blank">thermochronology</a>) then we can estimate the age of topography. But for so-called &quot;postorogenic landscapes&quot;, i.e., old mountain ranges, we can date various materials in the range that might tell us the last time it was &quot;active&quot;, but this doesn't necesarily date the topography. To try to understand this, especially if it's anomalous in terms of relief, often we must make inferences based on short term rates of erosion from things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogenic_nuclide" target="_blank">cosmogenic nuclides</a> and backwards extrapolation based on our understanding of the physical erosion processes and how landscapes evolve (e.g., the Baldwin paper above).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very informative comments, thanks. This is a very beginner question, but do flat landforms arise only due to erosion? So that flat (or flat-ish) areas were once rugged/had mountains etc which were eroded to become flatter? Likewise,, do flat areas never form like that - that is to say that when some new landmass forms, it's always rugged?</p></div>		</li>
