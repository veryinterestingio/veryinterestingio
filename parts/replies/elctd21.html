			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, some of the components like Oxybenzone can be found in blood samples in summer, from it being absorbed through the skin from sunscreen.</p>
<p>Oxybenzone has a very bitter taste.</p>
<p>And humans can taste many different chemicals if they are in the blood stream.</p>
<p>Penicillin injections often cause a metallic taste for example.</p>
<p>So it's quite likely that an ingredient like Oxybenzone would cause the taste. Sunscreen is after all applied to the whole body.</p>
<p>Stuff like Cortison creams are only supposed to be used on small areas of skin, otherwise too much gets absorbed and you get all of the nasty side effects of taking cortison pills.</p></div>		</li>
