<p>The reason RED was the color was that the farmers had to make their own paint. They used the available pigment which was finely ground iron oxide. They would scrape rust off of metal implements and then grind into a very fine dust and use it in their paint. </p>

<p>Got a source for that?</p>
<p>Because I grew up in farming country and have actually had to scrape rust off machinery (for various reasons). </p>
<p>You'd have to scrape a 100 pieces of machinery to get enough rust to actually add any color to the amount of paint required to cover a whole barn.</p>
<p>And what you got wouldn't give you a red barn would give you a shit brown colored barn.</p>
<p>So I'm calling bullshit on your comments.</p></div>		</li>
