Pre-existing conditions only really come into play insofar as waiting periods are concerned - once you've served your waiting periods, the fact that you had that condition when you took out your insurance isn't really relevant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All his insurances told him to get stuffed once he was diagnosed, saying that it's a genetic condition and so it was &quot;preexisting&quot;, and they don't insure for muscular dystrophy because you <em>generally</em> know about it from when you're a kid.... </p>
<p>Extremely specific tests are required for this variant, so basically no one ever knows about it till their 30's. &quot;Preexisting&quot;...</p></div>		</li>
