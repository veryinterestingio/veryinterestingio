			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this has been the best explanation I've gotten so far! When I posted this question, I had in my mind all the times I've been online shopping on my phone, and I click on an item to view it and then go back but the website is one of those &quot;infinity scroll&quot; pages where the items just keep loading as you scroll and it drives me nuts when I go back and it puts me at the top of the page, or at the first break of items where it loads more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This case is a little different. Infinity scroll pages are dynamically loaded. When the page first loads, it pulls maybe the first 20 items to show you, and then it monitors your scrolling and when you get to some point in the list it will fetch more items to show you, from the server, without reloading the whole page. It will edit the page on the fly and inject those new items at the bottom of the list. It might also remove some from the top of the list to keep the active page light and fast. When you navigate away and then back, the browser doesn’t have any idea how the developer set up their infinite scrolling. It doesn’t keep track of the internal state of the page and restore that when you go back. It just says oh you were at address www.foo.com, and it puts you there in that page’s initial state. On any infinite scrolling list where the back button takes you right back where you were, that’s because the developer of the page saved that internal state somewhere and then restored it when you went back, to make the experience better.</p>
<p>Edit: I should also mention that if you’re writing this kind of page from scratch instead of using a framework, the restoring state when you go back feature is by far the hardest part of infinite scrolling to do well, and the developer might not have planned for it in the design because they didn’t realize until testing that going back would be a problem, which is why it’s often not implemented or implemented poorly (where you’re slightly off in position or the list is in a different order, for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That internal state you mentioned, where is it stored? Because the link remains the same. (No #anchor-tag.) Is it stored in the cache or cookie, and how? Or it's stored on the server's side, which recognizes your browser and serves that state when you click back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways that this could happen. On example is the inner page link. An example of this is if you are on Wikipedia and you click the link that takes you to a specific section. If you scroll around the page then push the back button it will take you back to that section you clicked on earlier.
Another way this could happen is that the link that you click in Google isn't to the page at all. It is to a page that redirects you to the page you wanted to be at. When you get done with that page and hit back it takes you back to the redirect page that sends you back to the page you tried to leave. You can get around that buy double clicking the back button. It's a dick move because people will just open a new tab and close your webpage so why waste their time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun tip for some people who might not know it (from a fellow Web Dev) if you right click the back arrow in your browser it'll show you the last like 10 pages you've been to.</p>
<p>If a site is keeping you &quot;stuck&quot; in a bit of a loop you can right click up there and just click to the actual page you're trying to go back to. On mobile you can usually long press on the back button to achieve the same result.</p>
<p>Not a mind blowing tip or anything, but it can really help if you're prone to just spam clicking the back button to try and get back. Or just giving up and retyping in the search bar haha.</p>
<p>Edit: Additional note.. mileage may vary in different browsers. I know this exists in Chrome and Firefox. Haven't tested is specifically in <em>all</em> browsers but I'm sure most modern browsers support it by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, same thing for sure. I do it a lot for work so the long click is far too tedious for me haha half my day is just finding ways to save 3ms for absolutely no reason.</p></div>		</li>
