			<div class="markdown"><p>To expound on this the differences don't have to be that great. Agaricus Bisporous is the classification for button, portobello and crimini mushrooms, it's all the same, another mushroom in the amanita family is (which can look quite similar during growth phase, especially) is known as the death cap, and it's aptly named.</p>
<p>Molds can be very similar, but be drastically different (as can all fungi)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually no confirmed deadly Agaricus sp. mushrooms. You may be confusing them with Amanita sp. mushrooms, of which several notable species are deadly, most namely the Death Cap(A. verna) and the Destroying Angel (A. phalloides), responsible for the majority of mushroom eating deaths.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the mold grew on the surface of your cheese in the refrigerator, you should at the very least cut it off as it may be toxic.</p></div>		</li>
