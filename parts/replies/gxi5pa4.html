			<div class="markdown"><p>Other birds do this as well: E.g. Common swifts spend their lives in the air, living on the insects caught in flight; they drink, feed, and often mate and sleep on the wing (except when nesting). Some individuals go 10 months without landing.¬†No other bird spends as much of its life in flight and theft think they turn off half their brain when sleeping.</p></div>		</li>
