			<div class="markdown"><p>Pancreatic cancers are increasing - sorry to omit those from the list. There’s a bit of evidence some may be genetic, but beyond that the causes are uncertain.</p>
<p>Thyroid cancer is actually decreasing in the last five years or so. However, thyroid cancer is usually a screening detected cancer, so the rates of disease, particularly early stage, really depend on screening practices in any given region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had Pancreatic Cancer when I was only in 1st grade (7 years old). I found out when I was at a Christmas party throwing a tennis ball around and  tripped and hit my stomach pretty hard on the ball. That caused the tumor to rupture otherwise the doctors said I would have died silently because we wouldn’t have know of the Cancer. Do you know why Pancreatic Cancers are silent like this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I’m studying potential pharmacological applications of snake venom proteins (primarily focused on anti metastatic activity and the ability to promote anoikis in certain tissues but not others as well as the cancers that develop in those niches) and even though I’m essentially done with the classroom and background research part of becoming a doctor (including passing comprehensive exams) and all I have left I defending my own dissertation, which means as far as my advisor and committee members are concerned I know enough not to disgrace the name of doctor, I feel like I there is so much I don’t know about cancers that it’s really weird I’ll be a doctor whose dissertation was highly focused around that disease.  What I’ve been taught, as well as what I’ve encountered in my own research and literature... we haven’t made any great strides in treating any type of cancer pharmacologically in 20/30... maybe 40 years.  </p>
<p>We’ve been engineering small compounds like nutlin for mdm2 and p53 dependent cancers and they generally just... don’t work.  I mean, they work at what they’re engineered to do, but at any later stage in the game there are enough cancer cells and they’ve become so “comfortable” with higher mutation rates that any reduction in tumor size gained by such specific drugs rapidly (weeks sometimes) leads to a rebound with tumor cells that are no longer mdm2 and p53 dependent for avoiding apoptosis.  This same result seems to be repeated again and again for our tiny highly specific “hit em in their weak spot” miracle cures.  Do you have any examples of combination therapy’s or specific “magic bullets” that have made an actual noticeable impact in survival rates and longevity not from detection but from the cancer going metastatic or reaching a specific stage?</p>
<p>It seems like our best weapons against cancer are the same ones we had decades ago... broad, toxic, non-specific chemotherapeutic agents that are more toxic to cells with high replication rates including straight up cytotoxins like doxorubicin and nasty agents like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotnib) that are somewhat targeted... but we still look to good old surgery and radiation for the major “cures” that might result in the complete absence of a tumor in someone who deviously had one.  </p>
<p>Obviously I don’t think it’s a lost cause... there’s a reason I’m studying what I am... I think we still haven’t fully caught up to nature in “creativity” and “diversity” of drug design and powerful bioactive proteins and small molecules with untapped potential are still waiting to be found and applied in new ways just as we’ve been doing with plant, bacterial, and fungal toxins for all of human history.   </p>
<p>I guess my question to you is do you think we’ve made any great advancements in the past twenty years at increasing cancer survival rates and longevity, quality of life, that isn’t more of a reflection on our improved early detection rates and greatly improved ability to catch cancer in earlier stages where it reacts to the same sorts of treatments we used 20-25 years ago as well as being more susceptible to the newer more targeted treatments as a bonus since it isn’t as far along.  </p>
<p>I have no disillusion where I don’t think that improvements in catching cancer earlier doesn’t save a ton of lives, I’m just curious about what you think about, as well as what you know about, improvements in survivability in cancer discovered in late stages, post metastasizing, or if we would see statistics showing better prognoses, quality of life, time of life remaining if were still discovering tumors at the stages when they typically have been discovered in the 1970’s- 2000.  Sorry for such a long question.  And I’d love to see any literature you have that shows those kinds of major significant improvements that have nothing to do with the improvements in screening and early detection.  I want to think we have made significant strides in not just finding and treating cancer earlier, prevention, and elimination of common carcinogens but in fighting later stages as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The obvious huge impact on cancer mortality is declines in smoking. We’re seeing massive changes in lung cancer mortality as a direct result of anti smoking policies made decades ago. Other population efforts like screening campaigns have also been helpful.</p>
<p>Then there are technologies that are doing a better job of identifying tumors. We have new imaging technology that allows surgery to be more effective since surgeons can be more precise and can remove the whole tumor.</p>
<p>One of the areas of treatment that seems most promising to me is immunotheapy. Recent drugs have been released that are game changers for lung and melanoma cancers for specific types of disease. Pair that with ER/PR/HER2 treatments in breast cancer, we’re starting down the path of personalized medicine. </p>
<p>I went to a talk by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_Mukherjee" target="_blank">Siddhartha Mukherjee</a> a while back, and he said he says the future of cancer treatment will involve extracting parts of a tumor from someone, sticking it into multiple Petri dishes, and identifying which treatment is most effective for that specific tumor. Then you treat the patient with the one their tumor responds to, rather than shooting in the dark with things that have worked for some people in the past. The major downside to that approach right now is cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of those (smoking is an advancement in prevention, and tumor identification, unless you meant that in terms of identification of specific mutations and not just existence of a tumor) are the sort of advancements I was referencing that are major lifesavers of course but often give people (just reading the stats) the idea we’ve gotten better at treatment when we’ve really just gotten better at keeping people from reaching the “you have stage 3/4/metastasized cancer” as opposed to actually developing any better “cures” for established rumors.  </p>
<p>Which isn’t bad at all, I just think most people are under the notion that we have all these new specialized treatments from all the articles they see about miracle drugs but most are useless without the personalized therapy you mention.  One of the main focuses of my work is actually using snake venom as a diagnostic tool (some really amazing specificity for cell surface receptors... currently I’m working on a toxin that by all means should be shredding just about any tissue type by cleaving most surface proteins and cell adhesion molecules as well as showing high cytotoxicity to non adherence dependent cells like Colo205s but while very low doses will work on everything else I’ve assayed A375 melanoma cells are completely resistant (at doses factors above EC50’s for other lines) and it’s not a venom component we usually expect any specificity from, so it’s always fun to be surprised.  </p>
<p>I agree immunotherapy and personalized treatments are the future.  Hopefully the sort of research I think the larger proteins bioprospecting is best suited to will help better personalize those therapies and reduce the costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another downside is still the high mutation rate. The patient's cancer could develop mutations that will render the treatment tailored to their biopsied cells less effective during the time it takes to generate a cell line, test drugs, etc. Still a better shot than what we have ofc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that we’ve made decent progress in treating ovarian cancer, but that might just be due to my research experience in it. Overall, I think the best researchers are looking towards combination therapies to eliminate resistance to first or second wave therapies. It’s a tricky game, but we’re definitely catching up and we’ve made SO much progress in the last 20-30 years. Additionally, we just have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways by which cancer occurs and evolves, which will lead to better therapies in the future. The eludication of molecular pathways and the development of targeted therapies towards those pathways really is a long journey, and it’s easy to miss the progress that’s been made if you’re not actively involved in that part of the field</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m very much involved in that part of the field.  I’m working on trying to take advantage as well as use venom proteins I isolate from what I extract from our animals as tools to elucidate those specific mechanisms.  I know  how much progress we’ve made in terms of understanding and killing specific cancers both in vitro and in vivo in model organisms.  I suppose what I’m really asking about is literature that it sounds like you are familiar with or maybe even an author on that shows relative statistical advances in survivability and longevity and maybe even full remission without relapse that isn’t explainable in large part by our advances in tumor detection, screening, and prevention (which is very important, but is not due to leaps in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals).  Combination therapy with multiple drugs, new and old, specific and broad, and radiation along with surgery for operable non-metastasized or minimal metastases in operable locations are of course interventions which can potentially be applied even to late stage cancers circumstantially but I just haven’t personally found much in the way of literature supporting replicable and major (significant, yes, but usually a fraction of a percent... maybe 2 or 3 max but with short remission) over cancers not treated with a particular new pharmaceutical seems to be the standard over and over in human trials.  </p>
<p>I know 2 or 3 percent is major, but I haven’t seen much suggesting additive or cumulative effects in combination therapy with new pharmaceuticals on any late stage cancer.  My feeling is that we are in a much better place than 20 years ago to find out you have cancer of almost any type (and chances of many of those are greatly reduced thanks to things like the HPV vaccine and cessation of smoking habits in much of the western world) but I think that the main advantage we have today is that it’s likely whatever cancer one has was more likely detected at an earlier stage than any advancements in actual treatments, particularly of late stage or metastasized cancers.  I’m definitely a believer that immuno therapies and targeted delivery of cytotoxins along with combination therapies developed via personal analysis and determination of the precise mutations of someone’s cancer to deliver the the precise mixture of magic bullets rather than tossing nutlin at any breast cancer and assuming it’s a P53 mutation Is going to be the long term future, but I just think it’s often misleading to see articles today about our pharmacological strides in fighting and killing cancer when as far as I can tell we should be cheering our diagnosticians, vaccine developers and the public health professionals who got word out successful about the connection between HPV and  certain cancers, sun screen, and anti-carcinogen campaigns for the vast majority of statistical improvements.  I’d love to see some of your literature talking about specific therapies that have been successful at treating ovarian cancer, specifically which drugs developed more recently and with more specific activities have led to more than just brief reductions in tumor size or number of metastases without rapid resurgence.  I’m not doubting at all, I just read a lot of literature about promising specific therapies and then it peters out in clinicals.</p></div>		</li>
