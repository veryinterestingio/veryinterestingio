			<div class="markdown"><p>I experienced this twice during cancer.</p>
<p>First time my nose started running and is still running 5 years later. I’m getting allergy shots now for dust mites. It hasn’t worked yet.</p>
<p>Second time was a chemo that people have a reaction to after they get it a few times. I went into anaphylactic shock on my third time getting it I think.</p></div>		</li>
