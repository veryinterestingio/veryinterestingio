			<div class="markdown"><p>Though I mainly studied Old/Middle English for this, the continental West Germanic languages have their own sets of issues.</p>
<p>Middle High German and Modern High German are very similar relative to, say, Middle English and Modern English. I'm not too familiar with the phonological differences between middle and modern continental West Germanic languages, though. For some of them, such as Dutch, they experienced <em>dramatic</em> shifts in their grammar in an analyticizing fashion similar to English during that period.</p>
<p>However, if you go further back to the older period, prior to the 10^th century... there is no way it's going to really be understandable. High German underwent three sound shifts (the High German consonant shifts) during this period, which dramatically changed how it was spoken. This included the loss of many of the common Germanic sounds (recall that English is very phonologically <em>conservative</em>), and the changes of others. If you go back further, you're getting into Common West Germanic, where not only are you adding more cases, more inflection, you would also be changing the basic word order, with SOV being standard instead of SVO/V2. Also, you'd be seeing the reversal of most of the late Germanic sound shifts as well at that point.</p>
<p>As per early Medieval German... I like using the Old High German parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaths_of_Strasbourg" target="_blank">Oaths of Strassburg</a> as an example:</p>
<p><em>In godes minna ind in thes christiānes folches ind unsēr bēdhero gehaltnissī, fon thesemo dage frammordes, sō fram sō mir got gewizci indi mahd furgibit, sō haldih thesan mīnan bruodher, sōso man mit rehtu sīnan bruodher scal, in thiu thaz er mig sō sama duo, indi mit Ludheren in nohheiniu thing ne gegango, the mīnan willon imo ce scadhen werdhēn</em></p>
<p>Note that that's also a <em>modern</em> transcription of it. I doubt that anyone today can read, without training, medieval script.</p>
<p>One advantage High German has is that it has largely stayed pretty conservative in terms of grammar. It retained the V2 word order of Common West Germanic, it maintained most of the cases (though lost instrumentive). It did, however, undergo significant sound shifts, though most of those were complete prior to the Middle High German period. High German, though, has a large amount of variety even in dialects, with one set of dialects often being incomprehensible to others, and that's going to manifest as well in this case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got interested because you mentioned Dutch having experienced dramatic shifts in grammar. But what kinds of shifts do I have to think of, then? Out of my head what comes to mind, is only the case system being lost in nouns and adjectives (and simplified in a few pronouns, like “wien -&gt; aan/voor wie”).<br />
Perhaps also the Dutch smaller version of the Great Vowel shift;   </p>
<p>[iː yː iə uə] <ij uu ie oe> changes, into:<br />
[ɛi̯ œy̯/ɔu iː uː]) &lt;ij ui/ou ie oe&gt;.</p>
<p>But, that one is phonological and not grammatical. If including other changes, did Dutch undergo notable syntax changes too? Or?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The loss of the case system is significant, and is analyticization. It is similar to English in that regard, though not as substantial - the language became less inflectional and more analytical. This would make communication with someone speaking Middle Dutch or especially Old Dutch/Frankish very challenging.</p>
<p>As per other changes, you need to define what time period you care about. Frankish to Middle Dutch is going to be very different than Middle Dutch to modern Dutch. Frankish to Middle Dutch sees a <em>lot</em> of changes. Frankish wasn't particularly different from Old English or Old High German. They would have still been mutually intelligible, and hadn't diverged from Common West Germanic that long before.</p>
<p>Old Dutch (Frankish) partook in only two of the High German consonant shifts - ð&gt;d and θ-&gt;d - the loss of the dental fricatives. This is a common shift for <em>all</em> continental West Germanic languages. English, of course, retains these sounds (and is a major annoyance to German and Dutch speakers, apparently). The vowel system changed, though, during htat period, and the grammar began simplifying.</p>
<p>However, during the Middle Dutch period, you see more changes - the eliminations of some sounds, the alteration of others, but also the adoption of new words and the <em>further</em> simplifying of syntax.</p>
<p>Like Middle High German, I'd expect it to be <em>readable</em> but with difficulty, but I wouldn't expect it to be understandable when spoken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All in all, German is surprisingly conservative throughout a lot of its history with one exception: Old High German. Old High German is not well documented but the jump from Old High German to Middle High German is a lot bigger than everything after that.</p>
<p>Even though Middle High German is indeed difficult to understand without some help, it is much less of a change than in English. German hasn't really lost many cases, nor did the sentence structure change too much, you could still read and pronounce many of the things even though you might not understand it. One look at the Nibelungenlied and you'd say that looks like German. </p>
<p>Meanwhile English changed beyond all recognition between Old English and Middle English and has changed quite a lot between Middle English and Modern English. Fewer words made it to the modern era and the grammar has changed a lot.</p></div>		</li>
