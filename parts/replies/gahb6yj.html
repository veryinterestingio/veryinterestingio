			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's most likely to be based on carbon. The reason is 'information'. Although life is usually defined in terms of things like reproduction, inheritance, and metabolism, information is central to all of these things. DNA provides a massive repository of information because of its sequence specificity - every gene is different from every other, and we humans have about 20,000 of them; in fact even a humble bacterium has about 3000 of them. Getting such a range of specific sequences, and the information they encode, is not known to be possible for molecules based on elements other than carbon. Although some people wonder if silicon might provide a basis for life on some planets, large molecules based on silicon cannot rival DNA for information content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You assume humans would die out to AI, rather than merge with it. Cybernetics and digital prosthesis are advancing just as quickly as AI. There's likely to be a point very soon where artificial bodies are preferable to biological, especially when we become space-faring.</p></div>		</li>
