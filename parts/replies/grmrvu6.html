			<div class="markdown"><p>Fwiw I'm on anti rejection drugs to treat my flavor of kidney disease (no transplant necessary yet) and the side effects suuuuuck. Mine is neurotoxic so I get cool things like uncomfortably shaky hands and muscles, and they impact kidney function so I'm down to about 86% of normal function - still better than going untreated where by now my body would've shredded my kidneys entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upvote because the response is helpful. :( because I'm sorry to hear about your uncle. If we wanted to dive deeper (and please realize I have no clue about the selection and availability of these specific drugs) was it linked to a specific formula/brand commonly used medication or in general that's an inherent risk for this life long regiment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in ELI5 terms, your immune system is like a shield against everything nasty inside and out of your body. If you weaken it by taking suppressive drugs, then germs that don't bother people with healthy immune systems can take advantage of this. Essentially, you're extra vulnerable to infections, can't fight these infections off, and the infections you get are often complex to diagnose and treat as they can be caused by bugs that don't usually effect people.</p>
<p>Equally, your immune system is amazing at clearing out cells in your body that aren't quite right. Most of these cells are harmless, but a tiny proportion can go on to cause cancer. Your immune system can't filter these out if it's weakened, increasing the risk of many types of cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I believe this is something many people don't understand. *Cancer &lt;--This is your own physical person killing itself &quot;unknowingly&quot;. You can surgically remove it and/or treat the whole body with chemo until it stops killing itself. Of course, you may very well have caused your body to start fighting itself via introduce chemicals (smoking \ alcohol \ surrounding air quality \ etc.) either willingly or not but cancer I believe isn't something that can be completely prevented due to our diverse physiology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Heart transplant patient here</em></p>
<p>There are slews of side effects with all anti-rejction drugs, everything from nausea, headaches, to bone density problems and kidney failure. A big issue tends to be with the kidneys, hence why transplant patients aren't supposed to take other drugs that can also affect the kidneys cause they're already getting a beating from the anti-rejction meds. My dad also had a heart transplant, back in the 80s, and ended up passing from kidney failure and being drained too quickly. I don't know what medications he was specifically on, never asked as a kid I guess and he died when I was 18. But the meds I'm currently on have given me migraines, and nausea and vomiting problems mostly (the vomiting no one really understands), but this is still better than dying. But I'm not allowed to take ibuprofen or anything of that sort because of it damaging my kidneys (which really sucks when I have a migraine cause excedrin is BS). They also will check my kidney function levels most times they draw blood for labs. It's a small price to pay, to get a second chance at life though. Sorry I'm not more educational, but just telling you how I personally know it.</p></div>		</li>
