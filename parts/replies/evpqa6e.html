<p>I’m sorry I don’t understand what you mean by open your eyes really widely, may you kindly elaborate? Sorry I’m still a student studying in optometry and I’m keen to know more about things related to The Eye</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my area, ‘lazy eye’ is the layman term for amblyopia.
While ‘crossed eye’ is the layman term for strabismus.
Is it different in your area?</p></div>		</li>
