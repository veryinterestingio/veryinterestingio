<p>While Lake Baikal is very deep, it’s important to note that it doesn’t reach the depths of the abyssopelagic and hadopelagic zones, where most of what we’d consider “deep-sea” animals reside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reference that's 5390 feet, which is less than the <em>average</em> depth of the ocean (regardless of how you define average).   Those zones start at 9800 feet, and the deepest part of the ocean is 35800 feet</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, absolutely. Evolution varies with time, some mutations thrive. Any mutation in here will not reach outside, and everything else must adapt in turn. And likewise, any outside evolutions and adaptations will not reach inside.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Evolution isn't inherently sensical. Most/all evolution stems from mutations. These mutations can allow a species to better compete in its existing environment, or allow it to move to a more suitable environment. For your primary scenario the former is the case, and for your secondary scenario the latter is the case.</p></div>		</li>
