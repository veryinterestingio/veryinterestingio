			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is probably not any more mysterious than &quot;random chance.&quot; You wondering whether there's something special and innate about you that protects you from covid is like a lottery winner wondering if there is something innately special about their ability to pick the right numbers. But really, it's just that some people win the lottery and some get covid. There's probably nothing but your own good habits and deliberate precautions you take to protect you from catching it in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen the theory that having had certain strains of flu in the past makes it less likely you will catch Covid. The specific mechanism is that if you have developed antibodies to a similar virus it increases the amount of virus that has to be in your system to actually infect you.</p>
<p>Working in healthcare it is believable you have a stronger, trained immune system. You may have a higher threshold to infection than the average person, and have just gotten lucky in not exceeding that threshold when you were exposed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I’ve read about both of these hypotheses and they’re definitely included on my list of possible explanations. </p>
<p>I’ve also read about blood types playing a role, even though I’m aware there’s no substantial amount of evidence backing it up yet, I still find it interesting. </p>
<p>Another one I’ve thought about is if we had it before Covid was even thought of here. We don’t know when it came here but it could be as early as December. Since we didn’t know about it, we didn’t test for it. And then in March when lockdown happened we were already immune. But that doesn’t really explain why we didn’t get again later on.</p></div>		</li>
