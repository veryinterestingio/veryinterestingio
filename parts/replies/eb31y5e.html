			<div class="markdown"><p>It might not even be Youtube's servers that perform the caching.  Most content providers utilize 3rd party content distribution networks (CDNs).  These are provided by companies such as Amazon (through AWS CloudFront) or Akamai, or perhaps in some cases by the content provider itself (possible in the case of Google/Alphabet).  It's the CDN that does the caching in nearly every case.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google actually has YouTube/Google CDNs directly in the networks of most ISPs.  </p>
<p>When I had a major bandwidth issues I noticed that even 4k YouTube videos played just fine when even some 400kb image would cripple my internet.<br />
Turns out they have CDN in the local network of my ISP, thus bypassing regular lines that are crippled by other traffic.<br />
Almost as if you watch cable TV.  </p></div>		</li>
