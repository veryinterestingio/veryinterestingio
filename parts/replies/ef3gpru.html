There is a 3rd party company that tests vitamins and if there is a small sticker with &quot;USP&quot; on the bottle, then it has been approved as accurate labelling. Nature's Made found at Walmart is affordable and has been proven accurate. Labdoor.com is another website that lab tests vitamins but some can be pricey.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several years ago, Cardiologist Dr. William Davis, who puts all his heart patients on vitamin D, noticed that the patients that were on Nature Made Vitamin D did not realize any Improvement of their vitamin D blood serum levels. (very economical) He wrote to the company to ask them if they would speak with him about this, but he never heard back from them. This of course worried him, and made him feel that he could not recommend any Nature Made supplements to his patients.
I have been using Healthy Origins Vtamin D and Co Q10 for about a decade now. They work beautifully.  if you do a search on the internet 4 cardiologist William Davis, you would probably pop that story right up. Now I know that it's possible they have fixed this problem, but you'd have to look into it via reliable sources.
And of course people that know anything about it vitamin D, also know that it's not a vitamin, rather it's a unique and Powerful Seco steroid hormone, one of the most powerful of all our hormones.</p></div>		</li>
