			<div class="markdown"><p>That too is a common technique. Hiding the bodywork under covers so people can not see the changes. The problem with this is that it will change the aerodynamic of the car which voids a lot of the tests. For example fuel economy, noise, water penetration, temperature and dirt accumulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effectiveness of dazzle paint is questionable. And this is far from a good example. Some of these paint schemes are very effective at hiding the lines. This one just looks like someone wrapped the car in a cool looking design rather then actually trying to hide the lines. But it does work a bit. It would have been much easier to see the details of the car if it were not wrapped.</p></div>		</li>
