			<div class="markdown"><p>Myst is a game from my childhood, but thinking about how old it is not what makes me feel old. What really makes me feel old is thinking about something that is kind of new, but more time has passed by than you realized. Especially annoyingly catchy songs. &quot;All About That Bass&quot; came out 6 years ago. &quot;Call Me Maybe.&quot; 8 years ago. &quot;Single Ladies.&quot; Fucking 12 years ago.</p></div>		</li>
