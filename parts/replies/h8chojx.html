			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think Korea is more like Japan in that they donâ€™t use cents &amp; dollars and so one unit of currency is closer to being thought of as a cent than as a dollar. 10,000 yen is basically the same as a $100 bill. </p>
<p>VND is somewhat different. 500,000 dong is their highest note, and the average salary is around 17M dong a month, so rent or vehicle prices just end up using numbers far larger than Japan or Korea ever would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there are various  [1$ coins](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_coin_(United_States" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_coin_(United_States</a>) in circulation.  They're relatively rare but are legal tender. I use them when I get them, though I sometimes get funny looks from sales people (the same happens with the $2 bill :) )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how rare $1 coins are but one time i had to pay $5 for parking and i only had a $20 note. So, the machine gave me $15 back in all $1 coins</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I didn't mention it because like you said they are rarely used. I have both the 1 dollar coin and the 2 dollar bill but only as a part of a collection :)</p></div>		</li>
