			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that answered so many things I wanted to know. Thank you!! </p>
<p>I didn’t think about how slow moving the field is and the impact it would have. It makes sense now that you put it that way. Innovation usually has multiple iterations of failures along the way. So when doing projects that involve public safety, stay with what’s tried and true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an example to get a sense of the scale of how expensive civil infrastructure is.</p>
<p>I have a friend who works for an IT company that is developing a solution for an insurance company to process claims. The cost of the project is about $30 mn, and that is considered an expensive project that will be the bread and butter for the insurance company. They will go through a bunch of unit testing, alpha testing, and beta testing before ultimately deploying it.</p>
<p>The cost of a new interchange being built in Chicago - one interchange that you will drive through in less than 5 min - is $1 billion. It has to work the first time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's go with the tried and true method to make sure no one dies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This ELI5 has been asked before but yours was the only one that mentioned CO2 emissions this time. (I didn't expand every thread, though.)</p>
<p>Also, I think someone said that asphalt is also concrete but &quot;concrete&quot; is cement. Or might've been the other way around. Which one handles heavy (weight or volume) traffic better, black asphalt or cement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. How do you convince a client or local government to be the guinea pig? Most projects get built with a high level of confidence and no one wants to put millions of dollars into an experimental project with exposure to lawsuits, endangering the public, etc.</p></div>		</li>
