<p>If you're validating an email address, you can use RFC 5322. (Or, more practically, you can try to send an email and see if it works.)</p>
<p>There is no spec defining names. There is no way to sensibly say that the string a user has provided is not a name.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong in saying that there's no good reason for validating this kind of input but if you've worked in the field for some years I'm pretty damn sure you've seen this before.</p>
<p>Same goes for the new methods to deal with SQL injections. Decades is far fetched but even if you said 10 years old it is not uncommon for systems to be older than that and afterwards you still need to account for unskilled developers. There are still lots of application that are vulnerable to injections.</p>
<p>I don't get why you use that aggressive tone on an explanation that is IMO pretty good, but maybe that's just due to my understanding of your comment.</p></div>		</li>
