			<div class="markdown"><p>So many phrases come from Nautical terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pass with flying colours : After victory, the ships would come into port flying the flag (known as flying the colours).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Room to swing a cat : The 'cat o' 9 tails' was a whip type thing used as a punishment for troublesome sailors. They'd get lashed with it hence there needing to be enough room to swing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a loose end : When there was nothing to do, the sailors used to get told to check the ends of the rigging for frayed ropes.</p>
</li>
<li>batten down the hatches : Entering rough seas. They'd close all the hatches on the deck with shutters &amp; hold them closed with battens of wood.</li>
</ul>
<p>To name a few.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the cut of your jib, but because I'm three sheets to the wind, I'm going to change tack. People should take some of these on board, but maybe I'm cutting it too close to the wind. I've shown my true colours, I'm not trying to rock the boat, so don't give me a wide berth, ok?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eh. That one's probably folk etymology: <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/no-room-to-swing-a-cat.html" target="_blank">https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/no-room-to-swing-a-cat.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed: </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bitter_end" target="_blank">&quot;That part of an anchor cable which is abaft the bitts and thus remains inboard when a ship is riding at anchor&quot;</a></p>
<p>I always thought this saying meant &quot;bitter&quot; as in the taste/flavor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you'd also be mindful to remember that most of the ocean floor is pretty devoid of significant features. It's not like every inch of shallows are coral reefs. It's mostly silt and some seaweed.</p>
<p>It's still damage, but I feel like people are getting the idea of a huge anchor just cutting a trench in Nemo's whole scene.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The sea floor is very, very big and most ships anchor only in dedicated anchorages.</p></div>		</li>

secured with an anchor to the front in addition to the ropes
towards the moorings. Its neighbouring boats might not stay in
