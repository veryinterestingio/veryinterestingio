			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what was weird. I hadn't been shopping since the end of February, til last weekend. And there was NO shortage of toilet paper. They had plenty. I couldn't get my &quot;Scrubby Bubbles&quot; though. Entire cleaning section was bare.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, the toilet paper shortage has been entirely a virtual event for me. I saw it in the gas station and the convenience store I've popped into for sporadic things. Never saw a single empty shelf. Never happened where I live as far as I know, but that's because I never saw it.  I know it happened elsewhere, because I saw the evidence of it. But, yeah, no toilet paper shortage here afaik. </p>
<p>That's weird when you think about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hoarders are going through cycles, and you are right that there is local variation. People were mocking the hoarders that you couldn't eat TP and then I heard some complaints that yeast, flour, sugar, and rice were out. I saw pasta sauce and canned soup out or low as well.</p>
<p>I didn't see toilet paper all March, for my 2 or 3 shopping trips. I wasn't short because I happened to get some in mid-Feb that was on sale.</p>
<p>I have seen some cleaning supplies low, but not out.</p>
<p>Things seem to be recovering now that hoarders seem to have gotten their fill.</p></div>		</li>
