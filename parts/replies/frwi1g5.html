			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never heard the theory that its related to air pressure! </p>
<p>humidity on the other hand plays a large factor. higher humidity makes it easier for your body to keep the skin in side your nose and mouth wet - if it's wet the filter function works better (germs, dust etc is caught on the wet mucous).</p>
<p>more mucous causes more flow of mucus, which is a self cleaning function - the &quot;intruders&quot; are transfered away from the respiratory tract, instead they are swallowed and killed by your digestive system.</p>
<p>AAAAAND last but not least:
in the cold season people tend to spend more time inside of buildings and more closer to each other, with windows being opened less often and very little to no air exchange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had just watched a Dr. Mike or someone explain the droplets more readily falling to the ground in summer, it was news to me. Obviously people being inside more is a factor but controlling for that disease still spreads more slowly in summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is in fact the case that kid's build immunity when they eat their boogers. For exactly the reason u/konzty described. Exposure to the germs in the digestive track is safer but still slowly builds immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold air holds less water than hot air so it is actually much drier in the winter (outside the tropics).</p>
<p>It is less critical how long the particles are dangerous as it is how fast and how often they will come into contact with new targets.  </p>
<p>Cold air makes people have runny noses and dry air makes people cough more. We drink less water when cold, excercise less often to say healthy and eat less vitamin containing fresh vegetables .</p>
<p>In winter people are much more likely to be inside in close contact more of the time, to share more exposure to coughed droplets produced by more frequent coughing, and to do so on clothing and surfaces that don't get washed as often. </p>
<p>People wash their hands much less when they are cold. Their bodies are much less often exposed directly to wind or UV light, they tend to be in more dense or crowded social and sheltering situations.</p>
<p>Washing your hands and face, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze and staying more than 10 feet away from others are not some kind of impulsive guess-work or half measures. They are the most effective way to stop disease spread.  Hygiene and distancing occur more often and more naturally in mild weather (and when school is out) then in winter.  </p>
<p>Viruses spread through active contact and proximity. Passive airborne circumstances are at best secondary factors and at worst excuses to be a dick about basic prevention habits in public. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary argument I've heard is that mostly because people aren't going outside and getting fresh air as much.  Instead they stay inside where the air was stale and recirculated.</p>
<p>This taken with the other points suggested makes sense (denser, drier air; touching more of the same surfaces; etc)</p></div>		</li>
