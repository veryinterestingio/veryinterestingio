<p>2-million year old human ancestor. So fascinating especially since I'm currently reading <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari. Highly reccomend.</p></div>		</li>

His first (posted a couple of days ago) is about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mWOJ56_Et0" target="_blank">Taung Child, the first fossil Hominim found in South Africa</a>. Itâ€™s really neat! The man knows how to teach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to be this guy but read Sapiens with a grain of salt. A lot of the stuff Harari presents as facts are mere speculation. Also I don't like the way he downplays prehistoric humans. We were beasts and absolutely dominated our territories even in a time we had nothing but rocks and sticks to throw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve been to the Cradle of Humankind in recent years and National Geographic documented some new discoveries and put them on display at the visitor complex there. There was an extremely long and cramped (like 30cm by 60cm) route that the team took before it opened into the chamber with the hominid remains in it. It seems almost impossible that they found this chamber at all, but they borrowed tech from the oil drilling industry and began to map the caves from the surface. There are dozens to hundreds of chambers around the Cradle of Humankind area that the scanners located, but the caves have no known entrances so they are unexplored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought that weâ€™re only in the media publishing business for a long time, but when I visited the Cradle of Humankind I discovered that they funded so much of the expedition that one of the most major missing-link discoveries in history wouldnâ€™t have been done without their money. Nat Geo has enabled some pretty great anthropological discoveries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was lucky enough to visit the Cradle of Humankind a few years ago and loved it.</p>
<p>What I had never realized is that the remains which were found there were not in the caves on purpose, rather they fell into them through holes on the surface and died from the fall. This never seems to be explained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for Homo Naledi, who is still driving scientists a bit buggy. Until the pandemic allows us to reopen we wonâ€™t know much more. Professor Berger said on Twitter that they had teeth ready to fly to Denmark for the new DNA analysis the U. Of Copenhagen has developed, but the flight was canceled due to Covid 19. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p></div>		</li>
