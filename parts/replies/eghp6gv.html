			<div class="markdown"><p>That last sentence was gold.</p>
<p>All of what you said makes sense. I was told by an optometrist in my 20s that I will definitely be needing glasses at some stage, but she was reluctant to give me a prescription until after I hit 30, as glasses can accelerate the deterioration of your eyesight. That was quite a while ago now and I still don't wear glasses, although I really should.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was denied glasses in middle school (still don't use them, as I can pass all vision tests with no issue) because despite having astigmatism in both eyes, the doctor said that I only noticed problems when I was straining my eyes for too long, and all the glasses would do is let me strain my eyes even longer.</p>
<p>My vision is definitely not as good as when I was a child, but it's not gotten to the point where it causes any strain, and I can still pass all my vision tests at 20/20. Due to the inconvenience and expense factor, I don't see myself getting glasess anytime soon.</p></div>		</li>
