			<div class="markdown"><p>I took inorganic chemistry, and come to think of it you're right...I remember all sorts of stuff about d-splitting in things like crystals, but not in metals. Or at least if we did learn that, that's as far as it went. Definitely no relativistic effects.</p></div>		</li>

Call me weird, those are the classes that are most rewarding and worth seeking out. The things not everyone can do, maybe you're great at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My physics class was like that with magnetism. The professor also taught a lot of high level quantum physics classes, and she basically told us that what she was supposed to teach was so dumbed down that it was basically false, and that to really understand it we'd need to take a 300 level physics course. So just know that humanity in general understands how magnetism works, but you all as individuals will not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm colorblind so the statue of liberty always looked grey to me, so I always assumed it was like... made out of stone or something, like the statue of david but huge. I literally never considered until your comment just now that it was made of metal. </p>
