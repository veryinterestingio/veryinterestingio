			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not necessary though. Pasteur certainly didn't have that when he vaccinated and saved the life of a child infected with rabies. The virus takes weeks to reach the brain, your immune system needs ~10 days to ramp up. That being said, if it was me needing the vaccine I'd def want that IgG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but it's also likely unnecessary. Nobody who has gotten any rabies vaccine within three days of exposure has come down with rabies. Also there have been multiple cases where someone with only the pre exposure vaccine has seen a spike in antibody levels. </p>
<p>It's just that rabies is so deadly that they don't take any chances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's scary is bats... sometimes people are bitten without realizing it or worse the bats come in through an open window or damaged drywall at night and get into someone's bed while they're sleeping, then the carcass is found later when changing sheets, or worse is found under the bed weeks later.</p>
<p>A very good reason not to sleep with windows open where bats live, like in the warm season in south Texas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You literally take pieces of the cancer and make a vaccine out it. You then immunize the cancer patient with that vaccine and hope that they will develop an immune response targeting the cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaccinating the whole population only makes sense in specific circumstances like trying to erradicate a disease, one that spreads really quickly, doesn't have a clearly defined risk groups and leaves a lot of dead bodies.</p>
<p>Rabies checks none of these boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't erradicate it because it has such massive animal reservoirs that it'll always come back. That's not to say we haven't had success with clearing some of those reserviors. Several countries have done extensive wildlife vaccination campaigns against rabies. But those campaigns were not able to target all reservoirs (foxes and coyotes yes, raccoons probably, bats unfortunately not)</li>
<li>Rabies is really terrible at spreading among humans because unlike wildlife, symptomatic humans are quickly quarantined.</li>
<li>You achieve practically the same level of protection simply by PEP treating anyone who's been bitten. Similarly you can vaccinate your outdoor pets.</li>
<li>Rabies kills &quot;just&quot; 60k a year. Granted that's 60k exceedingly horriffic deaths but most of these cases occur in areas where PEP isn't readily available or is frequently not sought out by bite victims. When you can't even get PEP to the people who need it, vaccinating the whole species isn't quite realistic.</li>
</ul>
<p>TLDR: There are more cost effective approaches and we already struggle at those...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vaccine can be effective for 10+ years but not permanent. Doesn't really matter in most cases though since anyone who gets bit by an animal will have to get a booster shot anyway just to be on the safe side. (assuming they live in a country where rabies hasn't been eradicated)</p>
<p>In case of animal bites the rabies vaccine is also usually accompanied by a tetanus vaccine, which has a similar duration of immunity. So even if you were somehow immune to rabies, you'd still need to visit the hospital for tetanus.</p></div>		</li>
