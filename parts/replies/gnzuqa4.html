<p>This is why its also healthier to eat less more often than the massive one off meals we normally eat </p>

<p>On the other hand, when you fast for a long time your body gets used to it and you only start getting hungry when you would normally break the fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve found that the opposite tends to apply to me. I get hungry when I eat more frequently, than when I eat one large or two large meals per day. The act of eating, and having to think about food so often (every few hours) keeps food in my mind such that my entire waking time is consumed by what am I going to eat next and then I want to eat more. Also the more often I eat, the more often I release insulin in response to food, and therefore my hunger signals are triggered throughout the day.</p>
<p>Also if I eat multiple smaller meals, each meal does not seem enough to satisfy my hunger as I tend to need to feel full to be satisfied and I can achieve that by eating a large meal less frequently.</p></div>		</li>
