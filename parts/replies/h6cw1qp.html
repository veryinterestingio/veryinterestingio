			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't realise that was a top tier answer. Oops! I just saw so many mentions of turbulence, which while not incorrect, doesn't hit the answer full on.</p>
<p>I guess the diffusion answer involves giving a bunch of five year olds sugary sweets and wondering why neither the fat kids nor the skinny kids care about the 1% slope in the floor while they run around bouncing off the walls.</p></div>		</li>
