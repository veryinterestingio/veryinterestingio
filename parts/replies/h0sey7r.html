			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also differences in probability for mutations occuring between the nucleic acids, so on a statistical basis predictions are possible to some extend. But this is in no way precise enough to react in advance, as previously stated.
I think topping off the vaccination in reasonable intervals is by far the most viable option. This is already done with for eg. the influenza vaccines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to point out that I reject the premise of the title. SARS-CoV-2 (2019 Coronavirus) does <em>not</em> &quot;mutate often&quot;. We've had <em>at least</em> 175m cases worldwide and only 10 or so notable variants (and not even full on mutations). Compare that to influenza, which you brought up, that mutates to at least 3 or 4 different viruses that need their own vaccine every year. And drug companies make these vaccines by looking at the opposite hemisphere and seeing which influenzas were most common during the current flu season (which will be past flu season by the time vaccine is put out). </p>
<p>Relatively speaking, coronavirus is pretty stable. None of these variants are even that far off where they're completely immune to the vaccine made for the original 2019 sequence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are you differentiating between &quot;notable variants&quot; and &quot;full on mutations&quot;? Variants are notable when the cumulative effect of one or more mutations changes the characteristics of the virus/disease/epidemiology.</p>
<p>I agree that influenza mutates at a much faster rate than SARS-CoV-2, largely due to the fact that it lacks proofreading on its RNA polymerase, but there are some other interesting flu characteristics that lead us to use multivalent vaccines!</p>
<p>The fact that trivalent or quadrivalent flu vaccines are used is because there are both influenza A and B viruses; additionally, flu has a rather special way of swapping round its viral genome sections that code for haemagglutinin and neuraminidase with other flu viruses to create new combinations. That's why viruses are labelled H1N1, H3N2, things like that.</p>
<p>A quadrivalent vaccine will be designed to work against the WHO-recommended  H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A strains, and two influenza B strains (trivalent has just one influenza B strains).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are forgetting one important difference between corona and all flu viruses: the latter have had prior infections, corona has not. This means that there is more evolutionary pressure on flu viruses to mutate. This in turn means that as corona reaches higher immunity levels it will also encounter higher pressure to mutate. So it is relatively stable now, but might not be in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is like saying cats don't mutate often because all housecats are the same breed of cat, and that there aren't all that many different colourations. </p>
<p>Mutation occurs constantly, especially so in viruses. A mutation doesn't have to result in a viable and prolific strain for it to be considered a mutation. Mutation is a random process and is not guided towards proliferation. We only see 10 or so odd strains of COVID because all of the other mutations simply didn't change anything meaningful, were detrimental, or were not able to spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On this subject is where the research into ''gain of function'' plays a role, this research can be done to look into what new abilities could a virus happen to get through a random mutation or through absorbing a piece of genetic material from its host(this is a mutation mechanism some virus have), research can try to look into what the virus could become, or look into improving a certain mechanism and then see how you can deal with it and more...</p>
<p>As you can see there is more than one approach to this, the approach where research is done into improving the virus to see how to defeat it is a bit problematic and frowned upon by part of the scientific community as you're developing a virus and that poses a risk and has to be done with proper containment but if done properly it could allow to properly prepare and be ready for future mutations, there is proponents and detractors...</p>
<p>Research into gain of function came into spotlight lately because of the people who hold suspicions that the wuhan laboratory is involved in making covid-19... These suspicions had its place at the beginning of the pandemic but have since been proved unfounded and the origins of sars-cov2 are attributed to natural changes with a high degree of confidence and evidence</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! Thanks. Out of curiosity, as technology advances, what do you think about the possibility of ai or quantum computers to help with these types of predictions? </p>
<p>What if a computer can logically guess these mutations are the most detrimental if they occur, and as such, protection should be focused on these mutations first. </p>
<p>Just thinking in a future scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While machine learning is fairly applicable to most of biology in some way or another, I doubt there are immediate applications for quantum computing here where it'd exceed our classical neural networks simply because the data is not complex enough.</p>
<p>I think going forward, we'll be able to better model interactions between receptor binding domains and their targets.  The addition of structural data should help as well.  </p>
<p>But there's always going to be some randomness with mutations that will prevent you from accurately predicting what will happen.  It just seems sort of foolish to design a vaccine to a mutated version with the hope that the virus also happens to attain those mutations, when it's more likely that it won't.</p>
<p>And just to add, there are interactions that we aren't really able to see that make this even more challenging.  The most obvious one is interactions between our immune systems (diverse) and the virus, which is constantly driving evolution of the virus.  Then there are interactions between the spike and the rest of the virus proteins, which might restrict evolution.  And it's essentially impossible to predict (with any certainty) just how these might influence mutation and selection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to toss my opinion that no, it's not possible for a realistic application. A computer could guess what variants and mutations could pop up but that number would be infinite. In a real world application only a handful of the mutations will surface. So you'd basically need to create a vaccine that protects you against hundreds of different viruses on the chance that a few of them pop up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just predicting which nucleotides can mutate, but their effect on the proteins they code for. That second step, predicting protein folding, is something that has been and continues to be heavily researched, but is currently developed enough to solve this sort of problem. There have been some advances recently, but protein folding is difficult to model, and the effects on the characteristics of that mutation on the interaction with human proteins makes it that much more complex. </p>
<p>From there, the interactions of the virus on the human proteins and systems increases the complexity significantly. We don't even have a complete understanding of the interactions of human proteins with each other, so creating a 'new' virus from mutations and seeing if it is more or less infectious, or more or less dangerous, will require modeling interactions and the physiological effects of those interactions. It's much more straightforward to ask &quot;why is this virus having these effects&quot; than &quot;what effects could the many different small changes from mutation of this virus have&quot;. This becomes an entire level of more complex if we try to then expand that further to epidemiological trends.</p>
<p>Quantum computing might make this &quot;easier&quot; (as in decreasing computational time for sufficiently complex models to a functional timeframe), but we also need to be reasonable about our expectations of quantum computing, as it currently does not exist and may require significant development of the underlying software in addition to the hardware (as we've had decades of development on our current computing paradigm turning bits into machine code/assembler into C into languages and programs that can be used by non-computer scientists).</p>
<p>This might be simpler if, as mentioned in another comment, we exclude conserved sequences from mutation in the computation models, making them simpler but less robust (a common, natural tradeoff in simulating systems, especially biological systems). This decreases the number of changes we would have to examine, but does not decrease the complexity of simulating the interactions between the virus and the human body, or how that would translate into broader epidemiological trends.</p>
<p>Over all, simulating systems requires a strong understanding of the characteristics of that system. Even small changes can reverberate through complex systems, making then very difficult to predict and decreasing the value of simulation. It's also probabilistic, so if we make a vaccine that protects against the most dangerous possibilities, they may not be useful if they don't arise. If, however, we made a vaccine that had the broadest applicability against mutations then that might be more valuable, but we still run into the massive difficulties that I have already mentioned.</p>
<p>Ultimately, responding to existing variants as they arise is the approach we currently have to take, as we do not have the capabilities (currently, to my knowledge) to perform these simulations, and with the rise of the new mRNA vaccines whose development is apparently faster than other methods we may be able to respond effectively to these new variants with our current approach.</p>
<p>(Note: not an expert in this area, but I have been exposed to the concepts around it through studying biochemistry, biological and biochemical engineering, and performing some simulations of systems myself. Other answers I already see in this thread are definitely complementary, or just better, to anything I have to say)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And...I believe I heard that current software available at outbreak start would have predicted that SARS2 spike would NOT bind ACE2. Its part of the reason we know its not engineered...because it is not what would have been built. Its also not passage mutations as those are used to attenuate not gain function.</p></div>		</li>
