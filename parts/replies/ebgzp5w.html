			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've heard that before. But, again, it's a hypothesis. We just can't realistically know something like that because that history has been destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your insight. Is your differences in opinion based off of your fields? You study astronomy and probably focus heavily on material composition where the qoura author is a computer engineer/ possibly runs orbit simulations and doesnt deal with any of your knowledge?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually we can draw some pretty strong conclusions, if we find the evidence. One of the pieces of evidence is the fact that the vast majority of the extrasolar systems we see out there have close-in to the star giant planets. We're also missing a super-Earth class planet in  our solar system that a majority of systems have. Simulations of the Nice Model of the solar nebula have a pretty hard time resolving to 4 giant planets in their current orbits. If a fifth giant planet is introduced, roughly at Earth's orbit, or slightly further out between Earth and Mars' orbits, it makes the current solar system work out much more easily, and can be explained with the inner giant getting ejected in interactions with Jupiter (which would have tacked back to its current orbit after migrating closer) for the interaction. That &quot;ejected planet&quot;, might not have been sent completely into interstellar space. Instead it might have been sent into a long period, eccentric orbit with an orbital period of 50,000 years --e.g. the characteristics of the Planet IX we're currently searching for. If we find it in that orbit, understanding its composition could tell us whether it actually formed in the interior regions of the solar nebula, and confirm (or falsify) that theory</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moon rocks have been dated to pretty close to solar system formation. The Late Heavy Bombardment certainly pummeled the inner planets, but it didn't destroy any of them outright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the answer would depend on whether you consider formation to include something close to the today's form or some early stage that might not resemble what we know today.</p>
<p>For instance, there's speculation that what we see of Mercury is a planet with the surface stripped off.</p>
<p>And was Earth really Earth before Theia impacted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Undoubtedly, there were many more proto-planets at the beginning of the Solar System. For all the inner planets, there were probably some large object that smacked into each of them, Theia for Earth, something to reverse Venus' rotation, something to leave Mercury as 80% core, and something to smack into Mars. And of course, simulations have also made the possibility that there was a 5th Gas Giant in-between Saturn and Uranus that was ejected long ago. Oh and another thing to smack into Uranus as well. There's just so much we can't possibly find out no matter how good our forensics become.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good points. Theia, for example, doesn't exist any more. How many others existed that we don't even know about? How many were flung out of the solar system completely? Again, we just don't know. I always like to imagine, though, that if we invented time travel (or past time viewing), I'd love to watch the formation of the solar system in fast-mo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I doubt you'd &quot;see&quot; much. If you're close enough to see one planet, you're too far from the others. </p></div>		</li>
