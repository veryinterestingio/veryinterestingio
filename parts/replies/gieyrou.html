			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important thought. If a random farmer in a remote area invented THE DOOHICKEY to make their farming easier, there is a strong chance that invention might die with them. That farmer's kids may not like it or maybe it broke and they didn't know how to fix it. Maybe even a few neighbors used it for a generation?</p>
<p>There is no way to know how many times items we find commonplace today were invented over the years before catching on. </p>
<p>My own grandfather was a farmer and told us as kids that he should've been rich because he was a tinkerer and years later he'd see something he had a homemade version of in the store. Farmers tend to be very inventive with finding/making something they need.</p></div>		</li>
