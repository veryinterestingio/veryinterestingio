<p>Time inside the ship appears to be slowed down to the person on the ground, and conversely everyone outside the ship looks like they're running around like ants to the people inside.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure you nailed it, except for this point. Remember that to the people inside the ship, they themselves seem stationary while it seems like the people <em>outside the ship</em> are moving at 90% the speed of light. So the people outside the ship perceive the people inside the ship as moving in slow motion, and the people inside the ship perceive the people outside the ship as moving in slow motion, <em>provided the ship is not undergoing acceleration</em>. </p>
<p>For more detail, check out the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox" target="_blank">The Twin Paradox</a> and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MfJ59lkABY" target="_blank">this excellent PBS Spacetime video</a> that discusses how both types of observers can see the others as moving in slow motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, came here to make the same point.  The really mind twisting thing is that both sets of observers view the other as moving in slow motion.  The resolution to the twin paradox I sort of understand but it still makes my head hurt.</p></div>		</li>

Have a look at my answer to their comment and tell me what you think. I'm not actually a physicist, so you're probably right. I'm just a linguist who dropped out of a maths degree nearly ten years ago and reads about this stuff sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand this. Say someone gets in a spaceship and travels to  another planet, and the journey takes 10 years from their perspective.  So, apparently from their perspective time on Earth is slower, so it  might take, say, 6 years from the perspective of someone on Earth. But  from the Earth perspective, the astronaut's time is running slower, so a  person on Earth would think 3.6 years has passed for the astronaut? How  can both 10 years and 3.6 years have passed for the astronaut?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So here's where the last point in my comment comes into play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>provided the ship is not undergoing acceleration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If somebody got in a spaceship and travelled to another planet, they would need to undergo an initial period of <em>acceleration towards the other planet</em>, in addition to a period of <em>acceleration away from the other planet</em>. (We would typically call that deceleration, but I'm avoiding that word here as we only care about what happens in reference frames undergoing acceleration).</p>
<p>There are two principles to understand here. The first is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle" target="_blank">Equivalence principle</a>. Basically, any statement we can make about the effect of gravity on something also applies if that something is undergoing an equivalent force (and thus, acceleration).</p>
<p>Put another way, the same physical statements we can make with regards to you standing on the Earth (which applies an acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2) is we can make with regards to you undergoing 9.8 m/s^2 of acceleration in a vacuum (on a spaceship in deep space, perhaps.)</p>
<p>The second thing to understand is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation" target="_blank">Gravitational time dilation</a>. Basically, the stronger a force of gravity you feel, the slower time moves for you. If you've ever seen Interstellar, think about the scene on the water planet. If Matthew McConaughey's character could see David Gyasi's orbiting the water planet in his spaceship, what would he see? David Gyasi's character would be moving around the spaceship extremely quickly because McConaughey's character is experiencing so much gravitational time dilation.</p>
<p>Because of the Equivalence principle, the same thing applies for the person flying to the other planet in a spaceship, and will square up the otherwise different &quot;times&quot; (a loaded word here) different observers would have seen them arriving on the other planet.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am but a software engineer that binge watches PBS Spacetime a little more than is healthy for me, so I very probably got some things wrong. If anybody wants to correct any mistakes, please feel free!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help to talk about the counterintuitive weirdness of minkowski spacetime. If you draw it as a graph with one dimension of time and one dimension of space, we can compare it to a standard euclidian plane. In Euclidian geometry, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. If I have points A and B, a straight line between them is shorter than a line from A to C then from C to B. But, in Minkowski spacetime, a straight line between two points is actually the longest possible distance. It's called the path of maximal aging in some contexts. Taking a more circuitous route is actually &quot;shorter&quot; (in the time sense) than going straight there.</p>
<p>So if we think of two events (points) in spacetime, one at our resting space station at time A, and then another point that is also at the space station at time B, then the &quot;shortest&quot; (in a Euclidean sense) path between these points is the straight line connecting them, which is the path a person just hanging out at the space station takes in spacetime. But, in Minkowski spacetime this is the longest path. A ship that departs from the space station at time A and flies away and returns at time B actually took a shorter path through spacetime; less time passed for it. Now, if it's overall speed and distance traveled was of a magnitude that we are used to in everyday life, the actual difference in time between the two paths would far too low for a human to notice, and would require some pretty high end clocks to even measure at all. But when those speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light, things become much more noticeable.</p>
<p>At the limit, a ship that leaves at time A and then returns at time B, traveling at light speed (physically impossible) would experience 0 time. As mentioned this isn't actually possible, but you can get arbitrarily close to this, so there is no actual minimum time it would take. You can always get closer to light speed and make the time less.</p>
<p>In terms of what everyone involved is experiencing, that's much more complex and I'm not going to try to go into detail here... it's not exactly effective to try and dump all that info in one post without you being able to interact and ask questions. I'd probably just confuse you more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are correct that speed is relative. If I'm walking up an escalator at 2 m/s and the escalator is moving at 5m/s then my speed relative to a person standing still at the bottom of the escalator is 7 m/s, but to someone else on the escalator who is standing still and waiting patiently for the escalator to transport them to the next floor my speed is 2 m/s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so here is my problem with this relative motion thing.</p>
<p>Let's say I am in a spaceship. If I accelerate towards the speed of light, further acceleration becomes more and more expensive because of my mass increasing. If accelerating to 10% the speed of light costs Y energy, then accelerating from 99% to 99.9% costs, I dunno, one million Y, or something on that crazy exponential curve.</p>
<p><em>De</em>celeration is also proportionately expensive (obviously, otherwise we're destroying energy).</p>
<p>So, does the point where Y is cheapest not suggest I have found the universe's true &quot;static&quot; position?</p>
<p>If accleration costs more the faster you go, doesn't that undermine the idea that all motion is relative?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What one frame of reference considers to be a &quot;deceleration&quot; is an &quot;acceleration&quot; in another. What does it mean to decelerate until you reach rest? Rest relative to whom? You are always at rest in your own reference frame, but you can always find an observer that will measure your velocity as non-zero.</p>
<p>The amount of energy spent to achieve a certain change in velocity depends on the observer.
Take two rockets moving away from earth at .99c relative to earth. They are in the same reference frame, so they both see the other rocket as being at rest. If rocket A begins to accelerate, eventually rocket B will observe rocket A as moving .01c away from it after spending X amount of energy. On earth, we know rocket A is not moving away at 1c, it is moving away at .99c + some negligible amount.</p>
<p>As you can see, rocket B and earth both observed rocket A expending X amount of energy, but they observed different changes in velocity as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel this example has more moving parts than it needs and it doesn't make sense to me...</p>
<p>From Rocket A's own point of view: it spends X amount of energy to accelerate from 0 to 0.1C relative to the Earth that it has left behind. But to continue accelerating, say, from 89% to 99% of C, costs many times X, no? Does that not suggest that Earth is somehow at some kind of universal rest?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>>If accleration costs more the faster you go, doesn't that undermine the idea that all motion is relative?   </p>
<p>You need to consider how the 99% to 99.9% acceleration is seen in a different frame. What you are implyng, I think, is that a 1% increase in speed costs the universe a fuckton of energy so the universe &quot;tracks&quot; that the particle was already going very fast and thus a 1% should cost a lot.  That seems to imply that 0.99c is somehow intrinsically different from 0.1c.  </p>
<p>In a different frame the particle would not go from, say, 11%c to 11.1%c. It would go from 11% to, say, 99.2%c. So in a different frame, the change in speed would be large and thus the amount of energy spent would also make perfect sense <em>in that frame.</em>  </p>
<p>So all observers see a coherence picture of the world within their frames. Does that help?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% sure on the answer to this, but I'll give it a try.</p>
<p>I think the answer is that mass is also relative. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass\_in\_special\_relativity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass\_in\_special\_relativity</a></a> What does it mean for mass to be relative? Well, mass is just how strongly an object interacts with a gravitational field. So, if the relative mass of one object in relation to another increases as their relative speed increases, then all that means is that two objects that are moving faster in relation to each other have a stronger gravitational attraction.</p></div>		</li>
