<p>meaning, instead of gradually increasing the effort to draw as you extend a traditional bow, the compound bow peaks during your draw</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How exactly does this work?</p>
<p>I understand the basic concept of &quot;pulleys mean you can do less work&quot;, but I don't understand</p>
<ol>
<li>How the drop off works. Is it just that the non-circular shape of the cams changes the pulley ratio? Eg it starts off 1:1 and decreases to 3:1 or similar?</li>
<li>How, if it's easier for me to pull the bow, that doesn't work the other way and result in less energy being imparted back to the arrow than a recurve or traditional bow</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two question is really the same question.</p>
<p>The non circular shape does not reduce the total effort, <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2172756/how-compound-bows-work" target="_blank">check out this site</a>, It puts an empasis on the initial draw, as in a sense, changethe gear ratio rtahter than the pulley ratio. If you input the energy into a graph, both bow would have the same result. Basically you work harder initially so you spend less energy later, versus conventional bow where they spend less energy early, and expell massive energy later.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as &quot;free&quot; energy, and thus, all the energy that is stored into the arms and thus arrow came from you. It is NOT easier for you to pull the bow as a whole, but rather, it is easier for you to maintain the full drawn position because it requires much less energy to fully drawn due to the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Polispasto2.jpg" target="_blank">pulley system</a>. In the end, you are excerting the same amount of force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a compound bow (with non-circular cams) of the same weight will actually be heavier at the start of the draw, in exchange for the lighter end of the draw?</p>
<p>That make sense, it's basically then just reversing the forces of a regular bow where the draw is light initially and then gets heavier when closer to full draw?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pullies dont mean you do less work, they mean you do it in smaller increments.</p>
<p>Carrying two 50lb boxes 100 feet, is the same amount of work as carrying one 100lb boxl 100 ft.  however, if your not strong, the first option is a lot easier.</p>
<p>So what a the system of pullys does on a compound bow is instead of drawing 100lbs of force back 1 foot, it lets you pull 50lbs of force back 2 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of your draw is 1:1 and so the pulley will exert say 80 pounds of force most of the way after release. But the last few inches the shape of the pulleys makes it so you get a leverage and the force required to hold it there is only a fraction of the 80 pounds. You will lose a small acceleration at your release because of this but you can make that up by having a stronger bow overall but still be able to easily hold ot drawn.</p></div>		</li>
