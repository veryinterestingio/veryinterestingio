			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a little napkin math so not sure how accurate it is but I got the answer to be about 1.68×10^8 km (note: the earth is between 140 and 150 million km from the sun at any point) from the sun. Please let me know if there was anything I missed. The assumptions I made are as follows:</p>
<p>Emissivity of the body = 1
Surface area of the body = 1.9m^2
Temperature of the body = 313 K
Solar Output of the sun = 384.6×10^24 W (from a quick search)
Temperature of surrounding space = 0 K</p>
<p>The equations I used were the equation for thermal radiation (from hyper-physics):</p>
<p>P = emissivity×(stephen-boltzmann constant)×surface area of body×(temperature of body^4 - temperature of surrounding^4)</p>
<p>And the equation for surface area of a sphere:</p>
<p>A =4(pi)r^2</p>
<p>I solved for P and then set that equal to the watts per square meter that the sun would be outputting at a certain distance r on the surface area of thr body facing the sun and solved for the above r:</p>
<p>P = (solar output/4(pi)r^2)×surface area of body/2</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're missing a &quot;million&quot; in there. aka 1.4 to 1.5x10^8 km, so slightly further than the earth currently is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hero we need! However, this answer is 0.93 to 1.02 AUs (the distance to earth). Are we sure we are not missing anything? I don't think an astronaut in near earth orbit is in a steady-state temperature-wise, are they?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. No answer so far.  We have &quot;Halfway to Mercury&quot;, &quot;1AU(earth), and &quot;further than the moon&quot;.</p>
<p>People know damn well what he wanted to know but still parrot the same answer everyone else had given already &quot;no air in a vacuum&quot;.</p>
<p>Why don't people read an answer or two before replying (or before reading to repeat the same damned thing)?</p></div>		</li>
