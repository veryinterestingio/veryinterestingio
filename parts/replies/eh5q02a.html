			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad siting is totally an issue for the real weather stations.  A large number are at airports, and suffer from the effects of airplane exhaust or heat from all the paved runways and taxiways.  I read an article about a meteorologist who was trying to inspect and correct individual weather stations around the US.  Wish I could find and link it here.</p>
<p>I did find one about DCA weather station being a terrible choice for the official DC temperature. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/should-reagan-national-remain-dcs-official-weather-station/2012/08/16/ca1f4e70-e7aa-11e1-936a-b801f1abab19_blog.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cef685430320" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/should-reagan-national-remain-dcs-official-weather-station/2012/08/16/ca1f4e70-e7aa-11e1-936a-b801f1abab19_blog.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cef685430320</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't your cited article contradict that?</p>
<p>&quot;He said, in reality, DCA’s temperature sensor, has long been sited on a grassy surface and sheltered.</p>
<p>'We do a weekly comparison with a digital thermometer on the roof [of the airport] in a shaded area and they’re always comparable,' he said. '[Our] system has safeguards built in to make sure we’re not measuring some jet blast or something out of the ordinary - it’s as accurate it can be.'&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it’s not the article I was looking for. Smaller airports seem to be the bigger problem. But it does show that there are more issues beyond instrument calibration in weather reporting. </p>
<p>This isn’t the article either, but here is a guy fighting for proper siting. He seems
to have an anti-global warming agenda though. Nevertheless his criticisms of the weather stations are not being laughed off.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, humidity used to be measured in Canada with hair. Typically straight blonde hair worked best.  The hair would lengthen or contract depending on humidity and would be attached to a pen that wrote on a rotating cylinder.</p>
<p>Now we are using electronic instruments. The temperature sensors in the field are compared against travelling standards, which are compared against regional standards, which is compared against a Canadian standard, which eventually gets back to the world standard.</p>
<p>A similar thing is done with the pressure sensors.</p>
<p>All are NIST traceable back to the source.</p></div>		</li>
