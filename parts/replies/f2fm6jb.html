			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that comparison is more accurate than you think.  You know how there are builds and guides in video games that are min-maxed to the nth degree and they end up catching on with the entire community and everything else is trash even though most of them won't really see the benefit because they haven't mastered the fundamentals?  That's what creatine is.  It's for the people advanced enough to min-max.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh. I tried out Final Fantasy 14 MMO, and was reading some beginner guides. Choosing your race was essentially meaningless. It's just for variety and flavor. Gave zero bonuses until you hit max level, and had leveled a very specific way for one class, and used certain gear. And even then, it worked out to a few percentage difference. Less than 5%. And that small a percentage relied on perfect timing, and doing attack routines in a certain order, aka Skill. So unless you were perfect all the time, it was a zero advantage.</p>
<p>Creatine!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more like a 1.1x than a +1 in stamina. You take it when you are weak, you lift 1 lbs more, you take it when you are strong, you lift 3 lbs more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Not because it's in any way related to creatine or lifting, but because it's actual magic. Like it's an actual, honest to god, electric DC motor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just from a subjective standpoint but from what I see....definitely. A few weeks after I started to take creatine, my muscles got noticeably bulkier and people started commenting on them.</p>
<p>A few weeks of working out does not produce such results from what I gather. So...I think it definitely makes you look bigger.</p></div>		</li>
