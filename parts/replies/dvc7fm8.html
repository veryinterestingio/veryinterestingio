			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! I was reading an article about either chimps or gorillas (I forget which) and it was saying that when having a dalliance, lower ranking females had to be quiet. Otherwise the higher ranking females will come pull her off &quot;the rod&quot; and beat her ass for stealing their man. Which made me wonder if moaning during sex was an across-the-board simian trait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a little dumb, and I had no idea where I read/heard it (long while ago), but someone threw out the idea that females moaning during sex was a way to signal to the males around her that she was sexually available, meaning that she can maximize her chances of getting pregnant by attracting more males to her with her moans. </p>
<p>I see that it's the complete opposite of the idea you threw out as well, and I'm not sure how our ancestors liked--interfering with who has sex and when or sex free-for-all &quot;get me pregnant please&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that was thrown out as an example of why r/theredpill was a shit show of a subreddit. Some guy saying that ‘the whore’s moans were to attract other men... etc etc’</p>
<p>At least that’s where I saw it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I bet this hypothesis [edit: 1] is testable via simulation.</p>
<p>[1] Specifically, the hypothesis that orgasmic vocalizations can act as a signal to other sexually viable partners.</p>
<p>edit 2: I can't believe I missed my chance to make the pun &quot;testable by <em>st</em>imulation&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked around for the original article I read, but it's been more than six months and I have no idea where I found it. Here are some interesting articles I found in my search today.</p>
<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2011-03-primate-bonobos-noise-high-partners.html" target="_blank">https://phys.org/news/2011-03-primate-bonobos-noise-high-partners.html</a> </p>
<p>This was interesting. If it parlays directly into the human experience, it may be a way human females once padded the self esteem of their partners. &quot;Oh my god, your dick is amazing!&quot; I've never met a guy who didn't like hearing that. (Kind of the same way &quot;You're so tight&quot; gives an ego boost to women.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3826206/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3826206/</a></p>
<p>This isn't the original article, but they discuss what I was talking about in point 4: Competition Over Mating.</p>
<p>Earlier in this article it's stated that the amount of offspring you produce increases your rank, so it makes sense why the more dominant females would interrupt another couple.</p>
<p>The keywords I used to find this were lower ranking female apes sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could very well be. I'm a quiet person, and this carries onto my personal interactions. I've had to explain to a woman once that she was doing a fantastic job and I just never felt the need to vocalize my pleasure. My wife has even expressed that she would like a little more output from me. I try to throw in some moans and other pleasure noises for her benefit. </p>
<p>I 100% refuse to do the whole grunt/grrrwwwoooohhhhhyeeeeaaahhhhh at orgasm though. That mine and I'll be silent if I damn well please. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a woman, moans and other pleasure noises are super sexy—honestly sometimes it’s almost hotter to <em>listen</em> to porn than watch it sometimes. I hate the gorilla-grunt tiger-roar Harley-Davidson kinda shit you hear in most porn though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.  Also, as a gay dude, I can't stand bottoms whimpering like a woman in gay porn.  Complete turn off.  Give me the guttural and real grunts and moans that come from it, but don't give me that fake woman-sounding garbage that women only fake for porn in the first place.   Can't stand the forced verbal, either.  If it comes naturally that's hot, but an instant turn off when it sounds forced.</p></div>		</li>
