<p>Is there some kind of &quot;chemistry of food&quot; book out there? I have a lot of questions about food when i cook, but i can't think of any at the moment. (Other than: what allows Jackie Chan to make spaghetti by pulling on dough like he does in that video of him making spaghetti by folding and pulling on a basketball of dough. But don't worry about it. I'm sure its just &quot;dough -&gt; gluten -&gt; smallest surface area=cylinder -&gt; spaghetti!&quot;.).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anything by Hervé This, as French physical chemist who wrote extensively on the chemistry of cooking for a lay audience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try checking out “on food and cooking“ by Harold McGee. It’s one of my favourite books, all kinds of questions and answers about why things happen to different foods in different situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of them! Food science is an ever growing discipline. I liked Cooking for Geeks, but it’s definitely for a nerdy audience. America’s test kitchen is a typical cooking show/magazine/website, but they’re really good at explaining some of the science behind their recipes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>melting/freezing behavior definitely holds 100% of the time for more than just elements (and even then there’s a pressure dependency). </p>
<p>This is just not a phase change in the same sense. You can freeze an egg and you can thaw it back out by adding heat. It’s only when you get hot enough to change the chemistry of the egg that it doesn’t hold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I know but I deemed that information unnecessary to get my point across. Also didn’t think it would help with the understanding of the person so I left it out. But if you want to go into even more detail feel free. I’m just too lazy. Used up all my “long comment” energy in that one.</p></div>		</li>
