			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add to this. The brain also has ventricles that hold cerebrospinal fluid. If you are dehydrated you can get a head ache because the pressure has changed slightly. Alcohol tends to dehydrate plus the toxins can anger the meninges.
If you know anyone that has had to have a spinal tap they usually have to hydrate and lay very still to avoid a massive headache.
My Spanish teacher in highschool always encouraged us to drink  a glass of water before taking ibuprofen or tylenol in case it was a dehydration headache. If you are a zealous hydro homie likely not a dehydration headache.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's most likely because it was growing very slowly. When a tumor in the brain/around the brain grows at an extremely slow rate, it doesn't get to trigger the nerve endings, they all just ... slowly get used to it (the pressure). It will show symptoms only when it presses on something aahm....important, like the zone that controls movement and such. A faster growing tumor/bleed will, on the other hand, cause headaches.
Edit: some more clarification.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: I might have used a smidge too much weed at the time to notice any other symptoms:D</p></div>		</li>
