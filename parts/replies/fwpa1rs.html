			<div class="markdown"><p>They've developed several saliva tests already, and they're said to be much more accurate than the swabs. Rutgers here in NJ was one of the first to develop them and the state promised they'd be rolling them out &quot;soon&quot;.</p>
<p>They're still doing the swab. I have no idea why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saliva test requires 10 mL to keep type 2 error low. That's an ungodly amount of saliva, especially for the elderly and for people on multiple medications (xerostomia is one of the most common pharmacologic side effects).</p>
<p>In dental school, we were *supposed* to measure salivary flow rate as part of all comprehensive oral examinations by having patients  spit their saliva into a medicine cup over the course of 5 minutes. Allegedly, 1 mL/min is normal. No one actually did this because for most patients, even after 10 minutes, you still didn't have enough saliva to reach the 1 mL mark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The swab are likely inaccurate because of the technique not the method.  Swabbing that deep is incredibly difficult.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because millions of those tests were already produced and distributed, and we're still not doing enough testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The swab test triggers reflexive sneezing and coughing in a substantial number of people being swabbed, which is one reason they wear face shields in addition to masks. So it's not that big of an exposure reduction tbh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think coughing into a bag is a much lower risk than sneezing after a swab test, which a large % of people seem to do.  People administering the test need to have significant PPE already because of the sneeze risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had the test done twice and the first time I sneezed right on to the nurse's face mask, I tried really hard but it was impossible to hold it in. Luckily the tests came back negative both times.</p></div>		</li>
