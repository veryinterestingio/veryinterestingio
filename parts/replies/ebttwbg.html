<p>How does immune protection through breast milk factor in here? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breast milk provides the infant with <em>passive immunity</em>. White blood cells that fight and digest pathogens and antibodies that mark pathogens as foreign are transmitted through the breast milk to the infant to directly interact with and stave off pathogens. This is useful because infants do not have a fully developed immune system that can adequately monitor for pathogens, create antibodies, and dispose of these pathogens with mature immune cells.</p>
<p>Vaccines rely on the body's ability to recognize and react to pathogens independently (active immunity) since they are just safe &quot;simulations&quot; of specific pathogens for the body's defenses to react to and create an ever-growing database of recognizable pathogens. This makes future exposure to these same pathogens less disruptive and unmanageable for the immune system. </p></div>		</li>
