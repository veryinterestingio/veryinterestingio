			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem! The full version of the periodic table looks like <a href="https://www.sciencegeek.net/tables/LongTable2000.png" target="_blank">This</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, the blocks are out of order (Not S, P, D, F, but actually S, F, D, P) because the inner electrons &quot;shield&quot; the outer electrons from the nucleus' positive charge, leading to some of the outer electron's energy levels shifting from their ideal values, which makes the shells fill in a slightly different order than the ideal version predicted by Schrodinger.</p>
<p>There's actually a whole lot of stuff you have to take into account beyond what I wrote down if you really want to get it right: Electron-Electron interactions, charge shielding, spin-orbit coupling (fine structure), nuclear spin-orbit interactions (hyperfine structure), special relativity, etc.</p>
<p>It turns out the only element we can get the exact solution I described is Hydrogen! Everything else takes that and adds layers of corrections to account for all those other interactions and get a pretty good approximation.</p></div>		</li>
