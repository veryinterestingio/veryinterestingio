			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I've found my brain likes weed. I almost never get frustrated if I've smoked recently. An example of this is the other day I knocked over a plant and the dirt went everywhere, I had just smoked so instead of freaking out I took my time, grabbed a dustpan and broom and cleaned it up. If I hadn't smoked I probably would have complained and bitched while I cleaned and it would have put a damper on my morning. Another thing it does to me is breakdown my shyness. I used to dread presentations and any public speaking but I started to smoke just a little bit before and my weird concerns of being judged by my peers vanished. I dont mean get stupid high and do a presentation but rather just enough to give me some extra confidence. </p>

<p>My brother on the other hand takes 1 hit, thinks his heart is not working properly and tries to call himself an ambulance. Its crazy how different an experience people can have with the same drugs/medication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was pretty certain it was a &quot;bad&quot; drug until I used it and did more research. I remember in Health class it was taught as a gateway drug to harder/more dangerous drugs. I imagine a lot of other people were taught the same and look down on those who smoke it which is a shame really because I'm sure plenty of those same people could benefit from it in some way.</p>
<p>But again its not for everyone.</p>
<p>Its legal in my state and its not uncommon to see billboards advertising different dispensaries on the side of the highway, what a time to be alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it! It is ingrained into our thought processes by millions of years of evolution. Think about it: your goal as a human was, for most of our history as a species, to make copies of yourself. Of course someone else needs to help you with that. Unfortunately, thoughts like &quot;self-consciousness&quot; and &quot;fitting in&quot; and &quot;what if things go wrong&quot; tend to be obstacles that prevent you from approaching that person. Therefore, over time, evolution rewards people who have brains that adjust accordingly (i.e., they partially turn off) when they see a potentially attractive partner. Unfortunately, you and I and everyone else on Reddit are the result of this miserable multi-generational process!</p>
<p>EDIT: I should follow up by mentioning that the magnitude of the effect goes way down with age in most of us, and by the time you are in your mid-twenties you will usually retain most of your mental faculties around your crushes (yes, you still get crushes in adulthood; at least I do).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, what should a person do under such situation and is there a way to be rational about it at all?
Edit: cool cool. Thanks for explaining this thoroughly. Atleast now I have some better understanding about this.</p></div>		</li>
