			<div class="markdown"><p>But, wherever we leave mostly in the cities, they are also far away from large water bodies. You can find many districts which don't have large water bodies like lakes, rivers or ponds (that's what I understand from large water bodies, correct me if I'm wrong). Then how is the heat retained in these areas?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll not am expert but, in short, it isn’t. The farther from a body of water a place is, the farther from proper water cycles a place is, the more extreme the weather will be.</p>
<p>HVAC is a convenience that allows is to simply not consider the way he climate <em>actually</em> functions in an area unless we deliberately choose to do so. There is also the heat island effect from tons of black pavement absorbing heat, as well as tons of carbon dioxide emitted by cars that keeps the heat.</p>
<p>But, in general, being far from large bodies of water is a major reason why deserts are so extreme.</p></div>		</li>
