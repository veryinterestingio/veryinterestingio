			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true. At the south of Madrid, Spain, there used to be gravel quarries a few decades ago, next to the Jarama river. When the quarries stopped being profitable, they were abandoned, and they eventually filled up with water (despite not being connected to the river!). They are basically artificial lakes, and are now protected because they are a refuge to many animals, mainly birds :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This always seems like a recipe for disaster. Many quarry lakes are extremely steep and basically have no shore. Not usually wide enough for boating either, and no fish unless someone stocks the lake.</p>
<p>So basically, it's only good for swimming. The super deep, sheer cliff lake. Anyone who isn't a strong swimmer could easily drown. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So could making, say, a mountain top reservoir cause a spring or mudlside at lower elevation? By creating resistance in this sort of sponge, atop the water table, I assume that would cause higher saturation towards the edges?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A mountaintop reservoir would have an aquitard below it keeping it from flowing through the underlying soul and into the water table. It would lose water mostly by evaporation, which would get faster as the reservoir gained more exposed area. That's how it would stay in equilibrium without underground seepage or overtopping.</p>
<p>However, springs are related to the water table: they are places where the water table intercepts the ground surface. Water therefore comes out of the ground instead of water going into the ground. The water will also carry sediment, which is why &quot;spring sapping&quot; slowly carves a channel backward from where a spring occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's also very common for reservoirs being filled for the first time have landslides around their shores as the water table rises and saturates previously stable dirt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how Rattlesnake Lake in Washington State was formed – they damned a river up on the hillside above a valley to create Chester Morse Lake. But the hillside was permeable, so this reservoir/lake caused a great deal of water to seep underground and fill the valley below, creating a lake where once the town of Moncton had been. And now it’s called Rattlesnake Lake.</p></div>		</li>
