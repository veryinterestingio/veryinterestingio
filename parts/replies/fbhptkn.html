			<div class="markdown"><p>Maintaining steady speed is pretty efficient.  It would need more power in short bursts to support acceleration.  </p>
<p>Also I am assuming that is a tennis court of direct sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to requiring more power during acceleration than at steady speed, but most electric cars also use regenerative braking to recover at least a portion of that power during braking, so I bet it averages out to be not that much more overall.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Tesla initially reported the total output in the P85D as the arithmetic addition of the maximum power of the individual electric motors at 691 hp (515 kW) but later reported it as 463 hp (345 kW) because the two motors do not give their maximum power at the same time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tennis court is 195.7 sq meters</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the Earth's surface, the energy density is reduced to approximately 1,000 W/m2 for a surface perpendicular to the <strong>Sun's</strong> rays at sea level on a clear day. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>20% efficiency you are looking at 200W/m2 or 0.2 kW</p>
<p>195.7 * 0.2 you are looking at 39.14 KW </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You’re wasting land</strong>. Not only do you have to worry about row shading from north/south, duel axis trackers must also worry about east/west spacing. Instead of utilizing 40% of the land with a single axis tracker system, you’re only using 1/9th of land. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So single axis is looking at 40% utilization</p>
<p>39.14*0.4 = 15.656 kW power produced by a singles tennis court of single axis tracking solar panels with full sun on a clear day. Whereas the engines are pulling 345 kW when pulling power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks I get close to your result with the stats from some specs I looked up:  </p>
<p>85kWh = total battery capacity<br />
300 miles = capable distance traveling at 55mph  </p>
<p>85kWh ÷ (300miles ÷ 55mph) = 15.583333 kW </p>

<p>It's almost as if I did the math before posting that.  ;)  Anyway thanks for posting the details I was too lazy to include.</p></div>		</li>
