			<div class="markdown"><p>I think for comparing the strength of electromagnetism and gravity it suffices to look at the ratio of gravitational to coulomb force on two 1 kg, 1 C point particles placed 1 m apart. The electrostatic repulsion will be about 1.3 * 10^(20) times stronger than the gravitational attraction between them. Or to put it another way, these particles would each need to have a mass of 11.6 million metric tons in order to balance the electrostatic repulsion with gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is quite arbitrary. The distance doesn't matter, as both forces vary as 1/r\^2. The mass only affects the gravitational force, and the charge only the electric force, so I could just as easily have made the two objects 1.69*10\^40 kgs, and 1 C, and then it would be the gravitational force that's 1.3 * 10\^20 times stronger.</p>
<p>The reason that the electric force is stronger is because if you look at the smallest unit of charge -- the single charged particle (a proton for instance) and you look at the smallest particle with mass (let's use proton or electron, for fair comparison with electric force), you will find the electric force will dominate.</p></div>		</li>
