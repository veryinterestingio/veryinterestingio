			<div class="markdown"><p>They absorb heat from the sun, and electrical systems produce waste heat. The latter is part of the heat that is pumped to the radiators. The former is not going to beat the radiators' attempts at cooling because fluid is not being pumped through the panels to heat the station; instead the panels just get hotter and slowly conduct their heat through to the rest of the vessel. But the constant efforts of the pumps and radiators maintain that as a temperature gradient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's not a &quot;boil&quot; in the context we're used to. Boiling by definition requires the liquid to reach the boiling temperature (which, yes, varies with pressure). Since very few people have any experience with a vacuum, we equate boiling with high temps rather than low pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Spontaneously evaporates&quot; is probably easier for people to understand, since the concept of evaporation is familiar, and is accurate enough for non-physicists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you can calculate the equilibrium temperature based on the star's mass, the distance from the star, and the &quot;Bond albedo&quot;. If using a planet-temperature-calculator, set &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; to 0.</p>
<p>Bond albedo affects the answer a lot. For an object near Earth:</p>

<p>Note that an object that reflects 100% of input radiation has an equilibrium of &quot;absolute zero&quot;. Such an object is impossible, of course - and even if it was, it would never reach equilibrium since it wouldn't be able to emit it's initial heat.</p>
<p>Liquid water is highly absorptive has an albedo of about 10%. Water ice/clouds are highly reflective and has an albedo of about 90%. Of course, these assume that water is capable of persisting in those phases.</p>
<p>Rocks of various types can range from 5%-45%. Gas giants have albedos of 40-%50%. Venus, with its Sulfuric acid, has an albedo of 75% (which would lead to a temperature of -35°C at that radius, if not for the greenhouse effect). Small objects in the outer-system are mostly ice, so 90%.</p>
<p>Note that, for small bodies, there is a very sharp cutoff between &quot;mostly rock&quot; (requires high temperature to start, and the low albedo causes equilibrium temperature to rise) and &quot;mostly ice&quot; (requires low temperature to start, and high albedo causes equilibrium temperature to fall). So borderline objects tend to be trapped as one or the other.</p></div>		</li>
