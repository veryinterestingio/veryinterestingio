<p>The rest is statistics.  We can estimate the probability of success by computing (# of successes in the sample)/(Sample Size).  We can control for covariates with an appropriate regression method (e.g. Surgery is 40% successful for me, but 60% successful for women).</p>

<p><em>Regression</em> is the problem of estimating a continuous value (e.g., success rate) given some input variables.  So this problem is always regression.  <em>Controlling for</em> is a technical term related to causal models meaning to bin data according to measurements.  Unless you're building a causal model, then &quot;gender&quot; e.g. is just an input to the regression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh, I've seen &quot;controlling for&quot; used in statistical literature.  Under the right conditions, regression can be used to model causal pathways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, that makes sense because causal models are part of the statistical literature.  When you infer a continuous variable with a causal model that is an example of regression.</p></div>		</li>
