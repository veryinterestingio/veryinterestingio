			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. If you were to exercise those muscles it would just improve the efficiency of the lense focusing. Your ciliary muscles would pull that lense to the correct focusing level faster. Not necessarily better vision but more efficient.
Hope that helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was young and getting my first glasses I didn't know consciously focusing the lenses was possible, and my eyes would do it seemingly on their own sometimes. I told my Dr what was happening and he told me in the meanest tone that that was impossible. I didn't realize till a few years later what was actually happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Being short-sighted, far-sighted, or having astigmatism is because the shape of your eye or your cornea is wrong. Using the muscles in your eyes more doesn't change the shape of your eye. Other factors can also influence vision quality but they're also unrelated to the muscles.</p>
<p>The only &quot;exercise&quot; your eyes need is just from looking at things throughout the day that are different distances. If you work at a computer all day, take regular breaks to focus on something else for a few minutes. If you get eyestrain or have dry eyes or something like that, simple eye exercises might relieve those things, but they won't make your vision better, and they definitely won't improve vision in people with eye diseases like cataracts, macular degeneration, or glaucoma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know how if you close one eye it changes the perspective of what your looking at? For example your nose...close your left eye and your nose is on the left. Close the right eye and your nose is on the right. But when you have both eyes open, your nose is on both sides, and the middle, and transparent. </p>
<p>Now, the same way you make your nose transparent, you can “look through” anything by relaxing your eyes and splitting the image into two. </p>
<p>I want to know what’s going on there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. If you're &quot;near-sighted&quot; the refractive error can actually be beneficial to you close up. Say if your prescription is -1,50 in both eyes and you aren't wearing glasses it would have the same effect as if an emmetropic (0,00) person wore a pair of +1,50 glasses.</p>
<p>Depends on what your prescriptions are, since a toric correction in contact lenses might make focus in general a bit harder, but they shouldn't otherwise make you need to focus harder than a pair of spectacles. The main issue would be the extra irritation and dryness that comes from using contacts paired with the same problems from extended screen or reading work. It's also possible your contact lenses are relatively &quot;stronger&quot; than your spectacles, and it will almost always be the case that they are stronger or weaker than ideal. Prescriptions come in steps of 0,25 however because the lenses are sitting directly on your eye their strength may need to be adjusted since now the vertex distance equals zero. The compensation for relatively low/normal strength prescriptions however is often under the 0,25 step mark and based on what works best for you you'll often get no adjustment or a minor adjustment towards whichever direction you experience as more optimal.</p></div>		</li>
