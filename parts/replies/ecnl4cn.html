			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of your brain's computing power is not spent on conscious thought.  It takes an enormous section of your brain and energy just to process the signals coming from your optic nerve, for example.  Same with sounds, smells, touch, etc.  Regulating your digestive system, pumping your heart and making sure you breathe at the right rate, understanding and producing speech, all of that is actually pretty computationally expensive.  Solving a hard math problem at the same time doesn't increase total energy spent nearly as much as you would think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How accurate are BMR calculators online? I'm 5'10&quot;, 178 pounds, age 23 and it says my BMR is like 1600-1800. On my calories spreadsheet I put 1500 just to under-estimate, and my physical results show me losing weight at a slower pace than my spreadsheet. I am suspicious that it might be my BMR</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK the calculators that you get online are averaged for age, sex, height, weight etc. So I don't think they're very accurate (happy to be corrected if someone knows more). People differ according to their heart rates, breathing rate, muscle composition, even things like how much you fidget (which affects calorie burn but you wouldn't consider it as either BMR or exercise) so there'll likely be a decent margin of error there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the most accurate calculation for BMR involves measuring your BMI. Online calculators/apps/etc... are all just a ballpark figure.</p>
<p>I used Fitbit to calculate my BMR (ballparked) and used that as a baseline. Added my workouts, which it also calculated a ballpark calorie burn from those, and food consumed (which is a bit more accurate) and aimed for 1000 calorie deficit per day (fitbit set to the hardest mode or whatever it's called) which amounted to about 2lbs a week. I also rounded down calorie burns and up on consumption so that if I were off in my estimates then it would be in the direction I wanted to go. I lost around 75lbs in a little over 6months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re not accurate at all.  Your method of eating X amount of calories and determining how fast you’re losing weight is the best way to determine your BMR</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body needs fuel called calories to function. If you were to be a lazy shite all day and lie in bed doing nothing, your body would need a baseline amount of calories for you to survive. This is called your BMR, or base metabolic rate. Brain functions are already included in your BMR.  </p>
<p>Calculators online usually tell you your daily required calories, which takes your BMR and adds calories for other tasks like walking around or being a productive member of society. </p></div>		</li>
