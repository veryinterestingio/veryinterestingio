			<div class="markdown"><p>The word Dimethicone now leaps out at me for entirely different reasons..</p>
<p>It's a form of liquid silicone.<br />
Lots of new baking pans (er, and sex toys) are made of silicone. Cured silicone is amazing; as versatile as rubber but with better heat resistance, less chemical smell and less likely to leave chemicals behind in your food (or, uh).</p>
<p>But liquid silicone can react with cured silicone, making it expand, warp, and go soft and gooey. And sometimes it feels like CSI trying to figure out what is screwing up your toys!<br />
Dimethicone. In conditioner, in hand soap, in hand lotion. (and in lube! Even lube that claims it's water-based!) Dammit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I battled with the hunt for a good shampoo/conditioner for my curly, fine, frizzy, full head of hair.  I splurged and bought the moisturizing joico in the blue bottle and it left the nacknof my head greasy and sticky. I had to use a clay mask to strip it.  I have to wash every day or my scalp gets dry and itchy and my hair looks hella greasy.    I had really good luck with IOS shampoo and conditioner with a monthly deep condition woth the blue joico.  And doves scalp care shampoo as needed.  It's literally the only  shampoo I've used that doesn't eventually fuck my hair up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with avoiding dimethicone and other silicones.  The silicone covers the strands of your hair and essentially creates an impenetrable fortress.  It makes your hair feel silky smooth by not allowing any moisture to escape.  But when your scalp starts creating its natural oils, the silicone won't let the oils into the strands of hair, so the oils just sit on your scalp, giving you that greasy feeling.  The silicones only wash away with sulfates, which also strip away your natural oils.</p></div>		</li>
