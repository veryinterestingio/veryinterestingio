			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it had weird people that were super dorks and liked to share their knowledge with other super dorks. They liked to provide well researched annotations for further learning. Now we have memes on facebook and people who don't understand what the internet was actually built for :/</p>
<p>I think there are several generations of the internet. Government researchers, then University researchers, then University students and those that were heavy into tech, then laypeople who were super dorky (not in a I watch Star Wars dorky way that is popular now), then less dorky but still PC people like early PC gamers, and then a long chasm until smartphones. Then every jackass that had a phone was now on the internet. Think of the stupidest person you know. They are now on the internet. 30 years ago you had to know a lot just to connect to the internet and were considered basement dwelling dork. </p>
<p>The internet used to be really fucking awesome. And now its youtube stars who are children making $26M and bullshit comments like this. </p>
<p>Know your fucking history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I meant formatting/HTML. </p>
<p>I remember early internet. Some things were great. Anonymity was possible. Ads were fairly harmless. Also, search sucked, video/audio/non-shitty pics were almost nonexistent. My first modem was 14.4kbps. Not a pioneer but I've seen some shit (and waited hours for it).</p></div>		</li>
