			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that’s a fair statement. The dark matter halo is much more massive than all the stars and gas in this galaxy, though it’s more diffuse. If the dark matter disappeared the galaxy wouldn’t just evaporate, in the centre especially the ordinary matter dominates gravitationally. At the outskirts though we might lose some stuff!</p>
<p>The DM certainly helped our galaxy to form in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
