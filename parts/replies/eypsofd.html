			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people are mentioning previous designs. Are these designs in journals or made public? Can I view the post-mortem for the Tube for example?  Or is it simply a matter or company 'institutional knowledge'?  To which I would ask, how many subways has a single company ever built?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a few things going on here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Professional Organizations. In the UK they have the Institution of Civil Engineers. I mention them specifically as they were the first such professional organization formed in the world, almost 200 years ago at the dawn of the industrial revolution. Many other industrializing countries either opened their own chapters or started their own similar bodies. The goals of it were/are to promote the profession, set standards for the profession and build and develop knowledge for the profession. Since it’s inception it has managed publications to share research and experience with the profession as a whole. Today they run a couple dozen specialized monthly/quarterly publications specific to a range of civil and structural engineering disciplines. In several countries (UK included) these organizations also manage professional qualifications unlike the US where States manage them), so they’re fairly heavily integrated into the practice of the profession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Institutional knowledge (within companies) many companies that do these huge projects can trace an ownership path through mergers and split offs back to pioneering companies during the industrial revolution. The name on the door may have changed a few times but there has often been a continuous chain of people going back to the the earliest such projects, with a huge body of lessons learned along the way. On any big project you will have a people ranging from someone with decades of experience providing oversight, who got that experience working under another person with decades of experience who got their experience in a similar fashion etc etc etc. then there will be folks with 20, 15, 10, 5 and 0 years of experience, each is being mentored (officially or not) by the folks above them to ensure continuous development of knowledge in the upcoming generations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mistakes. There have been plenty of mistakes/lessons learned. Whenever there is a big one, and they are noticed as they become apparent when something very large falls down, it is investigated. If the failure was due to something that should have been known about before it gets published to hopefully nobody else will make the same mistake. When the failure is due to a previously unknown effect (and this happens) it is <strong>REALLY</strong> published in the profession. For example when the Northridge earthquake hit the US about 20 years ago it caused a lot of unexpected damage, that damage was investigated why, FEMA (IIRC) put out a report on it, then FEMA and the ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers, the US version of the UKs ICE) developed ways to prevent the same issues from happening and put together design guidelines, working with the AISC (Steel code), ACI (American Concrete Institution) and other similar bodies to develop material specific guidelines, and then these were later formalized into building codes and published design guidelines. The people who work at each of these are generally very senior practicing professionals at engineering companies who often essentially donate their time to the respective organization. Each organization also has routes for younger and less experienced people to participate in developing and spreading knowledge, to ensure a future generation of leadership. Most companies actively encourage their engineers at all levels to be involved in these organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Codes: These are intended to set standards and design methods based on academic research and past lessons learned. Engineers use these every single day when designing their projects. These are both the start and the end of the process these days. Junior engineers will stat out designing directly from the Codes, every day, working from the knowledge built up over a couple of centuries. But every project is different and there is always something new, so you very much need experienced people working on the project to provide guidance and interpretation of the code to unique circumstances - so while the Code represents the cumulative knowledge (barring the cutting edge) it is also just a starting point for every new project. It is a minimum, but that needs to be developed from, and gets regularly updated as experience and research progresses.</p>
</li>
<li>Patents: Civil/Structural engineering is possibly less patent trigger happy than many engineering fields. There are parents, but probably far fewer than there could be. Patents allow an individual or company to invest (considerable) time and research into a new technique/technology and then be able to profit off it for a limited time. The deal is they publish what they did and how to do it, so he method isn’t lost and so nobody has to invent it a second time. They get a couple decades of exclusive use of it and then everyone else can do the same for free. It’s an important route for getting cutting edge information into the field as a whole.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They typically aren't made public because of the security risk. It's like knowing the network architecture of 911 services; if you know everything about some building, you know the best ways to cause the most damage if you decided to bomb the place or stage a robbery.</p>
<p>Some places they may not care as much. You can go to your local town hall and ask what they can show you, but they may not allow you to see anything. In my line of work, when we receive documents like this, we are obligated to keep them secure and only use them as part of our contract with the client.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that these archives are also vitally important for any future work to be done. Finding a buried pipe where you don't expect it can easily cause costs to balloon. As such, these are usually kept in fancy fireproof vaults and backed up off-site.</p></div>		</li>
