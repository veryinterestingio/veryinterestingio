			<div class="markdown"><p>None, but your confusion stems from not being able to read a log-scale on a graph. If you divide the scale into equal intervals, each interval corresponds to the same order of magnitude difference. In this case, each interval is a 1000 times difference.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/qmzX1Wq" target="_blank">Here</a> is an annotation on the same graph.</p>
<p>The blue line is halfway between 1 kg and 1000 kg, but it indicates about 31 kg, not 500. The graph doesn't say that the birds weigh close to 1000kg, just that their weight (ostrich, 150kg) is much closer to 1000 kg in orders of magnitude than to 1 kg.</p>
<p>Hope that helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None in real life, and none are plotted in this graph. This is a log scale with 10^3 kg steps between. So equidistantly between those two points should be steps for 10 kg and 100 kg. This lands in the 100 kg region. An easy example is an ostrich, which is fast AF. </p>
<p>E: Speed is also plotted in a log scale. so it's not quite 100 kmh</p></div>		</li>
