			<div class="markdown"><p>But invisalign doesn't attach at all and doesn't have any squares.. </p>
<p>My guess is they had braces before that caused the squares.</p>
<p>Edit: Well I was plain wrong, they do attach a couple of brackets to hold the brace in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with Invisalign and an orthodontist for a few years and actually some patients (but not all) do require attachments for Invisalign (which are small shapes made of braces glue) that are placed on the enamel to help grab special attachment shaped areas in the tray to help rotate certain teeth. </p>
<p>The glue is removed the same way as braces glue (either with a specialized tool  called “an adhesive removing plier” that flakes the glue off, or a dentist drill that has a special bur that pretty much sands it off to the enamel). Then a polishing bur gets put on to smooth out any remaining roughness from the first bur.</p></div>		</li>
