			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, the best mirrors we have reflect about 99.999% of light, but only some wavelengths (as in, they're specialized). A lab-grade mirror might reflect 99.9%, while your bathroom mirror is probably 80-90%. </p>
<p>Take a 10m x 10m room and lab-grade mirrors. Light would cross the room 30 000 000 times per second. After a microsecond, you'd have 1/10^-14 times the amount of light, aka 0.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yup, millisecond, not microsecond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I double checked your math, and I think that you meant to say millisecond instead of microsecond. If I understand correctly, in one microsecond the light would be reflected 30 times, effectively reducing it from 100% brightness to 97% brightness.</p>
<p>You're right that after a millisecond it's effectively been fully absorbed by the mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We need a bigger room then, and many, many, many mirrors. </p>
<p>On second thought, a 1km room is only ten times bigger, so light will dissappear pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not quite.  Light would hit a mirror about 30e6 times per second, so after a microsecond it would hit a mirror about 30 times. you'd have 0.999\^30=0.97 -&gt; 97% of the light.  I think you meant a millisecond, at which point you'd have a 1e-13 of the light left, which is about right. (note that there are some assumptions here about the angle of the light's travel , and the bounce rate might be as much as 73% higher than listed here)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually how a technique called 'cavity ringdown spectroscopy' works- a laser is beamed into a mirrored compartment then shut off, and the time it takes for the light to die away is measured. It's used to measure trace gases that absorb light and change this 'ringdown' time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Semi-Related Question:   If an object is in space there is nothing around it to pass heat to, how does the object cool down?  Infrared cameras are picking up the emitted heat, right?   Do all warm objects constantly emit light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, all objects are constantly emitting light. Look up black body radiation! And yes, objects in a vacuum can only cool down by radiative heat transfer, which is why cooling is generally a bigger problem than heating on spacecraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All objects emit light, and warm objects emit more light than cold objects. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black-body radiation</a>. The particles of a body are continually colliding with each other, and the accelerations of charged particles implies that electromagnetic radiation will be produced. This effectively carries heat energy away from the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 ways to transmit heat: Convection, Conduction, and Radiation.</p>
<p>Convection is the heat transfer you are thinking off here. An object with lots of energy transfers that energy to another object nearby (like an air molecule), and that secondary object physically moves away.<br />
Conduction is the same thing, but with objects in physical contact. An example of this would be where you heat up a pan, and the handle of the pan also heats up. Energy transfers through the object, and all objects connected.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, neither of these 2 methods work in space.</p>
<p>The third system does work in space: Radiation.<br />
Radiation is where energy physically radiates away from an object with energy, in the form of electromagnetic radiation (light).<br />
This is how, for example, heat travels from the Sun to our planet, and provides us with heat.</p></div>		</li>
