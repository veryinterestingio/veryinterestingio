<p>RPG gamers took this term from the military, where a campagn is a series of battles.</p>

<p>That isn't where they took this term from.</p>
<p>Table top RPGs evolved from military simulation games that were played on table tops also known as miniature wargames. They were used to help train military officers.</p>

<p>Since as you said, a campaign is a series of battles, in wargaming was used by the military in the past, they called a series of wargaming battles as campaigns. Since then the name just stuck and carried over to tabletop RPGs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, I think he's saying that War Gaming made a series of battles (often recreations of old battles) a 'campaign'. The military (playing war games) then used that in Military History (famous generals and their Campaigns). As war games evolved into other types of games, we kept the terminology that was already there.</p>
<p>I think that's what he said. But I don't know the etymology of the word Campaign. It sounds French, so I would guess it's French Military History Authors using a gaming term, in his eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>The issue is the way the OP had implied how the term came to be was that RPGs were in no way related to Wargames or evolved from wargames and thus decided to take a word and use it to define something new.</p>
<p>This is more like the term and definition already existed for tabletop wargaming, you are evolving wargaming and thus terms wouldn't have changed.</p></div>		</li>
