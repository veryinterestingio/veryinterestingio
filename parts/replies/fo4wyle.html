			<div class="markdown"><p>No sir, but when you do - you won’t even be able to tell you went by looking at the toilet water after - and my friend that in itself is a sign that your body is emanating with joy. </p>
<p>It’ll continue to thank you for your due diligence by providing you with clearer healthier skin, increased feelings of wakefulness &amp; mental clarity, and you should begin to notice subtle transformations in your body as you fend off unwanted weight. I’m not exaggerating one bit by saying it’s one of the splendors in life! </p>
<p>I drink around a gallon a day and have been for probably 5-7 years now. I’m now hypersensitive to even the smallest inkling of dehydration because boy do I feel it. It hits me like a truck, I feel god awful - like 20% of my hydrated self when I haven’t drank enough water. </p>
<p>I go to sleep with a 32oz tumbler on my bed stand and by the time I brush my teeth in the morning there’s nothing left. I don’t go anywhere without that tumbler, because the minute I start to dip down below optimal hydration my brain starts having a temper tantrum like a 5 year old until it gets what it wants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drink 4-6 liters a day just from having water when I'm thirsty, but its still just going to the bathroom every few hours, really not that inconvenient.</p>
<p>Get terrible headaches though if I don't drink enough water.</p></div>		</li>
