<p>Visceral fat is body fat that is stored within the abdominal cavity and is therefore stored around a number of important internal organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines. ... Storing higher amounts of visceral fat is associated with increased risks of a number of health problems including type 2 diabetes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that, although sumo wrestlers have a lot of subcutaneous fat, they have very little visceral fat due to the amount of exercise they get. They tend to gain more visceral fat after retirement, which leads to health problems.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm not an expert on this subject, so take this with a grain of salt. <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/can-you-be-both-obese-and-healthy/" target="_blank">I found an article on the subject</a> that suggests that, while it may be possible for an obese person to be metabolically healthy, obesity causes other health problems that can cause such individuals to have shorter lives. Stay healthy everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always loved the paper towel analogy; Every sheet of paper represents a 10th of a kg/pound.</p>
<p>At first; You can remove 10 sheets of paper, and you barely see a difference in the size of the roll (the roll is big, so 10 sheets is maybe 3 circumferences).</p>
<p>As you get down to the end; Those same 10 sheets can shrink the size of the roll in half (each sheet nearly goes completely around the roll).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The same is true when losing weight! Losing a pound of fat takes a deficit of 3500-4500kcal whether you're 300 pounds, or 150. But the difference in looks from that pound will be insane between the two!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My biggest advice for weight loss as someone who was once obese: stop weighing yourself. If you make real, lasting dietary and lifestyle change, the weight will take care of itself in due time. Repeatedly checking on it can be very discouraging when you see little or no change and cause you to get frustrated and slip into old habits. Trust the process and the weight is going to come off regardless of you checking on it or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The carbon dioxide you are storing as fat was already in the system. It is important to keep the fossil fuels under ground, since they are not yet part of that system and will get into the atmosphere as carbon-dioxide, hence fuel the climate crisis, when burned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body breaks fat down into smaller and incrementally more oxidized byproducts to produce energy. This process is known as Beta oxidation, and it takes place inside the mitochondria. Eventually, it breaks the fat molecule down into the smallest and most oxidized byproduct: carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide then exits the cell and diffuses into our blood. We then exchange it with oxygen in the lungs, and breathe it out.</p>
<p>The point is: when you lose weight, where does the weight go? You breathe it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you took a 1lb pack of cheese slices and laid them all over your belly and butt and upper arms, that is basically what 1lb looks like when you gain or lose it. It's a tiny little film under your skin. I can &quot;gain&quot; a pound overnight by not pooping or eating something salty. You can't let yourself get too upset or too excited over a single pound. But, losing 1lb every week from New Year's to Easter is like 14 pounds! You should be excited about that.</p></div>		</li>
