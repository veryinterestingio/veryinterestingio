			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call it a 'consent process' for a legally marketed product; it's extremely different than the consent signed during a clinical trial.  But to your point, one major aspect is subject rights, which are extensive.</p>
<p>Another is labeling, which includes the physical product labels, as well as the information sheets that come with it.  There are a ton of regulations on the content of labeling in both a clinical product and a marketed one.  They can't simply set those aside, though I have no doubt they're expediting the review process.</p>
<p>And to the OPs question about just adding patients as more vaccines become available: that introduces all kinds of uncertainties and biases that a prospective trial is designed to reduce.  The endpoints, both safety and efficacy related, drive the population size of Phase 3 study.  If you just continued to add subjects it may question whether the endpoints were made based on the designed numbers or if you just kept enrolling until you met them.  There are also logistical issues: the data goes into databases which are locked, the data is cleaned and verified, and delivered in a lump.  Again to reduce bias of interpreting preliminary results.  Most systems I've seen simply aren't designed to allow you to continually add data while pulling it out at will.</p>
<p>That's why you have the phases.  If the results look promising but there is some endpoint that you lack data on you open a Phase 3b to allow you to close out what you have while getting additional data for whatever analysis is still needed (for approval).  If the data looks good enough for approval then the FDA usually allows a continued access study, that allows a limited number of subjects to continue to get treatment while the process is being finalized.  But, there are very specific regulations around that as well, because if you're simply giving out as much of the vaccine as you have available then there's no difference between that and commercial distribution.  Which creates a tough situation for both FDA and the sponsor to decide how much can be distributed via continued access, and to whom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still a consent process.  You can't administer a drug without the patients consent!  It's just a different type of consent process.</p>
<p>Editing to acknowledge a respondent who has pointed out that in some cases consent may be implied: in the case of patients who are incapacitated or in the case whosoever lacks fitness (intellectual, legal, or otherwise) to provide express consent.  </p>
<p>The specifics of when, how and wherefore consent is implied is bound in a whole bundle of legal doctrine.  None of it has anything to do with the matter at hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I agree that there isn’t really a consent “process” for approved products so much as the patient (or surrogate) must consent to the treatment.</p>
<p>And yes I totally agree with everything else you said, thanks for adding</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's a distinction without a difference. It still requires informed consent to some degree, just with different considerations being presented. The fact that one is more regulated and regimented is only tangentially relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, clinical trials require monitoring and feedback.  When a vaccine is ready for mass distribution,  there is likely minimul feedback unless there are severe reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, when people consent to trials, they consent to the possibility of getting a placebo, which in the case of a pandemic could be a death sentence. If it's being distributed generally, most people are going to want assurance that they're actually getting the medicine.</p></div>		</li>
