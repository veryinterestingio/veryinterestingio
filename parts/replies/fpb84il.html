<p>Who is <em>authoritative</em> for the .com domain. Verisign doesn't own .com, they just operate it (and the DNS servers that are authoritative for it). Who &quot;owns&quot; .com is more complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking it’s ICANN, the <del>International</del> Internet Corporation for Assigning Names and Numbers. </p>
<p>But there is of course some complication, but if you’re looking for an easy fairly accurate answer it’s ICANN. </p>
<p>The thing is as you suspect there must be a top level organization to do this, if not it would be possible for www.reddit.com to have competing iP addresses for the domain name. It a function of how the internet works. </p>
<p><em>Everything below is ELI5 and is, and I can not stress this enough, drastically oversimplified</em></p>
<p>However, IP address work top down so a regular looking up address like 255.255.255.0 (iPv4 as iPv6 the new standard is a bit longer as iPv4 almost ran out of space but runs on the same principle and 255 is about 2^8 since these are ones and zeros, per se.) </p>
<p>Generally but not exactly, ICANN runs 255.255.xxx.x. Meaning they assign the first two sets of number of a given IP address, it will give those to a geographical region (or rather a network region as it’s not exactly always geographical), so say Comcast gets 168.120.xxx.x, (these are examples not actual addresses) and will assign number underneath that to various infrastructures, and will eventually get to your router which will assign say 168.120.48.x to individual computers so notice the first numbers are the same. This allows you to put what’s called a subnet mask, this would allow computer to quickly realize who can actually assign any given IP address that contains the first numbers so they don’t go searching the entire world for a particular machine, as it may not actually exist or simply not be connected anymore. </p>
<p>Now when you type www.reddit.com your router goes hey do I know that domain name? If yes it will connect and open a session to reddit servers because it saves that information in its hard drive, if it doesn’t it asks your ISP, and if it does know it it gives it to the router which then saves it, and connect to reddit servers, if the ISP doesn’t know and asks it’s upper level ISP (the backbone of the internet) and they give it to the ISP which saves that on their servers, and finally at the end they ask ICANN and etc etc and if ICANN doesn’t know then the domain for all intents and purposes does not exist and you get an error, (as opposed to a different error where it should exist but no longer connects). </p>
<p>This is all dependent on your MAC address, media access control address, any and every thing that has the capability to connect to the internet has a unique MAC address, which are not organized in any particular way other than who manufactures them so would be inefficient to be an address for a network to find but you need a unique identifier at the ends, so the routers and servers all end up somewhere. </p>
<p>Of course all of this is vast and vastly difficult and there are a multitude of other processes actually going on in the real world. And this doesn’t get into how those connection actually go through the network that is the internet which is a whole other mess of problems to make efficient.</p></div>		</li>
