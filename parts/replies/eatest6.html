			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a rug store that sold all handmade rugs. Had to hear the word lanolin every day and never once did I not picture Mr. Burgandy.</p>
<p>But Lanolin is some real shit. We had rugs that were over 200 years old! Found in castles! And they still looked really good!
People would feel bad when they walked on our rugs that were worth more that a couple grand but we would have to reassure them that its literally what they were made for. Its seriously insane how long handmade rugs last! Its something you can hand down to your children!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use it as a lip balm, so good, especially if your lips had cracked from the cold. Lanolin also melts in oils, so sometimes I mix a bit of lanolin with some oils and put it all in my hair. Doesn't wash out easily, but it's a nice and affordable hair treatment. </p></div>		</li>
