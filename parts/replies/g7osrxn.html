<p>Why does lying in bed while sleeping not cause blood to pool, while lying in bed sleepless does?</p>
<p>(Or, is the &quot;lying in bed&quot; part irrelevant?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short it does. When I had a hand injury I had to keep my hand elevated in a 90 degree foam block and it resulted in blood pooling in my elbow and forearm. We have evolved to sleep flat and when entering sleep it lowers your blood pressure. so places that had blood pooling from your blood pressure pressing it there will have a chance to drain, and if you raise something above your heart it will more easily drain that extremity because there's less blood pressure to pump against gravity.</p>
<p>So while laying down does have something to do with it, it's a mix of things that cause it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who slept regularly in a sitting position for some time, my experience reflects this. I fell on hard times and slept in the front seat of my car for awhile, and I had to manage the problem of very swollen ankles.. Other fellow homeless blokes said, yeah that's a common thing. Gotta recline and put yo feet up on the dash or out the window if the weather is nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood stasis is a thing, especially noted in TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine). Trauma, scarring, as well as organ system misfunction can all cause blood stasis. It can not only be indicative of other issues, but it can also cause pain and discomfort (in the case of physical trauma).</p></div>		</li>

From a family of racoons to other embrace your dark circles, they make you look more mysterious and interesting (what my mum used to tell me and kinda confirmed by a boyfriend of mine).
But actually Benefit concealery my one and only (not sponsored but HEY BENEFIT ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By this logic the dark pools don't form because of lack of sleep but because of standing.</p>
<p>So by staying horizontal in bed while awake for 7-8 hours we don't get bags? Seems unlikely.</p></div>		</li>
