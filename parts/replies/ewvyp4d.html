			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mixing up Goodhart's Law with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis" target="_blank">efficient market hypothesis.</a></p>
<p>The latter states that once a signal is shown to produce alpha (positive gains), people will incorporate that into their decisionmaking until all the alpha is gone.  In other words, if some stock is underpriced and you come up with a rule that can show how, or you can otherwise predict how a stock will move in the future (eg technical trading), people will use that rule until all the underpriced things are gone and everything is back to its &quot;true&quot; price (as best as can be determined).</p>
<p>In total, this means that the market incorporates all information at all times, and any hunches you make are purely that - hunches.  If you came up with a reliable way to predict the market, the market would eventually become even more bizarre and incomprehensible (with respect to Douglas Adams).</p>
<p>Thus, from the perspective of any person, the market is essentially random.  It is already incorporating the best information available to it, so you are guessing on future events.  Nobody should be able to beat the market on a consistent basis (so, buy index funds).</p>
<p>Or at least that's the principle.  In practice the market is definitely irrational at times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. But I always wondered if someone “figured out the market” or at least some sub-sector of the market and didn’t tell anyone, who is to say your theory holds true? Assuming they only trade in the millions of dollars as opposed to the billions+. You wouldn’t expect some correction. Then again, I’m mixing microeconomic what-ifs with macroeconomic theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is anyone genuinely surprised wages are not rising? Companies optimizing ways to keep wages down makes sense (union busting, lack of pay transparency, as well as just optimizing for their own industry conditions). Wages not rising significantly due to companies realizing it's mutually beneficial if they don't raise them makes sense. Employees not leaving low-paying, low-quality jobs makes sense when there are not many better opportunities and there's a poor social safety net (like here in the US). Even if unemployment is low, that doesn't actually mean employees have much power -- a lot of lower-status positions involve horrible high-turnover jobs that employees move between.</p>
<p>And the rich and super-rich can afford to buy assets at higher-prices while they remain out of reach of more of the population. Idk, doesn't feel surprising. But I don't know economics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah labor is governed by supply and demand as much as anything it is genuinely surprising to see a high number of unfilled positions, low unemployment, and stagnation wages all at once.  Skilled workers are a scarce resource in this economy and it should benefit companies to pay a little more and snag them from the competition,  but that doesn't seem to be happening.  My personal theory based entirely on anecdotal evidence is management hasn't been able to adapt to the labor market turning into a sellers market when it was such a favorable buyers market less than a decade ago, and still make decisions like we're bin a recession.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If that's the case, wouldn't that invalidate the idea that it's governed by supply and demand? If managers can behave as if there's still plentiful supply of employees and be successful, I mean. That either means that there <em>is</em> a plentiful supply of employees and unemployment numbers don't tell the full story, or that the supply/demand model doesn't accurately describe what's going on here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Wages not rising significantly due to companies realizing it’s mutually beneficial if they don’t raise them makes sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theoretically, this sort of informal collusion isn’t stable because any single company can gain such an advantage by breaking ranks and paying slightly more to attract top talent. And generally, the way companies compete for labor ensures collusion like this doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>That said, the theory doesn’t totally hold up when you look at the evidence. There is somewhat of a monopsony (monopoly but single buyer instead of seller) effect in many labor markets, particularly lower income ones, and because of this lack of competition wages are depressed (why many modern economists support a minimum wage). There are also systemic biases which effectively create collusion to deny opportunity to minorities (such as women being locked out of high-paying jobs, people of color being locked out of high-profile customer facing jobs, etc.)</p></div>		</li>
