<p>Different species have different strategies (along a continuum of course). Lots of offspring or lots of involvement?</p>
<p>I recall some story about the other animals giving the lioness crap for only having one offspring at a time, but she came back with something like &quot;it's only one, but it's a lion&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a post on here about a species of octopus that lays 50,000 eggs and starves itself to death protecting them. On average, 2 eggs survive. Let's go ahead and assume OP was referring to ubiquitous terrestrial animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most the eggs survive. She caresses them and blows water over them to keep them clean and parasite free until they hatch and she dies. Then thousands of teensy tiny baby octopuses spill out into the ocean and 98% of them feed something else thats just trying to get by and about 2 make it to procreation age.<br />
Generally speaking any stable population only needs 2 to replace mom and dad plus a touch for population growth. Everything else is gravy. Or served with gravy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US brown-headed cowbirds do this. They don’t take care of their own young. instead, they lay one egg in another bird’s nest. When the baby cowbird hatches, it will try to push out all of the other eggs so it can thrive. It’s a pretty smart survival technique actually</p></div>		</li>
