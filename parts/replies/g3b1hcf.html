			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't just shock a heart. The heart actually has to have certain electrical rhythms we can analyze to determine if it can be shocked or not </p>
<p>These rhythms are ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia. </p>
<p>If they're in asystole, flat line, it's just compressions and medications that attempt to get the heart into any of those the rhythms or back into a normal enough rhythm to rush to ICU care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct and I should have been more specific.</p>
<p>My point was just, a century ago if your heart stopped it probably wasn't going to restart, so heart stoppage = death. But now it's sometimes possible to restart a heart, often enough that the medical definition of death had to change.</p></div>		</li>
