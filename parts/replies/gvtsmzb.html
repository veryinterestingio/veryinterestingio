			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the association of toothpaste to mint flavor causes people to turn their nose at anything blending mint with a sweet/tart flavor -- but there's food that exists involving those combinations, like mojito, which is a cocktail prepared with citrus and mint! The flavor isn't the reason -- the surfactants are.</p>
<p>And as a personal anecdote, I find milk or other creamy things helps the surfactants to dissipate faster, and they're pretty inoffensive tasting.
YMMV though.</p>
<p>EDIT: I ALSO FORGOT TO MENTION!! You can get SLS-free toothpaste too! If you're sensitive to it or can't stand what it does to food, it'll probably help a lot. It doesn't foam as much, but it uses other properties to get to the same goal. Look for &quot;hello&quot;, Supersmile, or NATIVE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should you even be eating after brushing teeth, tho? I recall being taught it's better to eat first and brush second if you are the type to brush in the morning. I mean, wouldn't it make sense to brush off any food residue anyway rather than eat away the fluorine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dentist told me that you should brush before you eat in the morning, said if you brush after it’s like forcing all of the sugars and whatever else further into your teeth and gums. Not sure that I believe him considering a toothbrush is meant to brush any stuff away but that’s what I’ve been told.</p></div>		</li>
