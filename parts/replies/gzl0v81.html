			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an electronic engineer and worked long time ago at an avionics company and was looking into modernising the PA system for a small commercial airplane. We wanted to use modern way of producing it and use modern components. But the high cost of certification made it too expensive with too little gain and we kept the old 1970s style design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For them it’s not : the NG already needed a good refresh of the overhead to modern looking and ergonomic ones but they ordered the renewal of their whole fleet bit by bit which is 700 aircraft. The cost is tremendous when you take into account each aircraft means 12 to 14 crew (28 pilots) a piece. But because if one or two airlines the rest of the world flies an antique ergonomy ! I’m fine with it because I’m used to it and it’s kind of a cool thing circa 2020 to have 1960s buttons and switches but it’s indeed against logic. But it’s not irrational, everything costs a lot in aviation and « if it ain’t broken don’t fix it » often is wise</p></div>		</li>
