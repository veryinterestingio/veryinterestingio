			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand it correctly, location markers (basical &quot;known points&quot;) are often in or around intersections. So they have to start a survey at the marker near an intersection and then figure it out from there.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert. So that's not an expert answer. But I did just have a survey done of my property and the nearest marker they could find was in the middle of a street a long ways away, which made the process a lot longer than they thought it would take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called doing a traverse with the idea being you can shoot two known points and then mark more points closer to the survey subject. You then move all your equipment and setup over the new points and essentially leap frog until they get to the subject. It used to be a lot harder before RTK GPS.</p></div>		</li>
