			<div class="markdown"><p>A fair amount of work is an understatement. My pops and I found a broken moped in the junk yard. Starter pedal was broke. Took it home with permission from junk yard personal because it's more of a pain in the ass to get rid of it. Called DOT to get salvage title for it. DOT personnel were a pain in the ?.couldnt give any info out. Showed up in person, Linda didn't want to do her fucking job, it was time for her snickers and cancer break. The lady in the next window told us to call to a higher level dept. Called down to state level DOT. Sure we can get the name for $65 dollars. Can we get an address...no. we ended up putting a sign in town that we would love a title since it was broken. Owner showed up with the title a week later and said good luck and keep fixing stuff. He would rather see it fixed than in the junk yard. Now he brings us lawn mowers and old boat motors from pre 1970s.  There are good people out there. Also fuck Linda, that lazy piece of privacy laws are real</p></div>		</li>
