<p>In certain instances they were, though. English Latin scholars of yore did that to words such as scythe (OE sithe), debt (ME dette) and island (OE iegland (g pronounced more like an English 'y') and ME iland/yland).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Closest way I think I can describe it without IPA would be like the diphthong in ear, but make the first part more like ‘ee’. Perhaps ee-uh and then add a slight ‘y’ sound. Land is then pronounced as lahnd.</p>
<p>Ee-uhy-lahnd. First part is a diphthong so one syllable. The sound then changed over time into the I we now have.</p>
<p>Edit: iland/yland (ee-land) in Middle English was deemed by Latin scholars in the medieval period to have been related to the Latin 'insula', hence the insertion of an 's'. It was never pronounced with an s, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those spellings weren't changed to reflect pronunciation, though. They were changed to better reflect (mostly) false etymological routes and a way to 'Latinise' English because it was deemed to be a 'better' language.</p>
<p>Island, for example, never had a hard 'g' that you're suggesting for iegland. Old English never had that in that word. Iegland would have sounded nothing like England and it would not have sounded similar to 'igloo' either. It was falsely deemed to have been descended from the Latin 'īnsula', hence the addition of an 's' to a word which has never had an 's' in it nor has it ever been pronounced. So 'To reflect this pronunciation change the spelling was changed to island' which you say does not make sense.</p>
<p>Scythe was never pronounced with a c. It was falsely deemed by scholars at the time (medieval) to have been related to the Latin scindere. When you consider that in other Germanic languages you have zicht (in Dutch), it makes even more sense. Similarly with island which in German is Eiland (pronounced the same).</p>
<p>Same with debt. The b was never pronounced, and entered English as dette from French. The b was added due to the relation to the Latin debitum, but it made no sense as in English it was never pronounced like that at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Taught is pronounced taut, the h sound is hard to make with the &quot;t&quot; sound, try to pronounce the &quot;g&quot;, &quot; h&quot; and &quot;t&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Taught&quot; never had a G or H sound. It had a /x/ sound, which is the sound in &quot;loch&quot;, &quot;Bach&quot;, or &quot;Van Gogh&quot; (when those are pronounced in their original languages). In Middle English this sound was frequently spelled &quot;gh&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
