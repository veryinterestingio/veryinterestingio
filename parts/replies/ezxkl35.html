			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you please tell me more about your technique?  . My necks been killing me for a couple of days ( from sleeping weird) and I can’t get to my osteopath until next week. I’ve never tried a chiropractor or acupuncturist or any pain meds for my aches and pains but my osteopath consistently fixes everything so far . I’m always amazed at what she can do .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This will be highly technical. If you don't know what I am saying you probably shouldn't try this.</p>
<p>Starting at c3 and working down bilaterally palpate the transverse processes of each vertebra down to c7. The one that hurts is the problem. Firmly palpate the transverse processes to determine which side is prominent and which is recessed (millimeters difference, this is difficult). </p>
<p>Lie down supine with your head off of the edge of the bed. Palpate the spinus process of the affected vertebrae and the one above and below it. Move your head into extension/rotation/lateral flexion away from the affected side until the spinus process are in alignment. While resisting against your temple with your hand attempt to move back to neutral. </p>
<p>If it works I usually feel the bone move back into place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for the reply ! Now I need to google all those words and see if I can figure it out . My osteopath will likely have an appointment available for me before I can understand it , but I truly appreciate your explanation .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're describing is a essentially a modified high velocity, low amplitude. This is using impulse to knock the bones back into place. I'm an osteopathic student and this is a more aggressive approach. With what you're saying about palpating and finding &quot;neutral&quot; is correct. One thing you have to be careful of with this is triggering spasms. Most likely, the muscles/bones are compensating for something. It may be bad posture, muscle dysfunction, trauma, or whatever. If you knock it out of it's compensatory pattern, the afferents may trigger a efferent response based on muscle tone. I'd look into cervical muscle energy, counter strain, still technique, myofascial release, and suboccipital inhibition. These will help loosen up the tissues and are not so aggressive. Bones don't move on their own and forcing them can cause some major problems.</p></div>		</li>
