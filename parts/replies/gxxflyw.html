			<div class="markdown"><p>no not really. the doorway effect is when you specifically was going to do something but forgot as soon as you entered the room. What op is talking about is just aimlessly walking to the fridge on almost autopilot, he never forgot anything because there was nothing to forget. The fridge is also where we get our food, and food gives us good brain feelings, so even if we aren't hungry we might just walk there because we know it makes us feel good. It's a learned behavior, almost like a pavlovian conditioning</p></div>		</li>
