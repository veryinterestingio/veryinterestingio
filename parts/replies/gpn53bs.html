			<div class="markdown"><p>^this. Pretty much our whole genome is made out of mutations with respect to our primordial ancestors. So your definition seems to be &quot;deviation from standard human genome&quot;. And there is no such thing. If you wanted a concrete answer, in terms of integer of mutations, you would have to select one person as a template. And if the person does not have identical twins or clones, then what you get is that every person has hundreds or thousands of DNA bases different from that one.</p></div>		</li>
