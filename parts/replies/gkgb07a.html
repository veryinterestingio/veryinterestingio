<p>In Palo Alto, yes, 3m+.  But the rest of the bay, especially southern end of the east bay is still solidly 1-3M.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be the opposite.</p>
<p>People selling more expensive homes that have risen in value, then turned that profit into buying a smaller house in cash.</p>
<p>That's a big reason people downsize... No or low mortgage. Less home to furnish, more cash for traveling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because your offers are $50-100K above asking doesnâ€™t mean they are the highest offer. Especially in the CA market for a $1M+ house Iâ€™ve seen houses go for almost half a million above asking price. If youâ€™re preapproved from the bank and going in non contingent then you are likely just getting outbid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in Spain you get nationality if you buy a house over 500k euros. You may imagine the amount of shady Russians that arrived to places like Marbella. (really exclusive area in the south).</p>
<p>Also I don't know in US but in Spain cash just mean laundry money/not paying taxes in operations like this. So is not only easier but I am sure many people would find a way to avoid taxes in cash</p></div>		</li>
