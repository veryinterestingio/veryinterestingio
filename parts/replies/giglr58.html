			<div class="markdown"><p>Because changing it means everyone that uses them professionally needs to relearn the on new ones. The people who use them order new ones, they want the old style so that’s what they buy. The new people use the old people’s machines so they get used to the old layout. When they use out the old ones they buy the new ones as well. Been going on for 80 some years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Adding machines predate the telephone by over three hundred years if you look at invention. Common use still predates the telephone by a lot if you look at adoption, and even longer looking at the move to touch tone. The ubiquitous 10 key, what we're referring to as &quot;calculator layout&quot; has been a part of the bookkeeping word for a very, very long time, and most people in accounting roles can work a 10 key blindfolded. 10 key will never change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had to guess the calculator layout derived from cash-registers, which had figured out the most efficient layout in the decades previously for repetitive/common number entry. Remember calculators didn't exist until the 1960s, PCs didn't exist until the 1970s. In the 50s most people didn't type and if they did number-pads on typewriters were not standard. So it would makes sense that when you showed a random person off the street a bunch of layouts, they are going to choose the one that goes in order from left to right, top to bottom, cause it makes the most sense because that's how our language is written.</p></div>		</li>
