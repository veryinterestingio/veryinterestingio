In all of the projects we purchased from this year, the CO2 is stored either as a mineral (e.g. calcium carbonate, CaCO3), or it’s stored in deep geologic formations (think of it as injecting it back into the ground, under impermeable rock, deep enough that it’s very unlikely to leak).</p>
<p>In the case of mineral storage, carbonates are the thermodynamic ground state of carbon, so it’s nearly impossible for it to go back into the atmosphere. More than 90% of the carbon on earth exists in minerals, as part of the carbon-silicate cycle. CarbonCure and Project Vesta both result in mineral storage. </p>
<p>Geologic injection (performed by Climeworks in partnership with CarbFix, and also by Charm Industrial), has a 50+ year history of safety and in the US is highly regulated by the EPA. To take the Climeworks+Carbfix example, the CO2 actually ends up being mineralized underground in basaltic rock formations. Oversimplifying a bit, Carbfix carbonates water with the CO2 Climeworks captures from the air, inject the carbonated water, and then it mineralizes in the subsurface. It’s quite cool. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6291/1312" target="_blank">Here’s</a> a good overview paper. (Ryan, Stripe)</p></div>		</li>
