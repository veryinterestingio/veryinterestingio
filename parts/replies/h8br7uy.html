<p>It's also easier to cook the &quot;raw flour&quot; taste out of it by mixing it with fat and exposing directly to a hot surface (making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux" target="_blank">roux</a>), rather than mixing it into liquid and hoping it doesn't clump and that the simmering cooks it.</p>
<p>So coating your meat with it and searing essentially gets you maillard browning and a roux at the same time.  Then you add that to your stew liquid and get both flavor and thickening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roux can be cooked to various levels that you couldn't get by adding flour directly to a liquid. </p>
<p>You can't make gumbo without a dark roux, no matter how much flower you sift into it. </p>
<p>Also, I just think it's the better way to make stuff. Sure, it's easier to burn, but you have to be a terrible cook to let that happen. Or really busy.</p></div>		</li>
