			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a mirror is a reflection where everything you see is flipped. So you might get a more true to life depth perception than a photo, but you will be flipped. Your brain gets used to the mirror image, so seeing yourself in your normal way (mirror flipped to your normal perception), it just looks off. </p>
<p>Like looking at this image of the US flipped horizontally. Nothing about it looks right.  <a href="https://i.redd.it/ij1gi72yd9r21.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://i.redd.it/ij1gi72yd9r21.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.redd.it/ij1gi72yd9r21.jpg</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>My wife has one in our bedroom. I asked her why she uses it since it makes you look skinnier. Her response was precisely because it makes her look skinnier...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say mirrors are more reliable. Because they are more or less an accurate representation. Photos on the other hand are way off. Just think about how weird the lighting in photos can be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend used to take high heeled butt pics with a mirror slightly angled up to add inches upon inches to the legs and pop to the ass. </p>
<p>She would try to hide that she was doing this but I could tell the very first time</p>
<p>I told her to just take real pictuers lol</p>
<p>Normal mirrors though if not noticeably distorted wouldn't have this problem. It's pretty easy to see a distorted spot on a mirror by simply moving</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some things people might not consider about mirrors:   </p>
<ol>
<li>Mirror will only show the lighting conditions it's in which may not represent the lighting when you're out and about.   </li>
<li>Using a single mirror will only show you from the front angle, which won't be how most people experience you.   </li>
<li>Your appearance in the mirror is how you look at twice the distance from you to the mirror. Maybe obvious but if you're closer to the mirror you might be more aware of that distance than the distance to your reflected face.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photos can vary by a lot. One could be taken in poor lighting, another one can be in bright and properly exposed. The camera can be very wide angle, distorting the image by a lot, or something closer, making it appear much more realistic.</p></div>		</li>
