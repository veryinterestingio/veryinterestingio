<p>But isn't a wild boar a different species than a feral pig?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here is a FUN fact in regards to pigs. Pigs have a really interesting adaptive feature. Take a baby big from a domesticated variety and give it to feral pigs. Its skull will then adapt to that of a feral pig. The reverse is also true. Take a feral pig and its skull will shape to that of a domesticated pig.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually true. It is not necessarily adaptation, but it is what we call developmental plasticity. This plasticity is just a fancy word to say that some structure is a bit maleable during development, so it can change  depending on the environment the animal is raised.</p>
<p>Check two-legged goats:  <a href="https://www.newsflare.com/video/139466/animals/goat-born-with-only-two-legs" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.newsflare.com/video/139466/animals/goat-born-with-only-two-legs" target="_blank">https://www.newsflare.com/video/139466/animals/goat-born-with-only-two-legs</a></a> </p>
<p>Their hips change because they don't have forelegs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that feral hogs are descended from farmed pigs initially, unsure if a boar is just a different nomenclature or a separate creature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soooo, first of all: feral pigs don't (and can't) develop tusks. 'Feral' just means a domesticated breed that is set loose on the wild - that's why we also have feral dogs and feral cats - so it will only change during their growth. So, they are still pigs. Wild boars<br />
are a completely different species. Not sure about hogs though, I would bet it is just a different name for pig. But I am not a native speaker, so Zack can clear the issue here.</p>
<p>To be selected, there needs to be a selective pressure either from natural or sexual selection. And that takes a loooot of generations (and probably speciations).</p></div>		</li>
