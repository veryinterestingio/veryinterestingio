			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot the proper name for the cognitive bias this is related to, but it's a self-fulfilling statement: if your speakers are not turned up loud, the small signal doesn't get amplified enough to hear or startle you. So you only register and remember the times this happened and your volume was loud enough to be annoying.</p>
<p>Edit: confirmation bias</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: it is <em>exactly</em> 60Hz, at least on average over the long term. Like, you can run clocks off it. And they do—many mains powered institutional clocks like schools and stuff were electric clocks that got both their power and time from the AC lines.</p>
<p>“While the actual frequency may vary with loading on the grid, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained rigorously constant, so that these clocks can keep time accurately for long periods, barring power cuts; over months they are more accurate than a typical quartz clock.”</p>

<p>I found this out when I was trying to figure out how to calibrate my turntable motor, because it had no adjustment. I looked it up and it said it got its speed from the AC mains, and I was like, ???, how can that be precise? I measured it and turns out, exactly 33.333 RPM. Very accurate. I was stunned. And that’s how I learned that the AC frequency is maintained extremely accurately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that most usually you don't hear the 50 or 60 Hz fundamental frequency, but its harmonics - 2nd harmonic at 100/120 Hz, 3rd at 150/180 Hz and so on... And it sounds like sounds from hell because all the load on the electrical grid - all the connected appliances, motors and power supplies are deforming the wave in various ways, creating modulation products that contribute to the noise in your power lines.</p>
<p>Pure 50/60 Hz sine wave signal is a deep, rumbling hum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is because while we can hear down to 20Hz, our ears don't hear these low frequencies so well, so we hear the actually weaker harmonics as being louder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Second harmonic noise (100/120 Hz) is a particular concern because of power supply ripple. Amps need a DC supply, and they get that by charging capacitors at the peak of the AC supply, which they do on both the positive and negative peaks. But since the voltage sags as the capacitors discharge, and the current spikes from recharging them, you can get noise at twice the supply frequency. Can be a concern with grounding with interconnects between equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same way microwave ovens work. (The 2.4 GHz frequency used in your microwave is the same as the older 2.4 GHz wifi band, as one example.)</p>
<p>Your body is full of water, and water is a polar molecule, meaning it has a positive electrical pole and a negative electrical pole. When you put a polar molecule in an electric field, it tries to align itself with the field. If you flip the polarity of the field back and forth quickly, you cause those polar molecules to jiggle, which gives them energy, which heats up the water.</p>
<p>In the case of the audio cable, this conversion of energy happens once more, as the water molecules are jiggling in time with the external radio field, and that motion is making its own little field, and the cable captures your electrical field and turns it into sound.</p></div>		</li>
