			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper you linked at least partially addresses my question for OLEDs, specifically FOLEDs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lifetime of blue FOLEDs cannot match that of green ones (TableÂ <a href="https://www.chinesechemsoc.org/doi/10.31635/ccschem.020.202000271#tab1" target="_blank"><strong>1</strong></a>). One of the reasons is that a significantly higher power (including Joule heat) is needed for the blue device than for green one to obtain the same luminance intensity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to other means of degradation.</p>
<p>Can I just ask for clarification about CIEy in this paper? Am I right to assume that it simply refers to a y value on the CIE xy chromaticity diagram? or is CIEy the luminance value from XYZ colour space?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, I don't know enough about chromaticity and color spaces to answer this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Samsung has an interesting solution to the blue LED instability. The RGB arrays use very large blue pixels which are locally dimmer than the RG LEDs to compensate for lower brightness.</p></div>		</li>
