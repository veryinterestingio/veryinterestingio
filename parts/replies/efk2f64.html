			<div class="markdown"><p>Under this logic, think of an emulator as a room that the school renovates for older students, and they put all the old rules in, and set new rules to limit how many little people can work at once on the old game, and and it even sets a couple more little people to help the old game find its way around.</p>
<p>But all that stuff has to be built and set up and assigned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to this entire thread, its not hard to add backwards compatibility to a next gen console to play older gen games. Companies like Sony think about this question all the time. And all the time they end up with the answer that its not worth their time for the return they get. In other words, they don't think they will sell X more consoles because it can play older games from Y generations.</p>
<p>Its also not hard for say, Sony, to make their own emulators that run off the hardware specs they have. Again it comes down to time/money and return they think they will get. Also because companies want to maximize profit, they will likely digitize their libraries first, and re-sell you the old games via downloads. So maybe in a few generations time you might see this when they think they can get some value there. </p>
<p>This is exactly what PlayStation Now is about, since you can't play PS2/PS3 games on your PS4, but you can stream and download the older games that they've digitized/licensed/packaged for this new feature. Its not exactly emulation though as these games need to be tested/updated for the new platform before its repackaged and re-sold.</p>
<p>Again, why does Sony not give a shit about emulation? Because they believe nobody cares. &quot;Sony’s head of PlayStation Europe Jim Ryan said in a June 2017 interview that while backwards compatibility is much-requested by gamers, it’s not actually used very often.&quot; Its a highly requested feature that &quot;isn't used very often&quot;. Kind of chicken or the egg here don't you think?</p>
<p>Compare this with XOne, which allows you to use your old Xbox disks, over 500 titles with the new console. PS4's disc reader won't even recognize your PS2/PS3 disks (for the same reasons why Sony wants you to buy new consoles each time and their old ones for old games). </p>
<p>Nintendo has the virtual console which emulated old games on their last gen consoles. But they dropped that in favor of a subscription plan instead that included the feature of playing old games. Anyways my point is this shit aint hard at all. It's a matter of business, a matter of money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they can only use new people that act exactly like the old ones.  The problem is that sometimes the old ones did things in a certain way under certain circumstances (for example, they took the long way through the halls only if nobody else was in the room and they were the last one to leave, and you asked it to clean the floors just a few minutes ago), so you need to be <em>very</em> careful to write new rules about how the new people need to act so that they look like the old people.</p>
<p>If you can afford it sometimes its easier getting an old room and including it next to the new one, and using the old one.</p></div>		</li>
