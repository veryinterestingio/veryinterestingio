			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum mechanics is used to describe single subatomic particles, but it applies at all scales. For many larger objects the quantum mechanical description is pretty much the same as the classical description but this is not always the case.   </p>
<p>CPU transistors work by manipulating the properties of energy levels of electrons at junctions between different semiconductors, this is 100% a quantum mechanical effect and it cannot be explained purely by classical physics. The effect of phosphorus/boron dopants on silicon is part of a field called condensed matter, which at its core is quantum mechanics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum Mechanics tells you how electrons will behave in molecules. Before Quantum Mechanics, we didn't really have any theory to help predict that. This allowed chemists to predict the properties of compounds before making them, and so start to create compounds with the desired properties on purpose, rather than by blind trial and error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum mechanics deals with things <em>the scale</em> of atoms and smaller. Quantum mechanics were needed to understand how to make the very very small transistors you have in modern processors. There are some details here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_transistor#Origins_of_transistor_concept" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_the\_transistor#Origins\_of\_transistor\_concept" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_the\_transistor#Origins\_of\_transistor\_concept</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  </p>
<p>I would also add that the development of methods where information can be shared more easily and widely made a huge difference.   Collecting data or making a discovery is not too helpful to other scientists if that information can not be shared to them.  Things like the printing press, which better allowed mass production of literature over widespread areas, allowed the sharing of ideas like never before and people could then build upon those ideas rather than waste time &quot;rediscovering&quot; those ideas on their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only real answer. The verifiable understanding of nature and building upon that which in turn verifies our understanding even more creating better instruments or new techniques that allow us to further verify or disprove our understanding and so forth. </p>
<p>This one of the main misunderstandings you see in conspiratorial places because science just moves on and ever increasing speed while people are still stuck at <em>how do we know the Earth is round?</em></p></div>		</li>
