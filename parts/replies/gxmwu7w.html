			<div class="markdown"><p>One basic principle of brain plasticity is &quot;fire together, wire together&quot;: when neurons are used simultaneously, they tend to establish and maintain meaningful connections. Conversely, an area that is not used/stimulated will regress (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_modal_plasticity" target="_blank">well-sourced wiki article on cross-modal plasticity</a>). TL;DR: yes, lack of use.</p>
<p>This article gives the exemple of kids becoming deaf after language acquisition: their auditory cortex has been recruited for visual and language processing, but less than pre-language deaf children, which allows them to benefit more from cochlear implants. So I guess it's reasonable to think that your brain will progressively forget how to see in the case of total visual deprivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! Could you drop some references regarding intramodal plasticity in congenitally deaf children? </p>
<p>I just started my Msc. in neuroscience, will research auditory cortex plasticity after cochlear implant, using steady-state auditory and visual evoked potentials. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you just started your Msc. on this topic, you might be better than me at finding those references (my PhD was some time ago and not related to brain function).<br />
A combination of Google scholar (sigh, hate advertising for Google but they're really good), PubMed, and of course SciHub will find you anything.<br />
Good luck with your research, and never trust a single source!</p></div>		</li>
