			<div class="markdown"><p>You were all good till your IRL meaning. The thing is you could go and cleanly cut each cord and cleanly splice in a new bundle in the middle, and just bypass all the old. But that takes a tremendous amount of time and energy to do at all, and basically impossible to do as one person. Instead you get 25 interns to go and do 10000 connections each. Which equates to surgeons and artificial parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to splice in anything when there's no way to know which cable should go where, since they all look the same.</p>
<p>In reality there's also the issue of the &quot;cables&quot; being so small they cannot even be manipulated individually without a massive effort, making the connection of hindreds of thousands of them an absolutely impossible task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out it doesn’t matter with nerves . The Brain and spinal cord can remap. The real problem is that inflammation keeps the nerves from growing across the damaged area in spinal injuries.In peripheral nerves the thousands of severed wires grow across the broken area just fine since there is no inflammation. However they don’t grow down the same paths as before. Your brain has to figure out how to remap everything using new wires. Pretty cool</p></div>		</li>
