<p>Soap is MUCH easier to wash off with soft water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My grandparents live in a major US city with very good water and they still have a large, very expensive salt-purifier in their basement plus filtration purifiers on all faucets. You can't rinse soap off at their house. You just live with it.</p></div>		</li>
