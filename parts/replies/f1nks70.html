			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, the enzyme required is cellulase. No vertebrate species can make cellulase. Even termites don't possess this enzyme. They have bacteria in their guts that produce cellulase and break it down for them.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I'm adding this because a lot of people are asking if you could eat cellulase or do a fecal transplant to get the bacteria or something. Short answer: no idea, but you can eat the enzyme because it is in some supplements and digestion medications.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, you'd need to take it constantly, as free enzymes don't last long</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even more complicated in a lot termite species. They have protists in their gut that have the bacteria inside them. Interestingly, they break down cellulose all the way into actetate which is ultimately the termites energy source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also from the other side, humans are pretty unusual, right? We put an unusual amount of energy into our brains, which are relatively massive. We stand upright, which makes our lower intestine weirdly short and our hips weirdly narrow. Between the narrow hips and massive brain, our heads are all messed up, which results in a relatively weak jaw. One of our ancestor species had to figure out how to cook before we could evolve, which makes the calories more readily available, so we could afford to have such a shitty digestive system. </p>
<p>Our muscle attach points prioritize fine motor skills &amp; dexterity, then endurance, and strength comes way lower. </p>
<p>All things considered our strategy seems to be to kick ass at making nutrients and calories easily available, and to not care too much about optimizing our strength gains per nutrient payoff. </p>
<p>Gorillas aren't massive outliers in terms of strength per pound, right? We are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We humans have proteins like myostatin that inhibits the growth of muscle mass after a certain point. When you see pictures of super strong children, they have two defective copies of the MSTN gene that codes for myostatin.  </p>
<p>A theory is that we were able to develop large, active brains, (well most of us) because we don’t put so many calories into building muscle. An average sized man burns more calories than a huge gorilla because the brain uses a lot of energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gorillas do expend more energy, but it's way closer than I would have thought, at just over 3100kcals. A natural bodybuilder would exceed that easily. Kinda crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the post you're replying to is correct, unfortunately not. Because it's also a matter of processing plus intestinal length. We don't pre-process (i.e. chew, shred) it enough, nor do we keep vegetation in the intestine long enough for cellulase to work; we'd starve those bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not just put it into a pill, like we already do with lactase for lactose intolerant people?</p>
<p>The German Wikipedia article says Cellulase is already used for treatment of phytobezoars, which is undigested plant material blocking the stomach or intestine.</p></div>		</li>
