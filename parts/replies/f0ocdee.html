<p>What do you think is the future for predatory journals? Should Beall's list make a comeback?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Predatory journals are a symptoms of how we understand scientific reward - you publish something, and it counts towards your 'total aggregate output' or similar.</p>
<p>Any push to qualify the quality of that output will kill them stone dead. One of the things which obviously makes a difference is, when someone applies for a job, you - uh - check their resume. That can kill a lot of it.</p>
<p>Basically, academia moves slowly. Obviously predatory journals are several years old, but the full extent of the problem is only just recently being dealt with.</p>
<p>Beall's list had problems. It was the opinion of one guy, who made some mistakes, and annoyed some commercial publishers a great deal. It became this odd kind of gold standard, but at the end of the day, it was just the opinion of a single person.</p>
<p>But obviously the ability to retrieve information about any given journal and its ostensive value is hugely useful if you're encountering it for the first time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you think reviewers should be paid for their time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You wouldn't believe the extent of the existing arguments about this. It's so hard to contain it all in one post with other things to answer. Relevant points:</p>
<ul>
<li>technically, if review counts as service, a lot of people believe that they <em>already are</em> being paid for their time</li>
<li>almost all of the people in the above post are people with stable faculty jobs, and their opinion generally alienates and annoys everyone else</li>
<li>some forms of review ARE paid - thesis marking and book reviews are very often compensated</li>
<li>for a lot of people review generally consists of 'overtime' - it's work you squeeze into your nightmarish schedule when you can. I certainly review like this.</li>
<li>it is very difficult to accept the statement that journal groups don't have the resources to support paid review.</li>
</ul>
<p>tldr I lean towards &quot;yes&quot;, but it's fiendishly difficult to have an omnibus opinion about something like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a better measure for a journal than impact factor?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impact factor is unscientific, easily manipulated (I'm writing a paper about this <em>right now</em>), borderline meaningless for any given paper, and has been subject to robust criticism since it was created. It is a terrible metric.</p>
<p>Everyone I know whose opinion I trust uses much more casual metrics. The one I've noticed most of all? <em>Quality of review</em>. I've often heard researchers who are really good say &quot;We'll send it to (mid-sized society journal or special interest journal) first because I want real, serious feedback.&quot; If only everyone thought like that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will scientific funding ever really allow for robust replication studies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you see a way to get that parameterized and out of the realms of purely past experience? Because that would certainly be a useful metric, if it went beyond mere reputation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of ways to do that. At a simplest level, the degree of change of the manuscript (measurable), the length of the review (bad ones, positive or negative in tone, are usually short), and the basic opinions of the authors (did that help or not?) would be a good start.</p>
<p>The problems are (a) privacy vs. reviewer anonymity and the fact that people would have to agree to participate (b) getting that data off the journals in the first place. Another thing open review would solve - it would make it easier to study review!</p></div>		</li>
