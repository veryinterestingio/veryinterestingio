			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I've never seen T-cell leukaemia but I have treated 1 patient with T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) and in practice the two are very similar. </p>
<p>I don't actually know the answer to this for certain, but what I would say is that the two are rather separate conditions - having a T-cell proliferative disease isn't associated with T-cell exhaustion because the problem is fundamentally that you are making too many T-cells rather than the ones you make normally misbehaving, with the ones you are making being poorly 'trained'. </p>
<p>If you are asking how someone with a T-cell proliferative disease would respond to a concomitant viral process which <em>does</em> cause T-cell exhaustion the answer is that it's academic and they aren't going to do very well (and they weren't going to do well before in all likelihood because T-cell proliferative diseases are nasty in their own right). </p>
<p>Most likely in the first instance their T-cells would be upregulated and their T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia symptoms would worsen. Then, assuming the virus doesn't kill them beforehand, if T-cell exhaustion sets in their symptoms may actually relent a little as T-cell death is induced. Again though, I don't know this for certain since I've never even seen a case study of T-cell exhaustion in T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia - probably because anyone with a T-cell malignancy doesn't survive long enough for it to become a factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I answered this elsewhere but basically there is a misconception that lymphoproliferative diseases make you better at fighting infection due to high cell counts, whereas in reality immune function is actually impaired because the cells produced are not immuncompetent. You'd therefore be worse off if you had one of those diseases (which are nasty enough on their own).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...there are people who think that it would make them better at fighting infection?</p>
<p>I was just wondering if maybe there was an upside to my T-cell disorder :P Turns out there still isn't one hahahaha</p></div>		</li>
