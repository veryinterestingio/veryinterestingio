			<div class="markdown"><p>So, read both articles. Cursory searches about other common ailments such as the common cold specifically. Those with weakened immune systems, regardless of age, may potentially die? Is this a correct statement? I feel like Iâ€™m missing something. </p>
<p>With the assumption that the statement is true, a typical developed world citizen that can access a decent base amount of nutrition has literally nothing to worry about regarding death from an ailment that kill those with a weakened immune system? Scratch this question if the above is false.</p>
<p>Still feel like the nuance is whooshing over me. Unknown unknowns are the worst. :[</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it is very unlikely you will have a deadly fungal infection with an intact immune system. </p>
<p>Conditions that increase risk of serious fungal infections include: diabetes, HIV infection, treatment with corticosteroids or anti-cancer therapy, severe malnutrition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could obesity and high blood pressure also be included? Do high levels of cortisol or stress reduce the capabilities of the endocrine system to balance in order for the body to function properly? Precursor for a cytokine storm? Cortisol from stress + weakened immune response? </p>
<p>Is this train of thought accurate? Or has my local news agency lead me astray? D:</p></div>		</li>

<p>Under normal circumstances, correct. But regardless of your country or access to nutrition, if your immune system is weakened, fungal infections can be life threatening and very likely. Think of how many people get normal fungal infections without a weakened immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I listened to an episode of radiolab where they talked about fungus evolving and they can survive under higher temperatures, even as high as a human with fever. Could that be part of the issue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All fungi that cause human disease have certainly developed heat tolerance. That's a key feature of what makes them cause disease. But in terms of the total fungi species, only a small fraction have develop such heat tolerance</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: I'm not a medical doctor, you should talk with one about specific concerns related to starting or stoping medication. </p>
<p>I'm on mobile, so couldn't copy the URL of the Flonase prescribing information pdf (easy to google). Here's a link to the <a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/flonase.html#:~:text=Inform%20patients%20that%20treatment%20with,perforation%20and%20impaired%20wound%20healing." target="_blank">Drugs.com</a> page. Flonase is associated with <em>Candida albicans</em> infections (commonly referred to as &quot;yeast infections&quot;) and worsening of pre-existing fungal infections. <em>Candida albicans</em>, while unpleasant, is easier to treat and less aggressive than other fungal infections (check out the review I shared in the top comment). Flonase also works fairly local so it doesn't supress your entire immune system.</p></div>		</li>
