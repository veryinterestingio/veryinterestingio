			<div class="markdown"><p>Acclimatization is real.  I used to live next to a bus stop in a major city.  Every five minutes a bus would stop.  Less than two weeks after moving in, I only really noticed when a bus with extremely squeally brakes would stop.  It was actually disturbing after midnight when the busses stopped.  Too quiet.</p>
<p>Rain and steady wind have consistent &quot;white noise&quot; in them that the human brain finds soothing.  Construction and other noises occur at random times that the brain finds jarring and doesnt like.  A gentle rain is much more soothing than a hurricane or driving rain.</p></div>		</li>
