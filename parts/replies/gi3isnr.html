			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but nothing bad happens if you use higher than the manufacturer recommends (other than you spend money for no reason). All the manufacturer's assumptions still hold. The converse is not true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not a common thing, an older low compression engine can absolutely run worse (or less efficiently) on premium than regular. Octane is a gasoline's resistance to predetonation, and low compression is pretty good at that already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can’t “not predetonate more”...the low compression just causes the higher octane to do nothing. It still burns just fine once ignited by the spark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a spark-ignited engine, it literally won't make a difference. It's also no less efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually lose some performance running a higher octane than needed as the additives that give it higher octane are less &quot;explodey&quot; than the gasoline. The purpose of the additives is to prevent the fuel from self-igniting at higher compression. However the higher the compression in the engine the more air and fuel is ignited with each stroke, hince why high performance / compression engines need the higher octane fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d be shocked if it’s big enough to see anywhere but a dyno, but it won’t hurt the engine at all. It may slightly alter the fuel heating value but that happens for lots of reasons anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it is the obvious answer and the 100% correct one. </p>
<p>Also you wont benefit when you use a higher octane rating than recommended - no reason to overspend.</p></div>		</li>
