			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is an answer to the main question asked, everybody else just rushed in with ‘this is why you’re groggy’, which isn’t even mentioned in the actual title question.<br />
Good answer too, I never thought about how maybe your brain is using those timestamps while processing short term memories</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting—and made me think about how, when I wake up in the middle of the night, I usually know what time it is (often correct to within a few minutes) before I look at a clock. During the day I don’t really have this ability, but if I wake up in the middle of the night I can pretty much immediately intuit the time. The few times I’ve been wrong I was off by hours and it was jarring. Internal clocks are weird!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I no longer wake up in the middle of the night, but when I used to, it was always around 3 or 4 am and I, too, was almost spot on when it came to guessing the time as I’m walking to the kitchen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer the part of the 15min nap question - </p>
<p>As we are awake the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland" target="_blank">Pineal Gland</a> produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin" target="_blank">melatonin.</a>  As the level of melatonin rises we start to feel drowsy and tired.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a 15 min nap, the Pineal gland removes melatonin, and you feel refreshed.</p>
<p>This is useful if you are driving long distances.  If you start feeling tired while driving, stop at services, get a coffee.  It takes about 15 mins for the body to metabolize the caffeine.  Once you have had the coffee, nap for 15 mins, but not longer than 20.  Set an alarm on your phone and keep the radio or music on loud enough to stop a proper sleep cycle.</p>
<p>After 15-20 mins, the pineal gland will have removed enough melatonin to refresh you for a few hours, and the caffeine will just be kicking in to give you enough alertness for <del>another</del> 3-4 hours.</p>
<p>/edit for links and clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’ve actually done studies where nurses (because of the nurses working 20-24 hours in some places...)  took certain intervals of naps during a pre determined time awake and on shift and even lying your head down for 20 minutes showed better fine motor responses and cognitive functions. I wish I could find the study but I read it awhile ago</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I understand where they come up with the idea that you should take 1-2 hour naps instead of sleeping in 6-8 hour blocks overnight. Wow</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NO! You still need a block of sleep 5-9 hours depending on the person!</p>
<p>This is just a quick fix if you need to be alert for a few more hours.  It is not recommended to be living like that!  Get proper sleep as much as you can, (and hydrate)* but a 15 min power nap will get you through that particular day.. you will pay for it later tho.</p></div>		</li>
