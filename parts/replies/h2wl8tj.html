</blockquote>
<p>The expansion isn't the cause. Many materials, even those that contract when freezing, form sharp and jagged (potentially injurious) dendrites upon crystallization. It comes down to the thermodynamics of the solid state and the kinetics of the phase change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that result in cell rupture? And if that were the case why have I been told that a glass like state is considered desirable for cryopreservation? Things like DMSO and glycerol are commonly added when cryopreserving cell lines and microbes. Granted I thought these were added to prevent formation of large and damaging crystals. But what you are saying is that that isn’t what’s going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With skin the most likely thing to happen is the denaturing of proteins before spontaneous boiling of water within them. Denatured proteins no longer perform the tasks they were grown to perform and consequently their function is unpredictable but usually not very helpful. These cells that contain them are likely to die rapidly either due to denaturing or apoptosis.</p></div>		</li>
