			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that has happened a lot of times, most of the world records right now are on &quot;easier&quot; scrambles than other groups, but there isn't really an easy way to solve this, we can either have huge groups, but that would be a nightmare to organize, or have the same scrambles for all groups, but that could lead to cheating.</p>
<p>And even if intra-competition scrambles are the same for everyone, there are many competitions held every weekend around the world, and some of them are bound to have easier scrambles than others.</p></div>		</li>
