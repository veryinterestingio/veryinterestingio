			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you would like, my website is</p>
<p>www.thesimplybookishco.com </p>
<p>We specifically blend tea based on literary characters and settings from young adult books.</p>
<p>I would most recommend Velaris from my own products it's lavender, earl grey with strong flavor or we have 2nd breakfast which is maple apple and English breakfast tea, which is a bit more mild.</p>
<p>Tea is so diverse, red rooibos is traditionally milk tea in Kenya so it just depends on what sort of flavors your interested in, Experiment!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I checked out your site and this is a really cool idea. If I could make one suggestion though, it's a bit frustrating to have to click on each tea individually until I find one I think I'd like. Maybe consider a different layout where your customers can see the flavors without rolling over the picture and compare them side by side? More user-friendly in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is the flavor of Lapsang Souchong. If Ron Johnson drank tea, this would be what he drank.</p></div>		</li>
