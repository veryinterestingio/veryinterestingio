			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm neither above (or at the least) 18 nor American, and I don't even have any certificate (I'm still in high school), but I do have a lot of curiosity in science and programming (because of which I love learning new stuff deeply in these fields everyday). Am I eligible too? (Like no age or country restictions or need of certificates, because it would be a honor to work with NASA). I even have some theories (idk if they are correct or have not been discovered yet, but I have some hope). I had some derivations too, but I lost them when moving for my high school (before joining it).<br />
Thank you in advance!</p></div>		</li>
