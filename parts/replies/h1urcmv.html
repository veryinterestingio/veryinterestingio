It is important to learn from the past, develop solid frameworks that include strong social and environmental criteria. This is the case for fossil fuels as it is the case for renewable energy. Today, global sustainability criteria have already been developed (e.g. <a href="http://www.globalbioenergy.org/programmeofwork/task-force-on-sustainability/gbep-report-on-sustainability-indicators-for-bioenergy/en/" target="_blank">GBEP</a>, <a href="https://www.hydropower.org/publications/hydropower-sustainability-guidelines" target="_blank">IHA Sustainability Guidelines</a>) but need to be mainstreamed when mainstreaming renewables.<br />
Currently, lots of solid information exists on these topics, but there is also a lot of misinformation. There is also lots of manipulation that is reflected in non-coherent regulations. In some German states, for example, you can build a highway closer to a home than a wind turbine. And often, we are comparing apples and oranges: e.g. when looking at renewables, we speak about the grid infrastructure, which is not accounted for at all when developing fossil fuels for power generation, or oil/gas for home heating that is delivered through pipelines.<br />
To make it a bit more visual: it’s like comparing public transport and cars, by pointing out the need for infrastructure development for public transportation, but not speaking about the roads, highways, parking slots etc. for cars.<br />
It seems important to frame the discussion in a way to ensure that the transition from fossil fuel to renewables is happening, but with the least negative impacts. REN21 is starting a project on the sustainability of renewables, where we will crowdsource data and information, but also create the spaces for dialogue.<br />
There is one fact: Fossil fuels are responsible for ⅔  of CO2 emissions and the impact is not local, but global. It is thus undisputed that we need to leave the fossil fuel era behind us.</p></div>		</li>
