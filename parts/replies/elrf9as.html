			<div class="markdown"><p>Deeper ELI10 scientific answer:</p>
<p>Muscle cells repeatedly stimulated by physical activity will experience altered epigenetics, or altered patterns of gene expression; specifically, the removal of particular epigenetic tags that prohibit regional gene expression. This altered pattern of (improved) gene expression makes it easier for the muscle cell to incorporate protein, grow, and increase in strength. The muscle cells keep this altered epigenetic pattern even when muscle mass is lost, so later physical activity will &quot;build muscle&quot; faster than it originally took.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20287-3" target="_blank">study about this</a>, and when interviewed, the authors of the study said, &quot;In this study, we’ve demonstrated the genes in muscle become more untagged with this epigenetic information when it grows following exercise in earlier life, importantly these genes remain untagged even when we lose muscle again, but this untagging helps ‘switch’ the gene on to a greater extent and is associated with greater muscle growth in response to exercise in later life - demonstrating an epigenetic memory of earlier life muscle growth!”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this will always be the case, regardless of age. The reason we don’t see older men being able to hold onto muscle, or be able to get as big as they once were, is due to the declining natural levels of testosterone. Put an older male with lower levels of testosterone on testosterone replacement therapy, and they can have their muscularity be the same as it were in their 20s if they went back to the gym and worked hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've learned. Fat cells can grow to be enormous before they replicate. Outside of a time period around toddler-time and puberty, fat cells are never lost. We can only grow and shrink the size of them - or they will multiply in more extreme cases.</p>
<p>My mom works in the OR, says she's seen cases of morbid obesity where you can visually see the individual fat cells because they have grown so enormously swollen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm definitely not an expert in the area, but I thought we could lose fat cells? </p>
<p>My understanding was similar to what you said, but with the exception that the body can eventually &quot;use&quot; up a fat cell after the cells shrink enough. But since it's more efficient to shrink/grow fat cells than constantly creating new ones, they aren't destroyed until other fat cells have shrunk a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article a few days ago about a study that supported the following idea: kids/adolescents build fat differently than adults do. Up until around age 20 people build fat tissue by hyperplasia (meaning <em>more</em> cells, but similar size) and after that they build fat tissue by hypertrophy (same number of cells, but they increase in size; this is also how we gain muscle mass, hyperplasia is relatively rare in adult muscle tissue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its a relatively new theory. i googled it just now to make sure it wasn't disproven and i had remembered it properly and its at the &quot;people didn't like the results but can't disprove it, so people aren't saying its wrong anymore&quot; phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, when muscle cells grow they develop more nuclei ('control center for the cell'). Most cells only have one nucleus, but because muscle cells are way bigger than most cells, they need multiple.</p>
<p>When you don't work out, and your muscle cells shrink, they keep all those extra nuclei. When you start working out again, they don't need to grow more nuclei when they get bigger again.</p></div>		</li>
