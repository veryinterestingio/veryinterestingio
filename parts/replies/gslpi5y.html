			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback on this, the hum frequency is usually twice the AC frequency (so, 120 Hz in the US). This is because the magnetostriction intensity is proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field and not its direction.</p>

<p>A G is 391.995 hz, and if you drop down a couple octaves, you get 49hz, so I'm curious to know if OP's power is 50hz</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, <a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html" target="_blank">here is a chart</a> of frequency in hertz mapped to pitches (in &quot;normal&quot; 12-note equal temperament tuning) and with A4=440 Hz (pretty normal, though not always; orchestras in particular can vary their A4 reference pitch by quite a bit—also music recordings sometimes tweak the overall pitch, sometimes causing major headaches for people trying to learn music from recordings).</p>
<p>You can see that the range of about 50-60 Hz (and doublings of that) covers about G to B, assuming A=440 and one is using &quot;normal&quot; 12edo tuning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Table of note frequencies: <a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html" target="_blank">https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html</a></p>
<p>So yes, countries at 50Hz would hear a slightly sharp G (49Hz is a G, 51.9Hz is a G#), including most of the world outside the Americas. Most of the Americas runs at 60Hz, and so would hear something between B and B-flat. As other have pointed out, differences of a factor of 2 don’t affect this, since they just add octaves to the pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I read this post when standing in a room with some buzzing fluorescent bulbs and I’m like... that’s between a B and Bb, definitely not a G, so I was wondering if OP just identified the pitch wrong or something else was going on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also be aware that power frequencies can vary a little bit. In normal operations, a 1% variation (so between 49.5 and 50.5 Hz) is normally tolerated, but larger excursions, if they don’t last long, can happen.  If a little more power is generated than is used, all the rotating machinery in generators and turbines will speed up a bit and if a little less is generated they allow down a bit. Outside the 1% band, things like turbines can get into problems with blade vibrations, and outside 2% is when power stations start to trip, ie go into emergency shut down to prevent mechanical damage.</p>
<p>Managing the grid frequency is a big and important task. In the UK there is the famous “TV pickup” event. When a TV show ends, the two things people in the UK do is put the kettle on for tea and use the toilet (causing water pumps to kick in). The grid control room has a TV tuned to popular shows like Coronation St and Eastenders so that when the credits roll, fast response generators like hydro pumped storage are brought online. The biggest TV pickup events come from major sporting events, for example if England do well in the World Cup, then the ending of the important matches creates a huge spike in power demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The resulting sound is not always coincidence though. The power inverters of some rail locomotives like the Siemens ES64U2 (1016 and 1116 Taurus) for example &quot;play&quot; a dorian scale in D across two octaves while accelerating (and the same in reverse while decelerating). Engineers at Siemens have confirmed that this was a deliberate choice for these models, because it would sound more &quot;pleasing&quot; to passengers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The Montréal Métro has turned this same sound into the chime played in the trains when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MR-73#Closing_doors_chime" target="_blank">the doors are about to close</a>, though I believe the motor sound is less pronounced on the new rolling stock.</p></div>		</li>
