			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was pregnant I got my tetanus shot in the butt too. It wasn’t sore at all afterward. Pregnant women need a LOT of vaccinations, so I started asking for all of them in the glutes at the OB’s office, and they’re much, much less painful down there.</p>
<p>That was the one upside of being pregnant: while the OB’s already got you naked on a cold examination table, might as well give you the shot wherever it hurts the least.</p>
<p>Postpartum, there’s really no way to walk into a CVS, pull down your pants, and ask for your flu shot in the ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember getting one when I studied nursing. Tetanus shots were/are infamous for how much they hurt. I’ve got a high pain tolerance and I’m not afraid of needles.
I went in like “cool, this will be okay”.
Once it was done I was like “is that it?”.
No one thought to mention the pain comes in hours after. My entire arm was cramping for the next 3 days. It was like I had constant pins and needles.
I called a 24hr nurse advice line and they said it was fine and to take some pain relief and use a compression bandage.
‘Fine’ my ass. I was okay, but I won’t be lining up for another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think 10-15 years. I wish there was a system, where your family doctors could remind, when you need to get vaccines. Generally they only tell you, when you are a kid.</p>
<p>But tetanus vaccine works even after injury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never gotten that sore from Tetanus shots. My least favorite is anthrax.  I could feel a spreading burning sensation followed by several days of really bad soreness.  Worse is that anthrax vaccine is a series of five shots spread out over a couple months or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got my TDAP (I think that's what it was) booster in 2016, after neglecting to get one for admittedly way longer than I should have, and my arm ached so badly afterward that I could barely lift it for several days :/</p></div>		</li>
