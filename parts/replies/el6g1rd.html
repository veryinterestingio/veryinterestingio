			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there theories for what would happen if we could overtake the rate of expansion? (Going off the assumption we have a way to travel faster than light). What would be there?</p>
<p>Like if we could travel in a straight line to the edge of the observable universe, what would we see beyond that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to be very hard to beat the speed of light. Recent research of Juan Maldacena at al. showed that even wormholes cannot provide a shortcut. Possible scenarios are membrane universes where signals can travel through the embedding space, but all of these pose very serious problems and are in violation of most measurements.</p></div>		</li>
