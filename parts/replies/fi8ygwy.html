			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it doesn‚Äôt work, for the reasons others have explained here (random sites having random password rules meaning you have to keep tweaking your password template).</p>
<p>At which point you have to start recording or remembering the exceptions, at which point you want a password manager...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;So you need to make sure you use a unique password for every site, how do you keep track of that?&quot;</p>
<p>OK, but let's not make it sound like that is such a difficult problem. I mean you can write them down in a book, use a secure encrypted notepad on your phone, simply use the password reset feature on sites you do not frequent often, etc.
A password locker is a convenience thing, but obviously there are other options.</p></div>		</li>
