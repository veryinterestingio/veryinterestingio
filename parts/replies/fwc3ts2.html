<p>I thought the cold is just a bunch of different viruses we group under a single name? Each of them gives reasonably lived immunity, if not lifelong, but it matters little because there's always one you never met before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there's different viruses constantly around that cause the upper respiratory symptoms associated with having &quot;a cold&quot; (most commonly rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, mundane coronaviruses) as wells as serotypes within those virus families. You can't get the same serotype twice (generally speaking) but when there's over a hundred serotypes, you can keep getting new rhinoviruses and adenoviruses all your life</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep.  And dogs are a bunch of different animals that we group under a single name.  And if you wear steak pants, you're going to get bit by them over and over.</p>
<p>And sure, there's various kinds of dog, but they're all fairly dog-ish, and no, that octopus isn't one of them.</p>
<p>Some people will go &quot;oh my god there's a thousand kinds of dog they're so different there's dobermans and danes and dalmatians and dachsunds and oooooh look at its tiny feet&quot;</p>
<p>Other people will go &quot;yeah, wolf descended omnicarnivore with domestic traits&quot;</p>
<p>Just about any bag in biology can be looked at as generic or overflowing with variation</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>You barely get immunity to colds, along with most coronaviruses (hi, the cold is related to covid.)</p>
<p>That immunity rarely lasts more than a month or so</p>
<p>The reason the cold is common is precisely because our immune system can't seem to remember it</p>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Whereas this is also true, it doesn't matter, because you'll still re-get the one you had last month</p>
<p>Think about it.  You ever go for a month long vacation alone, to clear your head?</p>
<p>Got the same cold three times, didn't you?</p></div>		</li>
