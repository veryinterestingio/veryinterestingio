			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.</p>
<p>The answers about microwaves heating water molecules differently than conventional ovens are wrong. The same process of heating occurs with infrared radiation (heat) as with microwave radiation. </p>
<p>The reason for the blanding is that some of the water absorbed by the macaroni when it was boiled will seep out into the sauce as the macaroni chills and then the diluted sauce will also be reabsorbed by the macaroni, making the sauce's flavor less concentrated to the tongue. The reason for the macaroni exuding sauce is that some percentage of hydrated carbohydrate molecules will form into crystal structures as they chill, forming <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cooling-resistant-starch" target="_blank">resistant starch</a>, and this percentage of crystallized resistant starch is also why chilled pasta (like in pasta salads) is firmer to the bite than freshly cooked pasta, and in that firming process the boiled pasta will exude some of the plain water it absorbed when it was boiled, making the sauce less concentrated flavor-wise.</p>
<p>You get the same blanding effect with leftover spaghetti, if you save the pasta mixed in with the sauce overnight. </p>
<p>To correct for this loss of flavor, my family would &quot;fry&quot; leftover spaghetti in a hot pan with olive oil to reheat it. It evaporates some of the water from the dish and concentrates the flavor again. If you toasted your mac and cheese in a frying pan it would concentrate the flavor again, but that's hard to do since cheesy pasta is harder to sauté without it sticking to the pan. Sautéing it with butter would work!</p>
<p>If their pasta dishes are getting very noticeably bland when they sit overnight, it's also a sign he/she might be overcooking the pasta/macaroni so that it's soggy with a lot of water that will seep out and exchange with the sauce when it's refrigerating overnight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the good explanation. I tend to make a ton of mac and cheese at once and so I'll just store it in the pot with a lid in the fridge. Then, to reheat I just put the pot right back on the stove. Sometimes a little bit of milk if it dried too much, and you can also add more cheese or anything else if you want to since it's pretty much the same consistency as when originally cooked.</p>
<p>Otherwise, though, I like mac and cheese reheated in the microwave about as much. It's a slightly different experience. I usually need to add salt but that's not a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just be careful cooling and reheating food repeatedly. Oftentimes the food cools too slowly allowing bacteria to proliferate. If the prepared food is not reheated to at least 165 degrees farenheit uniformly, food poisoning is much more likely once something has been cooked and cooled repeatedly.</p></div>		</li>
