			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Coronavirus itself isn't <em>just</em> SARS-CoV-2, but is a whole family of viruses (like how cold can be caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, etc.). A lot of misconception abut the Coronavirus itself is that <em>it</em> is a novel/new virus, when in fact the novel part is the SARS-CoV-2 which cause the COVID-19 (the disease).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused by what you are trying to say.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is a new coronavirus, it is distinct from other coronaviruses that affect humans, and has only recently mutated to infect humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was pointing out how many people – due to lack of information/knowledge – would say &quot;Coronavirus&quot; as if it's basically a new new virus (i.e.: SARS-CoV-2) when in fact coronavirus is a whole &quot;family of viruses&quot; that has long existed. SARS-CoV-2 is <em>the</em> novel coronavirus that caused COVID-19. In the mainstream, it's sometimes (wrongly) perceived as Coronavirus = COVID-19 = SARS-CoV-2, when it's more like what I've just said previously.</p>
<p>That's it. Just pointing out the comment which I replied to was giving a rather important distinction which some people ought to know, just in case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s still quite similar to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS I. It’s like comparing a brown bear and a black bear.</p></div>		</li>
