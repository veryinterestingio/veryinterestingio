			<div class="markdown"><p>Its easy to take for granted what we have but their are a huge number of things you need in place to support any form of technology to both sustain and grow. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>At the most basic end, you need security and legal enforcement. If there is widespread disorder and chaos you will struggle to maintain institutions or businesses as any disagreement will turn to violence rather than logic. You would not work for someone if there was no guarantee of payment or store wealth if theft was rampant. Peoples skills would be abused and in a disordered society would likely be killed.(imagine if the people on r/choosingbeggers had swords and lots of friends) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Once we have law and order we also need to keep people in the supply of food and water. You can't spend all day learning mechanics if you also have to tend a farm and walk 5 miles for water. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now we have logistics sorted we need trusted institutions to pass on skills and knowledge and keep things in order. These are hard to build but without a level of trust a market economy can't operate. Regulations allow you to trust that a product will always meet a basic level of standards. Without these Quality products lose out to shady businesses offering shoddy products but passing them off as quality. Your unlikely to switch butchers if you think the others meet lie about what the meat really is. </p>
<p>Healthy markets can't operate in these conditions, firms can't easily grow and consumers adopt a &quot;better the devil you know&quot; attitude to switching. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Only in these conditions can a society thrive. Without security,  law and order cannot exist. Without rules businesses struggle and without firms and institutions education and innovation will struggle. </p>
<p>If you lose security, you lose everything. Look at Syria, It was actually alot better off than you might expect before the current civil war. Now, it's doctors, teachers, engineers etc, have been killed, drafted as soldiers or fled to other countries, often performing lower skilled work than they did back home. </p>
<p>Even when peace comes it will take a very long time to return to what it was and that is with the rest of the world still existing ok. Imagine a time where you <em>literally ran for the hills and started a farm</em> Alot of skills would be lost.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A final part would of been the ease of writing. IIRC the romans didn't have a printing press so books would be rare. Books are fragile too so a lot of writings would be lost and knowledge would have to be passed on my word of mouth. You can't ask your dead dad how he built an aqueduct unfortunately and if his plans were burnt in the same fire he was, they're lost forever.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Death, mostly.  Or displacement.</p>
<p>Imagine you are an architect in ancient Roman times.  You designed and constructed numerous buildings in the city you live in.  You've drawn plans, your local government has worked with you on numerous projects and have their own records of the buildings and building codes (if any), and hundreds of people have either lived in the buildings you have constructed or otherwise used the buildings for the purposes they had them built for.  You are raising your son up to follow in your footsteps, sending him to the finest mathematics tutors and universities your fine city has to offer, so he can live a similarly-comfortable lifestyle.  You are busy having others lay the foundations for yet another building that you have been tasked to build.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, your city lies near the border between your city's empire and the neighboring empire, and the emperor there has just developed an itch to scratch.  He sends an army to take your city and claim it for himself, because it's situated on a river and he needs a warm-water port or whatever.  Also unfortunately, your city isn't in a layout conducive to the emperor's plans, so he has it razed to the ground.  Meanwhile, you have been murdered (sorry about that) and your son--bright, shining beacon of architecture he is--is forced into slavery, probably because the enemy emperor knows his family was well-off and probably deserved it anyways.  His skills in mathematics and architecture are useless when it comes to baking bricks or digging irrigation for the emperor's new fields.  His taskmasters demand a ditch be dug from here to there, and he has no recourse in arguing that the ditch won't be adequate because the hill it's on won't allow the water to flow to the crops.</p>
<p>The emperor continues his conquest, and soon your entire empire is now his.  Maybe your empire's army was particularly thorny.  Perhaps your emperor made a snide remark just before his untimely death.  Whatever the reason, the new emperor orders every city burned, and everyone living in those cities killed and put in a mass grave.  </p>
<p>Once that's completed (5 years later), the new emperor is constructing new cities when the old emporer's allies finally come to his aid.  Or maybe a neighboring empire notices that the new empire's armies are all on the wrong side of the fence fighting off remnants of your empire's armies, and decides to try to take advantage of the situation.  Pretty soon, the armies have all left to fight the third invading army, and all that's left in the land are--very few--people who only know how to farm or perform other menial tasks.  The enemy emperor is successful in repelling the invasion, but only after losing so much of his army and cities that he can barely hold his empire together, and is assassinated by any of his 30 sons.</p>
<p>As we all know, it's generally the educated people who are first punished for their existence by an enemy army.  And the people who are now left in what's left of your former empire have no infrastructure to return to--no libraries, no government buildings, no written records of who owns what or who know what.  The only buildings left are those that have been hastily constructed by slave labor ordered by the enemy empire--and those probably have no records or floorplans drawn up.  Lawlessness reigns supreme and trade very quickly breaks down, so no new knowledge enters your lands.  The empire on the opposite side of your empire looks in your dead, general direction, and decides it doesn't want anything to do with what's going on there, and closes their border.  Either that, or it sends its armies in and pillages what's left.  Whatever.</p>
<p>And that's how you end up with ramshackle cities filled with people dumping their waste in the streets.  The end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you see neighborhoods in Detroit after all plant shutdown/layoffs? You would think that couldn't happen in our country today, but there are neighborhoods and parts of towns completely abandoned. </p>
<p>As far as how society loses knowledge, I would imagine you only need be conquered by people less advanced than you or by people who burn down all your libraries.</p></div>		</li>
