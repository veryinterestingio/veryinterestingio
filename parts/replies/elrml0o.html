			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I wonder if the extra layers prevent wrinkles from forming. I always find in interesting that on older bald men, you can still see the difference between the forehead and scalp because the wrinkles just stop where their hairline used to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be due to no muscle on the top of your head. There is an tendonous sheath (aponeurosis) that connects to the muscles on the forehead (Frontalis muscle) and the back of the head (Occipitalis muscle). So when you are raising your eyebrows or wrinkling your forehead it is folding the skin.  One of the interesting things that I learned is that SCALP is actually an acronym: Skin, (Dense) Connective tissue, Aponeurosis, Loose Connective Tissue, Pericranium (a sort of fibrous connective tissue that covers bones).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. Tretinoin can help with both acne and wrinkles and it works by thickening the skin it's applied to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, does that mean I can use tretinoin on my feet to thicken the skin? I have some autoimmune issues and my feet skin is a very thin in some places, blisters very easily in others, and peels off with hardly any pressure in the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure? Pick a spot on the back of your head (or as far back as you have hair), grab a small tuft of hair by the roots (so your fingers are right up against the scalp), and tug. You should feel the skin pull away from your skull a short but noticeable distance before stopping short.</p></div>		</li>
