<p>Not only that, but much worse, right?</p>
<p>If the speed of the enemies was limited by how fast the processor could render them, and the processor is now 100X faster, then right from the start of the game the full huge group of enemies is going to be traveling as fast (or faster!) than the single enemy used to travel at the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at a presentation at the US space and rocket center with some of the people who worked on the Apollo program. One of them worked on the flight path calculations, it took months and they actually stopped the process to upgrade their computers in the middle to speed it up. He said he was able to get the program to run on a modern computer and when he ran it it spit out the result nearly instantaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space Invaders launched in 1978 on among others, the Arcade Machine Taito 8080 running an Intel 8080 clocked at an whopping 2 MHz .</p>
<p>Yes. MHz, as in MEGA-Hertz.</p>
<p>Today we measure almost all processors in GIGA-Hertz. 1 GHz = 1000 MHz. A gaming computer today can be overclocked to around 5 GHz.</p>
<p>That is 2500 times faster than the arcade machine!</p>
<p>You wouldn't have time to blink your eyes once before the game is over if you ran Space Invaders on modern hardware and didn't modify it in any way to make it playable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then there's all the work CPU manufacturers have put into making the CPU execute more instructions per clock cycle.</p>
<p>If a modern CPU were clocked at 2MHz, it would still execute instructions significantly faster than a 2MHz 8080.</p></div>		</li>
