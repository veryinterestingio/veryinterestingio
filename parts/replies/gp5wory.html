			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is the more common scenario for endangered species in general. Animals/plants etc that have plenty of space to live and food to eat will have their populations recover: look at birds of prey like the peregrine falcon which are recovering now that they have high buildings to nest upon in cities and pigeons to eat etc.   </p>
<p>The more difficult problems are creatures that live in an environment that just doesn't exist anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just species that are currently endangered.</p>
<p>With few exceptions we have been experiencing catastrophic collapses in the populations of species across the board.  The organizations that evaluate species status can't keep up, even the critically endangered species that is one of the key foci of my work took more than 14 years for the status an information to be updated for, even with me having provided the updated information (upon request) and following up on it several times a year for 6 years.</p>
<p>There are many 'least concern' organisms that have fallen into threatened or endangered categories, but we won't have the updated status for another decade or more, and by the time we do there will be an exponentially larger number of species in the same situation, awaiting evaluation, which will come too late for some of them, just as it does now.</p>
<p>The general public simply has no idea of just how bad the environmental situation is at present, and how much worse it will be in the future without the sort of <em>massive</em> changes no-one is willing to make, and which governments, political bodies, and corporate entities actively fight against.</p>
<p>Coupled with this is the fact that habitats are shifting as a result of the ridiculously rapid human induced climate change and species need to either move or die (the changes are happening too fast for he majority of species to adapt to them), but we have placed barriers to movement, enacted 'conservation' protocols to keep species in habitats that may no longer be suitable, and have not adjusted our concept of what constitutes 'invasive' species to account for natural movement of species <em>without</em> human intervention.</p>
<p>As a professional working in this field, even as someone who thinks there is still hope and fights for that all the time, we are fucked, as are many other species.</p>
<p>Sure, in the long run it won't really matter, but that long run is on the order of 5-10 <em>million</em> years.  That's about the recovery time needed after a mass extinction, and that's exactly what we are in the middle of right now.  An <em>extremely</em> rapid one that's taking place astoundingly faster than any previous extinction, even the largest and most devastating one, other than the K/Pg Impact (the one that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, but that wasn't nearly as bad as The Great Dying, the Permian/Triassic extinction).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to have a good grasp on the topic.  How long would you estimate it will take for a loss from climate change to be more expensive than the cost of preventing that loss?  And roughly what would you expect that loss to be?</p>
<p>I admit to an amateur interest here - climate change is definitely a thing, but people's self-interest is boundless.  It seems like climate change will only be affected when self-interest kicks in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's most of them really. But it's not as simple as space and food. Catastrophic climate change is messing up lifecycles for example.</p>
<p>A lot of insect populations are in trouble because they expect four seasons. But it's increasingly common for insects to hatch early due to soft winters only to die in droves during spring cold snaps or struggle during excessively arid summers. </p>
<p>As a result, they produce far fewer eggs for next year. And when these situations are not freak occurrences but a pattern year after year, populations are in real trouble. They can bounce back from a bad year but they can't cope with their lifecycle being permanently undermined so each next generation is weaker than the last.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related to this, individual bees matter less than an entire colony. It's more useful to think of the hive as its own individual entity, a super-organism. In this view, the queen is just the hive's ovaries, the workers are hands and eyes and other body parts, etc. </p>
<p>The problem is that entire colonies are struggling to survive, not that individual bees as parts of a hive are dying.</p></div>		</li>
