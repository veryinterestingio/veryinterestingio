			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly,  the immune suppression effect of catching (and recovering from)  measles means that people can fall sick to diseases they were vaccinated (or had natural immunity) from. </p>
<p>Source: various studies and articles regarding the immune suppression measles causes,  including this one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20636817/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20636817/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the reason for which is in your source: dendritic cell infection and subsequent spread to the lymphatic system. Measles infects a whole host of immune cells, starting with macrophages, dendritic cells, and virgin t &amp; b cells. While measles infects many cells, you could think of it as an infection of the immune system itself. </p>
<p>Kurzgesagt did a very health literacy friendly video on their YouTube channel explaining this process, so if you don't have a medical / biosciences / health science academic background to aid your research consumerism, then check out this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/y0opgc1WoS4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/y0opgc1WoS4</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask, how do they test duration of immunity in human subjects?</p>
<p>I'm a veterinarian, and I know that a lot of our vaccines use challenge studies to test DOI (ie vaccinate puppies against parvovirus, try to give them all parvo in a few years, see if they live).  I think that's barely ethical in animal species, and obviously you can't do that in humans.</p>
<p>I'm aware that some studies check antibody titre and use this as a proxy for immunity, but  I also know that antibody titre doesn't directly correlate to DOI for many diseases (ie, just because you have no ab in circulation, that doesnt prove all your plasma cells are gone, perhaps they just haven't been stimulated by antigen recently, you could still have a decent immune response if you were challenged ?)</p>
<p>I'd be very interested in hearing how they overcome these challenges to establish DOIs in human beings</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just antibody titres really. There's an arbitrary cut off and if you're below it you just get another vaccine dose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was watching a youtube channel and a woman was interviewing a woman who is a breeder and the breeder said she gets some test done that checks how much or if(I don't remember which) the puppies are immune to various viruses. Is that an actual medically accepted thing? If yes I wonder why it's not done in humans</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different immunology topic if you don't mind.</p>
<p>Autoantibodies can sometimes give misleading results in blood cell counts in medical labs. Antibodies can cause clumping of red cells or platelets so the analysers can't count them. We try to counter this by warming the sample outside of the thermal range of IgM antibodies, with mixed results.</p>
<p>Are there any enzymes (or other processes) we could use to disrupt the antibody-antigen complexes, so the cells are single and can be counted?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That question is quite far out of my scope to answer as I'm in no way involved with laboratory testing of blood samples, other than collection and labelling. I do trust the system in the sense that most institutions keep themselves up to date with their practices via centralised means, and would therefore be inclined to think that if there was a better way that was cost effective that your lab would already routinely do it. Have you brought this up in your quality assurance meetings? Is the level of coagulation of a sample measurable? If so could you report a coagulation index with the results similar to how a haemolysis index is often reported with chemistry results? </p>
<p>In arterial blood gas tubes they use heparinised lithium coating that the collectors have to mix with a horizontal rolling motion to avoid clotting the sample. Could that be an appropriate means to maintain the integrity of blood samples for auto antibodies? I'm not sure and I'm probably far from the appropriate person to answer that. Good luck with finding out though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your reply. Papain can be used to cleave IgG molecules, which should separate the cells so they can be counted. However, this won't work for IgM I believe. I just wondered if there was a universal immunoglobulin disrupter.</p>
<p>I can't find any such techniques in the literature so it would be a research study.</p>
<p>We can indeed measure coagulation times and that can sometimes indicate cells are clumped due to clots, but obviously that is different than autoimmune mediated agglutination. Interestingly, different anticoagulants can expose different antigens on the cells, causing agglutination in one blood bottle, but not another.</p></div>		</li>
