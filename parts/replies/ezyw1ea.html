			<div class="markdown"><p>MacGyver:
Luckily that car has a top knotch audio system. That guy also has 3 instead of the typical one 1 Farad condensators.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGIo-tqQkoQ" target="_blank">start theme song now</a>
MacGyver disconnects the condensators, pulls some of the wires out of the sound system - nice thick wire - score!<br />
Now the usb charging cable - there was one still plugged into the dashboard - MacGyver takes the cable cuts it in two with his trusted Swiss army knife pulls the insulation and connects the red and black wire to the first condensator. (realistically you would like a current limiting resistor but that is not necessary in TV)<br />
After a few minutes the first condensator is charged to 5V - now repeat the process with the other two condensators.
Once everything is charged the condensators are connected in series (now you have nearly 15 Volts available) with the thick audio cables (and can supply 400 A easily).<br />
MacGyver pops the hood of the car. He disconnects the battery (using his Swiss army knife) and winds the audio cables around the battery connectors.
He signals the woman sitting in the car (don't ask it was either a pretty lady or an orphan - the woman looks better and this is my phantasy...) to start and after 2 seconds of starter noise - suspension - the car starts.<br />
They drive into the sunset, or to the next US embassy, or wherever.
Theme song out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could literally do this.  Am basshead, have everything you mentioned.   I also have some current limiting resistors and a couple dc boost converters in my box of fuses.  Not to be confused with my fuse box.  It's all unnecessary though, as I have a deep cycle Duracell in the trunk on a battery isolator relay with a timer.  If the front battery is not 100% dead but won't start the car, wait 10 seconds and try again.  My little 03 Focus has jump started a semi truck and a 34,000lb forklift in sub zero temps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah, that feeling is awesome.  My '96 geo metro 3-banger was pretty badass in that cold Wisconsin winter (singular - frame at the end of the control arm snapped after a season thanks to the potholes).  Same type of setup, too.  So yeah, cell phone can jump a car, but it takes a few extra steps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aren't caps usually designed for a certain voltage?  So you cannot connect a 5v supply to a capacitor designed for 12v.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The capacitors mentioned would be rated for more than 12V (at a pure guess 20V) you can always charge a capacitor lower than the rated voltage - if you overcharge it it will destroy the capacitor (depending on the model - silently, spectacularly and or stinky)  </p>
<p>The only problem with using a lower voltage is that the absolute amount of energy that you store in the capacitor is lower than if you would charge it to a higher voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not certain, but as an electrician, I doubt the wires you could connect to a cell phone's USB output could handle the amps, even if the phone could supply them all at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is that you could theoretically use the energy in your cell phone's battery to charge your car battery, then start the car with your car battery like normal.  Due to limitations with the battery components, this would take a long time even if you had the proper circuit components.</p>
<p>Could you rig it up in an emergency?  No, you wouldn't have the components unless you're an electrical engineer.  It's not a practical solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, I used 4 gauge welding cable to run ~60 amps, which is <em>way</em> too big to connect to any kind of USB port.  And the starter wants 10x that current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need capacitors - if your car has a flat battery you could use a simple DC-DC boost converter ($3 ebay/alibaba) to boost the voltage up and recharge the (large beefy) car battery from your phone to a level where it could start the car.</p>
<p>You'd only need capacitors if you had no car battery.</p>
<p>Anyway, the more normal approach would be to bump-start the thing, or charge it by popping the belt off and spinning the alternator by hand might be a better use of energy than trying to MacGyver up your only means of communication ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn’t run the numbers but I suspect if you recharged a completely dead car battery from a cell phone you’d raise the state of charge like 1% and still be unable to start the car. </p>
<p>Without a smaller store of charge you can saturate it’s like trying to refill a swimming pool with a dixie cup.</p>
<p>That’s why other posters are talking about things like capacitors or high drain lithium booster packs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First - you would need the DC/DC boost converter<br />
second - your car battery would have to be still functional
third - your phone might not have the power to raise the battery voltage enough for the starter to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True enough, but this is exactly how those little power-bank phone-charger jump-start pack things work - they contain some 3.7v cells and a DC-DC boost converter.</p>
<p>You don't have to put a huge number of amp-hours capacity into a car battery to get one good crank, you only need very little even on a flat battery. Also, it's not the voltage that's the real problem - unless the battery is so dead it's internally damaged, it will pour hundreds of amps into the starter even if it's only at 9v.</p></div>		</li>
