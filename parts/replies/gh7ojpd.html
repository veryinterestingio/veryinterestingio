			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the reason I asked the question, I keep hearing that if say you stand by an infected person in the supermarket for a couple of minutes your chances of infections are low but if you are in an office for 15 minutes with an infected person you are most likely infected.</p>
<p>Now based on some of the responses I received I think the reason they say the above is because statistically you are less likely to be exposed to the virus in 2 minutes compared to 15.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You two have outlined a dangerous misconception. The 'time to be infected' or 'number of virus needed for infection' are both <strong>statistically relevant</strong> numbers. The research shows <em>statistically</em> it takes a certain amount of time or virus to be infected, it's not a precise number. The virus don't build up to a certain number then magically you are infected.</p>
<p><strong>It only takes ONE virus to infect you</strong>. Got that? One 'successful' attachment of a CoV2 virus to one of your ACE-2 receptor begins the process where your cells produce billions more and coat your lungs.</p>
<p>Imagine someone throwing grapes at you with your mouth open. Usually it would take a few tries to get it in but occasionally it could happen first try. So 'statistically' it may take 20 grapes but that doesn't mean the 20th grape will go in.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>So, to answer the question, exposing yourself to a low number of virus IS NOT a good way to gain immunity. It IS a good way to get infected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just happened to log back into Reddit and saw your response.  Thank you for your clarification.</p>
<p>I previously thought when people mentioned viral load and how long one spent in the company of others that people were talking about how much virus one accumulated before one accumulated enough to make one sick -- not about the odds of being exposed.  I'm still wondering why then there are often references to people picking up smaller amounts of the virus, but your grapes metaphor makes sense.  Anyway I've never had a plan to purposely infect myself hoping for immunity!  I've been careful and will remain so.  Thanks again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I almost asked this question the other day when I was thinking about a doctor I saw on twitter months ago sort of &quot;thinking out loud&quot; that people with masks may be getting smaller amounts of the virus transmitted to them and creating their own immunity. I've read this thread and that seems unlikely based on what people are discussing, but I thought it was an interesting potential path to follow.</p></div>		</li>
