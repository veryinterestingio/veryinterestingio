			<div class="markdown"><p>These are only somewhat informed guesses, but the likely main causes for differences are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Skull muscle, bone structure and jaw size development. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skin differences due to e.g. estrogen (makes skin smoother) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fat under the skin</p>
</li>
<li>Connective tissue composition </li>
</ul>
<p>Time usually spent outside is something they could at least control somewhat for in a research study.</p>
<p>Source for my guess: biologist that took some classes in anatomy, histology and histopathology</p>
<p>Edit: cleaned up the post and made it more readable. I could probably find some sources for my statements, but I think they're pretty non-controversial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They may not necessarily be trying to discredit OP. This is the exact kind of bias and statistical correction that the researches must have discussed prior to, and during experimentation. I agree that the counter arguments expressed in this thread are relevant, however I may not necessarily agree that the researchers can’t defend themselves against these arguments in their results. However, I do insist that all routes to discrediting any arbitrary scientific research be freely explored in a public domain. </p>
<p>Edit:
It is possible that the next study does in fact find that occupation, regardless of gender, affects the outcome in the same experimental procedures. </p>
<p>This is relevant, and should also be explored, even if OP is not referring specifically to this parameterization, if nothing else, to further the development of the science. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP meant was is the difference caused by genetic differences relating to things like aging or actual differences in skin composition, vs. just caused simply by differences in facial expressions, which could be caused by many factors, including both certain genes as well as culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah well that's an interesting question, with an even more interesting answer I'm sure, but I don't see how you could measure that really. </p>
<p>First it would be quite hard to show differences in facial expression that are not due to differences in genetic expression. It's basically impossible to differentiate the influence of the environment and your genes on any variable. The consensus is that complex interactions of both genetic and environmental factors affect everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's silly, it's not really that difficult to differentiate (or at least make very educated guesses  based on evidence) between biology and socialization in many situations. At least it's certainly possible to determine if culture and socialization play a role. Scientists do that all the time in many disciplines. For example behavioral sciences, language studies, etc. There is an entire field of study on facial expressions and how they do and don't vary between cultures. Many expressions are innate, as evidenced by being recognizable in any culture. But certain expressions, gestures, and variations are certainly cultural.</p>
<p>In this particular instance, all you would have to do is look at how facial expressions vary by culture and sex. Starting with the patterns you find, you can then tease out the influence of cultural, social, and environmental factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if the study was done in Japan then the cultural context is Japanese women value fairness and hence limit sun exposure. </p>
<p>Men drink more and work more so worse skin. </p>
<p>The oldest age group 65-75 would be a generation born 1950-1960 hence the people who came of age in the Japanese housing boom. </p>
<p>Maybe women worked more when the economy was more robust? Or they faced the tremendous stress of watching the bust and felt these emotions more strongly. </p>
<p>Could be interesting to study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could also be that women go to greater lengths medicating their skin, and treatment has gotten more effective in recent years. In addition to SPF, there is retinoids, hyalauronic acid, vit C, etc. which have been proven effective. Even if they controlled for that they could have missed ingredients that may be hidden in makeup and lotion.</p>
<p>Side note - It’s interesting how anti-aging products are heavily marketed to women, but I bet a lot of guys would be interested in preventing wrinkles if the opportunity was presented to them. Similarly to how they almost exclusively marketed computer games to boys in the 80’ and 90’s. Seems a missed opportunity.</p></div>		</li>
