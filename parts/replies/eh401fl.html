			<div class="markdown"><p>No it isn't.  It's wrong. the answer is the exosphere isn't hot. Space craft only have to deal with heat from entering the atmosphere at orbital speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is not a lot of energy transfer in the exosphere because of the low density. However, the particles that are there are at higher temperatures. This is due to two reasons: 1) only high velocity particles leaving Earth actually reach there in the first place. Anything lower energy is gravitationally bound. 2) this region takes in a lot of solar energy, so there are solar particles (already higher energy) and there is radiative transfer of energy to the Earth-escaping particles already there. All of that solar energy goes somewhere, and some of it goes to the particles in the exosphere.</p>

<p>Figure 5-6 in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JA022691" target="_blank"><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JA022691" target="_blank">https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JA022691</a></a> shows that the time averaged temperature is 600-800K with spikes to 1400K regularly. There are some &quot;educational&quot; resources that list the exosphere temperature ranging up to 1700K, which I couldn't quickly track to an original source. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, the argument about &quot;ships having to withstand the exosphere&quot; is certainly not really important because we don't generally travel to the exosphere. But... lunar missions and any extra-terrestrial mission certainly has to go through it. The bottom line is: yes, stuff is hot, but there's not enough hot stuff to make a real difference. See the water/steam analogy again. Water vapor in steam is certainly very hot, but there isn't enough of it to actually burn you in some situations (certainly steam CAN burn, but a foot or so above a pot of boiling water is not going to). </p>

<p>I mean, if you have some information that is counter to my space science expertise or original source listed - please do present it.</p></div>		</li>
