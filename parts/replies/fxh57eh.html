			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually work well for lightening scars. I have used roughly 5 different brands and they all tend to make the scar &quot;less noticeable&quot;. Scarzone worked the best for me. The scar I have is very big (&gt;8&quot;). Now I don't know how well these creams work with darker skintones, but to give you a reference my skin is slightly tan. And my scar was darker than my skin tone. Over several months of nightly application my scar began getting lighter and lighter. It did also slightly decrease the puffiness of the scar. EDIT, The other thing it did was reduce the shininess of the scar. Prior to treatment, my scar would somewhat &quot;glisten&quot; in light, but the Scarzone got rid of that. It has helped quite a bit. But be religious about it, apply it, massage it in, and make sure it doesn't get rubbed off.</p></div>		</li>
