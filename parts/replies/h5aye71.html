			<div class="markdown"><p>XX/XY - most mammals, some insects (I.e. fruit flies) <strong>XX</strong> is female, <strong>XY</strong> is male </p>
<p>XX/X0 - some insects (I.e. cockroaches or crickets) <strong>0</strong> denotes the <em>absence</em> of a second sex chromosome. <strong>XX</strong> is female, <strong>X0</strong> is male.</p>
<p>ZW/ZZ - birds, some insects, some reptiles (I.e. Lepidoptera, aka Ancient Greek moths and butterflies, or the Komodo dragon) itâ€™s the opposite of ours, <strong>ZW</strong> is female, <strong>ZZ</strong> is male. Some moths and butterflies have been found to be female even with <strong>Z0</strong> or <strong>ZZW</strong> chromosomes. </p>
<p>UV - algae who are not hermaphrodites. <strong>U</strong> gives rise to female traits and <strong>V</strong> gives rise to male traits. </p>
<p>Haplodiploidy - ants or bees, and other insects. This one is complicated but kinda neat! Long story short, the parent bug can decide what sex the offspring have. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>XX/XO is always fascinating to me, because it allows a queen/female to create a creature who's sole purpose is to be a source of genethic material so additional females can be born</p></div>		</li>
