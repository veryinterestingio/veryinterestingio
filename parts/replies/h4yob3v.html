			<div class="markdown"><p>sometimes both your hands can do something reasonably well (like catching a ball). sometimes one hand is better at writing, but that same hand may not be dominant during a different activity. so even though you're left-handed, your left hand might not be able to do some of the things you usually do with your right hand.</p>
<p>if you follow this logic, even though your left hand is good at more things it's not necessarily better at everything</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to him, I haven't witnessed the latter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I write left handed but do everything else right handed. Apparently my right hand writing is readable but it hurts me to do for long periods of time so I've never practised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently you can have a dominant thumb independent of which is your dominant hand. Supposedly you can determine this by lacing your fingers together and seeing which thumb is on top. I'm right-handed and my left thumb is on top when I lace my fingers together. I also snap much better with my left hand than with my right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a predisposition for one side, but honestly both your hands and feet have the same potential. They learn to do whatever you teach them. I cant write for shit on my left hand but I can input all of the directions of a fighting game combo and constantly move around the strings of a guitar using my left hand.
It is not dumber, just less trained.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't this a myth? Your brain is made up of dozens of different areas that all serve different functions throughout your body.</p></div>		</li>
