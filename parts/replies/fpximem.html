<blockquote>
<p>Though spores of C. botulinum are heat-resistant, the toxin produced by bacteria growing out of the spores under anaerobic conditions is destroyed by boiling (for example, at internal temperature greater than 85 ¬∞C for 5 minutes or longer). Therefore, ready-to-eat foods in low oxygen-packaging are more frequently involved in cases of foodborne botulism. <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism" target="_blank">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism</a></p>
