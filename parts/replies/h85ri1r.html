<p>Unless you are an elite athlete in the middle of an actual competition, you do not need a sports drink (even then, the evidence is pretty sparse that they help).</p>

<p>Anecdotal, but I would argue that. Working in construction, doing a day of labour in the heat and sun, I feel much better at the end of the day if I have a sports drink or 2 along with water, vs just water all day.</p>
<p>Yes, I could make sure to snack on foods that are high in electrolytes while I work, but the convenience of having it in a bottle that fits in my tool belt is just easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I work in oil&amp;gas and have to wear coveralls in the heat and I sweat right through my coveralls in a workday. Like I drink a gallon of water a day to keep up with hydration it's crazy. I drink the sugar free Gatorade to replace the salt I'm not sure if it works or not but I can see salt baked into the coveralls so I feel like I don't replace that amount through the food I eat so it gives me peace of mind</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other reason sports drinks are good is that they are tart with a hint of saltiness. Both make you want to drink more.</p>
<p>I bet if you actually measured how much sports drink + water you drink versus how much plain water you drink, you'd find you drink more sports drink + water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate to your salt baked overalls. I work in a warehouse with no ac, typically 95f outside with humidity at 40% average. I get home, rub my eyes and it feels like my face just came out of the sand. Crusty eyebrows and everything. I can kinda imagine what a jiz sock must feel like when taking off my shirt.
I drink a low sugar caffeinated beverage, two bottles of water (sometimes a third), a Gatorade, and a can of soda. And no bathroom breaks. It's all sweat out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should try nuun - it's slightly effervescent tablets that you drop into your water and it's got a lot more electrolytes than gatorade. It's lightly flavoured and has no sugar. I love it for running. I recommend it to anyone who sweats a lot and needs to keep electrolytes in balance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about salt lost in sweat, not your daily allowance. OP above is misunderstanding slightly. Yes you're right, if you sweat for any reason you may need to replace a small amount, and as you need fluid as well, sports drinks aren't terrible.</p>
<p>Depending on volume though, sugar free options may be a better option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit really? But a can of coke is almost syrup. I cant see that Gatorade being the same. Also I thought Gatorade was supposed to have electrolytes which help chemical reactions happen within your body. Didnt think I can put on weight drinking it. </p>
<p>From what you said. I can get a beer belly and a dad bod by the time I'm 29 by only drinking this stuff</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gatorade has <a href="https://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/Home/product?formula=33877&amp;form=RTD&amp;size=20" target="_blank">34g of sugar</a> in a 20oz bottle. 20oz of Coke has <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/products/coca-cola/original" target="_blank">65g of sugar</a>. It's not as bad as soda, but it is still excessive.</p>
<p>As far as electrolytes, you get more than you need from your food. You don't need more from your drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't go <em>that</em> far, but they still aren't good for you.  Sports drinks are meant for performance, meaning that your body needs the simple carbs from the sugar in them <em>now</em>, and it'll use those carbs <em>now.</em>  If you don't need those simple carbs right away and don't use them right away,  they go into storage like any other carb.  In other words, they get turned into fat.  There are low sugar and sugar free sports drinks out there that are little more than artificially flavored/sweetened water with some extra electrolytes thrown in, but you won't find a professional football player chugging down on one of those between plays.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's right. I can't believe it's 2021 and people still don't read the sugar content of everything they consume. </p>
<p>There are sports drinks out there w MORE sugar than soda. Same with juice. </p>
<p>This shit is not healthy. </p>
<p>I don't consume sugary drinks. So when I do, it all tastes gross. </p>
<p>Soda feels like syrup. Most beers feel like syrup. I have to dilute OJ and apple juice or I can't drink it. </p>
<p>Same w Gatorade. It's all sickeningly sweet.</p></div>		</li>
