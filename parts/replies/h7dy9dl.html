			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I wish we had strongly defined seasons like that. It must be nice to know that you will definitely get snow in winter and sunshine in summer. You can enjoy winter activities and summer activities. </p>
<p>But yeah, that much of a variation between summer and winter would be really tough to handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've lived beside Minnesota my whole life, and that's only partially true. Can't enjoy much outside when it's 30 to 50 below 0 or 110+ (F of course, being filthy colonials). With the joy of climate change those &quot;extremes&quot; keep being longer and longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Born and raised in MN. Finally had enough last year and moved to FL. No regrets.</p>
<p>Summers in MN are fantastic, but winters are beyond brutal. I had snow so high on the side of the house that it touched the roof. My dog could just walk over our 6 foot fence.</p>
<p>The first Christmas down here was so weird. We went to the pool.</p></div>		</li>
