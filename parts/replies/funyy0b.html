			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may have misread OP's point (or I could have).  I thought they had implied fossilized remains from proto-chimpanzes near in time to humanity's last common ancestor, not remains requiring only a few thousand years of preservation.  No offence intended and I could be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article seemed to imply they were the first fossils as a general rule (interestingly enough found near to a human fossil as well). I could definitely be misinterpreting though as it's rather late here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;proto-chimpanzee&quot; wouldn't necessarily be recognizable as such.</p>
<p>It would just be another hominid fossil with no indication of what it would be like if it survived today... just like with many of the other hominid fossils we find from around the time of the split and both before and after.</p>
<p>What would, for example <em>Paranthropus boisei</em> be like if its lineage had survived until today.  Would it be something like us, like a gorilla, like an ape version of a Chalicothere, an ape version of an <em>Arctodus</em>, or a shrub and tree eating version of a Gelada (<em>Theropithecus gelada</em>)?  We don't have any way of telling what direction evolution would have pushed them.</p>
<p>The same is true of any &quot;proto-&quot; fossil.  They are only &quot;proto-&quot; in the context of modern, extant species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct that 1000 years may not be an accurate timeframe, but look at the bigger question.  I'd chimpanzees went extinct, just prior to written language arriving in the area (whenever this may have been), then the only record we'd have would be the local oral stories.  We'd dismiss it as some odd legend of a race of &quot;tree hobbits&quot; or something, having no idea that they actually existed.  Particularly if you consider how the local names might have translated, like Orangutan translating from Malay as &quot;Man of the Forest&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't have. Homo refers to the genus, and it is often debated if taxonomy is still applicable in the modern day and age, but generally speaking: to be a Homo you need certain attributes. It's not just some arbitrary &quot;latin name&quot;, it's a tool for classification. One common attribute for members of Homo would be the use of processed stone tools, an attribute Pan lacks, among a few others. However, they are members of the Hominidae.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, Bonobos are NOT a subspecies of Chimpanzee! (Bonobo researchers had to fight hard for that one).
There's been some debate as to whether the 4-5 different <em>P. Troglodytes</em> subspecies actually qualify as subspecies, even. Though, I haven't done major research into chimpanzees in a couple of years, so that may have all been cleared up with more DNA testing.</p></div>		</li>
