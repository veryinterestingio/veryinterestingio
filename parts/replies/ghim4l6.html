			<div class="markdown"><p>In a biomanufacturing facility. Genentech has a massive bio manufacturing facility in Vacaville where it manufactures DNA strands to be used in its insulin drugs, and other biotech small molecules. You can synthesize RNA from a DNA template. Once the reproduction of RNA from the master template, the biological production continues as long as it continues to be “fed.” Think of rows of bio bath containers (vats) in clean rooms. Google Genentech Vacaville for some images of the facility. It is huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for pointing this out.</p>
<p>Just some corrections. The Vacaville facility doesn't make RNA or DNA to add to insulin. We don't make insulin anymore, though you are right that Genentech tackled insulin in the 80s as the first biotech application (proving that biotechnology is lucrative and can work). Genentech was the first.</p>
<p>The Vacaville facility is a manufacturing site. I can't say what we make there though, but the site is huge. Also, Vacaville site is not where insulin was made when it was being made because we didn't have the site until recently. All manufacturing back then was in our site in South San Francisco where the rest of the company still exists. I saw news as well that Genentech has put plans in with the city to expand over the next decade or so. We shall see.</p>
<p>Back to the vaccine:</p>
<p>The COVID vaccine is mRNA which is then encapsulated in a lipid vesicle. This type of innovation is old-ish, but this is a first to be sold, so much like insulin for Genentech, the mRNA vaccine is a much heralded innovation that has now been proven to have a true application for Moderna and Pfizer. This won't be the last we see mRNA being used as a therapeutic or vaccine. Hopefully, those companies or others can get a better formulation that won't require frozen temps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Too expensive and not high enough fidelity with phosphoramidite synthesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up polymerase chain reaction or PCR.  If you have an idea of how RNA and DNA replicate you’ll be able to understand it.  Basically we use the same mechanism that our bodies use to replicate DNA (or produce RNA).  The chemicals that form DNA or RNA are extremely common both in nature and produced synthetically.</p></div>		</li>

Only a few people will have access to the rooms at any time, but even fewer when production is occurring.  The rooms will also be thoroughly cleaned between each &quot;batch&quot; of production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any pharmaceutical that us going to be injected into your body is produced in a clean room. You don't want any random viruses or bacteria just floating around among the dust in the air getting into the final product (eg: coworker comes in sick). Or in the case of bio-pharma -&gt; you don't want anything foreign getting into your cell growth medium and infecting the cells you're trying to grow.</p>
<p>We're talking ISO class 7 down to ISO class 5 and all exposed surfaces wiped down with alcohol once a day. All personal will be wearing &quot;bunny suits&quot;. Any pipelines or containers are sterilized with 120°C steam for 20 minutes before use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the clean room in bio-med field if it the same as the semi-con industry. I used to work in a clean room (semi-con), it is a heavily controlled environment production line. </p>
<p>Dust, air pressure, ESD, number of personnel, personnel's attire (bunny suit) etc. are heavily monitored and maintained. This is for the manufacturing of sensitive devices. You don't want to introduce outside elements that might affect the product.</p></div>		</li>
