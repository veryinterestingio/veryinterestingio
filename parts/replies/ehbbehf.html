			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on that:</p>
<p>A full-size camera sensor is 36mm x 24mm.  A phone's camera sensor is 4.8mm x 3.5mm.   That means a full-frame camera has about 51.5 times more light sensing capability.</p>
<p>A traditional camera's lens has lots of moving parts for many optical properties. This means a traditional camera's lens can actually zoom the view with light rather than cropping the image for 'digital zoom', and the traditional lens has an actual physical aperture to control depth of field and light exposure instead of faking it with blurring where it thinks it saw depth and scaling the brightness like phones will do. The dedicated camera also tends to have far better (and more expensive) sensor hardware to handle low lighting and other difficult conditions.</p>
<p>Attaching two tiny sensors and doing a bunch of math can give a better image and more options than a single tiny sensor, but it is still no substitute for a bigger sensor and better lens.  A skilled photographer can still use their knowledge to capture good images with the phone, but the updated phone still can't really compete with a dedicated camera.</p>
<p>It is nice that they're trying to help people take better pictures.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadn‚Äôt even considered all of this. I always just accept that my phone takes lower quality pictures than a camera but it‚Äôs nice to know why. Also I didn‚Äôt get any elitism from this. I thought it was a good compare &amp; contrast. Just wanted to share that </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify a bit further, standalone cameras like DSLRs have much better sensors, but they're essentially a bigger version of the same tech.  Phone sensors may have fairly high megapixel counts, but the pixels are small, so the amount of light that falls on them is less, and they're more noisy.</p>
<p>Phones don't have bigger sensors because they would require bigger lenses, with more depth than the camera body.  There are optical limitations with small lenses as well- especially diffraction. </p>
<p>The only solution other than a thicker device is to combine multiple images from multiple lenses and sensors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have an old CRT TV that I play my old games on. I don't have the remote for it, so I've been using the IR remote app on my phone. Just recently got a new phone, but it doesn't have IR, so I gotta keep the old phone around and charged up just to function as a TV remote. lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your iPhone already has a barometer, thermometer, and infrared detection. </p>
<p>It's just that the barometer isn't calibrated, so it only measures recent changes in relative pressure, mostly used to determine changes in altitude.  </p>
<p>And the thermometer is internal, so it can only <a href="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/iOS/ios12-iphone-x-iphone-temperature-alert.jpg" target="_blank">measure the heat of certain components</a>, not the ambient air.  </p>
<p>And the cameras easily detect infrared light - go look at a TV remote through the camera while you're pressing buttons on it.</p>
<p>Now, if you want a spectrometer, I'm afraid that's not built in to the iPhone - you need to <a href="https://www.consumerphysics.com/" target="_blank">buy one and plug it in</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had a small freak out for a moment just there, because there‚Äôs <em>no</em> way you could possibly make a pocket size mass spec with exisiting technology.</p>
<p>Then I realised you‚Äôd linked to a pocket sized near-IR spectrometer (which is still fairly impressive). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but I want to be able to ask Siri what the temperature is of the room/park, etc I am in/at is, what the current barometric pressure of the exact area I am in is, and be able to visually detect variances in heat on my screen where I‚Äôm pointing my phone.

<p>Well I mean these are basic photography concepts, not made-up marketing shit so to have this ability in a smaller package gives content creators a lot of flexibility. Hell, Soderberg just shot his Netflix movie on an iPhone 8 and it looks pretty good considering.</p></div>		</li>
