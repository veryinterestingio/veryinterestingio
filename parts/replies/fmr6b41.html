			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this mean the virus can effectively “travel” to different sites of the body, using cell types expressing ACE2 as its “road”? But that study does say blood vessel endothelium has ACE2 receptors, so if the virus gets to a blood vessel following intramuscular injection, it could probably eventually get to any site in the body. Maybe except through the BBB. </p>
<p>This finally could explain to me why mucous membranes of the eye should be protected, according to recent guidelines to wear eye protection. If there is a pathway of cells from the eye to the lung that all express ACE2, that may allow the virus to get to the lung and still lead to pneumonia and ARDS and eventually death.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s important to emphasize that there is no data or evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and there have been no reported cases of transmissions for any respiratory virus, including this coronavirus, worldwide. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'd think that if it could jump organ systems via blood, especially to the respiratory tract, it could infect people via blood transfusion.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It definitely travels to different sites in the body, but it doesn't need an ACE-2 &quot;road&quot;. One cell full of virus particles bursts, and off the all go into the bloodstream. If there's lots of ACE-2 receptors nearby, they probably won't get far. But there's always a chance for them to float off and find some ACE-2 receptors elsewhere.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from lung, kidneys, GI, and testes. There's also ACE-2 receptors in the brain, but I'm not aware if the virus has been isolated from brain tissue.</p></div>		</li>
