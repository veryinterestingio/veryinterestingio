<p>This topic makes me think of synesthesia. Although full-on swapping sensory information is the hallmark of the condition, it is currently thought that we <em>all</em> have some level of synesthesia. Being able to comprehend symbols at all requires us to process sensory input in a non-literal way (like how hearing the word “apple” can make you immediately picture an apple.) In the same way, merely imagining an act that would create an awful feeling and/or sound can trigger the same physiological responses we’d get if we actually felt/heard the texture/sound. Fascinating stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i can't stand any metal thing..train screech, or even back in elementary school, going through the lunch line and my jacket zipper or hoodie string metal scraped the metal bars where you put your tray, i have to flail/ flap  my arms or grind my teeth or cover my ears.</p>
<p>i get sensory overload easy and some things are hard for me to ignore. I've never been diagnosed autistic but have adhd etc. i noticed i have some other tendencies. i hate eye contact. i feel uncomfortable and it feels  like a threat or challenge similar to animals. so i get submissive. i dont want trouble.  idk why i do/ feel  what i do as an adult and since childhood, but i will see a therapist when able. i recognize that it's not normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, I absolutely HATE eye contact!!! It gives me horrible anxiety, though sometimes I’m okay with it, just depends how my anxiety is acting. But yea, all of the things you listed would give the impression that you have autism. Problems with eye contact alone are a big sign of autism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I mean I can make myself do it for interviews, but sometimes I go overboard and stare too much. I know looking away makes me look shady or untrustworthy, but then I... Idk how to just be normal I guess. It's frustrating and makes job stuff hard. Otherwise, I can only do eye contact more comfortably with people I really trust to not hurt me or judge me. Friends, family, bf. Strangers not so much. I also know there's no cure for it, which sucks.  Best I could do is anxiety and depression meds maybe.</p></div>		</li>
