<p>They're a brilliant propagation model, on the contrary to what one might first assume.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Birds don't have teeth, so the seeds have a better chance of surviving going through a bird.</p>
<p>The hilarious thing is that one specific type of mammal ended up liking the heat so much, we spread the plant far more than any bird ever could. I'm sure there's even someone in Antarctica growing pepper plants in a little hydroponic garden somewhere.</p>
<p>Chili peppers have even made it to space.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good question! I've read some papers, and this is what I can come up with:</p>
<p>From the chili plant’s metabolic perspective, capsaicin wracks up a very high defense budget. The molecule is relatively large and contains lots of precious nitrogen, which is critical for building proteins and DNA. When a plant is deprived of water, it doesn't make sense for it to devote its resources and energy into producing more. In fact, capsaicin production decreases when water stressed. </p>
<p>The capsaicin accumulation in stressed fruit can be explained only through a reduction in its degradation. This means that when a plant is drying out, even though it is producing less capsaicin, at the same time less capsaicin is being oxidized, and destroyed. </p>
<p>The most likely cause of capsaicinoid loss at the start of fruit senescence is peroxidase activity, which is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide. Peroxidase activity is lower in fruits that are water stressed, leading to a slower loss of capsaicinoids. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. So it looks like my thoughts (and things I've been told about how to make spicy peppers hotter from other gardeners) are false. Proper watering should make them spicier than stressing them by withholding water.</p>
<p>I will keep them fully watered this year and see what happens.</p></div>		</li>
