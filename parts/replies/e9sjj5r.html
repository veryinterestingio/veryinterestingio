			<div class="markdown"><p>To re-emphasize the most important point in this excellent answer: <strong>we're not all gonna die.</strong>  Mass famine, war, disease, poverty are all likely, but there is no realistic scenario in which climate change alone causes humanity to go extinct.</p>
<p>And when thinking about the impact on you personally: the fact that you're reading Reddit means you're among the wealthier and more privileged people on the planet, who are the least likely to suffer the worst effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not have the source right now, but I believe it was Neil deGrasse Tyson who said we cannot conduct civilization like we used to. Majority of civilization lives off the coastal areas and rivers, they would be affected by floods, tsunamis and storms.</p>
<p>Crops and animal farming would not be sustainable in its current form if they die due to environmental changes. Where I live (in the tropics) the temperatures have risen so sharply that its uninhabitable without an air conditioner. Floods, landslides and inland storms are a common occurrence now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ocean is also getting warmer and more acidic, and oxygen levels are dropping. None of that is good for ocean ecosystems. Add in plastic, fertilizer, and other pollution and it's getting less and less fish friendly</p></div>		</li>
