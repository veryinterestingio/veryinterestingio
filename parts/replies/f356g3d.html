			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why so called &quot;dirty bombs&quot; are as feared as they are. A dirty bomb doesn't even entail an actual nuclear detonation; instead, it's designed to spread radioactive isotopes (something like caesium-137, strontium 90, etc) by way of conventional explosives. </p>
<p>In other words, you won't get that sun-like flash and mushroom cloud, and you <em>also</em> won't get the huge burst of harmful gamma radiation that would accompany a proper nuke. With other nuclear weapons, that initial exposure is going to account for most of the radiological hazard. There will be fallout, sure, but as I think someone else mentioned, the radiation levels at Hiroshima were more or less safe (that is, it wouldn't kill you via organ failure) within a few weeks.</p>
<p>With a dirty bomb, the fallout sticks around for a while. Depending on exactly what's in it, it could be hundreds of years before the site of such a bombing - or anything that leaves the site - is safe to be around. It's still emmitting that deadly radiation, the kind that basically causes cells to commit suicide en masse. </p>
<p>Think of it this way: with a conventional nuke, if you can somehow escape the first week without getting exposed to the outside environment, you're probably going to live. With a dirty bomb, your great-grandchildren will die of old age inside whatever lead-lined bunker they were born in, unless they want to see if they're cut out to be the next Bruce Banner.</p></div>		</li>
