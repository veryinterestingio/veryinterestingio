			<div class="markdown"><p>I always read a book before I fall asleep. When the words stop making any sense (they're a word salad or I try to introduce nonsense dream logic into the book) I know I am asleep, so I just put it away and close my eyes. After that I don't remember anything anymore. It happens almost every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same happens to me with podcasts.  I listen until one of two things happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am no longer able to concentrate on the words being spoken, or, less commonly:</li>
<li>The words start sounding like gibberish</li>
</ul>
<p>I will then put the AirPods away and almost instantly go into deep sleep.  (Unless I did something dumb like exercise vigorously in the late evening.)</p></div>		</li>
