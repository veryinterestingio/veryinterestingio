			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17019055/" target="_blank">Yep! </a>. Though it's not strictly due to the age at which the cells are created, but the number of times since birth a cell line has split to make two cells. Females (in all the species I'm aware of) do almost their producing of new oocyte during embryonic development. There's one more division step before the egg matures, but that's just a +1 to the number of divisions on all their eggs. Males don't produce their sperm in advance - they produce them as they go, continuously, discarding unused cells. So, if you were to compare the number of germline mutations in infants, you'd probably see more in females, since all their divisions happened already. Males will quickly over take them though.</p></div>		</li>
