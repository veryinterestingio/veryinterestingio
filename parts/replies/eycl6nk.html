			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going through the process of trying to identify is the reason I am collapsing without loss of consciousness (but also there are no muscle jerks) is due to atonic seizures or another type of epilepsy.</p>
<p>I have truly been overwhelmed by how little it turns out we know about the brain, and by how many types of seizures there are. My first response when seizures were mentioned by a neurologist was, “flashing lights and video games don’t affect me, I can’t have epilepsy”.</p>
<p>I have trouble with repeating patterns, like on some carpets, and on people’s clothing. Striped business shirts, checkered pants - high contrast patterns that are moving all about the place makes me feel really ill. I’d be interested to know if there’s anyone here with epilepsy who has had a similar experience, or if there’s anyone else out there with a similar experience but no epilepsy diagnosis.</p>
<p>I reeeeeeeally want to be able to drive again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a form of epilepsy as well, and have given up on driving even though my problem is somehow linked to something cncerning breakfast - it nearly always happens at breakfast for some reason. Though now I wonder if its something to do with the visuals of the cereal in the bowl, I often become fixated with tunnel vision with the movement of the spoon interacting with the milk and the cereal as it starts to set it... It's not only that as I have had seizures at other times, but it's the first time I thought about visual patterns being a cause. Stress is also a factor which definitely makes me more prone.</p>
<p>I was told that basically epilepsy is some bad wiring in there somewhere, so everyone's problem is different because it just depends where your neurons are messed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many types of seizures occur much more often soon after waking up, so your breakfast thing is likely to be one of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, you made me remember all of the struggles me and my family had to go through when I started experiencing my first seizures/collapses. After two years of different tests and analysis it was really hard for the doctors to diagnose epilepsy because I also had no muscle jerks and sometimes I would not even pass out, I would just talk total nonsense while being totally disoriented and scared. These things made me extremely anxious and much less social. In the end the doctor told me that the biggest trigger to my epilepsy was lack of sleep, overall body exhaustion, that is why I try to get as much sleep and food now. I am on Depakine now and am happy to say that I am 2 years of seizure/collapsing-free. </p>
<p>Also can relate on the driving part, it was 2 months until my driving license, and when I got diagnosed they banned me from driving, unless I don't get any seizures in a 1 year span.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually do get a bad headache before I collapse. When you say it used to, does that mean you don’t get migraines anymore? Was there a treatment you could do that stopped them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only learned this a couple of years ago when my housemate who is epileptic told me. I suppose I was only really aware of photosensitive epilepsy because of warnings on TV or before performances etc. Her epilepsy is triggered by stress, eating gluten (as she’s coeliac) and when she’s generally unwell she has seizures. I imagine there’s a whole load of triggers dependant on the person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are stereotypes associated with epilepsy.  Flashing lights causing seizures and people rolling around the floor jerking are two very common ones.  In reality there are a huge range of triggers and severity.  While someone can be rolling around the floor and jerking, you could equally be sitting right beside someone having a seizure and you would not even know.  Their seizure might be just blanking out for a few seconds, and nobody would even notice.  If you noticed anything at all, it might appear they were just daydreaming.  The whole thing could last just seconds.  There are great extremes between those two kinds of seizures.  </p>
<p>It is also said that anyone can have a seizure in their lifetime, but it is those that have recurring seizures that are diagnosed as having epilepsy.  It is said that about 1 in every 200 people have some form of epilepsy.  That could include people you know but you might not know they have it, mainly because you never saw them having a seizure.  Given the nature of the condition, 99.9% of the time, someone with epilepsy is perfect and there is no evidence that they have it that you can see or that they can show you.  &quot;I never knew you had it&quot; and &quot;I have never seen you have a seizure&quot; are common phrases that people hear when they tell someone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>
<p>I can have a seizure and no one would know that I am having it.</p>
<p>In fact, I had a seizure at a friend's house and they told me to stfu because they thought I was messing with them (they totally apologized once they knew I wasn't joking).</p>
<p>Definitely more mystical, in my opinion. It's what I call dream streaming, followed by deja vu and an impending sense of doom, auras, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had a few recurring seizures prior to having a “real” seizure - I thought that they were panic attacks. The whole experience felt like an extremely strong sense of deja vu, followed by a terrifying feeling of impending doom. In one day I had 5 at work, most during meetings and no one could tell. I felt very tired afterward so went into my office, closed the door and set an alarm on my watch for 10 mins. 40+ mins later I awoke disoriented and on the floor - the owner of the company told HR he “heard me snoring in my office” - why they let me continue to “sleep” was beyond me. </p>
<p>The worst part was, I just thought I was sick and extremely tired so I drove myself home and fell asleep for a couple hours. I didn’t think anything of it until I woke up at home and realized how strange is was to wake up on the floor of my office. I am lucky to have a couple neurologist in the family who were able to give me advise. Ever since I’ve been on the seizure meds and they suck - constantly tired and more easily irritated. In your experience when did this go away? It’s only been two months since the incident and they’ve been slowly getting me to a therapeutic dose (currently on levetiracetam 3,000 daily - 1,500 2xday). </p>
<p>Did you feel generally confused (as I have dubbed, spaghetti brained) after any episodes?</p>
<p>What meds do they have you taking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure your first statement is true. My son was tested at Yale Hospital, Neurological . They induced seizures and diagnosed him as having Psychogenic Nonepilectic Seizures (PNES) rather than epilepsy. Real seizures but not related to abnormal electrical in the brain. About 20% of people who get tested in these  epilepsy evaluation tests ( takes a week long hospital stay) are diagnosed with PNES.</p></div>		</li>
