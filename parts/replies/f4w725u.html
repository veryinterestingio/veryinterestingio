			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting take, as someone who struggled with depression I came to a very similar, but more abstract solution; I'd envision my mind as a landscape, my thoughts being a water spring at the center that's always flowing and changing the landscape. I couldn't stop the flow, but I realized I could direct it. </p>
<p>I envisioned depression as a canyon that formed when I was inattentive and let my thoughts flow in a negative direction too much. To get out of the canyon takes time, but if I kept mindfully nudging the flow of water away from negative areas it would then create newer, healthier formations.</p>
<p>I think in both cases, mindfulness is key, forming a habit of quarantining bad emotions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a similar vein, I personally found it helped to regard my depression as adversarial; something that I could expect to lie to me and try to hurt me, that was so close to my core that it was hard to distinguish from myself but that was categorically not <em>me</em>. </p>
<p>For others, it may feel worse to believe that some of their thoughts are not their own, but for me it recontextualized my condition <em>as</em> a condition, rather than as my own beliefs or (god forbid) the truth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I try to remind myself that depression is just a bully that wants me to feel bad about myself. I've dealt with bullies my whole life, I can ignore them. This gets me through the passing negative thoughts fairly well.</p>
<p>...but when it's really bad, this externalization hurts more than it helps. Because I <strong>have</strong> dealt with bullies my whole life. And this time, I can't tell an adult or just cut a toxic friend or abusive partner out of my life. This time, there's only one way to get rid of my bully....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a beautiful image, thank you. Started my own medication up again recently and anticipate that this will be rather helpful.</p>
<p>What helped me to get through OCPD as a kid was to imagine negative thoughts as clouds in the sky. Can’t do anything about them, but you can choose to just let them pass, as clouds are wont to do, rather than fixate on them while they’re hanging over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My layman’s opinion is that both of you ended up applying, perhaps unknowingly techniques of cognitive behavioural therapy. Roughly and perhaps unfairly simplified that form of therapy aims to creating healthy coping mechanisms, essentially ways of thinking that “trick” the brain into a different mindset or train of thought. </p>
<p>I personally went weekly to a therapist for a 1,5 year period, that was absolutely revolutionary. </p>
<p>My depression is heavily affected by seasons and as I live in Finland, the winter is long and sometimes harsh. Many things clicked during therapy but few of the discoveries fall to the same category, so to speak. </p>
<p>Firstly, there is an image of a goose or a duck. And how water flies over the feathers of a water bird. The duck can’t stop rain but it’s feathers are water resistant. The water just trickles over?l and the duck doesn’t even get that wet. And similarly my emotions come and they go. It <em>will</em> pass, feelings change. </p>
<p>Secondly, there’s The Myth of Sisyphus by Camus. Sisyphus is doomed to roll a boulder up a hill only to see it roll again to the root and to begin climbing again. I’m just going to quote Wikipedia here, cause the explanation there is better than mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the stone falls back down the mountain Camus states that &quot;It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end.&quot; This is the truly tragic moment, when the hero becomes conscious of his wretched condition. He does not have hope, but &quot;there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.&quot; Acknowledging the truth will conquer it; Sisyphus, just like the absurd man, keeps pushing. Camus claims that when Sisyphus acknowledges the futility of his task and the certainty of his fate, he is freed to realize the absurdity of his situation and to reach a state of contented acceptance. With a nod to the similarly cursed Greek hero Oedipus, Camus concludes that &quot;all is well,&quot; indeed, that &quot;one must imagine Sisyphus happy.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Winter will come, my feelings will be worse at some point. These are some of the cycles my life goes through regularly. It is patently absurd that chemicals in my brain and the tilting of the planetary axis fuck me up. Why not then don the cape of an absurd hero?</p>
<p>Thirdly, there’s aesthetics. I have some artistic inclinations and studied photography some time before dropping out. I take great pleasure in natural and “unnatural” beauty. Since winter had been so hateful, I had associated ugliness with it. But with therapy, I came to will myself to turn my analytical eye to it. I methodically searched beauty in the thing I hated. The light glittering in snow that hangs on branches, the forms snow makes when it covers hills and lakes and when it is pushed to banks by the wind. All that. And it made things easier. Instead of a formless monster I could see a thing of sad beauty. Delectable pain. </p>
<p>I’m not “cured” but I’m fine, I’m good. And I’m always really happy to hear how others have found ways to cope. All the best to you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“Always remember, child&quot; her first teacher had impressed on her, &quot;that to think bad thoughts is really the easiest thing in the world. If you leave your mind to itself it will spiral you down into ever-increasing unhappiness. To think good thoughts, however, requires effort. This is one of the things that need disipline –training- is about. So train your mind to dwell on sweet perfumes, the touch of this silk, tender raindrops against the shoji, the curve of the flower arrangement, the tranquillity of dawn. Then, at length, you won't have to make such a great effort and you will be of value to yourself,…”

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good for you. I definitely recommend medication. Even better if you have have behavioral therapy to accompany the meds. I remind ppl not to look down on behavioral meds. Just as a diabetic has a faulty pancreas and needs insulin, the brain is also an organ, which can become sick, and can also need medication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  I've read stuff that says SSRI's don't really do much of anything, but for me personally they've been a lifesaver.  Pretty much literally.  Venlafaxine has been the golden ticket for me.  It was the fourth SSRI I tried and thank god it was the one that helped.  Keeps me on an even keel and feeling like the &quot;me&quot; I'm meant to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congrats! I'm not OP but I'm also on a similar journey - you should totally take this perspective to heart. Mindfulness is a truly an amazing tool to help you climb your way out of the hole, and there's actually a lot of literature out there about mindfulness techniques. I've been through therapy and that never really worked for me, but I've been practicing mindfulness for only about 3 months now and I haven't been this happy in at least a decade. And of course, medication can be such a big help too. Best of luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey thank you both so much. I was on medication for years (SSRI for clinical depression), and went off thinking I was fine, but really I needed it more than I thought. I struggle with depression but also with anxiety so bad that I currently am not employed, left school, etc. But I'm functioning again and getting my life together with therapy too. I think a lot of people hear stuff like that and think if someone is medicated they must be crazy, but honestly depression and severe panic attacks are so normal and should be managed not shamed. I get the feeling crazy/ feeling like I'm dying type panic attacks and had them daily lately so felt so discouraged, but hearing other people's stories like this truly help. I think I'm more afraid of feeling alone, than actually having depression or anxiety when I really think about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man the come downs from a weekend of racing and MDMA use is brutal. I think that’s the closest I’ve ever had to feeling depressed or that emptiness feeling and I gotta say if there are people out there who just feel like that randomly and all the time I completely understand the torture they must go through and never wanting to deal with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually feels better coming down from MDMA, at least for me, because I can justify why I feel like that as &quot;yeah it's the come down&quot; and not something that's inherently my fault or out of my control.</p></div>		</li>
