			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you can do it, but it's at the cost of accuracy. Technically you can try to measure anything with parallax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This made me realize that an AU is actually from the <em>center</em> of the Earth to the <em>center</em> of the Sun (which makes a ton of sense), and of course, is the <em>mean distance</em> (given the ellipsoidal shape of our orbit). I know it accounts for a fraction of the distance, but then if you also think about the elliptical shape of the orbit, you also then have to account for the time of year as well if you need accuracy in your measurement (of course).</p>
<p>Very interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the time of year is accounted for, and as for the 'center' stuff, it doesn't really end up mattering that much. ~10^8 miles vs ~10^5, and parallax already isn't a very precise thing int he first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not accounting for that over those 6 months, Mars has also moved about 2.5 AU (arc, not chord).</p>
<p>In terms of RA, since sky position is what's measured, Mars right now has an RA of 1h38m, and in 6 months in September, it will have an RA of 9h48m.</p>
<p>Mars also will have had two very different distances from the earth. Right now, it's actually about 1.6 AU away, and in September it'll be about 2.7 AU away.</p>
<p>So the 'parallax' measured for Mars ends up being like 120 degrees (if we ignore the obvious problems here). Running that through the equation for parallax, which is d = 1/p with d in parsecs and p in arcseconds (432000 for 120 degrees), we find that the distance from Mars to the Sun is 0.000002 parsecs, or about half an AU, putting Mars well inside Venus' orbit.</p>
<p>Which is why the parallax method is <em>not</em> accurately done for planets in our solar system when separated out by 6 months apart.</p></div>		</li>
