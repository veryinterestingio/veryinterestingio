			<div class="markdown"><p>The password database is encrypted and the hacker will decipher that if he has it. Then enter it once on the application. The more complicated your password the harder this is to do, up to not being possible before the heat death of the universe. </p>
<p>I used “password” as a password for something that had no sensitive information attached to it, besides my email address. Somebody is emailing me now telling me they hacked this password and they are going to do bad things to me if I don’t pay them bitcoin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's still worth doing but it's also important to point out that you should not reuse this password or a variation of it. not only do you not know if it's stored with good encryption ( it's often not), but even if it is then an attacker could modify the application to save your password the next time you authenticate.</p>
<p>so you just want to assume any given account will eventually be compromised and make sure that when it is, compromising the rest of your accounts isn't as easy as trying the same email and password on all popular services</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a second reason: <em>Humans are lazy as hell.</em></p>
<p>Here's this neat little list: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 2016 edition, the 25 most common passwords made up more than 10% of the surveyed passwords, with the most common password of 2016, &quot;123456&quot;, making up 4%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a website doesn't require complicated password rules, a good amount of people just default to some lazy password, and anyone who managed to copy the database can crack those &gt;10% passwords in a few seconds(not a few seconds for each, <em>a few seconds for the WHOLE database</em>).</p></div>		</li>

<p>As opposed to websites that do require complicated passwords, where those people default to the same password, but with 2020! appended to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of locking out the user after a few unsuccessful attempts, the system should simply only allow one attempt every minute after that.  After a few more tries, one attempt every 5 minutes, etc.</p>
<p>That way, the user can still figure it out without jumping through a bunch of hoops (although the hoops can still exist for those that legit forgot their password) but dictionary attacks would take centuries/millenniums.</p></div>		</li>
