			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont make it a quickie. You got to spend time on yourself and really draw it out long. </p>
<p>When you make your face blush and your whole body goes limp and you are in a cloud then you did it right. It should feel like a warm fuzzy blanket is wrapped around you.</p>
<p>The only way to OD on oxytocin and endorphins is if you give your body time to prepare it all.</p>
<p>If you just shoot it out in 2 minutes as fast as you can get there forcing it half the time then you're just going to feel guilty and you wont feel the lasting after effects.</p>
<p>Just like a movie plot. A good rising action leading up to the climax, the release, and ride the conclusion all the way into darkness. </p>
<p>A bad movie rushes everything, weakly climaxes, and the rest of it is pointless and cliff hanging.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy hell guys thank you for coming to class today. I can't believe my 15 minutes happened while I was at work. A big thank you to my sponsors. Through discipline there is bliss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hot showers actually lower your core body temperature.  Naturally your body also lowers it's core temperature in preparation for sleep.  So hot showers before bed are really good at helping your body (and mind) prepare for sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't quite right - hot showers raise your core body temperature, which then drops back down after wards making you feel sleepy as, as you said, your body lowers its core body temperature in preparation for sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you could be either dehydrated or deficient in some minerals, like potassium or magnesium salts, or possibly so sleep deprived that you're sleeping like a stone and not moving at all all night and getting pain from compressing your joints all night. It could be that it's time for a new mattress- whatever the cause, that's not a normal way to be feeling in the morning and it might be an idea to raise it with your doctor, if something as simple as new pillows doesn't seem the likely cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this exact problem for years. Then I was diagnosed with sleep apnea, got a CPAP, and wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go.</p>
<p>I was breathing through my mouth and ended up getting severely dehydrated over the course of the night. I'd wake up with intense muscle pain and tension that only a glass of water and a hot shower would help.</p>
<p>Go see your doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>some of those sleeping assistance recordings actually guide you through tensing each muscle in your body one after another and then releasing all together, the cumulative relaxation helps get you to that state too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been meaning to try this, rather than relaxing my entire body at once i feel like i'd do better by selectively shutting the joints down and telling myself I know it's relaxed as to try not to continually shift around to find something really comfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine a point on the tip of my head, then slowly move it down my body. A ring engulfs me as I do this, and where the ring passes I mindfully unclench muscles that have (unknowingly) been carrying tension. Most nights I pass my shoulders and am somewhere in my upper back before I'm fully asleep.
I do this while I'm working for my face and neck also- it's insane to me how those muscles bunch up through the day</p></div>		</li>
