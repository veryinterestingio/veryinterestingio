			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition... if insider trading <em>weren't</em> illegal it would essentially be giving free money to stock owners whose stock is tanking because <em>they</em> committed a crime, or were dangerously negligent. </p>
<p>Imagine you're on the board of ACME Products and you have been committing massive financial fraud on your customers, or ignoring environmental safety regulations and you've now caused a massive health issue in a local community. You cover it up as long as you can but when you know the news is finally about to leak out, you sell your stock before it crashes. It's easy to see why that's illegal - why should an unethical CEO be able to make millions of dollars from the news getting out that they are a scumbag?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You could even short the stock (essentially make a bet that it's going to fall in price)  and time exactly when you made the announcement that will crash the share price, to make sure you turn a profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example would be the Volkswagen diesel emission scandal, or &quot;Dieselgate&quot; as some newspapers coined it. There was a massive investigation by German authorities whether  some executives in VW sold stock prior to the event going public. The news caused the stock price fall 20% the first day, 12% the second day and another 10% the third day. Don't know if any got charged tho.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then ask if it’s really actually illegal or just technically illegal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been actually illegal since 1934, though it is worth noting that the law at the time pertained almost exclusively the officials in the publically traded company itself. The law was also rarely prosecuted prior to the 80's.</p>
<p>Government officials were specifically NOT covered by the law though (I know, strange right? Why would CONGRESS leave themselves out of a law affecting everyone else?).</p>
<p>This, however, did change in 2012, where a new law was passed that SPECIFICALLY outlined members of Congress as being prohibited from using what they learned from their confidential briefings to guide their personal stock purchases/sales.</p>
<p>The law passed 96-3 in the Senate. One of those 3 against? Richard Burr.  One of the 4 currently being investigated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, the difficulty in this situation is proving they sold their shares based on insider information. There was plenty of evidence that the spread was bad in China, so it's very easy to claim the shares were sold based on public information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We all knew about China to some extent. </p>
<p>We didn't know how bad the government was poised to deal with it or how they were going to deal with it. On the other hand they were in control of very mechanisms that would affect the economy.They were privy to information that was not public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where the problem is. I had no inside information. I was watching the news and had a hunch, so I sold most of mine. (Small time investor on an app, not nearly these senators lvl). Its coming out alot sold stock in retail and service sectors and moved to health. Which was a reasonable trade with public knowledge. (They also are still likely to have lost atleast alittle if they did this). But so proving first they had insider knowledge, then it has to be proven they made the trades based solely or mostly on that knowledge and not publicly available knowledge. So unless they find email traffic or witnesses saying that's what they did it's unlikely to go any where. </p>
<p>Ps email is how they got Martha Stewart if I recall.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Martha Stewart went to jail for insider trading. If it’s good enough for Martha...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well didn’t articles say they sold their stocks literally after having private meetings about major information that was yet release to the public. Like they sold off stock that had to do with tourist lodging Companies, stock they knew would tank. Also started to buy stock in virtual companies, something similar to Zoom</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And they continued to downplay concerns over the virus to the public. </p>
<p>It was public knowledge that China was having a rough time. It absolutely was not public knowledge that the US government felt it was going to go through the same thing. Combine that with the reassurances and the timing of the sell-offs and there's your case.</p></div>		</li>
