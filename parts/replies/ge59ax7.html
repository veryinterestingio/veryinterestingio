			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wear compression pants long enough on and off for weeks does the blood flow regulate around the body then or does it pool back into the legs again?</p>
<p>What would happen if you wear compression gear for long periods of time everyday?
What would happen if you wear compression gear covering your entire body? lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blood pooling that people wear compression gear for is pathological- it's a medical condition usually caused by failure of the one-way valves in the blood vessels of the legs to maintain flow back up to the heart. As long as those valves aren't working properly, the blood will continue to pool without the aid of compression gear. </p>
<p>Pilots performing high-g force maneuvers also utilize a different type of compression gear to prevent blood from pooling in their legs under the force of high gravity. </p>
<p>If you were to compression over your entire body, you'd expect to increase your blood pressure but also restrict your breathing as your chest must be able to expand in order to fill your lungs.</p></div>		</li>
