			<div class="markdown"><p>why's HDL being good and LDL being bad cholesterol wrong? HDL is good because it removes excess cholesterol and lipids from body cells including arteries and transport it to the liver for elimination. LDL is bad because it deposits cholesterol in and around smooth muscle fibers in arteries, forming fatty plaques that increase risk of coronary artery disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So HDL and LDL are not cholesterol. They are transporters for cholesterol (and triglycerides) in your body. Think of them as cargo ships, with cholesterol being the cargo and your blood vessels being the ocean.</p>
<p>Both LDL and HDL are essential for life. Without cholesterol being distributed in your body as required you would die really rather rapidly. It's not the depositing of cholesterol that causes a build up of plaque, but the oxidation of the LDL molecules which prevents the LDL from being reabsorbed into the liver. This causes LDL to stay in the bloodstream longer than it should, continuing to deposit cholesterol, and this is why you end up with smaller sized LDL particles. It's these smaller sized ones that end up penetrating the endothelial layer and end up involved in the  atherosclerotic process. </p>
<p>The point is, high LDL cholesterol is not a problem if it's a lot of young large LDL particles. But if it's a lot of older, smaller LDL particles, that's indicative of a problem. All of which is to say LDL-C, which is what is measured in a standard cholesterol panel, is not a good measure of risk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that’s really annoying.  I go in for my annual physical and they always run that standard panel and it says ok your HDL should be in this range, your LDL in this range etc.  You are saying there is much more to it than that, yet primary care docs are prescribing statins based off of that lipid panel.  Seems like some people are on statins that don’t need to be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High LDL measurements are indicative of atherosclerosis and as you state LDL-C is measured as its metric. While smaller sizes of LDL are more atherogenic, roughly a 10% increase in LDL-C gives rise to a 20% increase in risk for atherosclerosis. The idea is that the smaller the LDL size the easier it is for LDL to infiltrate the epithelial layer of the arteries, it doesn't mean larger LDL molecules cannot. Most cholesterol is transported via LDL and therefore a total reduction in cholesterol leads to a reduction in LDL. HDL is a independent negative risk factor. </p>
<p>HDL and LDL transport cholesterol. IDL, VDL and chylomicrons transport cholesterol and triglycerides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hesitate to put it into my own words, so here's <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/tomdayspring1/" target="_blank">Dr Peter Attia and Dr Tom Dayspring's conversation excerpt</a>:</p>
<p>Peter Attia: But elevated levels of HDL-cholesterol are necessarily a good thing. That’s a fact that I think used to be deemed a fact, based on the epidemiology of Framingham. I think today anyone who’s serious about the study of lipidology would say, that’s grossly oversimplified, potentially incorrect (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17684448" target="_blank">Dayspring, 2007</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24079290" target="_blank">Toth et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<p>Tom Dayspring: That’s certainly one of the all-time facts that really disappeared. I personally think it’s a waste of time to even put it in the lipid profile, other than it’s used in certain calculations that are popular nowadays, like non-HDL cholesterol. But I encourage no one to ever make a judgment on any human’s cardiovascular risk, based on their high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, or think you know what you’re doing to a human being if you somehow change that HDL-cholesterol metric in that patient: has nothing to do with anything, to be honest.</p>
<hr />
<p>Toth, in particular, goes over it. Therapeutically, elevating HDL-C does not correlate to reducing athrogenic risk. There might be an optimal level pt to pt, but as a method of reducing CVD risk factors, there are better primary, secondard, and tertiary targets at this time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doc here. There is something called the Framingham risk score which we use to evaluate the risk of someone getting cardiovascular disease. It includes cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension and smoking. </p>
<p>So at the very least get a routine blood test panel to evaluate your cholesterol level, blood sugar and check your BP. Diabetes and high BP basically changes the surface of the blood vessel making it more susceptible for blockage while cholesterol causes inflammation which will lead to plaque formation (basically the thing blocking your artery). If you have high cholesterol level (and assuming you don't have high BP and DM), you maybe prescribed a small dose of cholesterol pill (statin). If you have DM and BP, on top of controlling these diseases, you will be prescribed a higher dose of statin.  </p>
<p>Continue to eat healthy, stop smoking, drink moderately, avoid anything which is fried (especially deep fried) and exercise regularly. </p></div>		</li>
