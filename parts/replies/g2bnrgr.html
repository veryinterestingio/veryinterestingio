			<div class="markdown"><p>Not extremely relevant as it's so niche, but there's actually one or two exceptions... specifically the BBC had some color television programs recorded onto black and white film for archival purposes. The BBC used what is more-or-less a black/white monitor with a film camera pointed at it to record the film. However, the color information in the signal leads to some small artifacts in the black and white image. Recently, people have managed to deduce the original color signal from those artifacts and succeeded in re-coloring the videos according to the restored original color information.

<p>People who understand older manufacturing processes can reproduce things with relative accuracy. And colorists can consult specialists to help them make good color decisions.</p></div>		</li>
