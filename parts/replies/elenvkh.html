			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the anti quark charges being wrong in the last paragraph, this explains why composite neutral particles (like a neutron) can have associated antiparticles.</p>
<p>But it's also possible (at least theoretically) to have an antiparticle associated with neutral fundamental particles (such as photons) all you have to do is find negative energy solutions of the schrodinger equation. For photons that's as simple as allowing negative frequencies in the Hilbert space - which i say is theoretical because there's no known way of experimentally distinguishing this from a regular photon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always heard it said that the photon is it's own antiparticle, although I must admit I never fully understood that statement. </p>
<p>A better example might be the antineutrino. While both electrically neutral, the neutrino and antineutrino have opposite lepton number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I suppose neutrinos just weren't the first thing to come to mind for some reason haha, you're right that they probably make better examples though - although I guess some might argue that lepton number is a <em>kind</em> of charge (although not electromagnetic)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just look for the photon moving at the speed of dark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, but as discussed in other comments, I didn't mention the neutrino (partly because I forgot about it) and partly since it has properties which resemble a &quot;charge&quot; of sorts anyway.</p>
<p>Of course we could talk about how anti-neutrinos would have opposite lepton charge, but then we're just talking about another kind of charge</p></div>		</li>
