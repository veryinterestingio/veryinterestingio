			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry. I posted this last night while sleepy and I just realized that my question is a very broad one. Thank you. Yeah the hippocampus definitely plays a major role in memory consolidation. My professor back in college mentioned something like stress indirectly causes our hippocampus to shrink due to cortisol and as a result have problems recalling memories.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You’re totally right about stress being a factor and how that has what seems to be a direct effect of the size of the hippocampus. Personally, I think it checks out cause I can’t remember shit from times in my life where I was strung out 24/7. I also think that it helps to explain why one symptom of depression is spaciness and forgetfulness.</p></div>		</li>
