			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's a good one, but he did miss the reason why they do it at morning/evening: they tend to eat insects a lot, which take some time to warm up and get active after a colder night, which happens when the sun hits the insects. So basically chirping is also them singing while watching the microwave count down and their food is ready to eat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, there's also something about the morning/evening air that helps sounds travel farther. something about temperatures, or atmospheric pressure, or some such sciencey thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't doubt that this is true but I can't help notice that up here in Canada its too cold for making babies right now and there are no insects around all winter either (except in the suet we put out). Nevertheless the birds keep singing.</p></div>		</li>

- Hey what are you talking about boys? By the way, glad you're all fine today.</p>
