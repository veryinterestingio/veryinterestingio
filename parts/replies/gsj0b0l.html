			<div class="markdown"><p>Not fucked us over, just picked a different strategy. There's pros and cons to both. Not many humans die from falling even as is - so it's not worth the disadvantages of exoskeletons. They limit mobility bigtime, so running, throwing, and having dextrous hands would all be out.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity, a mere nuisance to Christian, was a terror to Pope, Pagan, and Despair.   To  the  mouse  and  any  smaller  animal  it  presents  practically  no dangers.  <strong>You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft.  A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes.</strong> For the resistance presented to movement by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object.  Divide an animalâ€™s length, breadth, and height each  by  ten;  its  weight  is  reduced  to  a  thousandth,  but  its  surface  only  a hundredth.   So  the  resistance  to  falling  in  the  case  of  the  small  animal  is relatively ten times greater than the driving force.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you increase the length, width and height of an animal by a factor of 10, you increase its surface area by a factor of 10^2 = 100 and increase its volume by a factor of 10^3 = 1000. So it will have 100 times as much skin, but 1000 times as much guts. The guts increase the mass of the animal, which increases the force due to gravity when falling, whereas the extra skin increases the amount of drag that slows it down while falling.</p>
<p>But we have increased the guts of the animal much more than we have increased its skin, so the animal will accelerate much faster because the downward force due to gravity has been increased 1000 fold, but the counteracting force of drag has been increased by only 100 times.</p>
<p>For more I would suggest checking out this video, which is part 1 of 3 in a series about the square-cube relationship: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7KSfjv4Oq0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7KSfjv4Oq0</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">square cube law</a> is why King Kong could not exist.  The ability to stand is based on the structural strength of the support system - the legs. What is the primary component of that strength? The area exposed if it is cut in half, called the cross-section or cross-sectional area.  Letâ€™s assume the area is a square instead of a circle. The area of that square is based on its length and width - 2 dimensions.</p>
<p>Now if you had an ape and made it 10 times bigger, then its length and width of its leg would each get 10 times bigger which means it would also be 10 x 10 = 10^2 (10 squared) = 100 times stronger. </p>
<p>But, that doesnâ€™t account for the third dimension, height, which also gets 10 times bigger. Of course, it is all 3 dimensions (volume) that determines mass. So 10 times bigger means 10 x 10 x 10 = 10^3 (10 cubed) = 1000 times heavier.  </p>
<p>So, if you make something 10 times bigger, it becomes 100 times stronger but 1000 times heavier. Thatâ€™s a losing proposition. King Kong could not support its own weight. </p>
<p>This example works in reverse too and is why ants can lift so much  (relative to their mass). Ants have been reported to be able to lift as much as 5000 times their own weight.</p></div>		</li>
