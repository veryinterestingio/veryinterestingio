(note:  females are the only ones to drink blood, and that is because they need it for reproduction).  This mosquito type is responsible for the spread of diseases like zika and dengue fever amongst others, but not malaria.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001706X14002733" target="_blank">This study</a> on the other hand, suggests that Anopheles stephensi favours type AB, and according to that study, those with that blood type also suffer more severely from malarial infections.  Anopheles type mosquitoes are those responsible for the transmission of malaria.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is really interesting, because it is thought that malaria infected mosquitoes have their behaviour adjusted, making <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2013.0711" target="_blank">people more attractive</a> to mosquitoes that have late stage malarial infections.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Humans infected by malaria, may be more attractive to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030298" target="_blank">mosquitoes</a> too.  Now since AB positive people are more susceptible to malaria, they will have a higher malarial infection, making transmission of malaria more likely if mosquitoes prefer targeting AB blood type individuals.  It really does suggest some interesting things relating to malaria affecting both human and mosquito hosts behaviour and attractiveness.</p>

<p>Covering some of your other points.  <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028991&amp;utm_source=yxnews&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fyandex.kz%2Fnews" target="_blank">the things living on your skin can have an effect</a>  as well as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2006.00627.x" target="_blank">differences in compounds released by people in the scent</a> affect peoples attractiveness to mosquitoes.  But in reality, it's so incredibly complicated, and we're still doing massive amounts of research into it.  I know a fair bit, but it's not really my field, so I can't go into as much detail as a true expert.  And I'm also only covering general details here.  I found this interesting though - a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009546" target="_blank">study suggests beer makes people more attractive to mosquitoes too.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As to how they differentiate between body odours, blood type, etc.  if you read over some of the studies, you can see ways they study it.  But a solid way they measure attractiveness to mosquitoes is to have a y shaped tube, with a wind blowing mosquitoes away.  the top of the y has a person place their arm inside each, so 2 people.  The mosquitoes have to fly upwind to reach the people, and they have a choice as to which arm of the y they fly up.  The wind means they have to really want it, and the choice shows which they prefer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They place people inside a machine that collects the smells they give off, and detects what compounds are present within it.  Over time, they can use different people to check differences between attractiveness.  They use twins in such studies.  Identical twins are great, as they have the same blood type etc, but if mosquitoes prefer one twin over the other, you can work it out as the differences in compounds released.  But as I've said, it's incredibly complex, with huge amounts of research into it, that is still ongoing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for such an in-depth response!</p>
<p>I looked at the article linked in [6] about compounds released by people.  It quickly got over my head, but it seems like one of it's conclusions was that a larger diversity of skin bacteria might reduce attractiveness to certain mosquitos.</p>
<p>I wonder if more frequent bathing might, then, increase mosquito attraction.  (I'm assuming that more frequent bathing would create a more homogeneous skin bacteria population.  I could be wrong about this.)</p></div>		</li>
