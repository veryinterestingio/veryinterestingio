			<div class="markdown"><p>It really boils down to this. A Politicians job is to strategically maneuver public/private interests (which often will collectively have economic effects). They maintain close connections to lobbyist and special interests groups to request donations and establish trust that they will follow through on their expressed (sometimes shared) agendas (whatever they may be), and ultimately hope they can still keep their jobs the next cycle. </p>

They have no concept of what suffering is ($10 banana meme) and spend no time in places where people are actually suffering. The pain people are feeling <em>does not exist to those in charge.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last two sentences resonate with me. I was raised in a very humble environment and thought the glitz and glam I saw on movies were fantasy. Then I went to college and met more affluent people who were flippant about daily struggles I had. Now, as an adult who works and lives near the fringe of working upperclass, I am constantly reminded of the difference between my experience and the lives they (and I, to a degree) live. I can only imagine how it is for the ultra-wealthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone is interested, <a href="https://www.quiverquant.com/sources/senatetrading" target="_blank">here's a dashboard</a> I've been building tracking stock trading by US politicians.</p>
<p>I imagine that some people only get into politics as a way to protect their own financial interests, and that's only strengthened by watching some senators sell off half their portfolios after leaving confidential COVID briefings back at the beginning of this year instead of warning people about the impending threat.</p>
<p>That behavior unfortunately also makes them susceptible to being bought out. I've also been collecting data on <a href="https://www.quiverquant.com/lobbyingsearch/" target="_blank">corporate lobbying</a> and <a href="https://www.quiverquant.com/sources/govcontracts" target="_blank">government contracts</a>, and as you can imagine the two are pretty connected.</p>
<p>Our $700B+ military budget only makes sense in the context of the absurd amounts of money spent by defense contractors essentially buying votes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No offense, but if you're working for someone else, you're not upperclass. Your last sentence is absolutely true, though. We have no idea what it's like to be that rich. Bloomberg spent $100,000,000.00 on election ads in Florida alone. I can't conceive of having so much money that I could spend that much on one thing and not lose my mind. I'll never see that much money in my entire life combined. My entire family combined will never make that much money. It's so massively huge that my brain checks out and doesn't even try to grasp it.</p>
<p>And this one guy, who's not even the richest person in the country, let alone world, spent it on something without a tangible return. After spending that money, assuming he spent it all at once, he still had about $70,000,000,000.00 of wealth. So that unimaginably huge number from before was something like 1/700 of how much he had. Meanwhile, for a lot of Americans, 1/700 of their total wealth is probably negative, but at most a couple bucks.</p>
<p>This is why wealth inequality is the greatest problem facing the world today. There are so many things we could do to improve the lives of vast numbers of people, but instead we let a few assholes horde money like dragons while we fight each other for scraps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at someone like AOC; labeled a radical even by her own party. She’s not a radical. Bernie is not a radical. Do you notice that only rich people, or those directly beholden to rich people, call them “radicals” and “socialists”?  What is a socialist, really?  It’s simply someone who’s rather spend YOUR tax money to try and make your life better, rather than handing it to large corporations or squandering it on unnecessarily high  levels of defense spending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make this point all the time, Bernie and AOC would be center left in europe. Nothing they are arguing for is extreme, almost everything they have suggested has been done in the US within living memory.  We had a dozen tax brackets with the highest being in the 90 percent range in the fifties, the supposed golden age post war. And as recently as the late 80s it was in the 50 percent range.  The new deal programs were helpful in alleviating the effects of the great depression, and the green new deal and a grand infrastructure plan could do the same now.  No one is arguing for the forced nationalization of the means of production. </p>
<p>Also this quote from the new deal wiki might explain the pressure against the green new deal
&quot;A 2013 study found that &quot;an average increase in New Deal relief and public works spending resulted in a 5.4 percentage point increase in the 1936 Democratic voting share and a smaller amount in 1940.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not ALL people are self-interested. This is where we are today in some countries: a direct left/right split. In countries run by actual adults, coalition government that represents all views rather than just two diametrically opposing ideologies, achieves far more and allows the best ideas to potentially become mainstream political direction.</p></div>		</li>
