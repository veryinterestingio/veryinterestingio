			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you're saying. So if we drop a normal ball the size of a baseball and a second ball the size of the Earth we can see what would happen. Both balls would travel towards the Earth at the same speed but the Earth itself would be moving too and it's easy to see how at the instant you let the objects go the Earth moves at the same rate at the Earth sized ball and doesn't move for the baseball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had the same thought down a different line of reasoning, the earth is already moving VERY fast in a highly energetic system, the interactions of the objects in that system are relatively small compared to the influence of the Sun. For &quot;another Earth&quot; to be &quot;falling towards&quot; Earth, they would be on a collision course. Their acceleration might be measurable but it wouldn't be a particularly significant part of the collision. Their orbital energy with respect to the the Sun already set the table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think that you'd also have to have your second earth as a point mass for this, because otherwise you're going to have to take into account all sorts of geometric issues. Then again, making it a point mass would probably introduce general relativity corrections due to the extreme curvature of spacetime surrounding it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But also the Earth would move toward the heavier ball, so the Earth would be closer to the ball faster and exert a greater gravitational pull (r\^2 is disproportionately smaller). An outside observer would indeed see the ball moving faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>since the distance r keeps getting smaller, the acceleration is always changing right? so do we need to calculate something like jerk?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Minus-Celsius" target="_blank">Minus-Celsius</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you need to go to jerk, since you have an exact equation for the acceleration at a given distance. I think you would only need a double integral.</p>
<p>But you can do a comparison very easily, without any calculus. The Earth will move closer to the heavier object, therefore the force must be more for at least some part of the fall, therefore the acceleration must be more, therefore the speed must be more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but that detail needs to be taken into account with any falling object -- the acceleration due to gravity is slightly greater towards the bottom of the fall than it is at the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but we are comparing two different objects and we can show that the larger one would fall faster in outside reference frames as well.</p>
<p>This contradicts the above poster who said it would not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The equation the poster used applies to instantaneous force, setting all constants to be adimensional and equal to 1, we have the differential equation x''=1/x² (that I confess I am not yet able to solve)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not apply to non-intertial (accelerating) reference frames, and since he is measuring the distance from the planetʻs surface which <em>is</em> accelerating, it does not apply.</p>
<p>Generally we ignore this fact because for objects that differ dramatically in mass the difference is so small as to be ignorable, and when this isnʻt the case we realize that equation must be used in an inertial observation frame on the two objects separately.</p></div>		</li>
