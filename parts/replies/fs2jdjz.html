			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why it's that bright despite being kind of awful at producing energy from fusion- about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_core#Energy_conversion" target="_blank">277 watts per cubic meter</a>. </p>
<p>So a chunk of solar core the size of your desk is barely making enough power to run your office equipment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Believe it or not, this is an understatement. </p>
<p>The Sun isn't hot enough to fuse hydrogen at all. The fusion only occurs by quantum tunneling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A photon from the surface of the Sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds for it to reach the Earth; 500 seconds to travel about 150 million km. Inside the Sun however, it takes many thousands of years for a photon to get from the core to the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Mars is easily visible with the naked eye. Even at its faintest it has a magnitude of 1.86, which is still visible without problems from cities like Madrid. Maybe from bigger cities like NYC and LA it would be more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientific notation is great for making really big numbers easily digestible. But a side effect is like just seeing words like million and billion, someone not used to working with gigantic numbers loses the scale of just how big these numbers really are.</p>
<p>So because reading it written out like that is exactly the reason I did it that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, I'd argue that writing inches of zeroes makes it really hard to compare numbers. Like the mass of the sun being 1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000kg and the mass of the earth 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000kg and the mass of the milyway something like 4,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000kg.</p>
<p>Maybe one &quot;loses the scale&quot; in scientific notation, but I'd argue that there isn't even a sense of scale in that form. Like. Yeah, ok, one has more zeroes than the other. But is the ratio of the earth to the sun similar to the ratio of the sun to our galaxy? (it isn't, the ratios are different by 7 orders of magnitude)</p></div>		</li>
