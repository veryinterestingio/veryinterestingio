			<div class="markdown"><p>What does the night guard actually do?? I have migraines that don’t respond to meds :(</p>
<p>Edit: I meant to say “do for migraines”. I don’t think mine are related to clenching and grinding, but it’s always something to rule out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dentist said the mouth guard will also keep people looking younger, because their teeth won't be grinded down and shortened.  He is apparently an excellent salesman.  But I appreciate a mouth guard anyway.  I lost a tooth on my big 30 (birthday) from constant clenching.  I always remember that was my birthday present from my body.  Betrayal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here! Love my dental night guard. Tried a cheap one from the pharmacy first and bite through it in about a month....that's when I realized how badly I was grinding my teeth at night. Had a professional one made up at the dentist and I absolutely love it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I don’t think I ever got those bad of migraines or anything, but my jaw and teeth would hurt or be sore and I’d have a headache. </p>
<p>Sometimes I forget to wear my guard and I can tell I was clenching in the night. Reminds to me wear it and all is well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s so awesome, to figure out it’s simply due to those mucles.
I had a bad tinnitus on the left side with vertigo once every other month and it’s also due to jaw muscles. Crack and move them around every other day and it’s gone since.</p></div>		</li>
