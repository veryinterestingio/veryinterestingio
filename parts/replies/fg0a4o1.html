<p>The key is awareness. When the virus just starts the awareness is 0. When no one knows about the virus the R0 is high. When governments take action and the public is aware it should drop dramatically, eventually to less than 1. That’s why WHO specifically declared a global emergency because it’s afraid the virus spreads in a country that’s less equipped than China and the developed world to deal with a virus. If they’re unable to bring the R0 to under 1, it’ll spread and infect most of an underdeveloped country, unless the global community steps in like with ebola in Africa. </p>
<p>It’s pretty simple to understand, if only one person in the world has a certain virus, that person can cough in 200 people their faces and the R0 will be 200. Does the same person with the same virus get quarantined before he does so and is unable to infect anyone? the R0 is 0. </p>
<p>So the R0 is based for a huge part on human behavior. And then a small part is about how contagious a virus is.</p></div>		</li>
