			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the algae acts as a buffer between the turtle and light/heat source. Making it harder for the turtle to absorb the heat it needs. This is really important for aquatic turtles since they are more prone to shell rot since so much time is spent in the water. They bask in the sun to raise their internal temperature to regulate their metabolism and dry out their shells along with getting the necessary vitamins for growth.</p>
<p>I can't speak to how common it is in the wild, but I have 2 yellow-belly sliders (~5 years old). I have noticed them shedding about twice or three times a year so far. Typically have a bit of an algae built up on their shells before they start shedding. There would have to be a significant buildup of algae to have a visible effect on the turtle. In which case either the turtle is wild and for whatever reason it's body isn't self-regulating (sick/injured?), or I'm a terrible turtle owner and I have neglected the turtle and water conditions for far too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god, thank you so much for your answers, they make me want to understand turtles so much more!
Could it be possible that the build-up of algae would make the turtles vitamin deficient? And is the shell rot related to the inability to dry their shells properly?</p>
<p>That seems like a pretty regular thing. I would assume that if it couldn't shed it's shell, it would probably be sick then. I hope you don't mind my questions and I don't think you could be a bad owner knowing this much haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if the algae acts more like foil, reflecting heat they need to absorb.</p>
<p>What you're thinking of works because warm-blooded creatures create the majority of their own heat. Cold-blooded creatures rely on external sources of heat to help energize them. Your layers of clothing would have nothing to reflect back to a reptile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Endotherms and ectotherms are different things. Turtles don't generate internal heat the way people do. So they wouldn't heat up while wearing layers of clothes.</p>
<p>Turtles swim to cool off and bask to heat up. While basking, they are abosrbing solar radiation. This can be done on the shore, or at the water surface. </p>
<p>If the shell is blocked up enough to prevent (or lower) absorbing the solar radiation, then it would make it harder to warm up. It could also prevent/slow production of vitamin D3, needed for using calcium. </p>
<p>You should keep a pet turtle's shell mostly cleared of algae in order to check the shell surface for soft spots. You don't want some form of shell rot hidden under there.</p>
<p>A turtle that basks on land will usually cook the algae on its shell, causing it to dry out and flake off naturally. As they lose scutes, they will naturally fall off. Sea turtles will have whole colonies living on their shell, while there are fish that will come and clean the shell off, removing growths, crabs, and whatever has set up shop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You(hot blooded) heat up because you naturally radiate heat, and the clothes retain that heat. </p>
<p>Turtles(cold blooded) don't radiate heat. </p>
<p>In fact. If you stick around in a freezer for several hours wearing a parka, then that parka will keep you cooler in the summer sun for a while. Until your natural body heat warms it up that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sea-borne turtles can get infested with barnacles if they're sick or sluggish.</p>
<p>Well-intentioned people sometimes catch and lever the barnacles off, which causes stress and sometimes injury to the turtle.</p>
<p>Apparently the <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/uae/turtles-covered-in-barnacles-1.486755" target="_blank">recommended treatment</a> is to to take a distressed turtle to a specialist rehabilitation centre where the let the turtle live in fresh water for 2-3 days. Turtles can cope with this,<a href="https://localocean.co/2014/09/barnacles/" target="_blank"> but the barnacles can't</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with Sea turtles for a few years long term care and rescue. You are very knowledgeable I applaud you. For the turtles we had that could not be released we actually had rocks hanging in their habitat in order for them to scratch and rub algae off of there shells. Once a month we would dive with them to specifically clean there shells with a soft cleaning brush. Even magic erasers worked especially well and our big green sea turtle loved it so much when we did our daily cleanings when we dove in she would push us around just so we would give her attention and scratch her back. If you didn't acknowledge her she would nip your wet suit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's super cool. It also gives an interesting idea...</p>
<p>If we deployed stable buoys with abrasive surfaces on the bottom, could/would sea turtles use them to scrub their shells? I imagine there aren't a ton of opportunities for this in the deep open ocean. (I'm also definitely no zoologist or marine biologist)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will go to spots with rocks or debris even cleaning spots where certain types of fish clean it off. The biggest danger would be barnacles they can way them down and make it where they can't surface. The issue with the boat would be a 300lb turtle suddenly pushing on it. Now make it a few turtles and suddenly everyone is swimming. Good idea though I like it. But nature will take care of its self.</p></div>		</li>
