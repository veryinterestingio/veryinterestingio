			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, CDC tracks both positive influenza tests and syndromic (symptom-based) influenza-like illness and actually noted a decrease in positive influenza tests with a concomitant increase in flu and influenza like illness (with a corresponding increase in mortality rate) in recent weeks. So if CV had been here and spreading widely months ago, we would have seen those patterns that we are just seeing now in the last few weeks  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm</a></a> .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is, given the long incubation time and how differently it affects certain populations, couldn't it have moved cryptically through parts of the community (like entire schools) without raising a single alarm bell? I mean, what are the odds that it just happened to show up first in a care home for medically compromised patients? Also, I would like to see some digging into Jan and Feb deaths in the Seattle area due to respiratory failure. My hunch is that isolated cases spread throughout the region could have been happening, but were unremarkable in isolation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, so this all seems to support OP's hypothesis that it was spreading cryptically from around mid/late January up until the outbreak was recognized at the end of February.</p></div>		</li>
