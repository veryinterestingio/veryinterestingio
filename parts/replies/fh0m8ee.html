			<div class="markdown"><p>So could you say that Regression Towards the Mean says &quot;in the next 20 flips, we should expect more Tails and not as many Heads, and surely no 20 consecutive heads&quot;, while Gambler's Fallacy says &quot;It's been 20 heads already, next one must be a tails!&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, no. It's observational, not predictive. The next flip is still 50/50. The flip after that is still 50/50. The one after <em>that</em> is still 50/50.</p>
<p>After 20 Heads, the 21st flip will still only have a 50% chance of landing Tails. The coin doesn't care what the last flip was, or the last 20 flips, or the last 200 flips. You cannot predict future flips based on past flips. You can only say that, theoretically, an infinite number of flips should result in an even 50/50 split.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's more &quot;This was an extreme result.  If we do the test again the result will likely be less extreme.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
