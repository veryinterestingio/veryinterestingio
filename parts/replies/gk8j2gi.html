			<div class="markdown"><p>If you heat it and compress it at the same time, technically it can get hotter than the thing. </p>
<p>BUT!!! At that point the thing is being heated by the other object, as per the second law of thermodynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there’s an extra source of energy, just like the electricity entering the system in OP’s example of the fan in the sealed room. The extra energy source in the solar corona is from magnetic reconnection.</p>
<p>Columns of material rise and fall in the outer layers of the sun: the convective zone. The circular motions of the charged plasma produce a magnetic field through the dynamo principle, just like in Earth’s core. Because the motion of the Sun is so complex (thousands of convection cells, on a sphere that rotates non-uniformly), magnetic field lines can get twists around each other. The twists store magnetic potential energy, like a rubber band that you’ve twisted. Eventually field lines can become so twisted that they break, rapidly simplifying the magnetic file structure: a process called magnetic reconnection. This is associated with a burst of energy above the surface of the sun. The solar corona has extremely low density, so a little bit of input energy into this tenuous medium gives individual particles extremely high kinetic energy boosts. Therefore the average KE of the corona is high, and therefore we define its temperature as large. </p>
<p>Even though the corona is millions of Kelvin in temperature, it contains very little total thermal energy, because there just isn’t much stuff there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice write up. I had posted before the edit where the post asserted that nothing could be hotter than the source.</p>
<p>Now poster has added that the hotter object becomes the source, which I'll remain disagreeing with via same.example. the coronasphere is not the source of Sol's thermal output.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because the microwaves are not a heat source. They are an energy source. The frequency and energy of the electronagnetic waves cause water molecules to vibrate, which creates heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's different types of heat transfer. Conductivity is the transfer of heat by direct physical contact, so you touch something hotter than you, it will transfer heat to you. If you're hotter than the object, then the reverse happens. This necessitates that heat will never flow from a cold object to a hot object, so if you physically made a microwave hot (like setting it on fire) then put some food in without turning it on, then yes the food will never get any hotter than the microwave.</p>
<p>But microwaves don't work by conductivity, they work via a difference mechanism called radiation. Basically there's a device inside the microwave that generates a magnetic field and modulates it rapidly. Doing this makes any polar molecules (molecules that react to magentism) vibrate inside the food, increasing the temperature. So via this mechanism, the energy transfer is coming from the electricity powering that device, going into the magnetic field, and then into the molecules of the food. The actual physical parts of the microwave don't need to be hot to heat food up in this manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just pointing out an obvious exception.  </p>
<p>The original request didn't mention that it was conductivity only.  So a microwave could hear up an item hotter than the microwave itself becomes.  As it isn't using conductivity.</p></div>		</li>
