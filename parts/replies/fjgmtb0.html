			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question! There was a research study done in 2011 (Ozturk et al., 2011) which looked at if density of nasal hair affected asthma rates in patients. The theory behind this being, with fewer hairs more external particles reach your lungs and can subsequently trigger an asthma attack.</p>
<p>The results found that there was a significantly higher rate of asthma in patients with less dense nasal hair. However, you have to take these results with a pinch of salt. There a huge amount of confounding variables amongst the patients. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, we think so yes but there isn't a quality randomised control trial that has been done yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on what you mean by &quot;shaving&quot;.</p>
<p>If you simply trim the visible hairs at the end of the nostril, there's probably no meaningful reduction in particulate filtering.</p>
<p>If you jam a nose hair trimmer way up into your nostril, there's probably a reduction in particulate filtering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is strongly dependent on both size and shape tho. Powder don't have a single diameter, but multiple depending on measurement method. </p>
<p>Mainly, long, needle like solid has a very small aerodynamic radius, meaning it can enter very deep in the lungs, while still too large (too long) for the macrophages. Hence these will not be removed from the lungs. Spherical powder doesn't have this problem</p></div>		</li>
