			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a great answer. To add one more thing, because viruses need to hijack host cells to divide, most of their active life - the time when their limited set of enzymes are working and are susceptible to drugs - is spent inside host cells. So any treatment also needs to get inside our own cells, and not do too much damage to our own cellular machinery once it's in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so interesting, thanks for taking the tune to reply.  So, because the virus is inside the cell, it is difficult to not also cause (unwanted) cell damage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the basic idea with therapeutics used to treat parasites of all sorts is that you want a target that is as unique as possible, because that reduces the odds that it will gum up your own machinery. </p>
<p>When a virus enters a cell, it generally breaks open to reveal its own genetic information, which either directly (for double strand DNA based viruses) or indirectly (for single strand DNA and RNA viruses) read by the cellular machinery to produce new viral proteins and genomes. The enzymes that covert the genetic information (such as reverse transcriptases) or break apart viral proteins (proteases are needed when multiple peptide products are translated as one big piece) are some of the only ones directly from the virus that will be different enough for small molecule drugs to target them. Targeting the cellular machinery involved viral replication would block vital cellular functions, so that would put you in territory akin to chemotherapy where you’re hoping to kill the problem before you kill the host.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria are distinct cells in themselves. Antibiotics work usually by targeting bacterial machinery that we ourselves don't have. The drugs therefore don't have much of an effect on us, but can have a profound effect on bacteria. </p>
<p>Viruses don't have their own machinery. They enter our cells and then repurposed our machinery to make more virus instead of working for us. That means that you can't target the repurposed machinery without targeting healthy cells since it's all the same target. </p>
<p>Additionally, because they are much simpler organisms, there is also much less to target. Bacteria share much of the same machinery which means a drug that works on one will often work on many. Viruses have a tendency to be as simple as possible and that means getting rid of anything from their genome that they don't use. This means that there are fewer targets, and the targets that are left are more likely to be unique. </p>
<p>While this is very simplified, it's the inherent reason why it's more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Your own body’s response to a cell that signals it’s infected with a virus is to destroy it. However, this is done by specialized immune cells, and the effect is very local. With any drug you could take that interferes with the virus’ replication or transmission, it would likely, by design, disrupt the normal machinery of healthy cells as well as the infected cells.</p>
<p>There are viruses whose genomes encode unique or unusual proteins, which we can target directly (for example, capsid proteins), but even then it’s tricky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't anti-virals also relatively new as far as mass production? Compared to antibiotics?</p>
<p>I thought I heard they cost significantly more to develop and produce due to the nature of viruses (viri?) but don't know if that's true or not...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a company called Antivirals in Corvallis Oregon in the early 90s. We had selective chemicals that would shut off aids and herpes with no problem. They were even 100% selective. They don't exist today because we couldn't figure out how to get them into the nucleus of a cell. See above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this: like bacteria, viruses undergo antigenic drift/shift relatively frequently (read: more frequently than bacteria in most cases), which makes those enzymes and surface proteins harder to target. This is also why we annually make best guesses at which influenza strains will be most prevalent in a given season to determine what to include in our flu shots, why MEDI8897 is soon replacing pavilizumab (Synagis), why baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) is replacing oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in some cases, and why Pimodivir is also replacing or being added to Tamiflu treatments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is influenza a fairly representative “poster child” of a virus to use when explaining viral mutation rates? I always got the impression that the flu had an abnormally high abundance of rapidly changing sites (that don’t particularly happen to threaten each alterations viability), compared to other viruses?</p>
<p>Like Covid is ~30kbp and I think the flu is only something like 14 or 15kbp, yet my understanding is Covid is most likely far less susceptible to spontaneous generational mutations than influenza?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind with flu is that, generally speaking, the host range is far wider (avian, swine, human) with a relative ease of infection based on host receptors. Flu circulates continuously in avian species and makes jumps rather frequently but most often not enough to cause significant disease. However, as someone mentioned before with antigenic shift/drift, flu does both rather frequently as it's RNA genome is segmented and enzymes that replicate the RNA are not as efficient proof readers. So 'drift' happens as a result of mutations through poor proof-reading during replication generally speaking. Shift however is when genome segments are interchanged.</p>
<p>This is best shown with a hypothetical example. A person gets infected with two strains of flu, H1N1 and H3N2. This could result in a virus of combination H1N2 being produced if it's viable as the new strain has taken segments from both of the original infecting viruses. This is why flu is a 'posterboy' so to speak as it can do both shift and drift and does so relatively frequently in respect to other viruses</p>
<p>EDIT: I will also add this is a rather simplistic explanation and doesn't cover differences in replication etc. Just that influenza viruses are capable of shift whilst coronaviruses are not. Also my statement about host range is respective of type of host and how frequently they contact humans, again a simplification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing - there's a shitload less selective pressure for (human) antiviral compounds to be produced in nature. All these powerful broad spectrum antibiotics are derived from soil bacteria and fungus and such, things that have spent billions of years fighting similar or identical things to those we've been fighting. But you're never going to find a virus that infects humans and also some penicillium analogue. We're on our own on this one.</p></div>		</li>
