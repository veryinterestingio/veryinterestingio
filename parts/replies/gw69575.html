			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question! If I'm understanding you correctly, you're asking about methods for accounting for genetic effects attributed to heterogeneity due to different patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) associated with population ancestry when performing genetic association studies. </p>
<p>For the benefit of anyone reading this without domain knowledge, I will briefly define LD as the association of genetic alleles at different loci within a population. LD arises due to recombination, mutation, and selection over time time which shape agenome. LD poses a challenging statistical question in genetics research. When performing association studies, population structure can result in spurious associations, i.e., a false positive discovery.  </p>
<p>Various statistical methods can be used to account for subpopulation structure. Association studies are essentially regression tests, so one relatively simply method is to include covariates for local and global ancestry.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, LD and the statistical methods for handling it are very complex topics which would be hard to cover thoroughly in my AMA response and aren't my primary area of expertise, but hopefully I've answered some of your question!</p></div>		</li>
