			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen them eat round holes through walls. My wife ran away with my son and I got super depressed. I didn't go in his room for months other than to pile all of her belongings in there and close the door (maybe a year+, I dunno it was a blur). Apearently he had left some food in there and mice were attracted. When I finally got in there and cleaned up there was a golf ball sized hole chewed into the closet wall down by the floor. Very Tom and Jerry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! In the 1912 house where I used to live with a bunch of other students we used to plug them up with iron mesh and then plaster them over. It would help for a while, but often they would just eat through the skirting one feet over to make themselves a new hole. Yes, pretty much like in the cartoons, just smaller and less stylized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should stuff cedar or pine chips in there before plugging it up. Won't last forever but should buy a little more time, assuming the mice have another exit and aren't completely reliant on the house for food. Any pungent odor will do really but sharp smells like cedar, pine, tea tree, peppermint, etc will irritate their nasal passages something awful. (This is also why you should never use pine shavings as bedding for pet rodents.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What?</p>
<p>The entire question is where did the symbolism featured in the cartoons <em>originate from</em>. </p>
<p>Your answer, that the arch symbolizes mice, is completely circular. OP is asking <em>why</em> it symbolizes mice.</p></div>		</li>
