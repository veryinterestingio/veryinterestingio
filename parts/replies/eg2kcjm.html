			<div class="markdown"><p>I just lost two people I love to cancer, so sometimes it's hard to think a &quot;major breakthrough&quot; actually means anything other than a hope and a prayer. The most recent family member was determined to &quot;walk out of the hospital&quot; and she did - only to die two weeks later in her home as she wanted to be with her boys one last time. Her kids are young and totally disoriented. Telling them &quot;yeah, wait, no it's cool because major breakthroughs are happening in cancer treatments&quot; is just a slap in the face, honestly. The last treatments she went through did NOT work, not at all. And god did she fight and she wanted to do everything she could to live. Nope, failure. Pure failure.</p>
<p>Seriously, I take it all as very <strong><em>minor</em></strong> breakthroughs. Cancer is still devastating to our family, at least. Maybe I'm just bitter but it does rattle my chain when people keep saying &quot;oh god, yeah yeah. Cancer isn't as devastating as it used to be!&quot; really? To who?</p>
<p>Sorry..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously they do not mean personal devastation like you’re describing but rather sheer numbers of death statistics which have gone down. Less people are dying overall but not everybody can be so lucky. Sorry for your losses but every time there is a “major breakthrough”, think of the families like yours that won’t have to go through what you did. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To the millions of people who survive longer and with higher quality of life as a result of improvements in treatment.  About 1/3rd of people who get cancer in the developed world now eventually die from it; many of them die many, many years later.  This was more like 1/2 just 25 years ago.</p>
<p>To my brother, who is in remission from what would have been a death sentence 30 years ago; who had some discomfort from treatment but still lived an active life during chemo when treatment would have been crushing (but possibly effective) 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Even in looking at the 2011-2015 data, we have 1.5% fewer people dying per year per year.  This sounds small but it's on pace to further halve the fatalities in the next 50 years.  This is despite us making progress against other diseases, giving cancer more time to kill us.</p>
<p>Yah, it'd be nice to just flip a switch and have the disease go away like polio or something.  But we are drastically better off than before, and have the hope for next generations to be drastically better off than us.</p>
<p>My mom and father-in-law died of cancer.  But that doesn't mean I choose to denigrate the efforts of those who are slogging away to reduce the disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s really hard when you’ve lost someone to take solace in those numbers, but it really is the case.  My cousin’s girlfriend is a perfect example of the positive side: she has a form of lung cancer which is the result of a well understood mutation, and with a pill she takes everyday she is 100% in remission.  It might not work forever, but if you are lucky there are many forms of cancer which are no longer a death sentence.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the response I was hoping someone had made. The same way personal experiences and hearsay don't count anything in science, on the grand scale of things single cases aren't important - significant increses in survival chances are.</p>
<p>I think your point about gradually increasing survival rates despite increasing lifespan can't be pointed out strongly enough. </p>
<p>In the end, when it comes down to it, cancer is one of the &quot;death by default&quot; options because whatever you do in life,  the chances of getting cancer increase the longer you live.</p>
<p>Being able to counteract this trend is huge in terms of more people getting older and staying healthier at old age than ever before.</p>
<p>There will always be cases where chance strikes people of young age, but all treatment options available nowadays means that a cancer diagnosis isn't an immediate death sentence anymore - and that is undebatable progress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really are major breakthroughs being made though. The thing is most of them are only effective at treating one specific type of cancer. There are some cancers (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in children, for example) that were once death sentences and now have a 98% remission rate and a 90% cure rate. But there are also a lot of cancers that we haven't found much for - at least not yet.</p>
<p>We think of cancer as a single disease, but really it's a huge number of different diseases under one umbrella term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, advancements are definitely being made to make sure that people's lifespan prolongs even under these horrible circumstances. Compare the distinct available medicine, surgery, and antidotes nowadays, with a century ago. Huge difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 non hodgekins a few years back.  Went to see 3 different doctors before he was diagnosed. The other ones told him he had a bad case of the flu.  The doctor that diagnosed him said that he was in such bad shape that he wouldnt have lasted more than a month if he waited any longer, almost all of his lymph nodes were shot.  His oncologist told him they had some sort of new treatment available but the outlook was still very grim and that he should focus on spending time with his family and even with the treatment he would have had a 50% chance to make it a year and something like a 20% chance for 5 years.  He ended up going into complete remission and has been cancer free because of this new teeatment since 2016.</p></div>		</li>
