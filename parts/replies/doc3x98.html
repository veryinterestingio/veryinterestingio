			<div class="markdown"><p>based on one of the top responses, I imagine that the colored pencil isn't made of plain graphite, and always seems to be a little waxy/ smoother, so it would stick into the graphite less &amp; therefore come away from the page less effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colored pencils don't use graphite at all. Graphite, by its nature, is a dark gray to metallic black substance. The planar sheets of carbon atoms are just really good at absorbing visible light due to the various ways light can interact with the electrons that zip around on top of the atoms. It's a very similar reason for why candles make black sooty marks on the ceiling; large clumps of disorganized carbon bonds end up being black in color.</p>
<p>So colored pencils use wax and pigments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After trying to erase some colored pencil today, I think it's because the 'lead' in a colored pencil is more plasticy/wax. As opposed to the more dry/hard 'graphite lead'...Not very scientific </p></div>		</li>
