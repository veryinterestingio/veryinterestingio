			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that actually true though? That for all materials that X change in temperature would correlate to a change in volume? I understand that thermal expansion is a gradual process but could it be that it doesnt begin to occur until a certain point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You basically have just described a phase change in matter. They occur whenever there is a discontinuity in a thermodynamic variable (first order phase changes, ie solids, liquids, gasses) or a discontinuity in any <em>n</em>th derivative of a thermodynamic variable (higher order phase changes, ie superfluids, superconductors, plasmas, ect). However, within the phases themselves, everything should be continuous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even without changing phase, a material's thermal expansion coefficient can be temperature-dependent. <a href="https://www.nealloys.com/low-expansion-alloys.php" target="_blank">Invar</a> is a specialty alloy with a near-zero expansion over a certain temperature range, so that's basically what you're describing, but the change is still gradual and it's never <em>quite</em> zero to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all correct though there a specific exceptions. Invar is a steel alloy which has almost no expansion up to the curie point (where it losses magnetism).  It is believed that magnetic coupling holds the structure together against the normal expansion. It would then suddenly expand at the curie point. Just one example.</p></div>		</li>
