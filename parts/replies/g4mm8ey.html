			<div class="markdown"><p>As I scroll through the answers here, yours is the closest that I have seen, but needs a little more. As you break the milk fat globules down into smaller and smaller pieces, their surface area increases and you no longer have enough phospholipids to encase them, leaving hydrophobic patches exposed which interact with the protein casein to stabilize them. Also your terminology is a little off. The milk fat globules are not micelles as it is a lipid bilayer that surrounds the triglycerides, so it is a membrane structure (in fact it is directly derived from cellular membranes during production of the globules). It is the casein that is generally referred to as micelles, intrinsically disordered proteins with their mostly hydrophillic parts on the outside and hydrophobic parts on the inside. Interactions with the disrupted globules after homogenization causes rearrangements in this allowing the casein to act as an emulsifier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked into it further and it seems we're both off - milk fat globules actually possess lipid trilayers, or a micelle surrounded by a cell membrane-like structure composed of two amphipolar layers. Micelle is a general term for an amphiphilic structure, so both casein micelles and lipoprotein structures can be referred to as micelles... in this case irrelevant because a lipid trilayer is functionally very similar but technically not strictly micellar. Will amend above comment to reflect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very surprised this is so far down - proteins stabilise the micelles in a similar method to surfactants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol are you saying that milk can be used as a sort of micellar water?</p></div>		</li>
