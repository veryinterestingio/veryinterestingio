			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is why pools are kept as close to 7.4 ad possible as that's the pH of the human eye. A bad pH balance is why some pools will burn your eyes</p>
<p>Edit: way too many people for me to be able to reply to so I'll try to here. Yes when chlorine reacts with bios in the water it will produce byproducts that will burn your eyes (as someone below sarcastically pointed out was tear gas-like). This is very common in public pools. I'm just speaking from experience as a residential pool tech. In people's personal pools, where hopefully they don't piss and shit in the pools it's typically a pH problem if they complain about burning eyes (we adjust pH every week but that's often not enough especially with salt systems).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: is that for swimming pools with or without shitloads of chlorine in them? Idk whether its different here in the EU compared to say the US or elsewhere, but I remember from last times I was there that swimming pools in Italy, France and particularly Spain had enormous amounts of chlorine in them. Hurt like hell if it came into contact with your eyes..</p>
<p>Does the chlorine make a difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ideal pH of swimming pool water is a trade-off between the pH of human skin in the pool, the effectiveness of chlorine at different pH levels, the potential corrosion of pipes based on pH levels, and yes the comfort of swimmers (both eyes and skin). But eye irritation is often caused by high chloramine levels (reacted chlorine that is still in the water). When chloramine levels get high, the pool can be &quot;shocked&quot; with powdered calcium hypochlorite to reduce chloramine levels and make the water less prone to skin and eye irritation. Chloramine also creates the &quot;chlorine smell&quot; in the air, particularly with indoor pools. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you'd like a quick demonstration of why the number is 7 here it goes:</p>
<p>The reaction is called autoprotolysis or self-ionization of water, H2O reacts with another H2O molecule to create H3O+ and HO-:</p>
<p>2 H2O =&gt; H3O+ , HO-</p>
<p>Quick explanation:
The thermodynamical constant of this reaction is called Ke and its value is 10^-14. A reactions' constant is basically something we've measured when equilibrium is reached (nothing reacts anymore or whatever is consumed is regenerated immediatly), its formula is:</p>
<p>K= (Activity of products)/(Activity of reagents)</p>
<p>In the case of aqueous solutions, the activity of a reagent can be associated to its concentration. Therefore, in the case of water we have: Ke=[H3O+]*[HO-]/1 (the solvent, in this case water, is considered to have an activity 1 because there is so much H2O in comparison to the ions, its concentration is basically 1 mol/L)
Also, since 2 water molecules basically &quot;split&quot;  into 2 ions, conservation of matter gives us that the molarity of H3O+ and HO- is the same: 2 molecules of H2O yield one HO- ion and one H3O+ ion.</p>
<p>We measured Ke=10^-14, knowing that pH=-log [H3O+], therefore Ke=[H3O+]*[HO-]=10^-14
However [HO-]=[H3O+] so [H3O+]^2 = 10^-14
take the log, you get 2 log [H3O+] = -14 (the log function transforms powers into factors)
so pH = -(-14/2) = 7</p>
<p>Edit: [A] stands for concentration of reagent A.</p>
<p>Edit 2: This is only valid for a given temperature -room temperature-, 298 degrees Kelvin (25 degrees Celsius). Equilibrium is indeed affected by temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure water with a pH of 7 can't be obtained in open air as CO2 in the air dissolves into the water, this forms carbonic acid in the water. Pure DI/distilled water will have a pH of about 5.6 in an open container. So while the alkaline water may be acidic, it has a higher pH than &quot;pure&quot; water which is probably where they get the alkaline name from (although they're wrong). I guess they should call the water &quot;more neutral&quot; instead of alkaline but I don't think the general public is ready to know that &quot;pure&quot; water is acidic and not neutral as they were taught in basic chemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond temporary relief from heartburn or indigestion, not really.  Your body has a robust system in place for maintaining the pH balance in your body; and as discussed earlier in this thread, your body maintains different pH levels in different parts of your body.</p>
<p>When you drink something, it is absorbed through the lining of your stomach and intestine into your blood.  The major thing keeping your blood pH in check is a mechanism called a buffer system which uses a molecule called bicarbonate that can either take up or release hydrogen ions (H+).  It is the concentration of H+ which is what determines the pH of any solution.  </p>
<p>Your body does this because if the pH moves too far out of range, your enzymes will start to loose their shape and stop to function.  Taking in anything too acidic or too alkaline will have little effect unless you exceed the capacity of your body to compensate.  That is something that is equally bad either way.  The key to life is balance, a concept biologists call homeostasis.</p></div>		</li>
