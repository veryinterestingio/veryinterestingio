			<div class="markdown"><p>In a practical sense, everything you see is how it looked like 0.013 seconds ago, as we have a <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-0116" target="_blank">natural lag due to the visual input processing until it reaches our consciousness</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. We probably wouldn’t feel any of the effects of the explosion until at least 8 minutes as well (no energy travels faster than light).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THAT blows my mind more than anything else. It feels so wrong. </p>
<p>It takes time for the suns light to reach us — makes sense.</p>
<p>The only thing keeping the Earth in orbit is the gravity of our sun, and without it we would fly off into space just like launching a rock from a sling — yep, makes sense.</p>
<p>But if the sun vanishes, the Earth continues circling where it was until the lack of gravity reaches us? That’s weird. It’s like, if gravity is a string and the sun is swinging the Earth around i the string...and then you cut the string...the string has to travel to the Earth before the Earth can fly off.</p>
<p>I guess the problem is the string analogy. If you instead go with the sun’s mass causing a curved depression in space time that the Earth rolls around, then it makes sense. Because while when you release a string, it goes flying off near instantaneously (inertia slows it down)...the return to normal in the spacetime will propagate outward from the middle.</p>
<p>That’s...better. It almost fits my classical-physics intuition.</p></div>		</li>
