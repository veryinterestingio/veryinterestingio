			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this analogy, people often forget waves (radio, light, etc) travel forever until they run into something that absorbs it, but at some point their data (or their light) becomes scattered and eventually it becomes blended in with the background noise of the universe. Cell towers listen for the waves at super high sensitivities then communicate this data to a central station through fiber optic cables</p></div>		</li>
