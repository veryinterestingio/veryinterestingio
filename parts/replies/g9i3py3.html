			<div class="markdown"><p>Any of the dry herbs/ spices. In India they're called &quot;Khadda Masala&quot;. So that would be dried whole chillies, cinnamon barks, bay leaves, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, cardamoms and any other dry, coarse, raw spices</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything that is oil soluble will impart more flavor when cooked in oil first. Black pepper is delicious ground directly on things, but it is also oil soluble, so if you crush it and cook it in oil gently, the flavor will permeate the dish. Some flavors are water soluble too - and others aren't. Some stuff is soluble in alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done many years cooking in kitchens as my fall back job, and the last one, I worked with a chef who was really into the science behind cooking.</p>
<p>During a rush, he would be screaming at me and insulting my intelligence, but afterward, we had sane conversations.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I became more cynical than usual about processed food, especially the part where they realize that the &quot;sweet spot&quot; in a recipe is about addiction.</p>
<p>Chef and I didn't see eye-to-eye on this and went back to talking about Julia Childs' experience as a spy.</p>
<p>I heard from him a while back, and he gave up cooking and sells insurance policies now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent overview. A few (important) additions.</p>
<p>Salt can be used to draw excess moisture out of vegetables. This is especially useful for mushrooms, spinach and onions.</p>
<p>Salt can be used to draw moisture out of meats. This is why you salt a steak before cooking. Drawing moisture out of meats and vegetables makes them brown easier through the maillard reaction, which is a process through which sugars and proteins react to form more complex flavors.</p>
<p>Sauces, stocks and broths should <em>not</em> be salted until the end of cooking. This is because they'll reduce as they simmer, and salting early before they reduce will result in too salty of a finished product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also you should salt meat <em>very</em> early. Somehow, if you salt a chicken breast (very generously) an hour or more before cooking, it not only tastes better but also doesn‘t get as dry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stop salting steak before you cook it</p>

<p>Regarding chicken: salt pulls the water out, and does not help to keep the moisture in, as far as I know. Brining is different of course.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Don't crowd them (use a big pan).</li>
<li>Throw them onto hot oil, keep heat on medium-high. Salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Keep your hands in your pockets for 3 minutes (resist the urge to move the mushrooms about).</li>
<li>Turn them over.</li>
<li>Keep your hands in your pockets for 2 minutes (no touching the mushrooms).</li>
</ol>
<p>By adhering to (3) and (5) above you ensure they brown nicely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you watch the film Julie and Julia you'll hear the line &quot;don't crowd the pan&quot; regarding mushrooms. I like to cook mine separately and make sure they've had a chance to brown off a little before I use them in my dishes. This way they're flavorful and firm. The texture will depend on how you cook them and what variety of mushroom you use. If you have an electric mill whizz up some dried shiitake mushrooms - store in an airtight container and sprinkle into risottos etc right at the end of cooking for an amazing taste!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You want the water to be drawn out and mostly evaporate.  </p>
<p>As others said &quot;don't crowd the pan&quot; because you want enough surface area that the water evaporates rather than steaming in the liquid.  Also same reason for medium-high heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother has worked in a 2 star Michelin restaurant and taught me this exact stuff. It makes food so much better. </p>
<p>Side note on cooking the steak, if you have time unwrap it and let it sit on a wire rack or plate(if plate turn it and dry the plate) in the fridge for about 1 day. It dries the outside nicely, then the salt you add dries it even better and the sear on it grants great caramelization (maillard reaction). While cooking butter basting with the butter and smashed garlic adds tons of flavor.</p></div>		</li>
