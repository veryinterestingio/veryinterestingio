Like, the material properties are so important that we'll use the most toxic element in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Most toxic' is hyperbole. It is a carcinogen but the most debilitating effects of severe lung damage are only seen in some people (believed to involve genetic susceptibility). From the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berylliosis" target="_blank">Wikipedia article on berylliosis</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With single or prolonged exposure by inhalation the lungs may become sensitized to beryllium... Ultimately, this process leads to restrictive lung disease (a decrease in diffusion capacity)... The <strong><em>onset of symptoms</em></strong> can range from weeks <strong><em>up to tens of years from the initial exposure</em></strong>. In some individuals, a <strong><em>single exposure</em></strong> to beryllium can cause berylliosis.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know heavy metals like lead and mercury build up in your body and donâ€™t ever leave, but what makes beryllium toxic? Most of the other elements in that region of the periodic table are essential to life, how come beryllium is the odd element out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In workplace environments, it's because it's machined and inhalable dust and flakes are present. This means it gets an opportunity to directly contact and react with lung tissue. It also can trigger an immune reaction. Most of the concern TO PEOPLE involves inhalation. The usual requirement to wear gloves is to protect the PRODUCT, not the handler. Mere physical contact with beryllium is not advised, but as far as we know is not dangerous.</p>
<p>Why? I don't know. It probably has something to do with it not dissolving well in water and therefore never having played a major role in the development of life on Earth. I do know that you need to be careful with some other elements in the same group, like barium. This just comes from beryllium training I took at a facility where it was present.</p>
<p>Edit: barium, not boron.</p></div>		</li>
