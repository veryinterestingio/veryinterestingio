			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for capturing the subtlety of different hardware as opposed to simply having to translate words. The language analogy is good but without what you pointed out it doesn't capture the complexity of translating between systems who might not even agree on number of registers, additional dedicated processing units, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree the top answer gives the impression that instruction sets are just different mappings of the same instructions.</p>
<p>Some hardware straight up can't do some operations, the PS1 couldn't do float operations for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but I think the point about it being like a different syntax/grammar is an elegant way of putting it that captures some extra complexity beyond just a different alphabet. Just my opinion on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible with current technology to emulate very old game systems in a way that sort of.. translates everything in advance, so the game runs smoother as the hard work doesn't have to be done live while playing?</p>
<p>As I have very little knowledge of how video games work in general this may be a very stupid question lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're talking about certainly is possible. However, it would no longer be emulation. The key piece that makes something emulation is that you are digitally representing hardware. If you just rewrite the game to run on the hardware you already have, you've translated everything in advance and don't need an emulator. However, that rewriting process may be very involved and likely you'll need access to the source code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it would essentially be a port, then?</p>
<p>But.. would you then say emulation is kind of equal to &quot;live porting&quot; the game - porting as you play it?</p>
<p>What prevents a system capable of doing that simply doing it for the entirety of the game beforehand?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note there are ways (theoretically, and it has been done before, notably M1 macs) to translate the entire program before execution or in a JIT (Just In Time) manner, making the performance hit relatively negligible to not at all.</p></div>		</li>
