			<div class="markdown"><p>And people who keep insect-eating lizards need to dust the insects they feed the lizard with nutrient powder. Why? The insects (typically crickets) raised in captivity are on a more nutrient-poor diet than those in the wild. Doesn’t harm the insect, but the lizard doesn’t get the “salad” that would be in an insect’s gut in the wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that in the wild the lizard wouldn't just be feeding solely on crickets. They'd eat whatever they got on their tongues. Plus they might just as well eat other rand shit like half a mouse and shit and get calcium that way etc.</p>
<p>Making a single feed that is well balanced for a shitload of animals is actually pretty hard.</p>
<p>Pet kibble is a pretty recent invention, and before dogs would basically be eating the same varied food as humans. Just like that random farm pig eating your dinner left overs does now.</p>
<p>And cats would be allowed to obtain their missing nutrients in the wild. </p>
<p>Anyway: even if the cricket was raised in perfect lizard feed conditions it wouldn't make a good enough meal to have the lizard prosper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These days they even sell &quot;gut loading&quot; food to feed the bugs your lizard eats so they have a greatly improved nutritional profile, just as the calcium powder substitutes for the tiny vertebrates many a lizard would eat to opportunistically get their calcium from in the wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only actual answer to his question so far. Amazing. Carnivores eat the livers and brains of the herbivores which are filled with the vitamins they got from the fruits and plants. The other half of the answer is that all essential nutrients are available in plant form, just not in high density, so herbivores spend most of the day eating. We don't want to spend all day eating, and we no longer have the teeth for it anyway, so we eat the herbivores instead (and cook our food).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to raise cattle. I knew far more about the nutritional needs of cows then I did of my children. I often thought that was sad but it's true.</p>
<p>Cows don't just eat grass. They need certain amounts of grass/hay, protein (in forms they can digest), vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>I also raised chickens. They need vastly more protein than cattle, but turkeys need even more.</p>
<p>At any rate, the point of this is that we know a LOT about animal nutrition.</p></div>		</li>
