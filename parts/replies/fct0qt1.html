			<div class="markdown"><p>Just the 1st part addresses the question asked. I did separate it from the 2nd now where I just expounded on the fasting/CR effect in healthy subjects which has no direct relation to the question asked although it is still based on BAT thermoregulation. Probably didn't have to add it so things don't get confusing. </p>
<p>Initially, after infection there is an increase in thermogenesis which triggers the immune response where lost appetite/food intake comes secondary as a defense against the increase in BAT thermogenesis and body temperature and a means of the human body to restore homeostasis. It's a chain of events and developments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. BAT- Brown Adipose Tissue, CR - Calorie Restriction, reg T cell - regular T cells, NKT cells - Natural Killer T cells (immune response), CVD - cardio vascular disease, AFAIR -As Far As I Remember Hope I didn’t miss any.</p></div>		</li>
