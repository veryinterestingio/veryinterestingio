			<div class="markdown"><p>All answer ignore the fact that the question confuses a data standard with a type of cable. And ethernet cable uses Unshielded Twisted Pairs, just like USB, HDMI and SATA. With a well designed adapter, you could probably run all there protocols over one or more ethernet cables (although not over 100m).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. It's been a while but if I recall correctly HDMI sends video signal over two different wires at offset waves so that it can compare interference it picks up. If the interference is at the same location it'll be in two different locations on the data streams (because they were offset) and this interference will be removed by the software. If you don't have enough wires to send this data twice like that then you can't make the comparison. While you could still send the data via an adapter, you'd lose some of the point of the cable and why it was chosen. If I recall they do the same thing with audio as well.</p>
<p>A quick google says that HDMI 2.0 has  more than double the number of strands that Ethernet 6a has, just as an example. So yes you could use an adapter, and it would likely be fine in probably most cases, but you'd lose some of the features that a pure HDMI 2.0 cable offers.</p>
<p>But that's basically what u/ILBRelic was getting at, there's more than bandwidth to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, an ethernet adapter is required on each end of the cable. The required ethernet chipsets, power requirements, buffer memory, and physical size all mean more cost and complexity than other standards that could be used for the same application.</p></div>		</li>
