			<div class="markdown"><p>It is something generally seen (to larger or lesser extent) in bilateral animals, so yes. Sensory organs tend to be at least partially centered around one end of the animal, usually in the forward direction of the movement of the animal, which indicates cephalisation. Arthropods for example, which are not deuterostomes, also have a centralisation of nerve cells around the forward facing side, so you could also argue that this is cephalisation and therefore it probably arose before this divergence</p>
<p>Edit: correction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should point out that Echinoderms like Starfish are members of Bilateria, and are Deuterostomes, like us. </p>
<p>The non-bilaterans are cnidarians, placozoans, and ctenophorans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems you have a misconception about starfish.  They only appear to have radial symmetry later in life after metamorphosis.  They are actually bilateria, which is clearly observed in their larval state.  It is unnecessary (and inaccurate) to argue about the adult state as that is an extreme rearrangement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd want short connections between the sensory organs and the response center (brain) so it would make sense that the concentration of sensory organs in the forward part of the organism would create a developmental pressure to increase the neural capacity to interpret and react to their signals nearby.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As such, yeah, almost certainly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd agree with this. Especially anything with eyesight is going to need a really good brain.  The info from a brain with eyes needs to be turned into locomotion.  Fish,amfibs,mams all have heavy body size and need backbone to support the muscle system.  Insects are so light the exctoskeleton can do the job.  Octopus  and that family are the interesting exception.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily. On the mantis shrimp, for example, image processing takes place in the eyes instead of the brain, which is pretty basic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that animals' nervous systems started out as simple electrical signaling pathways to be able to respond to stimuli (I.E. moving towards light or away from harm/pain).  Eventually &quot;ganglions&quot; or groups of neurons formed so more complex responses could be made (I.E. moving somewhere where there's more food).  When ganglions get large/complex enough they're considered brains.</p></div>		</li>
