			<div class="markdown"><p>Mid-infrared observations (we observed in the astronomical N-band at 10 micron) from the ground suffer from strong background noise produced by emission from our own atmosphere. That's why observations in this wavelength are not very sensitive to faint objects and planets get fainter with distance squared. With current 8-m telescope, only Alpha Cen allows us to go sub-Jupiter. With the next generation of 30-40 m telescopes, we will able to go out to about 20 lightyears (\~6pc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alpha Cen is the clear target for current telescopes. There are a few systems that are a factor of a few further away, and the extremely large telescopes (GMT, ELT, TMT) that are currently under construction or consideration will be able to search the habitable zones of these stars. We also have plans to establish NEAR-like capabilities at the LBT, which will enable us to search the habitable zone of Sirius, which is also a bit further away, but is a brighter star with a more extended habitable zone.</p></div>		</li>
