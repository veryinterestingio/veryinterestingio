<p>the CB does who needs to protect the deep ball, then react up to the slant very quickly, then initiate contact to make the tackle. </p>

<p>This is what I don't get about people who complain that safeties/corners were too far back/the receiver catches the ball and maybe has a second or two before the DB gets there. Like.. they're a back, they're not necessarily supposed to be right up there at the line, that's how you get burned deep. </p>
<p>But I'm a hardcore Devin McCourty fan, so I'm biased.</p></div>		</li>

Especially these days with guys like Mahomes and Goff slinging it to speedsters like Tyreek and Brandin Cooks, you'd much rather give up a 6 yard completion if you can come up and make a sure tackle than risk getting burned deep for six</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Tyreek in particular. When the Pats (narrowly) beat out the Chiefs a few weeks back, there was one play in particular that I just remember thinking, &quot;Jesus, this guy.&quot; He caught the ball and escaped Harmon pretty easily. It looked like, given a long enough distance, McCourty <em>might</em> have been able to catch him, but it wasn't a pick and 80 yard return situation (or a Ben Watson-chases-down-Champ-Bailey stunner) so he didn't have time to catch up. </p>
<p>Tyreek has to be a nightmare to cover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both is the most tiring, especially in soccer.  A midfielder will have to run nearly the entire length of the field while backs and forwards tend not to unless the game is really wacky.  Though such a situation is fairly rare and short lived in American football (e.g., interceptions).  </p></div>		</li>
