<p>Double that, so 11 g... so about 1.8tsp would kill a person. It's one of the reasons the FDA banned powdered caffeine sales.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's less than people think. I've purchased powdered caffeine before and when I show people how much 100mg is they are surprised. I take a 1/3 tsp. Fill it with powdered caffeine. Now you've got 1g. pour it out and divide it into 10 equal piles. Now you've got 10 100mg piles. Each pile is roughly a cup of coffee. So before you go 'jokingly' pouring a lot into a beverage or swallowing it, you should know how much you are ingesting. People die from it. Caffeine is crazy powerful.</p></div>		</li>
