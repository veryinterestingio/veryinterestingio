			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that's not quite correct.  L-Glucose is the indigestible &quot;mirror image&quot; of normal D-Glucose, but L-Glucose is not used to make cellulose.  α- and β- refers to whether one particular hydroxyl group is attached on the same side or the opposite side of the ring from the -CH2OH group; they're isomers, but they're not mirror images.</p>
<p>That different hydroxl group placement determines whether the glucose chains up facing all the same direction (starch), or facing alternating directions (cellulose), and, as you said, amylase can only break down starch, BUT, if you had enzymes or gut flora that could break down the cellulose connections (like cows do), the resulting β-glucose units would be just as usable by the body, i.e. the difference in digestibility is in breaking them down to monomers, not a difference in the resulting monomers.  In fact, α- and β-glucose can interconvert when dissolved into water; L-Glucose, the actual mirror image, does NOT spontaneously interconvert this way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's stopping us from just taking a probiotic pill with a safe strain of those bacteria?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it help us digest more energy from the food we eat, and leave less waste?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really sure of all the factors in here (I study chem as a hobby), so I looked up the process for <a href="https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/Ruminant_Digestion.html" target="_blank">how cows digest their food</a>, and it looks like it's pretty darn complicated, more than I originally thought.  Cows don't actually have an enzyme to break down cellulose either, but they host a bacteria that does, and then they use an enzyme to digest that bacteria to get the energy out of it.  In addition, they have features such as a subdivided stomach, chewing the cud, and such to mechanically break up their food, helping the bacteria to do their work.  So it seems there's a fair bit of hardware involved in this as well, at least for ruminants.</p>
<p>Also, we DO get some dietary value from cellulose; it's one of the types of fiber that helps keep us regular.  Granted, it's not a caloric benefit, but if it helps keep us from having diarrhea all the time, that's still a good thing.</p>
<p>Of course, since cellulose breaks down into glucose, there may be undesirable side effects, since it would mean even more accessible sugars in our diets, which is already suspected as a culprit for diabetes and weight gain.</p>
<p>That said, <a href="https://innopa.org/inomart/probiotic-cellulose-the-innovation-of-probiotic-to-consume-cellulose-material-for-increase-efficiency-of-adsorbing-energy-in-human-body/" target="_blank">it seems like people are looking at options for doing just that</a>, so that could be a body hack for humans in the near future?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Combine this with what /u/Xambia said - the monomer sugars are what bind to receptors to give perception of taste.  And we can't break down starch or cellulose into monomer sugars, we lack the enzymes.  So the answer is pretty simple.</p></div>		</li>
