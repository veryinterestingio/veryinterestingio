<p>Anything over 40kg is a megafauna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps but the largest animal we know if is alive today. So it's clearly not essential.</p>
<p>A higher oxygen level was particularly significant in the carboniferous, well before the age of the dinosaurs. In this era was saw enormous insects and other invertebrates. For these, the oxygen level in the air is absolutely an important factor because many have either very primitive analogues to lungs or no active respiratory organs at all.</p>
<p>Insects, for instance, breathe through spiracles. Essentially tubes that allow the surrounding air to enter their body without active pumping like lungs. This system doesn't scale very well for larger animals but if the oxygen content of the air goes up, it still increases the oxygen available to them which allows for larger size.</p>
<p>Even today's insects can grow larger (up to a point) when raised in sealed, highly oxygenated environments. But in the Carboniferous, we saw dragonflies the size of hawks and even a millipede the size of a four-seat couch.</p>
<p>For dinosaurs, however, I'm sure a higher oxygen content made their lives easier but it's hardly essential as today's animals demonstrate.</p></div>		</li>
