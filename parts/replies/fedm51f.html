			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much so. High concentrations of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide will turn water acidic.  This damages damp vegetation, and mucus membranes of animal life (humans included) in the surrounding areas.  Then there's even nastier things like fluorine compounds.  A few years back the eruption at Holuhraun in Iceland presented with many opportunities for some rather spectacular photography opportunities, however the sheer outgassing made the local environment quite poisonous in the area around the vent.  Gas masks absolutely were required to get close enough for any meaningful research as well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true! I think the screw cap visualizes the earlier events with the pressure being let out of cracks and fissures slowly, but as you say when the whole thing blows it will be much more like a champagne bottle. </p>
<p>Thanks for expanding on my crude metaphor and explaining more comprehensively the actual dangers of a full-blown volcano eruption!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tapping does have a small effect, since it helps seed bubbles float to the surface, which reduces the amount of soda above them that they displace when they expand. However, as you said, the effect is minimal compared to the effect of just giving it some time.</p>
<p>I did a series of experiments on this in highschool for a science project, and tapping or slowly swirling gave about a 5-10% reduction in the amount of liquid expelled compared to just waiting the same amount of time.</p></div>		</li>
