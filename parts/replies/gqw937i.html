			<div class="markdown"><p>One day, when I was like 18 and living at home, I drove back to the house to see a few gardening tools like a rake just left in the yard next to some bushes. I felt bad because my dad is older and it looked like he was doing yard work without me. I went inside, didn't see any family, so just went back out to finish up the leaves and stuff. </p>
<p>30 seconds into it , I get stung by a bee. I'm allergic so I drop everything and go off to the nearest medical facility. </p>
<p>Who do I see coming out of it as I'm pulling in?  My dad, who is also allergic and got stung by a bee at the same spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some hives are naturally more aggressive than others, the queen can dictate the vibe of the hive. Never had problems helping my homie with his bees like a dozen times. Normally you can open em up and they start getting a bit agitated 5-10 minutes and then start stinging at 15min.  But he had this aggressive hive that skipped the first part and would sting us withing 5min. The only time I got stung there was twice by that damn hive (we dont use protective gear, only a smoker)</p>
<p>That hive made mad honey tho, mainly cuz it stole from all the hives next to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of wasps out there are completely harmless to humans, and indeed are of great benefit for pollination, pest control, etc, etc.</p>
<p>It's a tiny fraction of wasps species that are potentially harmful to humans, but all wasps wind up getting a bad rap due to those few species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok last summer one box got too full and one hive started swarming to relocate, so we put another tier on the box and start scooping them into a pillowcase to put them back, supposed to be passive if handled calmly while swarming right? Nope. We kept our cool but 3 people got stung 4 or 5 times each</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they'll sting in self defense if they're getting squished, even in a swarm ball. Next time move slower and try to scoop them into the bag/box using gravity to help. Once you get the queen into your desired container, the rest will follow her inside.</p></div>		</li>
