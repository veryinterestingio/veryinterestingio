			<div class="markdown"><p>What I describe in the last two paragraphs (minus gravity having to do with anything) has been tested successfully in a lab: </p>

<p>I understood your response to mean &quot;You're talking about a lot of things that are more conceptual than actually understood by physicists in the present&quot; </p>
<p>If that's the case, I definitely agree. However, I think it takes some conceptualizing to think about the implications of what little we do know. </p>
<p>We know gravity and relative velocity is causal to time dilation. We know that two observers cannot share an inertial frame of reference. We know that this applies to even the smallest, fundamental parts of the universe. </p>
<p>So what does that mean for us?</p>
<p>The problem is imagining a reality where a frame of reference is not needed to define a state. </p>
<p>We can't do it, because every single thing we experience can only be defined by it's causal relationship to something else. </p>
<p>Perhaps the rules of classical and quantum physics are in fact only rules of how far we can take our understanding before it becomes meaningless to us. </p>
<p>If there was nothing in the universe to observe it's nature, it would not exist (at least as far as what existence means to us). How could it? </p>
<p>Gravitational attraction brings particles together to make gas, gravity makes gas heavy enough to produce energy, nuclear fusion and quantum tunneling keeps the star outputting energy in a very efficient sphere.. eventually the balance gets thrown off gravity pulls the particles closer together. </p>
<p>All of those things.. gravity, time, energy, particles.. they are all concepts we can only see by painting a picture. </p>
<p>Math <em>is</em> the paint, and one might think there is nothing more certain than an equation like F = Gm1m2/r^2</p>
<p>But imagine having someone describe a subject you could not see in order to paint it on a canvas. You have to capture the shading, tone, size, etc. </p>
<p>Even the most skilled painter cannot put something on canvas that is indistinguishable and interchangeable with the original subject. It's still just paint on a canvas, not an actual bowl of fruit. </p>
<p>However complicated and mechanical it's uses may be, math (and the reality it implies) is still just paint on a canvas; much in the same way..</p>
<p>Our brains and other organs are describing the subject (re: gravity, matter, the laws of physics, etc) and number values are putting it on canvas for us to see (re: Newton's Law of Gravitational Attraction)</p>
<p>For this reason, it seems that what something in the universe is or isn't is never provable, only describable as what it is to us. </p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying that this matters or holds any value or is the consensus among actual physicists who know much more than I do. It's just the conclusion I've come to myself </p>
<p>We are trapped in an existence we cannot escape, because we do not have the ability to understand what it means <em>not to exist</em> </p>
<p>The only thing that matters is the feeling and how we decide share it with each other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conceptualizing is great. But when your conceptualizing goes beyond the Physics (e.g based on a popsci article) then it becomes metaphysics. Even metaphysics is fine, but it's not physics.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again, I do NOT want to be a dick. I respect you for posting your ideas. But you are saying a lot of things that are just flowery words. While beautiful and nice to read, they don't have a lot to do with the real science. That's why I challenged you to think about WHY the things you're saying might be true, instead of just saying them. That's so much more fun because you will always find nice surprises.</p></div>		</li>
