			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not entirely accurate. You can refer to this graph: <a href="https://unleashyouroptimalhealth.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/fuel-graph.png" target="_blank">https://unleashyouroptimalhealth.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/fuel-graph.png</a>
The aerobic system uses both carbohydrates and fats as fuel. Endurance training actually makes you better at using a greater proportion of fats, delaying the depletion of glycogen. </p>
<p>I am not sure about the muscle breakdown part. If i remember correctly, three thing could be responsible for making the race more difficult at the end:</p>
<p>One would be systemic fatigue, including CNS fatigue</p>
<p>Two would be micro lesion, not exactly muscle breakdown; running is high impact and has an eccentric portion that damage the muscles</p>
<p>And three would be glycogen depletion, or &quot;the wall&quot;</p>
<p>So it is entirely false that you do not use fats. Its probably the primary fuel source in a marathon, though it could possible be glycogen, too, not sure about that. Fun fact: at a healthy weight, you store about 2000 calories as glycogen, and 75000 as fat ! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I wasn't entirely accurate. You can access fat but it is a slow process so if you are running a marathon length race at a competitive pace, you cannot get the fat stores to break down fast enough. The primary cause of the wall is running out of glycogen stores. Otherwise, there would be no wall since you could just continually access fat. Obviously, if you go very slow, you can continue to access fat. <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20854502/understanding-why-you-hit-the-wall/" target="_blank">https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a20854502/understanding-why-you-hit-the-wall/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was not thinking of competitive speed, and it would make sens that the body use a greater proportion of glycogen in that case. However the link you gave quite clearly indicates that fat is also an important substrates for marathoners. Unless you do speed work, you will be using fat in a non negligible proportion. You dont have to go super slow, especially if you are trained. As mentionned before, accessing fat storage efficiently is trainable.</p>
<p>Again, the link you gave indicates that if glycogen were the only substrate, it would deplete after 20-30 miles and you wouldnt be able to continue. Which doesn't normally happen precisely because you're utilizing fat, too, which delays glycogen depletion. Muscle breakdown does not account to much in a normal situation. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your body is fat adapted then you actually have access to your fat reserves more readily, this is how some ultra marathon runners have been known to have run 100 miles with virtually no carbs!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is partly genetics and partly training. You can train your body to pull on fat reserves more quickly. There is a big (and not always uncontroversial) wealth of information on marathon training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems to not so much be genetic (although this will no doubt have a component in it) but rather what you adapt your body to; eat higher fat: burn fat, eat higher carb: burn carb.</p></div>		</li>
