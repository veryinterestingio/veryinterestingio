<p>The only reason Earth manages to have water is because it was bombarded with icy comets that formed outside the snow line after it got enough gravity to retain things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just want to chime in to say that the current main belief is that Earth got most of its water from asteroids that contained water, not comets. There is quite a bit of water in many asteroids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I also said, a comet is just an asteroid with an elliptical orbit that spends most of its time outside the snow line.</p>
<p>There's really not a clear division between a lot of astrophysical objects. This is why Pluto got kicked out of the planet club.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the next question should be; what allowed Earth to retain most of the water as opposed to Mars. I know it is atmosphere, but what made Earth capable of creating such an atmosphere and not Mars or Venus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars has like 1/4 of the mass earth does. Mars didn't have the gravity to keep hydrogen like we do. Mars did have water for millions of years though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of Earth's water, maybe 90%+, is actually in Earth's mantle. There could be a lot of water inside Mars that is just locked up because its core has now solidified, trapping it there. The water on the surface either froze, got stripped off by solar activity, or got blasted out by asteroid/comet impacts.</p>
<p>Gravity is everything when it comes to keeping an atmosphere, followed by a magnetic field (which Mars lost because it's too small), followed by getting continuous new outgassing from the planet below.</p></div>		</li>
