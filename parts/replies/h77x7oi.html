			<div class="markdown"><p>A little theory I have, is that England was at the forefront of the industrial revolution because you can work the entire year, it‚Äôs never too hot, rarely too cold, there‚Äôs no monsoon season, no hurricanes, no earthquakes or tsunamis, it‚Äôs just constant bland weather. So nobody gets any breaks and a lot of shit gets done.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs probably a lot of other reasons like small island with lots of ports, and lots of coal, but it makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>spf is a measure of what factor of time that exposure is reduced by.  so you could be in the sun 100x as long with SPF 100 vs unprotected (though you would need to reapply lotion regularly)</p>
<p>a roof (or any other fully opaque barrier) would not really be applicable, but I guess its SPF Infinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically infinite. SPF number means how many times you can ‚Äúextend‚Äù your skin‚Äôs natural resistance to damage from the sun. So, for example, a pale person on midday would start to go red in about 15mins. With SPF those 15 mins become 750mins. It‚Äôs not perfect, and the way the sunscreen is applied is important, but that‚Äôs the idea.
Inside your house you shouldn‚Äôt get burnt ever, therefore the SPF is infinite</p></div>		</li>
