			<div class="markdown"><p>What's funny for me, is that any of the 'sensitive' deodorants absolutely leave me raw within minutes, but a lot of the standard deodorants work fine lol.</p>
<p>Dove plug right quick: Of Dove deorderants, the Cool Silver is the only one I can use that doesn't smell like ass (imo), and doesn't leave me raw. Any of the dove 'gel' ones totally like cheese grate the pits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have an aluminum compound in them that makes them “antiperspirant” (I.e., they prevent sweating) whereas deodorant does not contain this compound and contain an ingredient to kill bacteria while also covering odors. There may be some evidence that aluminum is correlated with Alzheimer’s so some people prefer not to use antiperspirant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top comment goes into more detail but to paraphrase, the white streaks are indicative of a very effective anti perspirant instead of just something to cover the smell</p></div>		</li>
