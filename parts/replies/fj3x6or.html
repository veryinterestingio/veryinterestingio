			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly. Same goes for boating because your body is constantly getting pounded by the waves and trying to stay stable. Was doing training on the Detroit river and was on the water from 9 a.m to 5 p.m and by the end of the day I was sore as hell and tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both of theories are true, mental load and physical due to vibrations. </p>
<p>However, you may have noticed that the faster you go, the more tired you get. You have to be a twitchy fucker at high speeds, everything happens faster so you have to ingest and process info quicker, as well as make decisions faster - taking up more processing power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brain's bodily functions take more effort than our conscious thinking. You're tired from the stress of driving, not from thinking.</p>
<p>Myself, after several years in B2B sales and driving 8 hours a day, I can spend a whole day behind the wheel in heavy traffic and I don't care at all. No stress, very little conscious thinking, too.</p>
<p>What is tiering are the vibrations and shaking. That's why large cars with more inertia and longer wheelbase are so much better than compacts - they shake much less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That will be due to the springs in the 450. The rear is stiff so it can take the weight of a load. You need to compare more similar cars to see the difference. Jump an an A Class then an S Class. Night and day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive an f250 and my wife has a mazda. There's a massive swing in the feel of these 2 vehicles. In the Mazda I feel every teeny tiny turn of the wheel. Every bump seems to jerk you quickly. While in my truck it seems everything is more exaggerated but happens slower. More like the movement on a boat, like floating. Trips to the city are harder in the Mazda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Driving is mentally stressful because of what is mentioned above. The stress increases with bad weather. I also drive professionally for a living. Some people feel tired after driving their car for a couple of hours.  When I finish my shift, driving my 18 wheeler big rig through a snow storm after 8 hours, I’m just done, and all I want to do is go to bed.</p></div>		</li>
