<p>As you all have said, a mirage is very specific and identifiable and can only reasonably be confused with water. In order to picture anything beyond that you'd have to actually be hallucinating due to dehydration or whatever. </p>
<p>I've always found it interesting that I only ever saw it depicted in the desert though because they can occur anywhere. I suppose someone walking through the middle of France isn't going to be swayed by the potential of finding water up ahead whereas walking through a desert that's a lovely sight.</p></div>		</li>
