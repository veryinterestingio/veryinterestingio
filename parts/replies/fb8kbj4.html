			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this is pretty accurate. The decision making a computer is capable of breaks down to 4 basic conceptual decision trees: and, or, nand, or nor. </p>
<p>Insects operate in much the same way - they can act upon the concepts of all of X (&quot;and&quot;, such as all of Y prey species are food), some of X (&quot;or&quot;, as in all members of Y prey species are food if they are red or have wings), not some of X (&quot;nand&quot;, as in no member of Y prey species is food except red and has wings), or none of X (&quot;nor&quot;, as in if Y species has either black colors or no wings, it is not food).  We've actually learned a lot about the building blocks of computational cognition from insects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a basic level, we react to stimuli as any other creature does. We are made sentient by our ability to conceptualize, examine, and choose to override our instinctual reactions to stimuli.</p>
<p>If you put food in front of an animal, they will eat it if they are hungry. If you put food in front of someone on a hunger strike, they will be biologically driven to eat it, but will choose to remain hungry. That's the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are also biologically driven to not eat it based on social conditioning. I’m not sure we can confidently say that the person choosing not to eat is making a choice, rather than the social stimuli being stronger than the hunger stimuli (especially if they believe they will just eat after the strike is over).</p>
<p>Kinda like one of my dogs. He doesn’t like fruit. If he’s hungry, and I put fruit in front of him, he won’t eat. Because he doesn’t like fruit. Replace “fruit” with “source of hunger strike” and we see the same thing for humans. Do we actually make a call against our nature (hunger), or is a different aspect of nature simply stronger (social animal)? I’m not sure we actually know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair a well trained pet can make this decision to not eat food too. And a typical human will eat the food if hungry. So no it is not a good example of why humans are different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a pretty disturbing rabbit hole to fall down if you want to look into the question of if you made a rational decision on your own or if you just rationalized an instinctive reaction. It turns out the human mind is possibly the greatest rationalization engine in the universe. Free will probably isn’t an illusion, but the odds are most people probably don’t really know why they do a lot of the things they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever played the card game War?  You and your opponent each flip over a card, and the person with the higher card takes both.  If you both flip over the same card, then you each put down 3 cards, flip over another card, and the higher of those takes them all.  </p>
<p>There are rules for how to play the game, but you may notice that there are no one's actually making any decisions.  If you didn't like the outcome of a turn, and wanted to back up a couple turns and play again, you'd be guaranteed to get the same outcome.</p>
<p>That's basically determinism.  It's the idea that if you start the universe in precisely the same state two times, you'd get exactly the same outcome both times.</p></div>		</li>
