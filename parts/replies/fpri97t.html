<p>Another question: when something is extra spicy, I'll get hiccups sometimes. What gives?</p></div>		</li>

<p>But how about hot foods? (TBH that was the main reason I posted haha)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I interpreted &quot;hot and spicy&quot; as the same thing in your OP.</p>
<p>Gustatory rhinitis is a term that literally means &quot;taste-related runny nose&quot;. It's believed that people whose noses run when they eat hot foods (not spicy, but just like, hot soup) have a sensitive trigeminal sensory nerve. When this nerve is stimulated, your nose runs, your eyes water, etc. Cold acidic foods can sometimes stimulate this nerve too. I'm affected by citrus fruits myself in this way. Any time I eat an orange or have a glass of lemonade, or a margarita, my nose runs like crazy and I start sneezing because of postnasal drip.</p>
<p>It's thought to be something like a false-alarm allergic reaction. There is no specific set of foods that can cause this reaction. It is individual to the person's particular body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally, an answer! </p>
<p>I've been dealing with this <em>forever</em>. I eat soup, my nose runs. I eat other temperature-hot stuff, my nose runs. </p>
<p>Now I at least know there's a rational reason and it's not something terribly wrong with me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's just that humans are monsters. We like pain. So we actually breed these plants to be even more repellent to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I seriously want to see a TV series that's from the perspective of an alien anthropologist studying our species, but instead of being the &quot;middle-grounder&quot; that most sci-fi makes us out to be, we're actually one of the extremophiles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data entry 55.  </p>
<p>These primitive primates continue to astound me! Upon examination of some of their writing, I was able to decipher some of their language and the computer is now compiling a lexicon for my future usage.   </p>
<p>From the preliminary translations, I can confidently say that they call this world &quot;Dirt.&quot;   </p>
<p>The Dirtlings, as I have come to call them, are a remarkable example of adaptation to adverse conditions. It's incredible enough to think of the biosphere of a planet adapting to what we now know as the &quot;Oxygen Problem&quot; by <em>simply using it for respiration,</em> but to see it in action was another thing entirely.   </p>
<p>One of the most caustic known elements in the known galaxy, and these strange primates, along with nearly every motile macroscopic organism on this planet, just breath it the way you or I would breathe the methane of a normal, habitable world. Simply remarkable, as I have said.  </p>
<p>But, to think that, on top of that kind of adaptation, that these primates would then willingly grow some of the most toxic flora on Dirt and <em>consume</em> it for apparent pleasure is almost beyond belief. I have personally witnessed a Dirtling consume a solution distilled from a fermented plant mixture, one that when analyzed proved to be more than 25% ethanol!  </p>
<p>More findings to come soon. I cannot wait to see what these fascinating beings will show me next!</p>
