<p>One way to think about it, abdominal fat is like the fatty edge of a steak, &quot;visceral fat&quot; is like the marbleing throughout a steak.  Which is easier to remove?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think they do it to encourage planned c-sections, which can be scheduled and less problematic. I cant confirm this , just a guess, but i'm guessing that my guessing may be correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former big guy who’s less big now here. You can do it. I know everyone says that when someone wants to start losing weight, but it really is possible. There are a ton of diet systems out there if you are looking for structure, but overall, check with your doctor if possible to see what’s individually safe for you to do. </p>
<p>It really boils down to cutting out a significant amount of calories and avoiding fast food, soda/pop and junk food. For me I cut down to 1400-1600 calories/day on most days and lost an average of 2lb/week for several months. Exercising while fairly large was pretty much not possible with the strain put on previously injured joints, but I still lost the first 35lb with diet alone, even over the holidays. I still ate a regular thanksgiving dinner and the spread of food at Christmas, but overall just ate less and very little food that’s really nutritionally not good for me. </p>
<p>The first 2-3 weeks were the most difficult, but I swear it gets easier. Your body adjusts to eating less and you don’t get those ravenous cravings much at all. I eventually stopped having them and just got used to a regular light breakfast and lunch, then a regular dinner. </p>
<p>I plateaued at 35lb and started on an elliptical almost daily. Started at 15 minutes at a pace I could maintain and slowly worked myself up. Now if I need to book ass across an airport terminal I don’t feel like I’m going to f’ing die. I still have health problems, but holy crap do I feel better physically and mentally. I have a solid sense of well-being that I’ve rarely felt in nearly 30 years. </p>
<p>Seriously - you can do it. I’m lazy as hell and I did. It’s just difficult to get past the “I’ll start tomorrow” bit. If it gets tough or whatever, pm me here or go on a sub where others are going through the same. My wife being a nurse on a cardiac unit having patients younger than me with preventable similar health conditions was an major eye opener. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I started exercising about 2 years ago now just because I wanted to try and get back to something resembling 'in shape'. I swear that got me out of a funk - if not actual depression - that I didn't even recognize I was in.  I remember about 6 months after starting and realizing I was waking up feeling... good. Happier. Life wasn't series of difficult days.</p>
<p>Well done you :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pounds in the kitchen, ounces in the gym. Diet plays a huge roll. As far as exercise, just an hour of walking a day will get you started. Do that for a year, or even two years. This is a chance to change your life, so if you want a nice long one, don't beat your body (or yourself) up over getting in shape. The good news is as you up your activity, you actually need to fuel your body more (with good foods, of course). Better news is your pallet will adjust to what you put in, too. Let your family know you are doing it, and your friends. Social media and being held accountable does help. If you walk early in the morning, or late at night, don't worry about looking like a dork if you carry a flashlight around....get one of those police club looking bastards with 4 D batteries if anyone gives you grief. Good luck to you. It's a long road...</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a previously fat person, this is so true. Was exercising and not losing weight until I stopped eating sugary foods, processed foods , drinking soda and beer. As soon as I stopped the weight literally dropped off of me. </p></div>		</li>

Naturally: If you're very obese, please consult your doctor so he can monitor your vitamin/mineral levels but otherwise this diet is very pleasing to satiate and turns your body into a literal battery of fuel to use. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't consider myself an expert so be sure to Google this stuff to be make sure I'm not wrong, but I think endurance exercises like swimming and running will help plus cut back on alcohol and sugars.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can't really target fat loss on a certain body part so try to be healthy as possible with a nutritious diet, a good calorie goal, and exercise. I think visceral fat should be more likely than some other fats to burn off  though since its closer to the liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to contradict you but just expand on what you said, cardiovascular exercise like swimming and running is a mass loss (notice I didn't say fat loss) form of exercise and will absolutely help a person lose weight in conjunction with a proper diet, but one thing to consider is that while cardio will help build the muscles you work during the exercise, getting bigger and heavier is contradictory to performing cardio well so you will stay slim, which isn't necessarily bad depending on your goals, but to me is not ideal. </p>
<p>A proper weight lifting plan comprised of compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench pressing, rowing, overhead pressing, pullups, provides a larger metabolic and hormonal response than cardio and the calorie burn lasts longer after exercise is over. Also, the more muscle you build the more calories you burn while you're not doing anything, your base metabolic rate goes up. </p>
<p>Cardio is important but for real body composition change and lasting results I always recommend weight training. </p></div>		</li>
