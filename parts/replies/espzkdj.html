			<div class="markdown"><p>External genital skin is not structurally different from the rest of your skin, but it does tend to be more sensitive, and its environment is different (moist, hairy, lots of friction). You want to avoid using any potentially-irritating chemicals (exfoliants, fragrances) there, especially if you're having issues.</p>
<p>If you have professionally-diagnosed eczema that's not responding to fragrance-free hypoallergenic moisturizers, try a steroid cream or ointment - either OTC cortisone cream, or a prescription steroid like betamethasone.</p>
<p>If you just have a rash on your genitals that you think is eczema, see your doctor to rule out fungal infection and STIs before you use any steroid products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has a doctor confirmed that it's eczema, or are you self/google-diagnosed? What creams/lotions have you used, are any of them prescription?
I'm not a medical professional, but crotches are generally kinda moist, which leads to excess fungal growth. My GP has given me a standing prescription for an anti-fungal cream with betamethasone in it, that I use whenever a rash starts up in any moist bits. Maybe that could help you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think eczema need a professional opinion. It can be a sign of dermatitis (very easy to fix) or can be something that need more attention. The genital skin is very sensitive so be careful with the products you're trying in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they actually penetrate the barrier, or just add a further barrier? I figured they just prevented/reduced moisture loss and thatâ€™s what actually helped, in addition to the illusion of instant softness from the lotion/cream itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most lotions work on top of the skin like a sunscreen. It depends on your main goal (keep hydration, help with sun burn, etc).
Moisturizer let ingridients 'into' the skin helping to retain water.
Every person is difrent so the skin needs will be difrent. For some people a product is perfect leaving the skin soft and for others the same product get sticky or oily. That's why there are so many.</p></div>		</li>
