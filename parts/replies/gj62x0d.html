			<div class="markdown"><p>When turning on motorcycles at higher speeds, you'll lean left/right with the bike.  The faster you're going, the more the bike will lean. </p>
<p>So basically how far up the little &quot;hairs&quot; are rubbed off on the side of the tires shows how much your bike has leaned.</p>
<p>(Not sure if you were genuinely confused)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>watch some motocross, they lean waaaay over to get tight turns at high speed. I'm assuming he's talking about hairs on the sides of the tires that wouldn't wear down if the owner was too cautious to lean into their turns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You lean a motorcycle to turn it. The harder you lean the harder the turn. If you've got the&quot;hairs&quot; lower on the tire wall, it means you haven't taken any hard turns because you're either chicken or unable.</p></div>		</li>
