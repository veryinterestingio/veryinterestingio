			<div class="markdown"><p>note that modern tonic water is much less quinine than what is needed to prevent malaria, so you could only imagine how bitter the original drink mustve been!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look around at some specialty mix shops you can get more ‘authentic’ tonic water with more quinine.  I’m not sure how close to the original stuff it is but I just about doubled the gin I would normally use and it tastes like a chewing a spruce tree powdered with aspirin.  I do not recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If consumed in high enough doses you can develop what is called Cinchonism (derived from Cinchona, the bark quinine is from) and it can be fairly dangerous. We in the craft bar community have to be mindful when creating house-made tonic syrups (though it’s unlikely to get to this level with something that tastes decent).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of this bit from Danny, the Champion of the World</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A funny thing about Mr Snoddy was that he always brought a glass of water with him into class, and this he kept sipping right through the lesson. At least everyone thought it was a glass of water. Everyone, that is, except me and my best friend, Sidney Morgan. We knew differently, and this is how we found out. My father looked after Mr Snoddy’s car and I always took his repair bills with me to school to save postage. One day during break I went to Mr Snoddy’s study to give him a bill and Sidney Morgan came along with me. He didn’t come for any special reason. We just happened to be together at the time. And as we went in, we saw Mr Snoddy standing by his desk refilling his famous glass of water from a bottle labelled Gordon’s Gin. He jumped a mile when he saw us.</p>
<p>“You should have knocked,” he said, sliding the bottle behind a pile of books.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” I said. “I brought my father’s bill.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” he said. “Yes. Very well. And what do you want, Sidney?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, sir,” Sidney Morgan said. “Nothing at all.”</p>
<p>“Off you go, then, both of you,” Mr Snoddy said, keeping his hand on the bottle behind the books. “Run along.”</p>
<p>Outside in the corridor, we made a pact that we wouldn’t tell any of the other children about what we had seen. Mr Snoddy had always been kind to us and we wanted to repay him by keeping his deep dark secret to ourselves.</p>
<p>The only person I told was my father, and when he heard it, he said, “I don’t blame him one bit. If I was unlucky enough to be married to Mrs Snoddy, I would drink something a bit stronger than gin.”</p>
<p>“What would you drink, Dad?”</p>
<p>“Poison,” he said. “She’s a frightful woman.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first tried it as a teenager, I thought the same thing. It was horrible. Then, as an adult, I tried a weak gin and tonic. It wasn't my favorite, but it was tolerable. Slowly over time, I increased the gin and decreased the tonic. Now, I love nothing more than a dry gin martini.</p>
<p>It's like any strong flavor. You need to build up to it slowly. And once you do, you'll find it wonderful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm tagging to the top comment here, to add: the tonic water originally was made with a LOT of quinine, as ghttano said above.  It was originally like a Tea, which Brits traditionally loved, and did do a lot to prevent malaria. But even the Brits couldn't deal with it, so they sweetened it with honey or sugar, and eventually figured out that the VERY best way to suck down nasty medicine was with alchohol.  Gin was the perfect alcohol, as it can be made from just about anything that ferments, and is just flavored with Juniper berries. </p>
<p>Tonic water today has very little, or no, actual quinine, but mostly artificial flavorings. Not that that matters, my 86 year old mother was convinced that the quinine in WalMart tonic water helped her leg cramps. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most if not all tonic water still does have quinine in it, it's just a fraction of what it once had (to the point where it'd probably not be medically useful anymore).</p>
<p>Tonic water glows in UV light thanks to quinine, which is a fairly straightforward test I guess if you'd like to check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia tells me that the natives in Peru used the tree bark to treat shivering. Malaria also causes shivering so the Europeans tried it and it just happened to also cure malaria (through a different mechanism).
