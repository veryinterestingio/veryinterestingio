			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean it's relative and caused by the injury or perceived threat based on the type of injury or situation and not directly associated with the situation or injury itself ? Sorry if I am not able to understand, I mean can you measure the amount of injury from the pain and vice versa ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, when you hurt yourself, your nerves will signal &quot;something is wrong&quot; : that's nociception : aka detecting danger signals</p>
<p>Those danger signals activate a part of your brain that translate the signals into &quot;ouch, it hurts&quot; : that's pain.</p>
<p>You can have nociception and not have pain : that's what happens during anesthesia in surgery, when you get cut the nerves understand that something is happening but since your brain is not conscious of it you don't feel pain.</p>
<p>And you can have pain without nociception : something emotionnaly terrible happen to you, it can overstimulate this brain region responsible for pain and that's why you can feel pain without really hurting yourself.</p>
<p>Pain is a very very subjective interpretation, but in the head it's the sensation of something &quot;wrong&quot; that needs to be adressed. If someone feels pain, something is wrong basically</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, as pointed out physical and emotional pain are interpreted in the same area of the brain as pain.  The only difference is that physical pain comes with a tagged location from somewhere in your body, whereas emotional pain typically does not.  However, there are important and real physical effects to emotional pain as a consequence of being interpreted in the same area as physical pain.  The best example of this is heart attacks brought on by emotional trauma such as the loss of a loved one.  One type of this phenomenon is called Takatsubo Cardiomyopathy in which the vessels that feed the heart spasm as a consequence of emotional trauma.  Also called broken heart syndrome.</p>
<p>Also, it’s hard to measure amount of emotional injury.  There are certain depression, anxiety, etc questionnaires and screening tools, but these tools aren’t as accurate as say measuring the dimensions and depth of a skin wound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain does not equal injury/damage. Pain is just a perception, just like thirst or hunger. It’s something the brain projects somewhere to protect it. When there is necrosis (a violent cell death), then the nociceptors are like “hey brain, there’s damage here” and the brain projects pain on consciousness so that you leave the area alone until it’s cured, it protects you. But sometimes there is pain even if there is no damage, even without nociceptors sensing any violent cell death. Interestingly, pain can be much much higher when there isn’t any damage than when there is, because then it has no measure, so it isn’t a great indicator of real damage.</p></div>		</li>
