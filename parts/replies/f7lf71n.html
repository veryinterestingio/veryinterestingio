			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be harder for waterlife due to the amount of space needed to accurately represent an open-ocean. They are much more likely to grow to the size of the enclosure than terrestrial bugs. </p>
<p>I think a better way would be to compare the sizes of the same species taken from areas of different oxygen levels. Of course this is also difficult due to possible low geographical spread of the species. </p>
<p>But maybe such a study would work well when performed on smaller animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, there's an interesting phenomenon observed where predation is linked to size.</p>
<p>No predators, animals will grow larger to fill their niche or because there is less competition. It's called island gigantism.</p></div>		</li>
