			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm on brain zaps. At its worst, it's literally the only thing you can think of because every couple of moments or any sudden movement of your head triggers an electrifying feeling in your brain and your body feels fatigued, weak and tired for a fraction of a second. And the next brain zap is at most 30 seconds away...</p>
<p>0/10 would not recommend SSRI withdrawal</p>
<p>Edit: also, I wasn't even on a high dosage and only took them for a month or two, and it still took multiple months for the withdrawal symptoms to go away fully. A harrowing experience</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've recently had to go on Zoloft, but didn't have any of these symptoms from Citalopram from a few years prior. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I accidentally forgot to load up my pill pots with my ssri, and with a day I was feeling something like you describe. I'd describe it is a sort of mental &quot;shoop!&quot; noise in your head, coupled with feeling rough, and you're right about it becoming all consuming. Fortunately, after a day and a half I realised what I'd done and started taking them again. I've never felt so relieved! </p></div>		</li>
