<p>I think most Canadians know this, do we not? Seeing as 90% of Canadians live with 150k of the border I don't think I've met any Canadians who haven't ever driven down and accross a land border. Americans however I can't say the same. It's <strong>shocking</strong> how little Americans know about Canada and Canadians.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know. Growing up in Quebec if you had asked me the latitude of Vancouver vs Montreal I would have thought they are similar. I grew up with these books (<a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OUEXwns%2BL._AC_.jpg" target="_blank">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OUEXwns%2BL._AC_.jpg</a>) that make it look like the southern border of Canada is mostly a straight line except for that tiny bit of Ontario. </p>
<p>But nowadays people are growing up with google maps so maybe it's very different!</p></div>		</li>
