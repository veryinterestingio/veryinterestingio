			<div class="markdown"><p>The first person to get penicillin still died of a cut made by a rose bush cause they didn't know how much to apply. And that wasn't even that far ago, it was well in our parents generation, it's amazing how we take antibiotics for granted considering how recent their use is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A rotting tooth is a concentrated reservoir of bacteria inserted deep into the bone of your skull and connected to your circulatory system. </p>
<p>It is a short step from an untreated, infected tooth to sepsis. </p>
<p>And, apparently, the same bacteria that cause tooth cavities also like to colonize the heart. ~~So, a big blob of tooth plaque, essentially, grows in one of your coronary arteries, blocks the blood flow and causes a massive myocardial infarction. ~~<br />
So the tooth bacteria starts to eat one or more of your heart valves. A pump with a bad valve doesn't pump very well, so this leads to heart failure. Congestive or otherwise.</p>
<p>Dead from a heart <del>attack</del> <em>failure</em> caused by a tooth cavity.</p>
<p>Edit: valves, not arteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact - I’ve had open heart surgery and any time I go in to have my teeth cleaned they have me take a 2000mg dose of antibiotics (immoxocilin) an hour before, as apparently the bacteria in your mouth is the same bacteria that can give you an infection in the lining of your heart.</p></div>		</li>
