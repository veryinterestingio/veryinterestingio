			<div class="markdown"><p>If it doesn't mutate, wouldn't it go extinct anyway? Even if over a much longer time span?</p>
<p>Wouldn't everyone either get it and develop antibodies, or in some cases die, leaving only people who are immune around (and a few people who manged to avoid it until it went extinct)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With Polio you're infectious for 3-6 weeks. Most SARS-CoV-2 cases are infectious for a much smaller period of time. We're still working out exactly how long, but it sounds like people are testing positive well after their infection window has closed, which makes sense with the disease progression from upper respiratory to lower respiratory where you're much less likely to spread it since it is lodged in your lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Yes, it should have - but not every child in the remaining areas receive the vaccinations they need, because of complicating factors.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We're not there yet, but we're very close. Polio currently exists only remote areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Polio has gone extinct almost everywhere in the world as a result of vaccines. You can find the number of cases by year and location here: <a href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/wild-poliovirus-list/" target="_blank"><a href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/wild-poliovirus-list/" target="_blank">http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/wild-poliovirus-list/</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's very difficult to reach some communities to administer the vaccinations, especially due to violent conflict in these areas. Unfortunately, it looks like we've been losing ground for a few years - but it's an incredible feat to have gotten this far. Vaccines work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the experts are predicting that when approximately 40-50% of the population has had Coronavirus and develops immunity, the &quot;pandemic&quot; will be over as the virus will spread much more slowly since it no longer has as many hosts available.  Right now each sick person infects approximately 2.2 people, so the virus is spreading at an increasing rate.  When we reach 50% herd immunity, the infection rate should drop to approximately 1, meaning each sick person passes it to only 1 more person, so the number of new cases will no longer be increasing, and we'll be at a steady state.    Some estimates are that we'll reach steady state in a year, which is likely before a vaccine is ready for mass distribution.</p>
<p>As long as the virus doesn't mutate, the rate of cases should eventually start dropping as fewer new hosts are available.</p>
<p>If we were not practicing social distancing and quarantine, we'd reach 50% immunity much sooner.  However, many more people would die along the way since illnesses would outpace the health infrastructure to an even greater degree.</p>
<p>Note that these models are all based on the assumption that having COVID confers immunity to the virus.  There have been a few cases in China of people who recovered and tested negative, then became ill with covid again a few weeks later.  It's not yet known it y low levels of the virus were still in their body and just resurged when they became weak for to some other factor, or whether they truly caught the infection a second time.  Regardless, it does cast some doubt about whether someone who's had the illness once actually gets immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that the pandemic will be over (the virus itself will still be around, but the number of infected will drop significantly) well before the vaccine is available. </p>
<p>But yes the herd immunity is part of the plan to stop it from spreading again after the initial infection</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the implication was that covid19 is going to go extinct, it's that the other diseases spread much slower. So even though we're only doing enough to slow down covid19, it might be enough to stop other diseases entirely.</p></div>		</li>
