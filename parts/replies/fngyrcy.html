			<div class="markdown"><p>These are difficult times, and for those of us who have the benefit of canine companions to share our home with, their presence is a welcome reprieve. Just as it was an adjustment for many people in the nation to move to sheltering in place and working remotely whenever possible, there will be another adjustment period for society to reintegrate social interactions back to our previous working/living habits. These same challenges may also be experienced by the dogs that we share our homes with, particularly for those dogs who may already tend to be anxious, or sensitive to changes in routine.  If you and your dog experience negative impacts during the transition back to social engagement in the future, we recommend you reach out to your veterinarian as a first resource to discuss your unique circumstances. </p>
