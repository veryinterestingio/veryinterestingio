			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. I start my book with a patient who has a superbug infection that can only be treated with an antibiotic called polymyxin. We stopped using that drug a few decades ago because it was so outrageously toxic. But we've brought it back because the bugs aren't used to it. One of the keys to fighting antibiotic resistance is to keep the bugs on their toes. Even if we discovered ten new antibiotics tomorrow, we shouldn't let doctors start using them all.</p></div>		</li>

If we can accumulate bacteria that never mounts an attack how is this going to affect pretty much everything?</p></div>		</li>
