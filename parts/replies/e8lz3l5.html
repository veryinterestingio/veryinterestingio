			<div class="markdown"><p>Hence why I crank my guitar amp to 10 to get those tubes to really cook and then a power brake so I don’t deafen everyone.</p>
<p>A power brake is an attenuator with a potentiometer to lower the volume while not altering the voltage going through the tubes.</p>
<p>Tube amplifiers sound their best at full throttle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation, but for the sake of correctness, a vacuum tube valve used in amplification (in this case a triode) is normally fully &quot;on&quot;.  That is to say, the &quot;valve wire&quot; (more correctly called the <em>grid</em>) mentioned above when current is added, it actually closes the valve (i.e. reduces volume).   The solid-state transistor which replaced the triode actually works as originally described... normally off, but proportionally &quot;on&quot; when the control voltage is applied.</p></div>		</li>
