			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my word--I can't thank you enough for posting that article.  I just sat here reading it with tears streaming down my face because it explains so much about me. I was just trying to explain to my closest friend how I feel &quot;flat line&quot; and like I just don't ever get really happy or joyful or excited about anything.  I am thinking it is a result of some trauma I went through and I am wondering if a therapist can help me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve dealing with this shit for as long as I can remember and therapy has been helping me a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn’t cure me nor make my problems suddenly go away, but it had helped me find some things so deeply rooted and hidden that, duo to sheer fear of sharing to someone because of past bad experiences, I developed a fear of “sharing” it even with myself.</p>
<p>Mental health have a huge stigma on today’s society. Take your time to take care of your own and don’t be ashamed. Many deal with many things that don’t tell anybody about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dealt with multiple traumas as a child and young adult- could never figure out why therapy/antidepressants/lifestyle changes didn’t work to make me feel alive and shake me out of the numb I felt in general for about 18 years (on antidepressants to treat since I was 10). Why, despite all my effort, could I not shake it? </p>
<p>After working on mindfulness and emotional tolerance for a couple years my counselor and I used EMDR to help me process the traumas. Changed my brain, changed my life. See if you can find a counselor who practices EMDR and work with them to bring you to a state where you can process your trauma and move on. I will add that EMDR doesn’t erase trauma or memories- it’s like if you have a filing cabinet you an close all the way and a few files are sticking up- emdr helps pat them into place. The files are still there, you’re just not living in them all the time! It feels super weird and seems like a weirdo new age thing but it works for many many people who have ptsd, trauma, etc.</p>
<p>After hard work and six years of intensive therapy, mindfulness classes, and a year of emdr, I have been depression-free for 2.5 years. I still have normal ups and downs and sad days, but I am not numb anymore and it’s incredible. I’m finally alive at 30. </p>
<p>I hope whatever you choose you talk to someone and can work through this. Hang in there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely this. Therapy can do nothing but good things. Understanding yourself and why you feel the things you feel is paramount. Mental health has a shamefully awful stigma in our society. Don’t let that deter you. You do you. Do the things that YOU need to do. Be healthy, internet stranger :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I think I'm more &quot;neutral&quot; than most people, like I don't get very happy or sad about anything. I always felt guilty for not being sad when any of my grandparents died... since my father raised me since I was young and he worked 12 hour days my grandmother was a big part of my life as a child because she would watch me when my dad was working... I felt virtually nothing when she died. I can't remember the last time I was really happy either... It seems like I have only a few different moods, and at the extreme ends are &quot;content&quot; and &quot;annoyed&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t really know what to say, I’m tearing up reading your response. I’m so glad that the thing I posted helped you and I’m sorry you’ve gone so long without knowing what was underlying it. I hope you find a good therapist to help and please let me know if I can assist further in any way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably a bad sign that I've learned to dissociate at will, huh? Some days my anxiety is just too much to deal with without just lying on the floor and crying so I have to turn off my personality just to stay upright and moving.</p>
<p>Adult life is fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cold hollow feeling you get when you receive very bad news is <em>not</em> feeling nothing, nor depersonalization. It is an actual bodily sensation. Many (most? all?) emotions involve what is called a &quot;somatic state&quot; which involves sensations in the body, as the emotions involve biochemical changes throughout the body. Mind and body are not so easily separable as our Cartesian influenced mindset tends to think.</p>
<p>However I don't have the biological expertise to tell you exactly what is happening physiologically in this instance.</p></div>		</li>
