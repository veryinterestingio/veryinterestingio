			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, Hannah here - all really good questions that we encounter in our interviews with the bereaved here in the UK all the time. We find that funerals are highly complex events where conflict between family members about what should or shouldn’t happen is common. Some families are better at negotiating the spectrum of expectations than others. We also often find that where there has been a long period of care for the deceased prior to their death, that those doing the care work within the family report grieving whilst the person was alive (what we call ‘anticipatory grief’), so that by the time they die through long, protracted decline, there’s often feelings of relief and release mixed in with guilt and grief. None of these emotions are mutually exclusive. Both Kate and I would be loath to dictate that there’s one particular way of dealing and facing end-of-life over others as it’s about what is meaningful for those concerned at that particular time in their lives and the financial constraints etc. Peoples needs and experiences vary hugely so there needs to be space to accommodate different approaches. </p>
<p>I would be interested to know what you mean when you write “an archaic situation”; what are you referring to? It’s not clear in your question, so I worry I haven’t quite answered your question as you might have intended it being addressed.</p></div>		</li>
