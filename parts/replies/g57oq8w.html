			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally the real answer.  All you have to do to prove this is stand on your head, or just tilt your head so that it's upside down while looking at the moon.  When you do that, your brain will take time to process the new information, to figure out exactly what it's seeing, and the moon will be small (as it actually is).  But, if you stay upside down long enough your brain will figure out that you're simply upside down and things will return to &quot;normal&quot;, and the moon will be big again!</p>
