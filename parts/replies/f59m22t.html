			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a thing I could easily do when I was younger. Have some school trip I have to wake up at 5am for. Worry about waking up but then go to sleep and wake up at 4:58. I did this multiple times consistently. Can’t do it as an adult though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not work if you just try it once as a one off thing. Also if you have a habit of setting multiple alarms, or closing your eyes and laying in bed in the mroning after you wake up. </p>
<p>It may take a week or so of conditioning yourself to wake up once and get up, but yes, it does work. </p>
<p>There was a period of time when i did it every day for a year or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s awesome. </p>
<p>Did you have pressing things to wake up for? How do you comfortably train yourself for that without missing work, class, important drug deals, etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note, circadian rhythm is also dependent on your eating schedule. If it is steady, it is easier to fall a sleep and wake up at the same time. It doesn't even matter that much when you eat, just that you eat at the same time each day. If you want to change your sleeping schedule, you can do it by changing your eating schedule. This is used to combat jetlag, for ex F1 drivers use this, along with other tricks light adding or removing 480nm (blue) light to control our &quot;morning and evening&quot;. We have specialized light sensitive cells in our eyes that do not link with the visual cortex but instead regulate our body clock. Controlling the light color makes a hell of a difference. Using monochromatic orange or full red lights can help to get more sleepy in the bed room. This also means no bright displays and if they are present then adjusting their tint towards red and yellow, away from blue.</p>
<p>Routine is what bring those &quot;super power&quot; of knowing when to wake up but you need a steady body clock first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea absolutely, I mean I do believe in healthy regular sleep but for alot of us that isn't an option and that's where you can command your body to sleep whenever. I might tell my body I'm only going to sleep for 1hr,2,3,5hrs whatever and sure enough that's all it'll sleep for.</p>
<p>It's not going to work if your thinking body I'm tired sleep till whenever or not taking it seriously (that's when your body's natural cycles will wake you up) and it's not automatically going to make you want to spring up out of bed! But it'll atleast wake you up. There might be some task (not really that important) that I might need to get up at say.. 2am for, I'll tell my body, wake up at that time super tired, check my phone, think eh the task wasn't that important i'd rather sleep then go back to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I've done this before, but it was anxiety. It happened a few times in my life, where I had to wake up in time to give a presentation in the morning, or finish a project due the morning-of. But I get shitty quality sleep those nights because I wake up to an adrenaline rush in the middle of a deep sleep.</p>
<p>Is that the same thing?</p>
<p>Otherwise, my body actually naturally sleeps late. Like, 1pm, 3pm late. I've been diagnosed with delayed sleep disorder, in which my circadian rhythm is several hours off. (I'm not the person you replied to, btw.)</p>
<p>Edit: I think I may have done this “tell your body to wake up by X time” just yesterday (Saturday), because I had to get something updated for work yesterday morning ASAP. I woke up in time (by 8am) with no alarm, but still felt like it was driven by anxiety. So, I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>
