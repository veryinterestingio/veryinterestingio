			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely likely.  The DSM isn't a mathematical science, the boundaries are somewhat arbitrary and agreed upon based on clinical usefulness.  There are no mathematical formulas to calculate if someone is a narcissist vs ASPD vs psychopath, and so on.  Although Dr. Ramani Durvasula differentiates NPD from psychopathy as narcissists can feel shame, psychopaths don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to say, as someone with a cluster B PD - NPD/BPD, I can say that I can behave in psychopathic ways when I'm in the midst of an episode. It's like I can switch off any empathy I might feel towards someone once I've decided they are a &quot;bad&quot; person and would do the same to me given the chance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Narcisistic personality disorder has 2 different ways of operating though. One is certainly the well known, arrogant and self centered person who would lack empathy. The other version though I would say is a debilitating abundance of empathy where people will focus on self destruction(or refusal to focus on themselves) for the betterment of others. I'm not great at describing them, despite having been diagnosed as the second version of this. Who knows if narcissism will even make it into the DSM 6, it barely made it into 5</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much how I like to think about the difference of the two, and I think you stated it nicely. However, from a diagnostic perspective your comment is wrong. It would be possible to turn into a psychopath after birth because of traumatic experiences or damage to the brain for example, and it would be possible to turn out antisocial without a traumatic background, purely from genetics for example. My point is that there is no diagnostic criteria stating how your symtoms came about. There are just descriptions of different traits/symtoms and you either meet the criteria or you don’t, regardless of your biology or background. Both the dsm and the suggested diagnostic criteria of psychopathy are in this way ateoretical, which means they disregard the reasons/explanations for your symtoms. It is also very possible to be both antisocial and a psychopath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This rings true. The DSM, in my hobbyist opinion, is a flawed system. Psychology is nothing like physical medicine. Personality is less a system and more a concept. Differences in personalities are largely focused on the person's relationship to social norms, which isn't necessarily in line with biology. In fact, to some people who exhibit mixed traits, it is possible for them to change their personality on demand, and simply put, convince themselves to think differently in a given situation. A soldier for example, may be a perfectly healthy individual by any mental health standard, but also be able to compartmentalize the part of them that kills without remorse. Many of those who fit the &quot;successful psychopath&quot; trope may argue that they only do harm necessary to maintain the competitive advantage in a given system and are excelling in that system so should therefore not receive a diagnosis at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't an uncommon opinion. </p>
<p>The Division of Clinical Psychology in the UK claims that the diagnosis system is fundamentally flawed in its idea of categorising distress into disorders (e.g depression, schizophrenia, etc.). I just finished writing a paper on it and while I still definitely don't know enough to make an informed enough opinion, there are definitely some huge issues with the idea of diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although environmental factors can certainly play a significant role in many, if not most people with ASPD, it’s entirely possible to be born with it. ASPD has been shown to have a large genetic factor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most mental illness has a genetic factor, hence the stress-diathesis model of mental illness.  If you're predisposed to something, the right types of trauma and bad environment can set it off - hence severe childhood trauma can cause ASPD in people predisposed to it, but mainly it's seen as a dysfunctional coping skill stemming from a traumatic or dangerous childhood.  This does not seem to be the case with psychopathy.  For psychopaths, a healthy childhood and good family can help you succeed in society, but it won't change the lack of empathy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually many theories supported by data that psychopathy is effected by traumatic and dangerous childhoods. Monika Dargis is a researcher at UW-Madison studying the effects of children viewing domestic violence on psychopathy. Also, just because a child is exhibiting psychopathic traits doesn't mean that they will end up a psychopath as an adult, in fact most don't. David Lykken's Low fear hypothesis also has some interesting information on this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The differentiating factor between psychopathy and sociopathy is certainly whether or not the individual is born with the disorder, but since we don’t have an actual diagnosis for psychopathy, and ASPD is the only semi-suitable one, that’s where the issue lies. That being said, it’s obvious one can be born with ASPD since it’s our go-to diagnosis for those psychopathic individuals as well, being that they check all the boxes (or at least the amount needed to surpass the threshold necessary) for diagnosis. </p>
<p>Review the core traits used to diagnose ASPD and compare them to Hare’s PCL-R. </p></div>		</li>
