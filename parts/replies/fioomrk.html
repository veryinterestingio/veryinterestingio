			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of &quot;optimizing&quot; tools like to clear out the temp folder to free up drive space. Some people will do it manually if they're worried about not having enough empty disk space (e.g. installing a large game that you barely have enough free space for).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How exactly does it handle the temporary storage? Does it delete the contents after a specific amount of time? When does it go to check it? Are there instructions of what's in it somewhere? Can you access it?</p>
<p>Sorry for so many questions but I find these topics very intriguing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about other operating systems,  but Linux (which Android is built on), has a folder (/tmp) which is cleared on boot, or when the OS needs more space. And yes, you can access it.</p>
<p>The questions you're asking are OS specific though. MacOS also uses /tmp, but I'm not to sure about windows and iOS, as I don't use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be specific, /tmp folder actually is storage in ram, so it is not using anything on your drive. Also how it gets &quot;cleared&quot; since the data is never written on the drive and data in ram do not survive a power off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can definitely clear them manually; I've set up a task on my PC which clears all the crap, including temporary files, every Sunday evening...Idk tho if it'd be cleared automatically after some time...</p></div>		</li>
