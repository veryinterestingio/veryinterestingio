			<div class="markdown"><p>Your video is interesting, but nothing is pushing the pages of the phone book away or sucking them in as the original question describes.  In the video, the guy is clearly holding the phone book in the (large) opening in the subwoofer cabinet as the low bass notes make the pages flap violently and tear themselves into pieces.</p>
<p>I'm echoing /u/Pakyul here - I've worked with small and medium sized public address sound systems for 30 years and haven't seen the kind of one-directional pull of paper that the question describes.  Paper will certainly flutter back and forth in front of woofers that are playing low notes, and that flutter can be radical and even violent as /u/JayF2601's video shows, but there isn't a vacuum effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that what OP is describing is similar to the effect used by Apple Watches to eject water out their systemSlow mo guys recently did a video on this:</p>

<p>You can see the water retreat the system as the speaker pushes out, but recedes with the speaker as it sucks back in.</p></div>		</li>
