			<div class="markdown"><p>The vaccines act in the same way, even if they miss the mark on the exact flu strain circulating you still gain immunity for the strain you're vaccinated against, so you'll have at least some immunity the next time it comes around. While flu strains change often they're usually a combination of a few varieties and you gain partial immunity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called the cytokine storm. Basically a recently species hopped virus that's not adapted to keep the host alive (similar to many ebola strains) like the extra deadly strains of flu cause the body to throw everything it has at killing the virus. Basically it causes the body to nuke itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact; this is basically the the method the body uses when you get a fever. The other parts of the immune system have tried and failed to kill the disease in your body, so the last resort is to burn the place down and hope that your body outlasts the disease. Generally, this works because most diseases can't handle the tempratures the human body can ramp itself up to and they die off before our bodies kill themselves.</p>
<p>Its also why any illness that makes the inter-species leap from avians to humans is so deadly, their bodies run much hotter and when ours resort to fevers, the diseases have no problem running out the clock.</p></div>		</li>
