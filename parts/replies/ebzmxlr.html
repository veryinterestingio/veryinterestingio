			<div class="markdown"><p>Not not really. Submarines are long enough and the drag coefficient of water is high enough that a submarines terminal velocity to surface is not enough to go airborne.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, as many hidden comments have said, my name is very similar to <em>Das Boot</em> no, it's not for the movie (I'm a Red October guy, though Das Boot is a close second). It's my original username from War Thunder</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Submarines kind of &quot;do&quot; go airborne though when they surface. Kind of looks like a great white shark, except it's so long that it doesn't fully leave the water. Same principle though, just shoots up above the surface and splashes back down.</p>
<p>The terminal velocity to the surface isn't as relevant as the velocity it achieves on its way back down after breaching, which would be fairly low considering it doesn't get too high out of the water.</p>
<p>If it were somehow to jump out of the water a few hundred feet in the air that would probably cause a problem though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean you are correct, when the submarine is resurfacing via density difference compared to the surrounding fluids. </p>
<p>But when you have an external unlimited power source (aquaman), there is no such thing as &quot;terminal velocity&quot; since you can just keep applying higher forces as the drag gets greater.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: This is a joke. I’m aware it didn’t go airborne, but thanks for the informative replies! That scene of the sub breaching the surface is burned into my childhood memory, and I remember watching that film over and over again mostly to relive that moment. And also to hear Sean Connery’s hilariously non-Russian accent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hull on a US navy submarine is several inches thick of very strong HY-80 steel. On the inside of the exterior shell are huge frame ribs that we call frame bays. I have done an EMBT blow  where nearly 3/4s of the sub came up out of the water and slammed back down. Just a testament of how strong these sub hulls are...the USS San Francisco ran head first into an underwater mountain at flank speed...crushed the sonar dome and a few of the forward main ballast tanks in but we did not lose the boat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Submarines basically stay evenly weighted with the ocean around them. The force required to push a submarine from some depth to the surface (assuming there isn’t flooding occurring) is very small compared to lifting the boat out of the water, airborne. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under normal conditions this is true, but subs can become buoyant. During emergency conditions they can do an e-blow, where they blow out all of the water ballast with compressed air. The sub's buoyancy increases dramatically and the whole thing blasts to the surface of the water like a cork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are buckles for the Helm (person who controls the rudder and fairwater planes) and Planesman (person who controls the stern planes). They are supposed to where them when they are on watch. The Diving Officer has a buckle that he can put on. The Chief of the Watch (COW) has a buckle too. The Officer in charge in Control Center has one in a little seat that he never uses. But these are the people that make the sub do angles so if it’s about to happen they know it and can take action accordingly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've always wanted to see underwater footage of a large (think nuclear-class) submarine. I'm sure the military has tons of this kind of footage, but I've never found any in the public domain. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The secret part of the submarine is also its propellor.  You will see anytime a boat is dry docked the first thing they cover is the propellor in the back.  Mainly because if you can get a good picture of the propellor you can find out its acoustic signal and trace that boat anywhere in the world without even seeing it.</p></div>		</li>

<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cole_bombing" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cole_bombing</a>
Submarines are even more secretive (AFAIK they don’t make public the speed, depth, and warfare capabilities of their subs).. I would imagine the Navy makes sure that all their crews also firewall all information including pictures/videos of their subs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The movie Crimson Tide had to basically stalk a sub to get footage of it submerging.  From Wikipedia: &quot;Because of the U.S. Navy's refusal to cooperate with the filming, the production company was unable to secure footage of a submarine submerging. After checking to make sure there was no law against filming naval vessels, the producers waited at the submarine base at Pearl Harbor until a submarine put to sea. After a submarine (coincidentally, the real USS Alabama) left port, they pursued it in a boat and helicopter, filming as they went. They continued to do so until it submerged, giving them the footage they needed to incorporate into the film.&quot;  </p>
<p>EDIT:  That was 1995.  I wonder how the Navy would respond today in the post-9/11 world.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This footage is mostly simulated because it is dark underwater and thus very difficult to see a black submarine to any useful degree. However, you may find something useful on the US Navy's YouTube channel. I seem to recall a recent promotional video that featured subs.</p>
