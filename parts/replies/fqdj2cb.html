			<div class="markdown"><p>A simplified way to look at it is If it killed too quickly, it would not have enough time to spread and infect others. The less deadly version is more beneficial to its long term survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on route of transmission. Influenza produces a short-lived infection and is spread through respiratory droplets. Making someone really sick is going to prompt others to keep their distance, reducing chance of spread. Killing someone likewise makes it impossible to spread. So, viruses that produced weaker symptoms would reproduce more than those that rapidly killed their hosts. Some amount of symptoms is likely beneficial to the virus, since coughing helps to spread viral particles, but too many is detrimental.</p>
<p>A pathogen like HIV has such a long period of asymptomatic infection that there is likely much less pressure to reduce pathogenicity. </p>
<p>Anthrax spreads by inducing animals to bleed out everywhere, so it is likewise under no selective pressure to get less pathogenic.</p></div>		</li>
