			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does leak, and in fact a lot of times plastic surgeons will make &quot;mesh&quot; grafts where they basically use a machine to make a bunch of openings in the graft (thus, a mesh) so that fluid can escape and not build up under the graft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isnt necessarily why we do this, we also can cover more area with a meshed graft, so you get more bang for your harvest</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a free flap graft on my foot that had artery and vessels manually connected.  It took hours for the doc to get it working.  The connection was so weak they actually used leeches on the graft to pull blood into the graft.   4 leeches every 2 hours for 2 weeks and 7 blood transfusions...  The graft ended up not surviving and was removed,  but luckily enough tissue grew under and i was able to heal it with a wound vac.

			<div class="markdown"><p>leeches help the venous drainage. Arterial connections are easier to make, but if the blood builds up and there isnt good venous drainage, then the arterial flow will be decreased (this is called venous congestion). Leeches help remove that blood that isnt being drained by veins, allowing for better perfusion and new venous connections to be made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a flap it's not a graft, it's either one of the other (yours is a flap having it's own vascular supply manually attached, grafts don't have it)</p>
<p>Also leeches aren't used to &quot;pull blood into the graft&quot;, they are used when there is venous insufficiency in a flap to avoid congestion (= when there is too much blood that can't escape the flap)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to have healed a lot in the last pictures. How much can they reduce the pain in those weeks while it is still healing? I hope you are doing better now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer! It makes sense that the graft is just kind of passively getting blood, etc. by basically diffusion until new blood vessels form, and while thatâ€™s happening, some of the tissue does die.
Humans and medicine are infinitely fascinating and gross.</p></div>		</li>
