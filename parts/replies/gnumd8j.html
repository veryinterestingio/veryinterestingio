			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much with pineapples...they die picking/fruiting...the nice part, is how many pineapples you can get from replanting parts of the plant.  The crown, and any the plant's &quot;suckers&quot; (side shoots that grow in between the leaves of the main stem) and slips (tiny shoots that grow out from the bottom of the pineapple fruit) can produce new plants when replanted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Millions. I visited a farm a few years ago that harvested 3 million pineapples a year on 150 hectares. All harvesting was mechanised. Packing was done by hand. The next crop was grown from the prior year's tops so no seed cost (they harvested the whole plants and regrew each time but the variety was quick growing)</p>
<p>It was fascinating. Massive economies of scale in operation.</p></div>		</li>
