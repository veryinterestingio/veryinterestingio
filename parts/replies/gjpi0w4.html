A bee can easily stab anything that small without dying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I've seen a video where they harvest bee venom for skin care products. I used some and loved it but felt bad because I thought they were killing a ton of bees for it. Turns out they just piss them off enough to sting a mirror and after awhile they scrape up all the venom like cocaine.</p>
<p>EDITS:
&#x200B;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PA2-RgEdbk" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video of it being done for everyone curious.</p>
<p>Also here is a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4598227/" target="_blank">paper</a> on possible benefits of bee venom in skin care products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last summer I was trying to move a bumble bee that was stuck on my screened-in porch. It tumbled off the piece of paper I was carrying it on, and I caught it with my hand. Immediately stung me and then I felt super bad it was gonna die when I was just trying to help it--- then I realized the stinger was still on the little buddy and did some googling later. </p>
<p>I set it up with a little sugar water and it flew off after a little bit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They do, if they carry honey.</p>
<p>They do the equivalent of a jet pilot landing on the wrong carrier. Humiliate him and claim the airplane. The bee just becomes part of the new hive after that.</p></div>		</li>
