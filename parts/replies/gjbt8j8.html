			<div class="markdown"><p>The real question is how to make a magnet? Natural magnetite exists, but it's rare....</p>
<p>So first you would use a chemical battery - copper and zinc in a acid and build an electromagnet. Use that to make better magnets - I believe simply hammering heated iron when it's in a magnetic field will allow it to align into a permenant magnet.</p>
<p>Once you have them you can build your generator which will allow to turn mechanical energy into a current.</p>
<p>The real problem is inefficiency and infrastructure - modern generators, motors and manufacture are the result of a couple centuries of incrimental design and improvements in materials.</p>
<p>Producing a motor which is more efficient than just using mechanical energy directly would be astoundingly difficult. The real killer apps for electricity originally were telegraph and radio - military and commercial advantage. That would depend on a level of other development being ready.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes - it will steam engine when it's steam engine time...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a foot note in history to add.</p>
<p>The first evidence of electricity is from the ancient Egyptians using a chemical battery.</p>
<p>It wasn't very powerful... but there's some speculation about its real applications.</p>
<p>We don't seem to have electricity for a long while afterwards, as we stick with Mechanical Devices for a few thousand years...</p>
<p>In our modern history, I'd suggest looking at Nikola Tesla and the corresponding &quot;war&quot; between competitors. It's quite illuminating.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XcFOOfqfx3s" target="_blank">ElectroBoom - Baghdad Battery</a> - Fact Check, Egyptians didn't understand electricity enough to use it. An accidental &quot;useless&quot; battery isn't significant evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd heard one theory a while back about the baghdad battery that while it's very low power it does likely have enough charge to electroplate other metals in gold or silver (which was even more rare than gold in Egypt for a long period of time).</p>
<p>Well probably never definitively know what it was actually made for though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two other advantages of electricity over pure steam or fire: You can power light bulbs and itâ€™s easy to transport. A big generator can easily power multiple small motors or bulbs from hundreds of meters away. Over longer distances you have to think about higher voltages and transformers and stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They sit there with their photo-chemical energy-potential building asses and create energy from the sun, never attacking anything (okay venus fly traps exist, but most of them), and in doing so support all animal life.</p>
<p>Without plants, the gracious lovable bastards they are, we'd have nothing.</p></div>		</li>
