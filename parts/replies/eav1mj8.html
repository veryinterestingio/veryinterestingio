			<div class="markdown"><p>A weird way to say it,  but yes, this. Anything flushed with a liquid will remove certain “buildup” including bacteria acquired through the friction and exchange of bodily fluid during sex. </p>
<p>One of the reasons women have a higher instance of UTI’s is because the length of the urethra compared to men. It still happens to men but typically it either takes longer to develop and/or a higher level of bacterial exposure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the antibiotics for a while (after a stint where I couldn’t go 6 weeks without another damn infection), but I’ve gotten more familiar with my body since then and can better prevent them so it isn’t really necessary to sustain the antibiotics anymore. But it does still mean a religious observance of the “pee after” rule.</p></div>		</li>
