<p>As I mentioned above, currently schools unwittingly reinforce social pyramids by celebrating the activities and achievements of a select few and mostly ignoring others. I think they could do more to help kids develop stronger friendships by fostering a wider array of extracurricular activities and celebrating them more equitably. I have found that the desire for popularity and social status drives a lot of bullying, but on the positive side, the kids who maintain stable, healthy friendships become less interested in social status over time and hence are less likely to engage in bullying. Additionally, these kids are less likely to be victims, and less affected by bullying when they are victimized. So we need to help more kids develop these kinds of social roots.<br />

<p>Seems that the inequitable celebration of certain activities over others is directly related to adult behaviors, preferences,  and likely own personal social pyramids.</p>
<p>Has your research looked much at adult behavior using children as proxies for personal social status as a cause of bullying?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct--it's probably not unwittingly at all. I haven't conducted research on parents social climbing by proxy (nor am I aware of any), but I know it happens, and probably quite often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a ex-victim of bullying outside of the US, I'd say this is most likely not the cause, with all the respect for your research. I live in Brasil and studied in a private school my whole life ( I should probably clarify that private schools are common here and frequently used by medium class families, if it makes any difference) While I indeed observed that I was chosen for being in the same social group, like you said, it had absolutely nothing to do with our interests, since a variety of activities are stimulated and  celebrated here without major hierarchy issues attached to it. We were not in the same teams or specials classes or anything either, so no competition in that sense, although there might have been competition for the friendship and admiration of others in more subtle areas. In short, I don't think lowering the levels of competitiveness would solve the problem. Kids will simply target &quot;weaker&quot; peers in desirable social positions, no matter what it means, to gain easy advantage.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to add that the reason why those programs who give prestige to other abilities and interests work is probably because they mean the adults are really engaged and making an effort to include those kids. If you ask me, I think those guys noticed I was considered irrelevant to the adults and thought they could get away from bullying me. They imitated the grown-ups. It might not be a bad idea for this side- effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't necessarily have to be competition in the same activities. The school I went to we had hockey(not ice hockey) and it was considered a 'girlish' sport(I was in an all boys school). So someone who played say basketball or rugby was seen as someone better than someone who played hockey. And this did make a hierarchy. And rugby players got higher in the hierarchy by acting like they were better than everyone else. So I'd say it does contribute.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this really matter? Coming from US schools, if the administration was merely unwittingly reinforcing the concept of social hierarchy, I would be ecstatic. Usually what I've seen is the administration bullying the teachers and students, the parents bullying the teachers, the teachers bullying the students, the students bullying the students, and sometimes the parents of one student bullying another student, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56404038" target="_blank">which makes the news</a>, and of course there's the occasional &quot;persecuted&quot; nerd (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre" target="_blank">a type of bully who thinks they're being bullied but isn't</a>) who shoots up their school (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting" target="_blank">or even someone else's</a>), which also makes the news but really just comes across as the final form that bullying takes.</p>
<p>It just seems to me, random layman with a pile of completely anecdotal evidence, that current American anti-bullying efforts are bizarrely one-sided, focusing only on student-student bullying, and not the larger environment of the school. It just seems like everyone is constantly at everyone's throats. My complaint is not that this is hypocritical (I mean, it is), but that the hostility and antagonism of the adults is what makes teens turn on each other. I'd love it if the adolescent chimpanzee instincts of the teens was the only source of antagonism at school, or even just the added pressure of homework, or having to get up at 5am and thus being sleep deprived for five years straight, but it is clearly not the only source of anger that then gets passed on from one teen to another. It just seems to me the adults are to blame, and not for doing something &quot;unwitting,&quot; but for being raving, violent lunatics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And, I'd add, not the broader cultural context of present-day America in general.</p></div>		</li>
