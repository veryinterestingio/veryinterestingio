			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if a party wants to report that an individual failed to make a payment, their entire payment history with that party as a single report should be able to be submitted without costing anything extra, including every single on-time payment to give context to the missed payment. This should be relevant to one's credit as making 3 scheduled payments and 1 being late should affect your credit in a much different way than making 300 scheduled payments and 1 being late.  It shouldn't cost anyone extra to not get un-proportionally dinged by a mistake.</p></div>		</li>
