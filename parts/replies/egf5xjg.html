			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid answer. To expand on this: There's a lot of emphasis at the moment on the role of social influences on development, and with all that, it is easy (or perhaps fashionable) to forget the vast amount of innate behaviours and knowledge posessed by both humans and animals. In any non-parented animal, it is not much of a stretch to say that <em>every</em> behaviour they display is genetic and inherent. </p>
<p>Humans recognising other humans is a particularly fascinating example, especially with regards to faces. There are plenty of brain processes which occur <em>only</em> with regards to something we notice as a human face. We are far more efficient at processing them than we are with other information, we automatically prioritise them over other visual information, we can remember thousands of them with minimal effort despite the fact that they only have small variations, and these processes completely fall apart if we try to apply them to non-human faces - even very closely-related primates with similar facial structures. With regards to this, similar effects are found in newborns as in adults, suggesting that (at least in humans), it does not depend on parenting at all, despite humans having the longest parentage cycle of any known animal (as far as I remember). This ability is so strong that it causes us to recognise faces in places where no such thing exists, such as on the front of cars. It's a fascinating subject.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it's not hard to see how animals would have an innate ability to spot other members of their species. Note also that, for mating purposes, it is necessary for basically every species to have a very keen ability to spot other members of the same species. It's highly likely that this ability is innate even in parented animals, since it has an evolutionary benefit. Or, rather, there is a cost to not having it, because if it is lacking, then orphaned animals would have no realistic chance of passing on their genes regardless of whether they survive or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. To expand a bit on the eternal debate of nature vs nurture influences on human behaviour... I've always been fascinated how even newborns react to perceived danger. A loud sound, something running towards them, etc. They <em>immediately</em> look at the nearest adult, preferably a familiar parent.</p>
<p>Why? Because the infant has no information or experience on whether something is dangerous or not. But the adult does. So it makes perfect sense to turn to the adult.</p>
<p>I tested this with both my children when they were babies. If there was a loud dog for example, they would turn to stare at me. If I looked calm, they would calm down also. If I felt scared they would squirm and cry.</p>
<p>No one taught them that obviously but in terms of chances of survival it makes sense. Fascinating stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point bringing up face recognition. The fact that face blindness (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia" target="_blank">prosopagnosia)</a> only impacts facial recognition and not other components within memory suggests it's a highly specialized and localized ability that has likely been within us and our ancestry for quite some time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes “sense”. The face is the most distinguishable feature of a human being and an innate ability to tell the difference between friend or foe at some point in our lineage would have been very important. Or possibly more accurate, the inability to quickly distinguish between recognizable friend or foe meant a shorter lifespan and less opportunity to produce offspring. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine as a human you come across an animal you've never seen before. I guarantee there is a 9/10 chance you can decide within the first few moments if that animal is going to be a threat to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm curious though, how much of that might be learned knowledge vs instinct? How good are humans actually at instinctively deciding if something's dangerous with no prior knowledge thereof? Like, if I saw a small brightly coloured animal I'd never seen before, I'd probably stay away from it because I've been taught brightly coloured things are nature's way of saying <em>&quot;step the fuck off,&quot;</em> If I see something with teeth and claws I'd book it because I've been taught things with teeth and claws will use them to rip your guts out. </p>
<p>Has there ever been a study like this with children? Like, you show a really young child pictures of dangerous/safe animals they've never seen before and they say if they think it's dangerous? You'd need to get them really young or they'd already have those &quot;learned&quot; ideas like I mentioned before.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My non-scientific answer is that it's definitely a mix of both. A child might try to pick up a brightly color poisonous frog because it looks cool rather than stay away because it screams &quot;danger.&quot; Conversely, a child might cry when it sees a wolf bearing its teeth and growling instead of trying to pet it when it's exhibiting those warning signs.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that the curled lip and bared teeth are common signs of aggression in most mammals so I have a feeling that's more instinctual than the brightly colored frog I mentioned.</p>
<p>That's a good question though, I wouldn't even know where to begin to find studies like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the environment as well. Kids who pick up brightly colored frogs without prior knowledge are usually raised in an environment where bright things are the norm (modern day kid's room)<br />
Meanwhile kids raised in the jungle may think that brightly colored things are different and scary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just an anecdote, and not a very good one. But I watched a discovery channel show one time and they threw a few rubber snakes in the Chimpanzee enclosure. They said the Chimps were all born there and had never seen a snake. The Chimps went crazy, started calling out to each other. A few of them eventually grabbed sticks and started poking the rubber snakes very cautiously. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What I am sure of is that peoples' fear of cockroaches, spiders and mice is instinctive. I jumped when I saw my first cockroach and that certainly wasn't a learned behaviour. Small geckos for example are a comparable animal in size and where and how you may encounter it but they don't get that that reaction out of me at all.</p></div>		</li>
