<p>My favourite part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On occasion, he had to invent reasons why his agents had failed to  report easily available information that the Germans would eventually  know about. For example, he reported that his (fabricated) Liverpool  agent had fallen ill just before a major fleet movement from that port,  and so was unable to report the event. To support this story, the agent eventually 'died' and an obituary was placed in the local newspaper as further evidence to convince the Germans. <strong>The Germans were also persuaded to pay a pension to the agent's widow</strong>.</p>

<p>Also were there any instances where the existence of Enigma was leaked or hinted at but was successfully covered up?  There had to have at least been some close calls.</p></div>		</li>

On the US side FDR and Marshall were cleared for Ultra decrypts. Eisenhower, Montgomery and Bradley were cleared in the European theater. MacArthur was cleared in the Pacific, which is one of the reasons why he was ordered to abandon Corregidor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes- Churchill knew about not just the Enigma work but the whole Ultra program. In fact, several times he was asked to personally decide how much risk the military should take when it came to acting on intelligence that could potentially tip off the Axis their machines had been broken. </p>
<p>I don't know of any leaks at all. Like I said, the British were exceptional when it came to operational security, even when it was bad for them personally. That, and there was no effective German spy operation in Britain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually, we do hear about it, it's just that the most unbreakable code the Allies had was the Navajo language.  towards the end of the war, encrypted messages were handled by Navajo codetalkers, using a modified version of the Navajo language.  Neither Germany nor Japan ever really managed to get hold of a codetalker in useful condition, since orders were to shoot the codetalker dead if there was any chance of his being captured (more than one codetalker shot HIMSELF, no less.  the Navajo in the US Armed Forces were pretty hardcore, even if they weren't always what most people would consider a badass soldier).</p>
<p>There were other codes, of course, and the Axis went through the work of breaking them, but breaking those weren't as epic-seeming as enigma and the codetalkers.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>People underestimate how hard it is to crack a code like this. It's not <em>difficult</em> to translate a language without a reference point, it's <em>impossible</em>. Not a &quot;soft&quot; impossible either, that if you throw enough money and manpower at it, you'll get there eventually. It's actually, literally impossible to translate a language without either bilingual texts, knowledge of a related language, or an actual speaker in front of you.</p>
<p>Even once you get most of the language tacked down, there's plenty of failures. Any content word that's not either derived from something else you already know or listed in your source is, at best, an educated guess, and often completely unrecoverable. This even happens in well-attested, well-known languages - that &quot;give us this day our <strong>daily</strong> bread&quot; in the Lord's Prayer? Yea, it exists nowhere else in the entirety of the Greek language, so we don't know what that word (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiousios" target="_blank">epiousios</a>) actually means. Even words that <em>are</em> derivable can be suspect; as an example, you can't derive the word &quot;outhouse&quot; from &quot;out+house,&quot; it's undergone too much semantic drift. If you came across that word in this barely-known language &quot;English&quot; in the context of &quot;you're like an outhouse,&quot; you could <em>easily</em> misinterpret it as &quot;you're not quite good enough to be the main thing&quot; or &quot;you're a good person to go to to relax away from the bustle,&quot; completely missing what it really means.</p>
<p>It's also possible or even likely that you don't get the language rules themselves with any surety, either. There's a widespread idea that languages are fundamentally ciphers of each other, but that's <em>not true</em>. They can vary wildly in what they do and how they do it. Sumerian has a whole set of prefixes that every indicative, main-clause verb must have, but we're still not certain what they actually <em>do</em>. We know parts, like that one of the prefixes shows up in phrases without an agent (similar to passive voice), and another always shows up when the target/goal is in 1st person (she gave it <em>to me</em>), but otherwise their interpretation doesn't have a solid consensus. And in the context of the Navajo codetalkers, Navajo may not be the <em>most</em> alien language from a European perspective, but it's certainly up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example Germans did break UK codes during battle for atlantic at least once.</p>
<p>Buuuut...</p>
<p>Losses inflicted pale in comparision to loses Germans inflicted on utterly and stubbornly unprepared USA convoys for about a year after USA joined the war. That's in contrast to very technical top stupidity of Germans during that battle. So that could explain some of it. Of course there is no denial that nobody but Nazist want to prise Nazism, thus &quot;accomplishments&quot; of Nazi germany are rarely depicted as heroic struggle, the way allies stories can be without much controversy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two people have talked about the Navajo code talkers: Few people in the US knew much about the Navajo language, let along anyone outside the US, so they basically had a complete new language to use as a code.</p>
<p>However, the Ultra program also reverse-engineered an Enigma+; which critically fixed a flaw in the Enigma cypher that no letter could be coded as itself. The Germans where aware of it, and were eventually able to determine that it was better than their own - but couldn't break it. One of the huge advantages that Great Britain had over Germany was more electric computers; allowing them to brute-force codes much faster. Both sides had human computers (people whose job it was to compute - try codes, do math, etc.), but having electric computers gave the allies a measurable advantage.</p></div>		</li>
