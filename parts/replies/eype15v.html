			<div class="markdown"><p>Resistance training or weight bearing activities actually increase bone strength. On top of this, by increasing muscle mass (for the right muscles), you’ll also decrease the risk of falls. Of all adults over the age of 65 in the USA, about 30% fall within a given year. That is an insane amount. Of all those that fall within a given year,  many go on to die within a year of their fall as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 100% sure. I can go back and look at my notes to check. But I know this is correlated to the USA because it’s a statistic that Medicare uses to validate strength and proprioceptive training.  I’m a physical therapy student approaching graduation , so a lot of my time has been spent in the clinic and it’s a reason Medicare reimburses well for PT.</p></div>		</li>
