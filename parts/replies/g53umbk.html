			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this cancelation pretty much remove/flattens the sound wave or does the ear hear both, In a way?  The fact that there is a sound and an opposite sound doesn't actually tell me it does not stimulate to the ear (or does so minimally), only that it may be different. In other words, would it be safe to be wearing noise canceling headphones <em>all day</em> with no music? On its own,, not by comparison of drowning outside noise with music volume. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does remove the sound</p>
<p>Sound is pressure, alternating above ambient (positive) and below ambient (negative).  When you play the opposite waves, the positive cancels with the negative and results in zero.  </p>
<p>So it does remove or &quot;flatten&quot; the wave.</p></div>		</li>
