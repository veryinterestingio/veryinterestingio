<p>each year, the baseline salinity rises.</p>

<p>That's the real kicker. </p>
<p>A temporary transient issue is one thing, but a long term trend is another animal entirely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean at it's core, it's a basic stock and flow issue. The flow in is greater than the flow out, and it's only a matter of time before there's a substantial enough change in the stock to push things over the edge. Assuming that there's not a latent salinity capacity that can out breed the changes in concentration. Actually that makes me wonder if we could end up with one of those fast-paced selection examples like the peppered moth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if, over enough time, some species evolve to be more tolerant, since the ones that can handle small increases in salinity are left alive. May not be a long enough timespan for any large increases in evolutionary traits, but maybe a bit in perfect environments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With enough time, other species that are already more salt resistant will move in but it's happening too quickly for the species that are there already to evolve. A small portion of those there may be able to adapt to the increase but not a yearly increase. </p></div>		</li>
