<p>I'm not currently working on another book. It turns out that DESTROYING THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE is a very hard act to follow, and also I have a bunch of research I should catch up on that I have neglected a bit recently. I have some vague thoughts about future book topics, but I haven't settled on anything yet.</p>
<p>As for my research -- I'm thinking about several things lately. Mostly: dark matter's possible particle physics interactions (i.e., stuff it might do other than sit there and gravitate) and how it may have impacted the first stars and galaxies in the universe; other kinds of dark matter beyond the usual suspects; and a few things connected to vacuum decay and how we might learn about it through cosmological observations. All fun stuff. :)</p></div>		</li>
