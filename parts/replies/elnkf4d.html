<p>No amount of wanting something to be done seems to overcome the lack of wanting to do it for ADHD.</p>

<p>It's not so much a &quot;lack of wanting&quot; you're trying to overcome, it's more like a mental block. You know you need to make that phone call, you have the phone in front of you, it's really no effort at all, you end up cleaning the kitchen, doing the laundry, painting the fence and not making that phone call. Despite desperately wanting to make that phone call. It's really quite frustrating.</p>
<p>A lazy person does not seem to be frustrated by being lazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never been diagnosed and have been working up the courage to go see a doctor about it. I never cashed a check for like $250 because I just never got myself to open my bank app and deposit the check with mobile deposit. It takes all of one minute but I let the check sit there for 6 months. The mental bar I need to clear to start a task, any task, seems like I'm climbing Everest to get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in the same boat for the longest time. Unfortunately, this meant I took forever to finally get my ass to a psychiatrist. I know it's hard but take a step towards that today. Find someone in your area or what your options may be. It has honestly changed my life. Just wish I had done something about it sooner. Good luck to you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man I do stuff like this CONSTANTLY. I put everything off, even small  tasks that “are no big deal” even though I know I need to do them and they’re easy.    Make a phone call? Gonna put that off.  Text someone back? Gonna put that off.  Run an errand? Gonna put that off.  I don’t even fill the time with anything important...I just don’t do what I know I’m supposed to be doing.  It’s so embarrassing because these things always come back to bite me and are a much larger ordeal because I avoided it for so long... and once it’s finally resolved I feel like an invisible weight is lifted off of my shoulders! But I could’ve done it myself AGES ago and not have had the trouble.</p>
<p>This has been everything in my life from homework in school to almost every other thing in life that doesn’t <em>require</em> immediate action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, I am in grad school and I always get jokes about how I am taking the easy way out by getting meds. But I got to a doctor to get diagnosed because I was living at the school trying to start my work form 8 am to 8pm everyday. The pills dont do the work, I do the pills help me do it. I cried the first couple days after I got my pills because life just became easier and I had struggled so much before then. I dont think people with adhd are lazy nor do they feel like they are lazy they just keep trying and trying and cant seem to live up to the expectations of others.</p></div>		</li>
