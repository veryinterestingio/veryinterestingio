			<div class="markdown"><p>The risk should be typically lower outside since there is breeze that tends to mix the exhaled puff quickly. If a sick person sneezes outdoors, the puff of air moves forward and beings to spread with the droplet nuclei suspended in it. It beings to dilute fast due to mixing. So now it is the question of chance - what is the probability of another person happen to walk right into this? Generally slim. As a general rule keep some distance away - I do this when I jog outdoors - keep a distance from other joggers and walkers.</p></div>		</li>
