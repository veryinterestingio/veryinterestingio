			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone reading this: Get a radon detector. It'll tell you the level. </p>
<p>I got one. They work! Radon levels were hitting 4 - 6 on average. I got a fan installed just because I like to play it safe. That worked too! Levels went down to 0.6 - 1 on average. </p>
<p>Wanted to share just in case anyone thinks a fan is a scam, like my father-in-law. Hurray for detectors and, you know, fucking science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just playing it safe.  In my area anything over 4 is a no-no for real estate sales.  My first house hit 4.3 when I had it inspected so the sellers credited me the cost to install a dispersion system.</p>
<p>it's just good to do so you won't have to deal with it when you want to sell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Ireland now living in Canada. This is the first time ive heard of Radon. Is it just some naturally accurring thing in the earth? Is it everywhere? How have I not heard of this!?</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> you've all blown my mind with radon. I'll be looking up radon levels in BC and see whats what. The tldr I believe is: Yes its real and a potential hazard but very unlikely and under certain circumstances. Thanks all! except that one person..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, I can understand (but not condone) some people being skeptical of complex things like climate science or evolution.</p>
<p>But you can literally <em>see</em> a fan working. Like ????</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher amounts require sealing your foundation and venting out from under the basement slab before it can get into the basement itself.  Easier to do in a modern foundation, where a stone layer exists under the concrete slab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How modern.  Our house is 27 years old, and only has,sand under,the slab.</p>
<p>Cuz it doesn't take any load.</p>
<p>The foundation footings were 4 inches of sand over a 12 inch bed of crushed stone.  But not the slabs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We installed a 'pump' with an external exhaust when we bought property here in NC (previous owners didn't have one which the inspector said was a bad move since the area is known for Radon).  It has a detector as part of it but the installer said once you have the pump, you are good to go on the 'fear front'.</p>
<p>Not something I had to worry about in Ca. or in the UK so the whole experience was an education.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve watched this happen on my radon detector! Was really interesting to see the effect. Now whenever I see that type of weather pattern I crack a couple of windows in the basement to get a cross flow and everything stays good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a home inspector: To add to this, radium and other radioactive elements are found almost everywhere (building products, household cleaners, natural gas)... in trace amounts, but large beds of granite are typically the culprit for measurable amounts of radon gas accumulating in a home. Georgia (where I live) has huge granite fingers that run into adjacent states and there are many areas near me that regularly have elevated radon levels, so that may not be true all over but as far as I know that's the most common source.</p></div>		</li>
