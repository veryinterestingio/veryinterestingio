			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll just add on a bit of common sense for the &quot;why&quot;</p>
<p>Ganglia and neurons are immunoprivlidged sites. Any infection (including varicella) that has the ability to settle into nervous tissues also has the capacity to evade the immune system, a feature that enables the primary -&gt; latent -&gt;  reactivation phenomenon caused by the same virus. The immune system can keep the local infection from spreading (until the immune system takes a weekend or is weakened which is usually when shingles arises), but it can't be completely eradicated due to the protection of the nerve cells. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can also have this pattern of active -&gt; latent -&gt; reactivated, but for a different &quot;why.&quot; It hide inside macrophages and  suppress the local immune response (presumably via cord factor).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably because you don't want phages to kill your nerve cells if they get infected.</p>
<p>Edit: I used the word &quot;phage&quot; incorrectly. I don't know the right word, but I mean one of those cells that goes around your body and kills / consumes infected cells.</p>
<p>You don't want that happening to your neurons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The virus probably doesn't &quot;wait.&quot; More likely, it's always &quot;trying&quot; to replicate, and until the immune system weakens, it fails to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that may be more accurate in some cases but latency is programmed by virus dna as an innate life cycle characteristic for some viruses. There’s a long history of evidence of that.</p></div>		</li>
