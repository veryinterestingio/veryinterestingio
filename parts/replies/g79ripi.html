			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happened to me with crab legs. It's the only allergy I've ever had and it developed when I was 21. It was the only thing I ate that night, I had a horrible reaction, and I haven't touched one since. I'll probably try it again at some point to see if I'm still allergic or if it was a one-off, but I'm less willing to test it because the exact same thing happened to my brother who also had no known allergies before (and after) this.</p></div>		</li>
