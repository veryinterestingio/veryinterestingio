<p>in the brake caliper piston boils, and your brake pedal goes straight to the floor</p>

<p>The going to the floor only happens after you release the brake at least once after the boiling temperature has been reached. As long as you keep pressure on the brake that pressure will prevent the liquid from forming any compressible gasses. So is not like you press the brake and after a second or two while still pressing down it suddenly falls to the floor.</p></div>		</li>
