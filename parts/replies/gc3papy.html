			<div class="markdown"><p>Key point: saline solution is <em>specifically formulated</em> to have approximately the same concentration of salt as your blood. And also is usually sterile / has no other contaminants.</p>
<p>If you can find a natural body of water with the same salt concentration and relatively clean, which the ocean is definitely not ... ::shrug::</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>anectdotal - all our lives, having cuts in saltwater ALWAYS heals them faster.  Any skin irritation seems to be helped by salt water.  We have a salt water pool - anyone with skin cuts, irritants gets a soak (like i was having hives, helped tremendously) (not poison ivy! that gets a salt soak in a container)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also anecdotal, but a cool ocean dip on some longboard-induced road rash was wonderful. Also seemed to kick start the healing.</p></div>		</li>
