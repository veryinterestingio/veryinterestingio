			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Lost 2 of my friends to this :( both were very strong swimmers, in the primes of their lives. One went for a swim in a lake on hot day without realising it was actually insanely deep and had very cold patches of water in it; the other dived in to cold water in winter to try to save his friend.</p>
<p>Edit to clarify because a few people have asked: these are 2 separate incidents, and in the second case both my friend and the person he was trying to save died. Also in the first incident I believe it was a quarry lake, but wasn't labelled as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your friend may have done this, but I want the information out there for people who are unaware. Jumping in to save someone is always the LAST resort when trying to rescue someone who is drowning. Reach, throw, then go. If they are close enough, try to reach out to them with your hand or a branch or whatever you have from the shore. Maintain 3 points of contact with the shore. Then if you cannot reach you throw them a rope or life preserver or a floatation device of some kind. Again, this may not work due to distance or the victim may be unconscious. Only then should you go in after them. This can be extremely dangerous to the rescuer and you may want to wait until they are unconscious. The instinctive drowning response causes a victim to reach for anything to try and pull themselves up which can push you under yourself and cause you to drown with them. It's dangerous to go in after someone and it's why lifeguards have that floatation device to push to the victim to give them something to latch on to.</p>
<p>This is not to discourage people from trying to help, but if I can help prevent more cases of two or more people drowning due to rescue attempts then I will be content with that. Stay safe out there people, I love the water, but you have to respect it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In New Jersey one summer while I was in the ocean a man and 2 young girls got caught in a rip current.  I got to the one girl and passed her off to a life guard when they reached us. The lifeguard put the one girl on his red floatie and grabbed the other.  We were all still in tje rip current.  I then see the other lifeguard approaching the man and the amount of panic I saw on the man's face was nothing I've seen before.  His eyes didnt even feel human to look at, he was in 100% panic/survivor mode.  He kept just pushing the lifeguard down and just trying to use him to stay a float.  The lifeguard cold cocked him right in the face and I grabbed the floatie and pushed it into his chest.  It was the craziest shit I've seen. This dude couldn't even use words and the face of terror just looked like an animal, it felt so not human.  Everyone survived tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this. My sister almost drowned in a lake trying to save her friend who couldn’t swim. She kept getting pulled under by the friend. I was of course glad they were both safe, but I was pretty upset with my sister (I guess more terrified than anything!) for putting herself in so much danger!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of related, but on the theme of water, NEVER, EVER, EVER STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THE OCEAN WHEN YOU'RE NEAR IT. I come from the Oregon coast, and recently we had another tragedy involving a man and his children being caught by a sneaker wave. Sneaker waves are massive surges of water that are almost silent and come out of nowhere. The only way to predict them is to actively pay attention to what the water is doing. For example, <a href="https://youtu.be/RPypT9dOvSY" target="_blank">this sneaker wave</a> occurred in Coos Bay, and very easily could have turned this video into a snapshot of a tragedy. Imagine seeing it too late. You will never be able to outrun them, and they'll suck you right back out to sea. Keep pets on leashes unless they're very well trained, and always keep your children close. Keep your eyes on or near the water at all times, and if you see the water become unusually still or pull back a long way, GET TO HIGH GROUND. The Oregon coast is achingly beautiful, and I'd never want to live anywhere else, but you have to respect the ocean and understand that it's not gentle like those nice blue oceans you see in ads for trips to Hawaii.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I almost died from this myself. Was going to cross a small river during early summer, like 20 meters across, went in and it was ice cold, immediately started to hyperventilate and had insane problems swimming. I wasn't more than two meters from the shore but could barely get back cause my entire body felt like it was burning or something and somehow it was as if I didn't know how to swim.</p>
<p>I just got lucky and while swinging my arms I reached some vine or some vegetation which I could drag on and could keep me floating. And after about half a minute or so (at least felt like half a minute) my breathing went back to normal and I realized I could cross the river without any issue.</p>
<p>Been training on that ever since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I saved someone once in this exact scenario and at first when reading your comment was thinking holy shit, is this that same guy??</p>
<p>We were going to a jumping rock on the consumnes river early in the year, maybe even march. River was high, all snow melt,  absolutely freezing. Friend brought his dorm mate home for the weekend from LA, and I should have read the flags sooner...were walking along a river and this kid legitimately is saying things like, &quot;wow, I've never been to a lake before!!&quot;</p>
<p>I gave him a quick run down, this shit has a strong current, walk up stream and swim WITH the current at an angle to the other shore, if you freak out, GET ON YOUR BACK AND BREATHE tc etc</p>
<p>Me and my friend jet across and he was trying to acclimate to the water before going which wasn't going to work, it's like 55° water. Finally he starts trying to swim but didn't go up stream like I said and the mf starts swimming STRAIGHT UP STREAM like a fucking infinity pool. Shit goes awry, he goes under ones and pops and seemingly joking says &quot;I'm drowning&quot;. My buddy who brought him legitimately starts cracking up thinking it's a hilarious joke so I'm like what the fuck, is this real? Chuckle myself at this jokester too, right.</p>
<p>Kid goes under once again and pops up and blood curdling scream this time &quot;I'M DROWNING&quot; and I just immediately jump in after him. When I get to him he's just fucking thrashing and shit, kicking punching splashing and latches on to me and we both go under in the scariest moment of my life. I somehow manage to wrap his arms up and roll over on to my back and am kicking with every bit of life I have after being zapped by the cold and fighting this guy into submission. I'm drained and legitimately in fear of my life, no energy, no oxygen, still 6 plus feet from the shore and start sinking when my feet touch the ground. One last push and were safe. Drag his ass out and just collapse. Safe.</p>
<p>After we catch our breath he stands up and faces me with tears in his eyes, shakes my hand, and says, &quot;you just saved my life&quot;.</p>
<p>Fuck what a memory.</p>
<p>Sorry for the novel too. I don't remember this story often and rarely tell it and I just had to get it out again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The video is old, but this guy gives the gold standard of advice. I highly recommend watching it all the way through. It's 10 minutes and in the second half he talks about what to do if you simply can't get out. He actually &quot;falls&quot; in to show you. Crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a year or so I was taking cold showers every morning and I would try to go into the water slowly and focus on not allowing that reaction to kick in. I usually felt calm after the shower. Now because I don't do it often when I try I can't control that reaction and I always gasp for air.</p></div>		</li>
