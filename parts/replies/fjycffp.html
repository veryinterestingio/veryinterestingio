			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious if you might be able to explain. Have you ever heard the general term &quot;LA is due for a large quake and will one day break off&quot;? Is this actually a thing considering it's just two plates rubbing together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the original person you asked, but I can answer! The idea that LA will &quot;break off&quot; is largely an exaggeration. While Southern CA is due for a large San Andreas earthquake, it wouldn't break off into the ocean from one. The Pacific plate that everything west of the San Andreas (including LA) is on moves about 46 mm to the north every year compared to the rest of North America, so while in millions of years LA will technically be much farther north, it won't fall into the ocean from one earthquake. As far as the whole &quot;due&quot; thing goes, geologic evidence can be used to determine when past ruptures have occurred on faults. This isn't perfectly rhythmic by any means, but we can calculate an average interval between events, and for Southern CA this interval has been reached and surpassed. So a large earthquake could happen tomorrow, or it could still be another 50 years - no one knows. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2017/02/06/california-will-break-away-us/#4a8a1c5d69cb" target="_blank">This article</a> might be of interest to you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool! Thank you for taking time to answer this =)</p>
<p>No clue why I've always believed this since I was a child - haven't really thought about it until now lol.</p>
<p>Are they expecting like a flood/tsunami caused by this major quake then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It won't break off.</p>
<p>But one day the forces acting on the san Andreas fault will get to large for whatever is holding the plates together right now.</p>
<p>And that thing is going to be massive.</p></div>		</li>
