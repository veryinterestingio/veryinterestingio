			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaccination is great but still not total protection. People can still be infected although it is much less likely. When you have a high percentage of the population vaccinated, such as in Israel, we can restart many parts of our lives. Especially when more than 90% of high-risk individuals are vaccinated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What level of risk would be acceptable for full resumption of normal activities?</p>
<p>The recent data out of Oregon shows &quot;<strong>Of more than 700,000 fully vaccinated Oregonians, 168 tested positive for COVID and 3 died.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Given that this mortality rate is substantially less then that of driving (both in US 6/100k and Israel), what is the argument that the vaccinated should be more cautious about normal activities then they would about driving?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea how Oregon population is distributed. But would this statistic stand if the measurements would be made for 700,000 from a dense urban area?</p></div>		</li>
