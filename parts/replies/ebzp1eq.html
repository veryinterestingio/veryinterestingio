			<div class="markdown"><p>Fireproof houses (we're talking money no object here) domes that cover houses in the event of fire with massive desalination plants on the coast and infrastructure to pump massive volumes of water to communities to help them stay fire free while the fire burns around them. Not at all viable or practical but there you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there's just a way it could safeguard a bit.  for example, having a ton of money set aside for natural disasters (and a ton of trained emergency response workers ready to go, and a ton of resources for them to fight fire/flood/etc) would certainly help here.  </p>
<p>History has told us that anything we do to try to &quot;fix&quot; nature is as likely to bite us in the ass.  Clear trees for fire prevention and you risk flood and landslides and all number of other things.  </p>
<p>Imagine this as a number of sliders.  You can lower one, but when you do others rise.  And you can't predict the future, so you don't know if this year is going to be a fire year or a floor year or an earthquake year or what.  So any shifting of those levels you do is just as likely to be shifting in the wrong direction. </p></div>		</li>
