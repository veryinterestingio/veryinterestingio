<p>It is thought that by racing counter-clockwise, charioteers would want to keep their dominant sword hand to the outside in case the weapon was needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that was why we drive on the right/left side. Im guessing its the left side which is why the newest countries do the right side. The english used to care about horseback fighting so they drive on the left to keep their sword arm ready. But north america was built for the car so fuck your left side driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar reason to why in the US we drive on the right.  Back in the day when we used whips on the carts, we wanted to avoid hitting people coming up the opposite direction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly most horses are also &quot;left handed&quot; and thus run more smoothly in counter-clockwise circles than clockwise. This is because the left legs lead while cantering in that direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like there has to be some kind of psychological or physical reason for us to naturally do this. </p>
<p>I have a 500m track a few blocks away. There isn't any specific start or finish line, nothing to indicate direction, and has access from every angle... yet people always seem to walk/run/jog counterclockwise... every single time. </p>
<p>My buddy and I spent a good 20 minutes pondering why that is and we just assumed it has something to do with the earths rotation and shit lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like you only really ever see people going counter clockwise but might not conciously remember that, so you just do what feels more familiar. </p>
<p>You'd have to take kids to test this who've not been exposed to racetracks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to ice skating, turning left is much easier than turning right (for right-handed people). Seems to be that our left leg is our &quot;balance&quot; leg (in soccer, kick with right leg, balance with left leg) and that makes turning left easier...somehow...</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm way better at turning left than right when iceskating. But I always assumed this was because people always go counter-clockwise in all ice skating rinks I've ever been to, so I've really only worked on turning left.</p>
<p>I've been trying to force myself to do more right turns when there aren't so many people around, but I'm terrible at it. I'm so wobbly and un-sure-footed when gliding on my right blade and trying to cross-over my left skate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely aside, but I used to frequent a roller skating rink on a Sunday. You always went anti-clockwise. Occasionally they would make it go clockwise for 15 minutes for fun and it was so much harder. It was really bizarre. It feels so mich easier crossing my dominant leg over my non-dominant rather than the other way around when being sporty.</p></div>		</li>
