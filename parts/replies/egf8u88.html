			<div class="markdown"><p>Popping in to give another &quot;same&quot;; I grew up in Florida and every bus I used had seat belts. When we were in elementary school, we'd scramble to put our seat belts on when the bus driver pulled over, because we were supposed to wear them but never did. </p>
<p>Sometimes they'd have gum on them, or they'd be shoved down under the seat. I'm surprised (but not really) that some school buses don't have seat belts for the kids, even if no one I knew ever wore them. </p></div>		</li>
