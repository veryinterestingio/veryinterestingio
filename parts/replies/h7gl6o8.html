<p>To be fair, how many automatic transmission cars are driving around with an inoperable shifter brake interlock?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely more than you'd expect. Similarly, and even more concerning to me, there are vehicles with exhaust leaks or even fuel tank/filter/ line leaks rolling around. I don't like it, but a lot of counties in the US at least don't have emissions/inspections standards and a lot of un-roadworthy vehicles do roll around. Hot gasses and maybe even burning fuel can be ejected through the leak, and there's an outside chance that they can ignite. You're right, it's rare, but extrapolate that by x number of vehicles and y probability and it's a no-brainer for gas stations and even legislative motion to just tell everyone to turn their cars off when refuelling.</p></div>		</li>
