			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah targeting the core does help you define what is fat and what is muscle. It's not a great weight-loss plan by itself but there is a huge mental boost when you can start to feel some abdominal muscles under the fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can feel ab muscles under my fat but the fat is definitely still there. Building muscle everywhere is way more effective because then fat gets distributed over a bigger area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building muscle mass doesn't just help spread things out, muscles are hungry boys and will up your resting metabolic rate which means you could start losing fat just by having the muscle and maintaining the same diet since suddenly you're in a caloric deficit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I simultaneously feel better knowing I don't have to do crunches and planks to lose belly fat and also worse realizing this belly fat will probably be the last thing to go in the losing process. Ugh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, having big abdominal muscles under the fat makes it look like the belly is even bigger. I would just do overall body exercise instead of targetting abdominals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is entirely genetic. Hormones have little to nothing to do with it. Your genetic bone structure that you inherited as well as where you store fat is genetic. Ever seen a lot of the people on my 600lb life? Some people you can still make out their jaw line at such an enormous body weight, while others you can’t even see it because they have so much fat stored in it. 100% genetics. Weight loss is simply calories in calories out. Eat less move more, that doesn’t mean to starve yourself because a lot of idiots take it to that extreme. Just gradually eat a little less as the weeks go on, increase your physical activity, and in time you’ll notice your body shedding water weight and getting leaner in the face.</p></div>		</li>
