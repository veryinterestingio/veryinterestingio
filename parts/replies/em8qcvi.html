			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same thought initially, but it's not that light is traveling &quot;slowly&quot; through the medium, it's that it is blocked from ever completely traversing the medium. </p>
<p>So if the question was &quot;Is there any medium through which sound travels through which light^* cannot travel?&quot; Then &quot;any opaque solid&quot; would be a valid answer. But if it's about the speed with which the two &quot;travel through&quot; the medium (implying reaching the other side), then I don't think the opaque solid answer works.</p>
<p>^* - For the purposes of this question, I'm assuming &quot;light&quot; means 'visible spectrum', not other electromagnetic radiation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just assumed &quot;light&quot; meant any electromagnetic radiation.  So, your point kind of falls apart in that regard as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the question was about light why would we assume <em>any electromagnetic radiation</em> was intended?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that's what light is...?  You don't see through walls because it blocks the visible spectrum.  You can have other EM radiation travel through the walls just fine.  It's all the same thing, just different wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All light is the same even if it's not in the visible spectrum. It's made up of the same particles doing the same motion and moving at the same speed. The only difference is how fast the particles are moving up and down. Saying electromagnetic radiation isn't light because you can't see it is like saying sound stops being sound if it's too high pitched for you to hear.</p></div>		</li>
