			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s getting better tho: One reason why CBTC was so expensive is, that current installations require a 30km+ Glass Fibre to every WiFi Access Points which takes a Team of 15 People 2 Weeks+ just to splice. It’s the Labour cost, not really the cost of hardware. Newer Versions can finally do “Meshing”, which means Signals can “Hop” from AP to AP until they reach one with a fiber uplink. In China they just use Private LTE Networks, because they reserved Frequencies for such purposes.</p></div>		</li>
