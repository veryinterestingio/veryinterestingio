			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the thorough response. One question, if I shake a can but then let it sit before opening it that is usually a safe bet. Is that because the gasses get absorbed back into the liquid similar to the initial carbonation process?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a lot to do with the nucleation sites as per twink above. The little bubbles that you shake into the drink ride back to the top so there are fewer of them in the bulk of the liquid and so there are fewer nucleation sites. This makes it harder for the co2 to escape. </p>
<p>Also, since they rise, there are more at the top where the gas can escape with out pushing the liquid out first as it would have to if they were at the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nucliation sites get stuck to the can. But yes if you wait they will go to the top. But if you tap the sides you can make the bubbles lose grip of the sides of the can that makes the can safe to open. You can try this with a clear bottle with something like 7up where you will be able to see the bubbles sticking to the sides of the bottle, when you shake it. As long  as you tap the sides of the bottle untill there are no bubbles left it should be okay to open</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way, an even faster method to open it safely is lean it to the side while itâ€™s slightly open. You might have to open and close it quickly a couple times but it takes much less time than just letting it sit</p></div>		</li>
