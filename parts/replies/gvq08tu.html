			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for you if it's allowed. </p>
<p>I was leaning on my left elbow a lot at work while using a computer. Bad on me, I know.<br />
For 4-5 weeks now, I get numbness and tingling in my left arm. And pain around my C5. Made much worse if I tilt my head back and look up.<br />
Anti-inflammatories  remove the numbness and tingling for about 6 hours. My doctor said that this should go away on it's own over time but it's been 4-5 weeks.<br />
Is there anything that I can do to speed up/help recovery?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be rude but don’t listen to the treatments that the other user told you to do. Never take medical advice from someone over the internet. And whatever I’m about to ask you isn’t intended as medics advice and you should go see a trained professional in person. Everyone’s problem is different and require different interventions depending on history and presentation.</p>
<p>With that being said when you say tilting your head up/back makes it worse, where does it feel worse, the neck or in the arm?</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I tilt my head back there is immediate pain just to the left of my spine that radiates into the muscle. I will also get pain in the side of my left upper arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do the same thing. In fact, in my 20s, I did it so bad, that I ended up in the ER, and the doc there popped a vertebra in my mid-back, which helped. He explained that I had aggravated a muscle in my back which in turn became inflamed and swollen and clamped down on the nerve running into my arm. Last month, I started seeing a chiropractor. Best thing I've ever done. Some advice he gave me:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>first, stop leaning on your elbow. Sit back in your chair.</li>
<li>second, sitting at a desk makes us round our shoulders forward. Every hour or so, spend a minute pulling your shoulders back by squeezing your shoulder blades together. </li>
<li>third, treat with cold only, no heat. Ibuprofen is good, but you have to start at 600 mg to get the anti-inflammatory effect</li>
<li>fourth, on the affected side, pull your shoulder all the way back and then turn your chin to the other shoulder. You may need to use your other hand to pull your chin around. This stretches a muscle that connects your neck, shoulder, and the underside of your shoulder blade. You can start feeling around in that triangle above your collarbone, up against your neck, and you will find that particular muscle, and you can apply pressure and cold there. </li>
<li>fifth, get your self a sock and a tennis ball. Put the tennis ball in the sock, and throw it over your bad shoulder, and lean against the wall with the tennis ball between your shoulder blade and the wall. Move it around until you find one of the trigger points. You'll know you've got it, because it hurts. Put your weight on that against the tennis ball and keep it up for a couple of minutes. Keep moving the tennis ball around until you find and pressure all the trigger points there.</li>
<li>finally, go to a chiropractor. Most insurance plans now cover them, though you can expect a copay. I've been three times, and a problem I've had with my lower back for more than twenty years is almost gone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or ignore this part and see a physio-therapist.</p>
<p>90% of chiros are quacks that still believe &quot;fixing the spine&quot; cures disease.</p>
<p>If you can find a chiro-physiotherapist sure. Otherwise all that most of them do is pop some joints. </p>
<p>You may be one of the lucky people to find a competent one, but they are so few and far in-between as to be useless for many people.</p></div>		</li>
