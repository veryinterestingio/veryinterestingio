			<div class="markdown"><p>While the outcome of the two conditions are the same (angina, ischemia and possible infarction), there are some slight differences: </p>
<ol>
<li>Takatsubo’s is caused by a stressful situation; however there may not be an evident trigger (perhaps a sudden intense sadness that isn’t immediately evident to a doctor). However, there is always a cause for ACS; it can be inflammation or even stress (same as Takatsubo’s)</li>
<li>There are some differences in the ECG readings from these two conditions</li>
<li>The left ventricle wall will look different when the heart is viewed ultrasonically</li>
<li>The coronary arteries in ACS will be damaged in some way whereas in Takatsubo’s, the coronary arteries are normal.</li>
</ol>
<p>I only brought up Takatsubo’s because the OP specifically mentioned sadness in his question. Also, Takatsubo’s tends to affect females more than males and the elderly more than the young.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline and noradrenaline are short-lasting hormones. They degrade very quickly. It is only when the body is constantly producing this hormone that things become dangerous. And this happens when the body is under chronic stress. In the modern lifestyle, this is increasingly becoming a problem so yes, a stressful lifestyle is not a good thing for heart health.</p></div>		</li>
