			<div class="markdown"><p>Haggis isn't really any different to many types of sausage in terms of the meat it contains. The amount of people who will turn their nose up at it for it being too icky, yet happily chow down on a hotdog is astounding. I once shared a deep fried haggis with one such person under the pretense of it being a &quot;special spiced sausage&quot;, she ended up finishing mine.</p></div>		</li>
