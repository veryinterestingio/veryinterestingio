			<div class="markdown"><p>Picked fresh, cubed, and then chilled on ice for about two hours, not enough to freeze it just to make it cold and firm. Put the chilled chunks in a cup with a dash of lime juice and chili salt, give it a few good shakes. Serve with a toothpick or fork. Holy fucking shit it's so good. Ambrosia. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fresh ripe pineapple is just amazing, most supermarket stuff is picked WELL before it's ripe so it won't go bad before you buy it, but it's nothing like the fully ripe stuff...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to Mexico when I was a teenager (15+ years ago) and I was on a bus that pulled over on the side of the road and bought bananas from a farm stand.</p>
<p>Legitimately the best banana I have ever had in my entire life. I still think about it 15 years later. It was the perfect ripeness and so flavorful.</p></div>		</li>
