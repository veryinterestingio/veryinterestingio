			<div class="markdown"><p>I already did. My sugar is fine. School causes my cholesterol to climb, but it goes back down the minute I am out of school (law school)</p>
<p>Also, I try to drink 1L a day at  a minimum. If I have caffeine, I'll ad an extra 1L for every cup. (2 cups is my usual max--not everyday.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My job is super stressful and my cortisol levels can get up there because of it. I recently started doing wellness related activities, taking a test booster and cortisol blocked and my hormones are much more in check. I feel way better in a relatively short amount of time. Good luck with school, I hope you do well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I was just thinking about people with diabetes and/or insulin resistance being thirsty and not being satiated with water being a symptom of that.</p>
<p>I am not a medical professional, I just work in health insurance and I work alongside nurses and doctors every day discussing high cost patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of climate do you live in?  Low humidity?  I find that in very dry climates I need to drink almost double what I would living on the coast just due to the lack of humidity and extra water my body seems to need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I couldn't tell you lol. The weather in Texas is up and down. There isn't much consistency. A lot of people joke that Texas weather is bipolar, but I dislike that reference cause I don't want to make fun of anyone who is struggling with mental-illness.</p></div>		</li>
