			<div class="markdown"><p>CMOS transistors are faster at low temperature and you can clock them higher. It is not that relevant for the normal operating temperature range of  CPU in a computer with regular cooling but it will have have a noticeable effect if you cool it down with liquid nitrogen-</p>
<p>Bipolar transistor are the opposite and is faster the warmer they are.</p>
<p>It is easy to show that it is the case if you make a RC oscillation and heat up the transistor or dip it in liquid nitrogen, I have done it as a part of a university course and when CMOS speed up Bipolar slow down and vise versa.. The faster transistor is a large part why using liquid nitrogen make it possible to overclock it and not just that you can transport heat away efficiently.</p>
<p>The temperature depended is more relevant in thing like RC oscillators, quartz crystal  or any other stuff that need exact frequency. There is a reson that you need to compensate for temperature in different ways and that some high quality oscillators have a oven-controlled crystal oscillator where you heat it to a fixed temperature to create a stable frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, this is coming from audio engineering (and congruently air traffic control) where we are looking for not an increased frequency but an exact frequency and the amount of jitter (variations in sync between oscillations) causes havoc.</p>
<p>Oven controlled oscillators are expensive but provide some of the most precise clocking we have available.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But making the clock go faster means pushing more electricity through the chip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is that? If '1' means electricity flows, but '0' not, then the same amount of electricity flow on average would be regardless of how fast ones and zeros change, wouldn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually modern cmos transistors only consume power when their states change in an ideal world.  In the real world we have leakage.  And the clock is a signal that is always changing aka consuming power.</p></div>		</li>
