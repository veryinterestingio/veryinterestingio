<p>You either code in English (seriously everyone in programming requires to know English anyway) or with subroutine/variable/comments in your own language, but usually keeping get/set for object getter/setter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a ton of words that had to be invented for programming, and they have all been invented in English. Most other languages have none of these words, or maybe just a few. </p>
<p>I know foreign language programmers who get irrationally upset when someone codes in their mother tongue, instead of English. Even they feel like all code should be written in English. Imagine trying to write concise variable names while also trying to avoid words like class, float, singleton. Evidently it's upsetting to come across things like &quot;Truthyfalsy&quot; for booleans. It always sounded hilarious to me though, having all your comments sound like they were written by a 5yo.</p></div>		</li>
