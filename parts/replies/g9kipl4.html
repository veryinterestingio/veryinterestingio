			<div class="markdown"><p>When the economy tanked, our county road Dept. contracted a company to repave the interstate. The company had a list of different types of asphalt, the county picked a cheap one. The company said that was only recommended for the warmer climate down south without the constant freeze cycles that cause potholes. The county insisted to use it and wouldn't you know it, within a few months for 20 miles the interstate was a minefield of expanding potholes. It was comical in a sad way watching swerving brake lights as people tried to not dent their rims or bottom out in smaller cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an example of a newer type of asphalt that is very common in my country on basically all highways: <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnl.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FZeer_Open_Asfalt" target="_blank">https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnl.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FZeer_Open_Asfalt</a></p>
<p>Can't even find an english wikipage for it, the english wikipage that is (in my view very erroneously) linked to it is for permeable concrete, which is quite a bit different from ZOAB (Very Open Asphalt Concrete). ZOAB is way closer to Asphalt than what you would think of as concrete, and is only called concrete because it has a load bearing amount of rocks in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: looks like someone else already linked it, but I highly recommend all his other videos</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in an almost third world country and the asphalt streets and some roads need repair after a year and some street can have a different look than the asphalt of other street, quality of asphalt varies. I visited some first world countries as The Netherlands and Canada and the difference is night and day really good looking and durable asphalt.</p></div>		</li>
