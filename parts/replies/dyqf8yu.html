			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly she didn't die just cause of the water, it was the not letting it out that fucked her up. Her body couldn't get it out so it took it in. By the time the contest was over she didn't even feel the need to pee anymore. </p>
<p>Chubbyemu has an amazing explanation of the whole thing

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good analogy for eli5. I was going to use the analogy of pre-heating an oven: “Set your oven for 400 degrees. In 20 minutes, it will reach 400 degrees.  But you cannot turn it on for four minutes once an hour, for five hours, and expect it to eventually reach 400 degrees.” </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Q: &quot;Why cant I drink 5 gallons of water in 5 hours but I can drink 5 gallons of water over 5 days?&quot;</p>
<p>A: &quot;You shouldn't spend 4 hours all at once in the sun but spread it out over 15 minute increments and you'll be fine.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
