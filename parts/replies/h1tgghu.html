			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, other answers have been good, but the real answer is that bananas and humans both need to do things like make proteins, and make mechanisms to transport things in and out of cells. Lots of the code of your dna is boring stuff like that, and lots of it is extra nonsense.</p>
<p>Edit: Lots of responses using coding as an analogy, which I think is a good one, but not one I'm an expert at. </p>
<p>Think of it like if every app you could download, had to also download the entire 8gb android operating system that it runs on. If a banking app and a game are each 100mb normally, suddenly they're both 8100mb - and they share 98.8% of their code! It isn't necessarily a sign that the apps are super similar, but it is a sign they both use android. </p>
<p>Human and banana dna, are read internally inside new human or banana cells, so the code on how to read them needs to be included in the box, which means the contents of those boxes are very similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man!  Totally not boring!  I feel like cells get such a bad rap.  There is SO MUCH COMPLEXITY inside a cell.  The cellular machinery is just simply amazing.  And it's all coordinated together.</p>
<p>Like we think humans are so complex, but the only reason we can have organs and organ systems is because our cells are communicating with each other and coordinating all their activities together.  Everything we do as a human begins and ends in cells.. from digesting food, to thinking about philosophy to having sex.  And really sex is mostly about making sure your cells get to make more cells indefinitely.</p>
<p>Ok, I'll stop.</p>
<p>EDIT:  There have been a couple requests for me to continue my geekery, and I simply can't deny someone the pleasure of geeking out.  So here goes:</p>
<p>So your cells are in this constant communication with each other.  They're sending out chemical signals to each other that helps coordinate these larger responses.</p>
<p>What you may be aware of is that you are actually an entire planet for other cells.  You have colonies of different simpler bacteria that inhabit the different biomes of your body..  You have whole ecosystems of bacteria in your gut that change as your food gets broken down further.  You have different species of bacteria that live on the dry desert of your skin and a different species that live in the humid tropical living tissues of your urethra.  So you are a collection of these different habitats for all the bacteria you host on the microorganism planet that is you.</p>
<p>So we are starting to suspect that these populations of bacteria ARE communicating with your cells and influencing you.  I suspect that when your gut bacteria starts running out of nutrients they send signals to your brain to make you hungry and eat more.  So &quot;you&quot; are a collection of &quot;your&quot;  cells but also these other passengers cells that can rub off on other people or theirs can rub off on you and your population shifts.  You may have heard that you host more bacterial cells than you have human cells.  So what are you really?  </p>
<p>I have this whole theory of consciousness that goes along with this but that just gets in to unfounded pseudoscience that's just fun to think about.</p>
<p>SECOND EDIT:  Buckle up, here we go on some pseudoscience....  </p>
<p>Let's imagine for a moment that time doesn't exist the way our brains perceive it.  That maybe it happens all at once but our conscious mind is limited to seeing just one moment at a time.  (Several experiments in quantum physics support this idea, but it's in no way accepted science at this point.. and let's be honest I could also be grossly misinterpreting this through my own ignorance, but hey, isn't that was pseudoscience is all about?)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04558-7" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04558-7</a></p>
<p>Anyway.  So time maybe exists all at once but our conscience HUMAN brain sees it as linear; past, present, future despite all of these things happening at once.  We're just limited in our view by being so self aware.</p>
<p>But maybe bacteria are also conscious...  just not so 'self' aware and their consciousness is much more disperse.  And maybe this disperse awareness is NOT limited to one point in time.  Maybe this disperse awareness has some sense of time that appears to be in the future for our conscience minds but the bacterium in our body can sense it.</p>
<p>And what if the bacteria in our body could warn us of our future events?  Most of the bacteria we host is in our gut...  maybe this is our &quot;gut feelings.&quot;  Trillions of bacteria screaming at you chemically telling you not to do this thing because if you die, they die with you.</p>
<p>Anyway.  Thanks for taking that wild ride with me.  Sorry if you hit the eject button on the way :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess you could say that it is the same as giving objects and actors physics in a video game. a huge amount of the code would just be telling the engine that these 2 objects share the same physics code and how the player can interact with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a reasonable metafor is a LEGO set. The box contains bricks and a building manual for putting the bricks together. The manual is basically information that could easily fit on a micro SD card. Compared to a micro SD card the bricks easily make up more than 99% of the physical size. Yet the building manual is crucial for the end result. In this metafor the bricks are the part of the DNA that codes for proteins and the manual is the regulatory part of the DNA.</p>
<p>You can pick up two very different LEGO sets and still find 40% of the bricks being identical. The building manuals will be nothing alike, but they contain such a small part of the total size that it's insignificant.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with modern sets, but at least in the old days LEGO Technics building manuals would have instructions for building alternate models. Instead of building a car you'd might build something like a dragster. The alternate model would use the same bricks (with different instructions), but the end result would be quite different (similar to how humans and chimpanzees share 99% of DNA).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even when the bricks are slightly different, the extracting and processing of the petrochemicals and raw materials, and then  manufacturing, packing, and distributing of the bricks is very similar.</p></div>		</li>
