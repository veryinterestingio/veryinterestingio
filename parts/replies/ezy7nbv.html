<p>But to continue the math: An average human can put out a couple hundred watts for a few seconds without much difficulty. As you've seen, we need in the order of 5 kW to start the engine, so we're still going to need some kind of energy accumulator.  </p>
<p>Exactly how much energy you'd need if you were directly linked to the crank shaft is beyond my knowledge. But yeah, seems plausible, as I say, they used to do it that way. Though I reckon you'd have more luck selling as &quot;plug your phone in to start your car&quot; device than a &quot;here is a long bar, get to work&quot; device. But maybe not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can just use the car as the accumulator. </p>
<p>car = 2000kg</p>
<p>5mph = 2.24m/s</p>
<p>KE = 1/2<em>m</em>v\^2</p>
<p>1/2 <em> 2000kg </em> 2.24m/s \^2 = 5000 Joule</p>
<p>In practice, on a manual transmission car you pop it first gear, push in the clutch, push it to 5mph, release the clutch. This has the cars rolling kinetic energy spin the engine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This gizmo stores the energy of your hand cranking into a flywheel. Once there is enough stored energy you can push a button and dump all that energy to crank the engine. </p>

If you completely remove your battery and install it in another vehicle with a dead alternator to get it out of the way, you won't be able to push start your own car.  Unless you've got magneto ignition, or something.</p></div>		</li>

Those will have C rating up to about 50, but realistically that's a burst rating, usually 1-3 seconds. However, a battery with that chemistry the capacity of one in the phone (3Ah) will do 150 amps repeatedly in short bursts.</p></div>		</li>

Then again, at 120C, how much difference is there between burst and continuously - we're just talking about 15-30 seconds of battery capacity then.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I reckon your phone battery can probably supply about 1 amp of current max, [totally guessing that number] at 3.6 volts, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A cellphone will likely have an energy cell such as Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO), which can be reasonably discharged at 1C, or pushed to 2C with some degradation in performance. </p>
<p>In reality, if you wanted to build this type of system, you would want a power cell such as Lithium Iron Phosphate or Spinel, which can hit 40C discharges for a few seconds which still doesn't quite meet your estimate, but is much closer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This estimate is way off. My racing drone spikes 150A at full throttle out of a 1500mah battery in normal use. If damaging the battery was acceptable I reckon shorting it will probably produce many many more amps than that. This is not even one of the best batteries you can get, Tattuu R-Line probably does 200A.</p>
<p>For extra context, we normally discharge this batteries in about 2 to 3 minutes at an average of about 30A+, and they'll last less than a hundred cycles, with noticeable degradation (where you wouldn't use them in an actual race) happening after 20 cycles or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that the batteries you are talking about are being run out of specifications if they really are being discharged at 100C like you are saying (by spikes are you talking about inrush currents for a few ms, or seconds?). 40-60C as I said is really about as high as I've seen for lithium-ion cells and 60C is really bad for them.</p>
<p>The 30A you are referencing is 20C for your battery, which is within the numbers I was giving.</p></div>		</li>
