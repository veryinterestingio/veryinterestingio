			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting to me. I'd like to know what research confirms the cognitive load theory, because I think there could be a connection to anxiety. If you're in a vulnerable position, to me it would seem like being heavily mentally engaged would increase the threat level?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once told that I never looked people in the eye I talked to them. It was my anxiety, and I probably though that what I was saying wasn't interesting. Anyway, i was then self conscious about it, so I started forcing myself to look into eyes of the people I would talk to. It was super awkward for me to do, but at the time I though I was something people do. Until one day I overheard some coworkers talking about me and how weird I was when I stared into their eyes while talking. Fuck it, i can't win. So I just don't talk to people anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I couldn't understand why I was constantly lagging and dropping frames, so I went into my account settings. There were like a hundred relationships with other humans I had that were still in active memory! Anyway, I deleted those and now it's much better.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly, brain resources are tied to dedicated tasks more or less permanently (there is some plasticity, but not on such short time scales).</p>
<p>It's more like shutting down devices so they don't interrupt the CPU and don't mess up with the data in cache (process isolation and data integrity in the brain are pretty sketchy at best)... but you can't completely shut them down, so you just cover the camera to stop the image recognition from feeding you data. Even moving it to a side will make the recognition circuits take some time to detect new stuff, hopefully enough time for the CPU to finish what it was trying to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was younger, my dad would yell at me to “look him in the eye,” while he stabbed his finger into my sternum and basically spat in my face while screaming at me whenever I was “in trouble.” He never held that much contact when we were just talking. Today, I realize I avoid eye contact with other people because I am certain it makes me seem threatening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, internal mental image of flicking through a rolodex to find the filing cabinet where that memory file is</p>
<p>Kind of a dented Dewey decimal system, but like searching terms on Google, you put as much info and bounds on the search, a targeted sql query rather select all from memory where instance is leggy brunette or select from memory , where car keys equals location sort of thing</p></div>		</li>
