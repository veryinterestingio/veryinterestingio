			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I have benign fasciculation syndrome and will get crazy twitches from time to time. If you look at my calves or instep of my feet, you'll see them twitching almost constantly at times. (And yes, I've been tested for more serious conditions) Can happen anywhere though. Once my shoulder twitched non stop for about a month. Annoying.</p></div>		</li>
