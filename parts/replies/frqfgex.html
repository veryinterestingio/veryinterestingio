			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only one method.  There are many many methods for transferring profit out of the country.</p>
<p>One that is very commonly used is transfer pricing on funding.  Exxon and Chevron are examples in Australia that use that method to pay next to no income tax.  What they do is they have a parent company in a tax haven borrow money at a cheap rate, say 2.6%.  Then they &quot;on-lend&quot; that money to the Australia subsidiary at 9.2%.  Bang profits are now overseas and you can argue it's a legitimate cost of business.  Which is complete BS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't count as consolidated as they aren't in the same jurisdiction.</p>
<p>But on lending of finance, on charging of rental markup, licensing, large internal supply markup, service fees for &quot;marketing&quot; etc.</p>
<p>It's all BS when it comes down to it.</p>
<p>One I know of specifically has a Microsoft azure tenancy that is billed to the Caymans that is then oncharged to the Australian operation with an INSANE markup.</p></div>		</li>
