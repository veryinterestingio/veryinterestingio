			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with honey isn’t that botulism is more likely to be present versus other foods, but rather the low water content in the honey: </p>
<p>Almost all foods contain water, and if enough water is present the botulism spores will quickly multiply, produce toxin and degrade the food. You would notice that the food is ‘off’, and you wouldn’t eat the food (or serve it to an infant). With honey, the botulism lies dormant due to the lack of water. So the food doesn’t spoil, but the botulism is still there. When you eat the honey, the water in your saliva (or in the other food you mix it with), kick-starts the process of botulism spore multiplication and toxin creation. In adults, the botulism is destroyed in the stomach, but infants’ stomachs aren’t developed enough and the botulism spores can survive, resulting in the botulism toxins being produced <em>inside</em> the child’s body, even though the food wasn’t spoiled before they ate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of foods contain the spores, but as far as I can tell honey is the only food where infant botulism is a real risk. The wiki says most infants actually get it from eating dirt (C.  botulinum is very common in dirt). The spores tend to be in the air everywhere, and will easily get into things like fresh juice and whatnot, but that has a very low pH and I'm guessing is pretty good at keeping stomach pH low because it doesn't seem to be a problem. I think honey is just the bad thing because it comes from outside and bees (lots of stuff from whatever is outside) and it's sweet (so people try to give it to babies).</p>
<p>The risk for adults is it does tend to thrive in canned foods, and it will grow in improperly canned foods, that's the main cause of botulism in adults, but it's from ingestion of the toxin, not the bacteria growing in your gut. In the US at least, we require canned food is pressure cooked to kill the spores after canning, so this is mostly an issue with home canned stuff.</p></div>		</li>
