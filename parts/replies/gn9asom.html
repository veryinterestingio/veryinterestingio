			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer as well, and goes into more detail than I did. One thing I would like to add as an aside to Doc's review: 4.3 and 4.4 Volt operating windows did not come from no where. What happens is the electrolyte used in the battery will decompose at high enough potentials. This is a limitation because we are using organic compounds (hence the flammability issues). So this is addition to the cathodic reaction issues stated above. </p>
<p>Additionally, 811, while being very energy dense, is highly unstable alone. It needs serious surface treatments to operate effectively thanks to the high amount of nickel. </p>
<p>But here's a question for you: what do you think about the recent advancements in solid state tech and the increasing amount of silicon we can put in our anodes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acewing - you are right about the electrolyte stability limit in conventional solutions. Much more than about 4.4-4.5 V vs Li leads to decomposition of the electrolyte. This can be mitigate with surface treatments like you mentioned for 811 or even from certain additives which preferentially decompose on the cathode surface. Stabilizing Ni rich cathode was one of the key components of the recently publicized &quot;million mile battery&quot;. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-may-soon-have-a-battery-that-can-last-a-million-miles/" target="_blank">million mile battery</a></p>
<p>Regarding solid state, I think this is an important area with some potential advantages, but I don't think LIB is going anywhere in the next 20 years at least. I actually think LIB will be the mainstay EV battery for much longer but SSB will find markets in electronics sooner. Increasing the amount of Si (and there is a small amount already in commercial LIB anodes) is in my opinion more compatible with LIB than SSB due to the large volume expansion with lithaiting and delithiating Si. I would say most SSB approaches are focused on Li anodes rather than Si, which also has volume change issues among other problems, but a Li metal anode is kind of the holy grail for reasons others have stated in this post (Li is the lightest, most reducing metal).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most chinese companies work on SSB with Si-C anode, using mostly polymer electrolytes.</p>
<p>By the way, batteries for cell phones are now targeting 4.5V cycling vs graphite and LCO gives something like 190-200 mAh/g at this voltage.
It does not make sense to push nickel and go to high voltage, these are actually two separate paths. (See Tesla battery day for ex.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We were talking about performance not price.</p>
<p>But hitting on the subject of price, yes they were far higher in cost when they first came out, but they were also very expensive when they came out. Per ah, they were ten times the price of the previous battery they were replacing. Just the cost could be justified by the size and weight gains. If you notice the price is hitting a plateau the last couple of years. Maybe we will see another 30 to 50 percent drop in ten years but we are reaching the raw material cost limits.</p></div>		</li>
