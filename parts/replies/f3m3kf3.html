			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much pitch black by definition, since &quot;pitch&quot; in the context of color refers to essentially the same thing as asphalt (sticky black hydrocarbon distillation residue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The asphalt needs to be sufficiently thick to deal with the weight of the vehicles.  The thinner it gets, the less weight it can handle and the faster it breaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well here where I live we do both! First a cold planer is used to mill the topmost layer, but this leaves a rough surface unsuitable for use as a finished product. Then, tack oil is sprayed onto the milled surface to ensure adhesion, and a new lift of asphalt is placed. </p>
<p>It's much easier to achieve a smooth, uniform surface when placing new asphalt. </p>
<p>In addition, often old asphalt is cracked and weakened in other ways, and simply milling off the top layer won't fix the underlying issue, but placing a new layer on top will add adequate strength to last another few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always enjoyed the cut edge of asphalt. Base and finish grades looked like marble from the side when cut or cored.   I wondered if it could be a polished and sealed countertop material.  Marilyn Monroe mix (maintenance mix) with no aggregate other than sand looked less pretty in core samples and whatnot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it - asphalt, even when quite old remains relatively ductile. I find when we're ripping out even the oldest surfaces pieces will bend and break when you cantilever them off the side off the equipment. Maybe mixed with sone kind of epoxy it would work? Interesting idea!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not. Asphalt is not a rigid structural surface on its own. It works for roads because of a firm base underneath it. But for a countertop it would be a disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In parts of Australia (I live in NSW) rhyolite can be used as the course aggregate in order to improve skid resistance of the asphalt concrete (AC).</p>
<p>Once this begins to age or wear, it goes a pale pink colour. This is because the rhyolite has a pale pink colour to it and isn't grey/blue like most other rock suitable for AC.</p>
<p>Surprising hard to find a photo to link, but it is usually put on sharp corners where there is a history of accidents and on the approaches to traffic lights on high volume/speed roads.</p></div>		</li>
