			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes youre right, but like the other guy said they're not all made from the same metal. And F1 engine doesn't even turn over when cold. They lock up tight</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless all the parts are made of the same same type of metal/alloy, the various parts will shrink by different amounts. This means some parts might end up squeezing against other parts.  That squeezing force increases friction, even if the surface area has reduced by a negligible amount.</p>
<p>Also, if there's a lubricant involved, the lubricant will likely be more viscous, meaning it will do its job less effectively.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why doesn't this happen when the car heats up?</p></div>		</li>

<p>When materials get cold, holes in those materials get smaller.</p>
<p>An engine is nothing but a bunch of holes in metal with things sliding around in those now smaller holes, with vastly increased frictional forces when cold.</p>
<p>In fact the basic approach to separating seized metal parts starts with knowing of the holes growing and shrinking with temperature, and using heat to get things loose.</p></div>		</li>
