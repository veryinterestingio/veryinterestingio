			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this:- Fecal matter (and the diseases/parasites it can spread) is a serious concern in feedlots and other forms of intensive/crowded farming. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These farms will (usually) have a lot of measure in place to prevent the spread of disease such as a quarantine zone (e.g. requiring all staff to completely shower and decontaminate before going onsite) and pumping the animals full of antibiotics to prevent any diseases from gaining a foothold.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because if some sort of disease does make it into a feedlot it can (and does) spread very rapidly and can wipe out an entire herd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More common on dairies is to have a section of concrete where the animals feed that is cleaned daily and separated from the feed by a low wall with stanchions that the cows can eat over. Then past that you have the open corral for them to move around it that you just manage.</p>
<p>No special quarantine efforts(aside from separate pens for sick cows) and you can't use milk from cows on antibiotics either and I haven't seen any massive epidemics sweep through the herd thanks to things like vaccines. Good cleaning practices in the milking barn of course. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes but the vaccines make the cows autistic and they give autistic causing milk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to work for a pig farm, we had 2000(close to half of our total) sows die due to the cleaning team not properly washing all the fecal matter in the vacant rooms. Spread like wildfire, forget the name of the disease but it was not fun hauling dead sows for 12 hours a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a farmer, and this is a good practice, as long as the cows and chickens are regularly moved to fresh ground.  An added bonus is that the chicken shit acts as a liming agent, so if you have acidic soil, it raises the pH and makes it possible to grow more nutritious pasture grasses.  My naturally acidic fields want to grow broomsedge (<em>andropogon virginicus</em>) but moving chickens across them eliminates the broomsedge in a season and makes room for higher quality warm season grasses and forbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a video that says putting goats in before cows, albeit for a short time only, can be beneficial because they preferentially eat non-grass weeds, and many of their favourites, like certain spurges, are noxious to cows and horses.</p>
<p>I mean, they were pretty pro-goat. Any thoughts on this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up working a 7 acre farm, and helping to rotate the Chicken lot to Garden plot that typically hosted 100 to 300 chickens depending on time of year and egg production cycles.</p>
<p>We would turn over sections of about 2 acres to the chicken flock over fall/winter, then shift them for summer.</p>
<p>The former chicken yard would be barren of all weeds and caked in chicken shit.</p>
<p>I regularly drew the short straw and had to plow and till the section to get it ready for spring planting.</p>
<p>When we put corn, green beans, carrots, lettuce, beets, squash, tomatoes... no matter what went into the former chicken yard, would explode out of the ground.</p>
<p>Other sections of the garden got the chicken shit that had been accumulating under the roosts and such - same effect - vegetables exploding into massive size in record time.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of quality chicken shit.</p></div>		</li>
