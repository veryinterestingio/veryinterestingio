			<div class="markdown"><p>By land area maybe but the shape of Florida makes it pretty easy to drive forever without leaving. If you’re in Miami and trying to get to Texas for example you’re driving along an edge the whole way but due to the shape you’re driving for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Florida is very tough to drive in thanks to all those large inlets on the gulf side that you have to drive around.  My parents place to a nice beach is prob 5 miles as the crow flies.  It takes almost an hour to drive to it though because it's on the other side of a giant fucking inlet.</p></div>		</li>
