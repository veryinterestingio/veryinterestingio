			<div class="markdown"><p>When people say there are many strains(1000+), they are mostly referring to small nucleotide shifts(technically a new strain). For reference these shifts are like moving one piece in a 32,000+ piece puzzle.(less than .001% difference) Coronaviruses are relatively stable (for a virus...) In that there will be thousands of minor shifts but it will largely remain the same ~less than 1% shift. </p>
<p>The business of assigning the &quot;number&quot; of  let's call them &quot;functional&quot; strains is artificial and usually done in retrospect. For example, dengue fever has &quot;4&quot; strains which share 60% genetic similarity but the amount of actual strains in those 4 families is enormous.</p>
<p>Let's say that viruses are dogs. And the coronavirus is a corgi. Functionally a brown corgi would function the same as a golden corgi, because it's still a corgi just looks a bit different. But if we suddenly had a great dane instead.... Well we assign a new tag. Or if the corgi suddenly had a different style head or taller legs etc. That's a significant functional difference. </p>
<p>So yes there's 1000s of strains already. No it's probably still one &quot;functional&quot; strain. But even if there's &quot;one&quot; strain it's very valuable to continuously sequence it and see it's progress as we can use it to trace outbreaks and see how the virus spreads as well as test for functional differences etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for the flu, how does this kind of thing work? Strain A and B would be the 2 families of flu, and within those there could technically be thousands of slight variations?</p>
<p>Do those two families get treated with the same vaccine? Is it as effective for each family?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Let's be clear about this, there are millions of mutations of sars-cov-2. Just because full genome sequencing has only been done for a few thousand doesn't mean there are only a few thousand strains. We are only getting a detailed look at a few drops in the ocean.</p>
<p>It's also unfair to say there's only X functionally different strains because analyses for functional differences between even just the strains listed on nextstrain isn't anywhere close to feasible right now.</p>
<p>When you account for zoonotic infections, we have very limited insights into the functional differences these strains have between species as well as the number of mutations happening in infected animals in the wild.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What are the chances that new strains become weaker or stronger? Or does it just make it so that we need a more &quot;general&quot; vaccine that works for all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I appreciate the response, and I realize I didn’t pose my question very well. I’m familiar with nextstrain, and it’s awesome! Nice work on that.</p>
<p>What I was wondering is are we seeing any reliable info on certain strains behaving in a way that is distinct from other strains, such as increased rate of spread, decreased case fatality rate, etc. I understand that is to be expected but I have been skeptical that that information has been shown definitively since it’s hard to have any type of controlled experiment in this environment.</p>
<p>Also, is “strain” defined as “genetically distinct”? I was operating on the assumption that genetic drift was a given, and thus a strain would refer to a whole bunch of slightly genetically different viruses, but which would have a common infectious behavior. </p>
<p>Thanks again for the response! I’m a scientist, but I do materials research and genetics, etc related to Covid is way outside my wheelhouse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggy backing with a new question, there is A and B on nextstrain already in December.</p>
<p>Based on rate of mutation have researchers been able to better pinpoint when it jumped to humans?</p></div>		</li>
