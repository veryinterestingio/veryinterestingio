<p>I’d hazard a guess that it was found that if you slow down the release of the vaccine in this way for this particular vaccine you get a better outcome.  </p>
<p>The only other vaccine which is delivered in a similar way is the BCG, which protects against TB.  That’s usually delivered with a regular hollow needle though.  Probably because you’re not trying to vaccinate entire populations in one go.</p></div>		</li>
