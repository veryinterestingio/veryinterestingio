			<div class="markdown"><p>Further more, as sound waves travel, they start to dissipate.  If projected with enough energy (such as something with such force; thunder, a gun shot, etc) the sound will travel given its' raw potential to not be stopped so easily.  Even while they dissipate, and not just fall away out of thin air, the sound will augment or transform into a longer, perhaps more drawn out, and less intense force than it was when first created.  </p>
<p>So, if a tree falls in the woods yet no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?  Of course it does.  There is always something living near by that will hear it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further further further more, lightning can travel an astonishing distance, so if the lightning bolt starts 10 miles away and ends 2 miles away, the sound from the 2 mile location will arrive before the 10 mile location and all the locations in between which can dramatically change duration of the sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool, thank you for that explaination! Just sounds so different from a near by lightning bolt I guess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yea, when you are near by, you will hear much more intensity of the sound created because it has not had to travel much distance in order for the sound waves themselves to disperse across other matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, depending on the size and orientation of the lighting bolt, you could be significantly farther away (at the speed of sound) from one end of it than the other, so the sound could be spread over several seconds as it reaches you from a range of distances.</p></div>		</li>
