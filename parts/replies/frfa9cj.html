I have noticed many, many times that Iâ€™ve been doing something quite noisy at work such that I couldnâ€™t hear anything around me, then I started humming a song seemingly at random, then I stopped doing the noisy thing to discover the song I was humming was playing in the background.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's fun is when you start going deaf. People tend to assume that being deaf means you can either hear stuff or you can't, but it's much more fun than that - you hear things like your name when that wasn't what was said, but your brain is doing its' best to guess at what you just heard (or rather, didn't hear). So you start hearing people say stuff in conversation like 'table-chair-ashtray', leaving you in a permanent state of 'eh, what?'</p>
<p>(I've had one ear fixed where they replaced the 'anvil' bone with a titanium-steel rod, and my hearing in that ear came back as soon as I woke up after the op. It still works really well, although I do have to fight the urge to find and kill Sarah Connor)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember in school picking a word of the day (something uncommon) listen for a bit and figure out how often it was said (not very often), then start adding it to conversations and seeing how many people would starting trying to add this new word to their sentences.</p>
<p>It always seemed like it worked, and friends agreed that it seemed to work. Would be interesting to see if there is a study like this out there now that I think about it again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to extend this explanation a bit further, tests have been made about actually perceiving if you're being stared at from outside your peripheral vision, as very often we feel like we're being observed even when we're alone or we don't actually see anyone explicitly doing so, and, as you may imagine, the results were that the &quot;feeling of being observed&quot; and actually being looked at, have no correlation whatsoever</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like something like this is extremely hard to test. If I go into a random room knowing its a study of some kind I'm probably gonna skew the data because I might feel like its pretty possible that I am being watched.</p>
<p>Then again maybe that just shows the feeling of being watched is more due to being in an uncomfortable environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard about a conclusion as to why we feel we're being watched is sometimes you think you are and you look back, (like in a class), and someone notices you turning around and looks at you just because the movement caught their eye.</p>
<p>So like a self fulfilling prophecy kind of thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although I agree with this answer, it over-legitimises that you get the feeling only for a valid reason, and thatâ€™s not the whole truth.</p>
<p>You can easily get the feeling after youâ€™ve subconsciously noticed you havenâ€™t been checking your surroundings for a while, and mostly we forget the times that we got the feeling and no one was there.</p>
<p>You might also have problems with paranoia or social fears, and so youâ€™d get this feeling more often than not and without any specific reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree there might be non-visual cues that tell your brain someone might be looking at you. Such as someone standing very still, or if they aren't in your field of vision, someone suddenly not making sounds of movement. Your brain picks up more cues than you're immediately aware of.</p>
<p>Also I think it's in interesting question why our brains are so hypersensitive to the <em>feeling</em> of being watched, even if it might not be true. Might have something to do with fear of predators. In that case it's better to err on the side of caution. Sensing something when there's nothing there, is a mistake you can make as often as you want. The other way around is a mistake you can potentially make only once. ðŸ™‚ I think this is also part of the reason why our brains try to see faces everywhere. Same effect; <em>not</em> recognizing a (camouflaged) face quickly enough is a much more dangerous mistake than seeing too many of them. So evolution made sure that our brains err on the side of safety; the people or populations whose brains didn't, were eventually weeded out by dangerous predators.</p>
<p>And in addition to predators, the fact that we are social group animals I think also plays a role. After all, not detecting a fellow's presence, or recognizing his face, or knowing what his facial expression meant, could potentially quickly hinder your functioning within the group (including learning as a group, which has been vital in human evolution) and/or even make you an outcast eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do want to add something important to this. You may get the feeling and think someone was watching you, however, it is more likely that the person looked at you at you turned your head to look at them, falsely thinking you were being watched. That person's peripheral vision spotted the change and looked at the same time you got the feeling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in addition to what I said: of course these skills and survival mechanisms (and the punishment by evolution if these skills wouldn't work) evolved long before we became humans. </p>
<p>Every living species that needs to fear predators AND/OR has social behaviour, will have these skills, and pretty much every lifeform as simple as a single-celled lifeform able to detect light/shadow would have started to evolve these skills. So it wouldn't be an overstatement to say that these things are looong engrained in our DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue this line of reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>You might start with the feeling that someone is watching you.  You turn to look around.  People that were kind of looking in your general direction - but not necessarily staring at you - have their eye drawn to your movement, and are now looking at you.  You write this down as a validation of your stare-detection superpowers.</li>
<li>You also don't remember all those times you looked, but didn't find anyone looking at you.</li>
<li>If you're behaving nervous already (perhaps because you're &quot;always right&quot; about people staring), people are more likely to actually notice you than if you were acting &quot;normal&quot;.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Glad to see this.  We &quot;false positive&quot; a <em>lot</em> of things, think some things are more common than they actually are.</p>
<p>In this case specifically, we remember because looking up and seeing someone else looking is kind of creepy.  Despite being creepy, that's &quot;objective achieved&quot; reinforcement: If you try to put a ball through a hoop 100 times and fail, the one time you make it you'll remember forever.  Most people will forget most of the misses, they'll blend together as &quot;a lot&quot;.</p>
<p>Taking note of the creepy is an evolutionary advantage, as is looking for it in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
