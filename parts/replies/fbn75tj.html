			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any tips on breaking into Union camera work?  I've been assisting for a few years now with lots of non-union experience as both a 1st and 2nd, and I'm wondering where I go from here.  I'm also in NYC and I'm also looking for camera PA jobs but I'm wondering if you have any tips?  Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
