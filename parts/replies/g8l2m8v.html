			<div class="markdown"><p>Long haulers have symptoms for months, but there is not evidence of persistent whole viral particles. Rather it appears that some people clear non-infectious pieces of the virus over months, unrelated to symptoms. Persistent symptoms may be due to an inflammatory reaction or microthrombi or damage from the original infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but is it really relevant comparing the bovine cov results with the ones of covid 19? One is a virus only found in cows and one jumped from animals to humans. I am not sure if you can detect any long term effects in kettle (especially if it's for meat production...) and compare it to human long term effects.</p>
<p>I genuinely wanna know, so you might be able to explain why you choose this virus compared to other Corona virus like mers that also affected humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people talking about antibodies, which is true, but the PCR test may be persistently positive for months after an infection because of tiny pieces of viral particles that may be cleared over months after an infection. These are not whole infectious viral particles, but broken down “dead” pieces.</p></div>		</li>
