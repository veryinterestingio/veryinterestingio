			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. I'm a veterinarian, but I don't do a lot of allergy testing due to the cost. If I had a dollar for every person who told me they gave their 75 lb itchy dog a half of a children's benedryl, I would already be retired. </p>
<p>Thank the pharma gods for Apoquel. Now make it cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately no :( Apoquel hasn't been out for long enough for that. I do know that some human pharmacies are carrying it now. The Costco near me carries it. They might be a little more reasonably priced. It is an expensive medication though :( </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I know of. Prednisone would be the next best thing, but the side effects and lots of veterinarians will not prescribe it for allergies when there is something safer to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apoquel is so expensive!! And I work at a specialty center where everything is even more expensive ? I try to encourage people to get it at their regular vets. Cytopoint is a good option but it is even more  expensive!
We do our allergy testing through Heska and VARL. I'm not sure what the cost is to us, but we charge 285 to the client and I know we mark our stuff up a ton :-/ and then skin testing but that is more expensive and such a pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert but I was also curious. Read a few articles and their references and I saw nothing about histamines playing less of a role in canine allergies, but that antihistamines were just much less likely to actually work for dogs in blocking histamines.</p>
<p>The consensus seemed to be that scientists aren't really sure why and aren't that interested in finding out because corticosteroids work just fine in treating most symptoms of dog allergies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So histamine does contribute, but is isn't the largest contributor in allergic dermatitis. It's more a contributor for an acute reaction to something, like bee sting. </p>
<p>What does contribute more in dogs are cytokines. The drugs we use are targeted for different steps in these cytokine pathways. They block the pathway that causes the itch sensation to happen, if that makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>300-400 for an allergy test. If it comes back positive for something, allergy injections are going to be pretty expensive too. </p>
<p>IMO ask your vet to try Cytopoint injection off the bat. If it works, then it's just a matter of getting that done every 4-8 weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We'll ask, thank you. He's been getting steroid injections but he can't get those too often and they wear off before it's safe to give him a near one and he literally tears his fur out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity what is the cost of cytopoint? It's monoclonal antibody and the human version is currently out of our price range. </p></div>		</li>

			<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/camokittyy" target="_blank">camokittyy</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how they are tested. Typically we do blood tests which are cheaper and in my opinion produce better results than skin testing. We charge around 300 for the test - but keep in mind I work for a prestigious speciality center and we mark stuff up a ton. </p>
<p>Allergy serum injections is the next step. We take what they are allergic to and create a serum out of it. The dog then gets bi-weekly to monthly injections of the mixture, done at home by the owner. The constant exposure makes it so they don't flare when they encounter it. It can take up to a year to go into effect so we typically use Apoquel or Cytopoint in the meantime to manage the symptoms. For us, serum costs clients around $180 but lasts an entire year. </p></div>		</li>
