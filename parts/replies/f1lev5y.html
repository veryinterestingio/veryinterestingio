			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello I have a question.  When I was in college I took a few grad level audiology classes. My professor mentioned pulsating tinnitus being a serious matter. Lately I’ve been experiencing a ringing in my ears along with a strange pulsing/heartbeat type of sensation. Should I get it checked out? What could be causing this?  I’m currently using timolol drops in my eyes and one of the side effects are tinnitus.   Thank you in advance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a doctor. Please get it checked. Pulsatile tinnitus might be concerning, especially for something called a paraganglioma (aka glomus tympanicum or glomus jugulare based on the location) in the middle ear. It's a benign tumour (not cancer), but it can grow big and affect hearing, balance and other important functions locally.</p>
<p>10-20% of paragangliomas or glomus tumours in the middle ear are also known to secrete catecholamines, ie certain hormones that cause symptoms like a panic attack (strange pulsating/heartbeat kind of sensation that you're describing).</p>
<p>While certain paragangliomas have a tendency to turn into cancer over many years, that's very rare when it comes to the ones in the middle ear. Still, it's a good idea to get it checked by an ENT specialist.</p>
<p>Again, it's not a common tumour, so it's more likely than not that you don't have it and it's just a side effect of the medication that you're taking, but I would recommend getting it checked out.</p>
<p>I hope you get better!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had that for more than six months, and when I finally realised that it was something I should go to the doctor for, it turned out to just be a very mild infection or eardrum irritation. Doc said it was very red, anyway. Gave me ear drops, annoying pulse sound went away within a week.</p></div>		</li>
