			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does banning plastic bags and straws in developed countries help with that? Well that and all the fishing gear mentioned in the first reply. What's the connection between the bans and other cleanup efforts (in developed countries) between the bulk of pollution sources that are in developing countries?</p>
<p>I'm guessing some roundabout logic like &quot;we recycle the plastic waste in places that dump it in their rivers, so we'll ban plastic products because we don't want plastic waste dumped in rivers&quot;. I guess it's still helpful, even if it reduces worldwide pollution by 0.1%, which makes it hard to criticize, but clearly the money and effort involved in cleaning up already (comparatively) clean countries is well up there in diminishing returns zone. I'm honestly curious BTW, I feel like there's a large disconnect between what's being done (in places that actually do anything about the problem) and the actual sources of the plastic pollution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't.  Plastics and garbage from individual consumption is small compared to industrial waste.  The biggest way developed countries like US and Europe can help is to continue to regulate industrial waste and perhaps add some more regulations to prevent farm chemical runoff, probably one of our largest ocean pollutants.  Tarrifs on countries who do not properly regulate their industries could also be helpful.</p>
<p>As a consumer, continue recycling and not buying products from China would be the best you can do, as reducing demand from products will reduce production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recycling does almost nothing. Majority what we think is recyclable just goes straight to the landfill or shipped to other countries' landfill. After China started banning imported trash, our export to countries like Thailand increased by almost 7000%. And now with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand also starting to crackdown on importing trash, reducing and reusing are really the only option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Environmental tariffs isn’t something you hear much about at all. They seem like a far better idea than the economical ones (they tend to have the opposite effect).</p>
<p>If a broad support for them could be implemented in “the west” consumption of environmentally bad products can go down, while giving an incentive for the producers to improve to get away from the tariffs.</p>
<p>Economical tariffs on the other hand gives an incentive to make new trade agreements and lowering cost (often leading to even worse treatment of the environment).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My (cynical /kneejerk) reaction is that while limiting plastic bag use is a good move, and to a lesser extent the convenience of disposal straws is kind of not worth the wastage, the whole &quot;campaign&quot; nature of it all lately is more about giving people an excuse to <em>feel</em> like they're part of some sort of productive action. Optimistically we could say that's because we might generally succumb to helplessness otherwise, so this at least gets some collective positive outcome. Conversely, the pessimistic view could see this as a way of helping to keep us focused on spinning our little economic hamster wheels as long as possible because any actual significant action we could take might interfere with the truly important universal mysteries <em>(edit: /s)</em> like GDP growth, election cycles, and smart phone battery-life upgrades. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. And it's also a way for big companies to act like they're doing something about it. For example, Starbucks saying it's going to stop using straws. A friend of mine who used to work there talked about the waste in the kitchen, how they would throw out hundreds of plastic lids and cardboard cup holders without blinking if the plastic they were wrapped in had a small hole, because they might be contaminated. Everything they work with comes wrapped in plastic, and there's no plans to change any of that. but they put out a media campaign about getting rid of straws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GDP growth is not a mystery. If there is no money in something, that isn't because the money gods don't like it, it's because it takes more energy and expendable resources than are received by doing it.</p>
<p>If you want to clean up the ocean, you need the fuel to get there, the tools to make it happen, and the fuel to get back, than you need to do something with the trash. </p>
<p>I'm not  saying it isn't worth doing, but it is  not creating any wealth, therefor energy and expendable resources that could be put towards other projects needs to be taken aware and applied to it. And making the case that healthcare or national defense isn't as important as a garbage heap at the bottom of the ocean is a very hard sell</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being a role model.</p>
<p>It's fair to assume, I reckon, that your average person in a developing nation doesn't <em>enjoy</em> squalor; they just put up with it for now. Those countries have spent decades aspiring to be like the wealthy countries with their big TVs and cars and all that. I would expect that the next aspirational goal on that trajectory would be “hey, how come they get nice rivers?!” And it's the responsibility of wealthy countries to say “well, here's how you do it: ...”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we already have nice rivers(except bicycles they are everywhere) , if we ban plastic or not, it's about throwing the plastic in the trash cans, it's not like our infrastructure just dumps all our trash into the water, in Europe it's burned, and In USA it's simply buried, which definitely is a thing USA should address, it's much better to burn trash than burry it. What I don't understand is the trend of absolutely banning plastic, I mean plastic is useful and if you throw it in the trash can then it won't end up in the ocean, at least not in the west in many big poor countries they don't have any trash infrastructure at all, these poor countries are the reason for the pollution, and no it's not because they use more plastic than us it's because they don't have anywhere to get rid of it, they need trash infrastructure, and whilst you can't just change law in other countries we could still help them, you know their exists organizations like Red Cross, we could make an organization that actually made a difference in the areas, and they could set an example in the actual area, they educate about trash cans, place them everywhere and then burn the trash for them at some facilities that have some decent filters and such. Then those environmentalist that spend extra money for a worse cup made out of something environmentally digestive which doesn't do a difference anyway because the people that actually will invest in such a cup would probably also be decent enough to throw their cup in the trash after use beating the actual point of the product. Instead they could donate to an organization that helped with trash infrastructure in poor places</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's genuinely unfair that wealthy countries got to develop all their wealth industrial revolution, polluting and destroying everything around them, and now we turn to developing countries where people are trying to build up their quality of life and shake our fingers at them and say no. Unfortunately, though, there's no way around it. The Earth can't support more of what developed countries did to it for 200 years or so.</p></div>		</li>
