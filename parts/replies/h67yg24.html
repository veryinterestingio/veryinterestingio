			<div class="markdown"><p>But I would think the question would be whether the grandma did this because it was her grandchild or just another member of the group. We know there are animals that take care of their tribe/group but this question is specifically about grandparents/child relationships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm dragging this up from old memories but the videos i remember were based on animals that go round in family groups so it would be because it's a grandchild. That said it's no definitive proof that if another infant animal joined the group for some reason the same help wouldn't be offered.</p>
<p>My opinion is that it's because of the familial relationship.</p>
<p>On a philosophical side note, you could say a matriarch considers the herd to all be her family regardless of a blood ties. But that's a whole other discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again I think that’s slightly different. We know animals have family groups that take care of each other but I think the question is “in animal groups or tribes are grandparent/child relationships stronger than the rest of the group relationships”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s important to realize the evolution of the function for grandparents as human social groups have changed. </p>
<p>For much of out history, life expectancy was shorter, so fewer elders would be a resource to the entire group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a misconception, while the average life expectancy of hunter gatherers is low because of child mortality once you reach adulthood, the life expectancy was similar to modern humans in developing countries. There would be plenty of elders and grandparents throughout the majority of human history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely woman still had menopause back then.  And the whole reason for menopause is probably so grandmas can help with their grandkids.   Or at least one of the reasons.</p></div>		</li>
