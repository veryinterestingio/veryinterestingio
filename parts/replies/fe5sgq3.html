			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Taylor's eyes had a very specific, and rare, amount of melanin, but it was roughly the same as a person with blue eyes. &quot;  From the OP question, the context was really more of a generalization as to why we don't have certain eye colors, but for the few, there may be aberrations! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they weren't really purple. She had a rare amount of melanin that <em>in some light</em> make her eyes to have a faint purple hue. But mostly of the time her eyes would look blue.</p>
<p>Obviously in movies they tried to use the light to make her eyes as purpleish as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and I believe earlier studio lights also altered how her eyes look under certain lighting conditions. There's also a photo of a young Courtney Cox somewhere where she appears to have violet eyes too.</p></div>		</li>
