<p>Yep. Having the tech to add an atmosphere should also make it trivial to <em>maintain</em> one, even if its loss rate were much higher than it actually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Raw materials and the fact that it isn't possible to get the atmosphere on to mars without significantly raising its temperature. Basically the kinetic energy of the matter that turns to heat when decelerating would make mars a boiling hellscape for 100s if not 1000s of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the amount lost over any human time scale would be much much less than the amount you have to add initially.  </p>
<p>If you're able to create a livable atmosphere maintaining it won't be a significant issue.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>A thick atmosphere like ours does a better job of blocking radiation than a magnetic field, as it can block both charged as well as uncharged particles. A magnetic field can only block charged particles, which means high-energy EM (gamma rays, X-rays, hard UV) can pass through a magnetic field unhindered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A magnetic field doesn’t deflect electromagnetic radiation but it does deflect charged particles. So UV radiation would not be reduced by a planetary magnetic field. On Earth it’s certain materials in the atmosphere — such as ozone, water vapor, dust particles — that scatter and absorb UV radiation. </p>
<p>What the Earth’s magnetic field protects against is the stripping away of atmosphere by the solar wind, a stream of charged particles driven by the sun. The solar wind would act to deplete the ozone layer and this would cause more UV light to reach the Earth. So, indirectly, the magnetic field does help against too much UV light reaching the surface.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You should probably read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/oyeg3f/is_it_even_feasible_to_terraform_mars_without_a/h7tklzn/" target="_blank">this comment</a> - I've mentioned many times on this subreddit that while a magnetic field protects against solar wind sputtering, it also causes polar wind outflow that means even-faster atmospheric loss on Earth-sized planets.</p></div>		</li>
