<p>I don't know much about the process to make holy cows (heh) but I'd imagine if it turned out badly and the cow was in pain they'd put the cow down, which is not an option human doctors have (as much as they might wish for it sometimes). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a naive thought, but isn't the flank of a cow much less &quot;mobile&quot; than a human side? I mean, humans twist and turn a lot in the stomach area while cows usually do most of their movements with their legs.</p>
<p>And my coffee didn't kick in yet. So maybe I'm just an idiot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s awesome! I hope everything goes well with you. My dad has an ostomy, but he had an extreme reason for it, and because of that he has had various health issues stem from that. The past year was extremely difficult for him in terms of pain. He is somewhat fine now but that’s because of heavy medication. So basically I just think it varies depending on why the ostomy was needed in the first place. </p></div>		</li>
