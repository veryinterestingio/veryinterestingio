			<div class="markdown"><p>That used to be the assumption, just didn't really bother looking for it. As Op says, now it's thought that far more people in Africa have traces as well. Probably from populations travelling back into Sub-Saharan Africa after mixing with outsiders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand. If all homo sapien lines originated from Africa via migration, then Neanderthals and Denosivians and Java lines also originated from Africa.</p>
<p>So shouldn't those three lines have African DNA and vice versa? What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>
