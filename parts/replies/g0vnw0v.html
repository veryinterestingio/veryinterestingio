It was made by Howard Hughes, who felt so guilty about exposing the crew to radiation (25 years after it was made, 91 of the 220 crewmembers developed cancer) that he bought up all known prints of the film and kept it out of circulation until his death. Supposedly he watched this film and <em>Ice Station Zebra</em> over and over after becoming a recluse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small addendum it's about the land owned by the Federal government. Federal land can be used for nuclear testing without state authority. State land can't be used the same way. You need state permission (which I doubt anyone is going to give you to blow up bombs there). </p>
<p>But since it's federal land, the Fed can just drop bombs and states have to deal with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was the '50s, the state would have probably given permission</p>

<p>It's easy to forget how new these weapons were to these people.  If the Cuban Missile Crisis happened today, the first bombs would have been dropped in 2002.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Because the Federal govt owns it. Technically it owns <em>everything</em>. That's kind of the point. There always will be a top dog, but much better it's Uncle Sam than a Google.</p>
<p>There's messy realities at that level involving the valid use of a bunch of desert land to prevent a hostile nation from harming us. None of that is done perfectly or in a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>
