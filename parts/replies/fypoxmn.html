<p>These days data analysis happens real time on billions of transfers daily, there isn't a <em>3 day delay</em> in handling anything. It's simply banks being slow for the purpose of being slow. Being slow allows them to not pay any interest in the days there was interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's instant. Mind you as a landlord I've a fair amount of daily transactions that I need to move around.</p>
<p>But it goes even that far, a while ago my younger brother's account got compromised, the bank called him and directly got blocked. Total loss 0 Euro.</p>
<p>In the end think about it, how does a delay make any sense to begin with. We are able to trade trillions per day on a stock market at less then 10 ms, why wouldn't we be able to move a couple USD from A to B within a day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, um, what kind of fraud can you commit by transferring money between two of your own accounts?</p>
<p>And what kind of algorithms do these computers use to detect fraud that take days?</p>
<p>Sorry, but your explanation might hold water for making the transaction take seconds, or maybe a few minutes instead of nanoseconds. But days? Bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money laundering.</p>
<p>The algorithms have to track all the intermediary banks involved, and see if there’s actual an end result pattern or not. Fifty people transferring money into my account looks like a birthday. Fifty people transferring money between each other before giving it to me is sketchy as fuck. Remember those money laundering transfers aren’t all done on the same day, either, so the lag lets the software loop through as many things as possible and flag your account.</p>
<p>Mind you, I don’t think it’s the case. They invalidate transfers days after all the time. No, I think the real reason is that they get interest on your money, so the end of day reckoning keeps your money in a bank longer than in your account making you interest.</p>
<p>Day 1, you send me money. The bank takes the money out of your account immediately. End of day, the accounts are reckoned and balanced.</p>
<p>Day 2, your bank tells my bank it has money for me. They negotiate and check our recent transactions for shittery. End of Day, the money is in my bank and everything is reconciled. Your bank no longer earns interest on the money.</p>
<p>Day 3, I get my money. At some point, whenever. I get to start earning interest.</p>
<p>And you can clearly see this is bullshit. If they can take the money away from you immediately, then even an intrabank transfer should be fast. That it’s not is just banks wanting to have your money longer. The computers and programs are fast enough now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question was between your own accounts, not two different people between banks.</p>
<p>Also, even between banks, the rest of the world seems to manage just fine with instant transfers, with any issues being addressed after verification, as the vast majority of transactions are not fraudulent, and the ones that are can be detected and rectified after the fact.</p></div>		</li>
