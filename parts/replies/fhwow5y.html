			<div class="markdown"><p>As an interesting side note, Purell recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/27/business/fda-purell/index.html" target="_blank">got in trouble with the US FDA</a> because it was marketing its hand sanitizer as: “Kills more than 99.99% of most common germs that may cause illness in a healthcare setting, including MRSA &amp; VRE”; “demonstrated effectiveness against a drug resistant clinical strain of Candida auris in lab testing”; and “may be effective against viruses such as the Ebola virus, norovirus, and influenza.” The FDA told them that these sorts of claims make it seem like Purell is a drug, which is a much more tightly regulated category. So, the company has now stopped making claims relating to efficacy against specific bacteria or viruses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, they're different products. Avagard is 1% chlorhexidine and 61% ethanol formulated as a hand rub. Hibiclens is 4% chlorhexidine formulated as a soap.</p>
<p>There's also Peridex, which is 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash. (Do not confuse with Perid<em>o</em>x.)</p></div>		</li>
