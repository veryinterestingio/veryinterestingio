			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I think that Fermi's paradox in its framing assumes too much. It assumes that alien life would want to expand among stars, and that interstellar travel is practicable. There are so many things we don't know so I would not really call it a paradox. All we can say is that humans spreading around Earth does not appear to be a good analogy for what intelligent life in the universe may do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to expand on this question as well. Iâ€™ve heard a hypothesis that is along the lines of: intergalactic space travel is is not plausible/practical because if an object was going near light speed (or even a fraction of it), the particles and little bits of anything in space would collide with the spacecraft at that, or an even higher, velocity. This seems like the most plausible explanations to me. Are there any major flaws in this hypothesis?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is : near-light speed interstellar travel is absolutely not a premise to Fermi's paradox. Our galaxy is &quot;only&quot; 100k light-years wide, so even at 1% of the speed of light, an interstellar civilization would only need 10 millions years or so to explore the whole Galaxy with automated probes. We know that our galaxy is billions years old, so the probability that this have never happend is very low. Hence the Fermi's paradox. I recommend the book &quot;The Great Silence&quot; by Milan Circovic if you're interested in this field of study. Not an easy read, but it really clearly states why the Fermi's paradox is not easily solved (as this AMA's author seems to be suggesting the contrary) and classify all the known possible solutions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. You'd think that with a certain level of intelligence (like the level required to travel to other solar systems), they'd just stop having so many babies that they need to constantly find new planets to crowd into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! Can I subquestion this ? </p>
<p>Regarding the problem of alien life... what do you see as the problem? Specifically, do you think Fermi's Paradox is a paradox, or just 'a question to which we don't know the answer' ?</p></div>		</li>
