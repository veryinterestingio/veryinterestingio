			<div class="markdown"><p>The Primate Specialist Group is one of about 160 Specialist Groups of the Species Survival Commission of the IUCN.   We have about 700 members and are about to renew our membership for the next IUCN quadrennium.  I estimate that we will have at least 800 members this time around  We carry out a wide variety of activities, all of them aimed at maintaining the current diversity of the Order Primates and achieving our objective of zero extinctions.   We establish and maintain networks, produce five journals, four of them regional and one global, and all distributed free of charge.  We do periodic red-listing to establish the current conservation status of all primate species, and are just finishing up a five year reassessment of the entire Order Primates.  We use this information to develop action plans at regional, national and species-specific levels.  We assist in the creation of national and regional primate societies, the most recent being for Bolivia in South America and for all of Africa.   We produce a lot of educational materials and focus attention on getting primate conservation issues into the media, esp. through our biannual Top 25 Most Endangered Primate list.  And we have several funding mechanisms aimed at supporting primate conservation projects, especially those carried out by people from the habitat countries.</p></div>		</li>
