			<div class="markdown"><p>some ants evacuate during rain or they hide in deeper tunnels that remain dry. sometimes they are protected from water because there are little &quot;rooms&quot; or air bubbles in their tunnels that trap water and stop it from destroying everything. the top layer of the anthill may wash away but it's usually not too much damage. in a flood, fire ants can hold onto each other and create a weird, floating chain that lets them survive and relocate. </p>
