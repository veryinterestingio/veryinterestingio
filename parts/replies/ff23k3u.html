			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting experiment doing just that: participants were given what amounts to a PipBoy around their wrist. A number was flashed on a small screen followed immediately by everything around the number flashing and leaving the number dark. Do this fast enough and you can't see it at all. The flashes were set beyond the participants' normal 'frame rate' to make it invisible.</p>
<p>The researchers then changed the number, and since the display was going so fast, the participant couldn't see it. They then asked the participant to watch the screen as they were dropped down a SCAD tower. They would be in complete free fall with a net to catch them. Basically simulate a life or death situation (sort of) safely. <del>Participants consistently were able to read the new random number during the drop.</del></p>
<p>Edit: I was mistaken due to recalling this from a long time ago. The length of time that the participant perceived to be in freefall was extended, but did not see the numbers more clearly. This suggests a higher data storage rate than normal during times of stress, not accelerated perception.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract  </p>
<p>Observers commonly report that time seems to have moved in slow motion during a life-threatening event. It is unknown whether this is a function of increased time resolution during the event, or instead an illusion of remembering an emotionally salient event. Using a hand-held device to measure speed of visual perception, participants experienced free fall for 31 m before landing safely in a net. We found no evidence of increased temporal resolution, in apparent conflict with the fact that participants retrospectively estimated their own fall to last 36% longer than others' falls. The duration dilation during a frightening event, and the lack of concomitant increase in temporal resolution, indicate that subjective time is not a single entity that speeds or slows, but instead is composed of separable subcomponents. Our findings suggest that time-slowing is a function of recollection, not perception: a richer encoding of memory may cause a salient event to appear, retrospectively, as though it lasted longer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it looks that it's only the duration of the event in our apparent memory, and not boost in perception during the event...at least from this experiment.   </p>
<p>..unless you are talking about a different one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. We don’t perceive more.  Just recall more. </p>
<p>Likewise our perception of time doesn’t change as much as how much of it is memorable, worth recalling based on novel experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you seem to have knowledge about the topic, maybe you can answer my question. </p>
<p>When I haven't played fps shooters for a very long time, more than a year or so, and I start playing them again, everything appears to be moving too fast, and I feel I actually see only single frames. Only after a few hours the game appears to &quot;run smooth&quot; again and I start to see what's going on. I always took it as a &quot;ofc I have to get used to it again&quot; but could this actually be my brain learning to put me eyes into the high fps mode when playing shooters?</p>
<p>I've been wondering this for years and it would be awesome to have an explanation for it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, the post you're replying to is utter nonsense and the guy was apparently making it up on the spot. The perception of time is effected by a lot of things, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the 'frame rate' of our eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't record at a &quot;frame rate,&quot; but the experienced flow of time is definitely relative to the way your brain is taking in data. A framerate is the most comparable way of saying it without going into detail.</p></div>		</li>
