			<div class="markdown"><p>This range is also why doctors are often hesitant to make predictions. They don't want to say 'you will probably recover' or 'you aren't likely to walk again' because people get anchored to certain outcomes without properly evaluating likelihood. Most doctors I've met will avoid making predictions because they don't want to have patients and family later on being upset that the doctor was 'wrong' (even if they were statistically speaking right for this circumstance, but not for this individual).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much what I figured. You have to tell them the most likely negative outcome, so they can prepare and look after themselves.</p>
<p>If a doctor were to say &quot;you can't walk anymore BUT THERE'S A TINY CHANCE you will be ok&quot;. So the patient internally hopes that they will be better and will just wait it out until they're better... And when they're not, well damn now they're mad af at the doctor.</p></div>		</li>

If they think they canâ€™t, they likely wonâ€™t. Physical therapy, with a GOOD PT staff is crucial to any physical recovery for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was born with CHD and the doctors told my parents that with my condition I wouldnâ€™t live past the age of seven.</p>
<p>That messed with my parents so much that my mom had her tubes tied cause of the fear of possibly having another child with a CHD and then losing them at an early age.</p>
<p>Which I guess at the time was probably correct in most cases. In this case the doctorâ€™s prediction was wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had an aunt who recenltly had a massive stroke and had to go into an emergency surgery. The doctors gave her a very low chance of survival, but they gave it to my uncle in percentages. It was basically like:</p>
<p>We're going to do our best for her, but here is what you need to prepare yourself for based on our experience with similar cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>30% chance she doesn't make it out of surgery</li>
<li>20% chance she makes it out by ends up as a vegetable</li>
<li>30% chance she regain some semblene of a normal life but is diabled to one degree or another</li>
<li>20% chance she make a strong recovery but isn't quite right for the rest of her life</li>
<li>Very, very slim chance of a full recovery, but not impossible so hold out some hope</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure how common it is, but rather than making predictions they gave him the statistics in an easily digestible form. They did something similar for the outcomes when my grandfather had to go for some surgeries, although the outlook wasn't as grim. I know quite a few vetrinarians as well, and they are taught in school to give outcomes like that as well. Rather than making prediction, give them the statistics in an easy to understand way so the clients can make the best decision for them.</p>
<p>Also, for those wondering, she's in one of the last two bullet points. She's out of her induced coma, but is having a hard time forming new memories right now, but the doctors said that it is still too early to know if that will improve. Took almost 9 hours under the knife and 3 different surgents. Thank God for Canadian healthcare!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an haemmoraghic stroke, at twenty four. That happened four years ago. I lost my speech, expressive aphasia - meaning I couldn't speak or write English, but I could read and hear it.</p>
<p>I got all of my physical therapy in two years, I can walk, run and write with my right hand. But, talking is hard, and writing what comes into my head is so hard. I want to get better. But the speech therapists said it will take a lot more work - ten years - because you have to make new brain cells to get back to where you were. </p>
<p>And I get frustrated with myself all the time. But everyone thinks I am amazing and inspirational. I did what had to do, because I was twenty four and I have fifty more years in this world.</p>
<p>And I am glad for Australian healthcare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was going to say that. In my experience, doctors are often reluctant to provide predictions. People are bad at probability. They hear &quot;90% chance of surviving&quot; and don't realize how 1 in every 10 people dying is actually a really big number or they hear &quot;up to a year to live&quot; as &quot;1 year more of life&quot;.</p>
<p>That said, I think that just calls for a very carefully stated prediction. When my dad was in the hospital we just wanted any sense at all of what his chances were and it took a lot of time and persistence to get &quot;3 to 6 months&quot;. That was really helpful in planning for how to respond. He ended up passing right about at 3 months and so, while we didn't have all things in order, it was definitely something we were more braced for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, I had a very similar experience with my dad. I get why doctors are reluctant, but as a patient or family member it's absolutely infuriating. I wish I could take some sort of test to prove I understand probability and then be given straight answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example:
It even happens after death, FWIW. Many plane crashes, after investigation, are labelled as &quot;unsurvivable&quot;, even if there are survivors. Examples would be JAL123, NWA255. Both had survivors, but for all intents and purposes, should have died. </p>
<p>It seems ridiculous to give a &quot;likelihood to die&quot; retroactively, but it helps push change, research, testing, etc.  </p>
<p>For medical stuff, it helps in terms of how long it will take to recover, what injuries a non-survivable survivor of a particular crash would have, what trauma to treat first, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>JAL123 made it possible for UAL232 to  be survivable even though it was essentially the same problem - complete loss of hydraulic pressure. Amazingly a check airman (the guy who essentially evaluates the pilots) for the DC10 was on board, and he had practiced the exact scenario JAL123 had in a simulator to practice steering by alternating engine power. With his help they were able to get to a runway and land with 2/3rds of the passengers surviving despite the situation according to United Airlines being &quot;if you're in this scenario you're fucked and we can't help you&quot;.</p>
<p>Sadly the guy regretted losing those passengers he couldn't save because he blamed himself for letting the wing dip into the runway which ignited the fuel, even though I don't think any pilot ever replicated the landing in a simulator or even got close to doing as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As much as it sucked at the time, hearing it straight turned out to be a good thing. Mine wasn't as bad as lots of these people, but I was never going to walk/run/move normally after I was run over by a truck. At first when I couldn't I was more hard on myself, then mentally kind of accepted where I was which in the end allowed me to push harder and work more and eventually get some of this back. I can now walk (although with a bit of a limp on most days). I could run, it would cause serious pain but I can do it. That doctor being honest let me get in a much better head space to examine where I was at and not feel defeated every time I failed. So thanks from someone who has been on the other side, we may not appreciate it at the time but we damn sure do later in life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it mostly intuitive and based on experience or do you guys actually go back and crunch the numbers for the exact probabilities? I would assume the former because it seems relatively inconsequential, but am interested to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well as a current medical student, without the experience, we already have some vague notions of prognosis, because well-documented diseases have lots of established literature to pull from. So while I couldn't easily make predictions, I generally have knowledge on prognostic indicators, like if someone just found out they had cancer at stage 4, versus someone who we caught early due to screening. Or how behaviors contribute to prognosis etc. So based on what I've seen it's not quite intuition, though that's part of it, but just general knowledge on how diseases progress. Plus there are lots of scoring calculators which can estimate 5-10 year survival which get memorized as you use them more</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Experience thats based in science. So, you have this type of stroke and the issue is at a certain location in your brain and your neurologic exam looks like this ... well, the study of 2,000 people with similar problem say you have 40% chance of recovery. Thats the science part. But then I see that youre 90 years old, your lungs and heart were already bad ... now its like 5% chance. I dont have a study to tell me that 5%, so that part is more experience. Good question.</p></div>		</li>
