<p>dirt is usually a very good filter of particles and toxins so the ground water tends to be even cleaner then the surface water</p>

<p>So water in the dirt ... removes dirt from the water! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dirt is mostly sand. Once a little water goes through and the organic particles come out, it's just sand and some clay. It can only make a little water dirty with the particles stuck in it, after that it will have run out of &quot;dirty&quot; dirt and it will just be a really tight filtration system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Soil is made of very fine particles, and traps a lot of impurities so they don't go &quot;downstream&quot; in the aquifer.  Not everything, but surprisingly a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contamination of the groundwater by bacteria (normally because of human activity) can still be a concern with wells, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NVT6iZP2qg&amp;list=PLfkEG7-l23BEPVpk9utR0y7p_i0I6GMy5&amp;index=4" target="_blank">wouldn't be fully realized until the 1800s</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the Broad Street cholera outbreak does demonstrate how good the ground is at filtering water. The cespit and well were constructed very close to each other as were many other similar wells. However there were few problems with this until cracks formed allowing water to flow directly between these. Before these cracks formed the water draining from the cespit would have to flow a few feet down before going up again into the well which would be enough to filter out most of the bacteria making the water safe to drink. There are similar placements of sewage outlets and wells in some places even to this day. And even though the distance is a bit greater and the water is treated somewhat both before being released and after being pumped from the well it is very effective to filter the water by letting it flow through the ground for a bit.</p></div>		</li>
