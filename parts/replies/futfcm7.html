<p>Before the link between celiac and gluten was discovered the infant mortality rate of celiacs was 30 percent.</p>

<p>Where did you get that number from?</p>
<p>The overall infant mortality rate was 30% or higher for most of human history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Thanks for the question. I heard it on a podcast about the Dutch doctor (Dicke) who discovers the connection. I know it is not a great source but it’s listed on the Wikipedia page for coeliac disease.  It says that before the connection was made with gluten the infant mortality was above 35 percent — which is close to what I heard.  You can check the hyperlinks for the source.
Dicke noticed that during the famine of 1945 in the Netherlands his coeliac patients were getting healthier and theorizes it was wheat.  The connection to the gluten protein was not made until the mid 1950s.  So we can guess that the 30 percent ish infant mortality number is based on a number from either during or after WWII.</p>
<p>Good questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in 1940-1950 this would have been much higher than the general rate (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4838a2.htm" target="_blank">~3% in the US</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! You can just google coeliac and infertility and see the studies.  The first one that came of for me is the peer-reviewed study from 2011 “Unexplained Infertility as Primary Coeliac Presentation”.  The link is very well-documented in women.  I don’t know about in men but I’m sure a quick google search would tell you.
Thanks for the question.
Sorry I can’t provide hyperlinks, I’m on my phone and it’s crap :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's totally fine, I am just lazy. My mum is a coeliac and so far I and my sister are not, but we have both had fertility issues. I need to google for myself! Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit: from what little I know about biology and fertility I would very much doubt that coeliac disease affects male fertility. But I'll google that too because now I'm intrigued</p></div>		</li>
