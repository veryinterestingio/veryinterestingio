			<div class="markdown"><p>Alligator populations have steadied since being federally protected after unregulated hunting reduced their numbers throughout their range until the 1960s. Itâ€™s estimated that the current alligator range is similar to historical ideas and that alligator population numbers are around where they used to be, but alligators now face challenges from human encroachment and quality/availability of habitat that could threaten their success. In short, alligators have rebounded wonderfully and, for the time being, seem to have a healthy population that is similar or perhaps slightly higher to historical records.
To answer your other question, based on the definition of a dinosaur I would say yes we probably would refer to them as dinosaurs given that they are large reptiles that would have existed through the Mesozoic (originally appearing in the Triassic and hypothetically going extinct in the late Cretaceous).</p></div>		</li>
