			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. So if I do push on my head and use the gate theory, then does it cause any damage? Because I'm applying more pressure to something that already has too much pressure?</p>
<p>I don't know if that made sense... But... Yah</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not going to cause any harm, as long as you're not applying so much pressure you're rupturing your blood vessels or something lol. Either it's a tension headache, in which case the muscles on the outside of your skull are tight and rubbing them will help them relax and loosen up, or it's something like a migraine, where the increased pressure is happening on the inside of your skull and touching the outside won't affect it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I regret learning this a LOT, is there anything you can tell me that will make me feel a little less like my next migraine will kill me? ðŸ˜­</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your comment! When I have a migraine I will vigorously massage the muscles in my neck and get irritated when my head is still killing me. I didn't even think about the fact it's the muscles on the inside of my skull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 days a week is very frequent. If she's not faking it, has she been checked out? It could be environmental or dietary but it definitely sounds like something that should be looked at by a doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah been meaning to get her to a doctor. She has to be on a pretty strict food schedule  and the pressure changes from hot to cold  (and vice versa) trigger them.</p></div>		</li>
