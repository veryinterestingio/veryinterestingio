			<div class="markdown"><p>In short if the injury happened long before or long after death it is usually fairly easy to say for sure, if it's near the  same time it can be trickier. </p>
<p>As mentioned by u/mootec18 in another response to your comment  that would probably be described as peri-mortem which can mean either &quot;at/around time of death&quot; or &quot;we can't say with 100% certainty when it occurred&quot;</p>
<p>Injuries that are not directly the cause of death or happen unrelated to but near the time of death can complicate the findings which is why you would typically want to look for multiple supporting clues. Imagine something like a major fall where the person cracks their skull, but would have survived if not for the  actual cause of death - blood loss from falling on something sharp or  they were involved in a car accident yesterday, but cause of death was a heart attack today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No signs of healing, but because the bone is surrounded by tissue and not dried out it will fracture differently than old, dry bone. Like green wood instead of dry wood.</p>
<p>Other signs of how recent the break was are things like colour and edge condition.</p>
<p>Soil will stain bone, but it takes a long time for that stain to reach the center of the bone. If the break is new, you'll often see that the center of the break is a lighter colour than the outside.</p>
<p>Edge condition means how sharp or dull the edge of the break is. You can think about it a little like river rocks. If the break is new, edges are sharp. Older breaks will have softer, duller edges, but no regrowth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would like to add as an archaeologist:</p>
<p>In the archaeological context, the color from the dirt tends to leach into the bones.  So if a break happened perimortem (around death) or around the time of burial, it will be the same color as the outside of the bone.  If the break is more recent (like during excavation) the color will not have seeped in, and the break will be white/off-white</p></div>		</li>
