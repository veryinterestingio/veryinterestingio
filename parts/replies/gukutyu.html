			<div class="markdown"><p>I concur with this as I'd always wake up on the off ramp. The deceleration and change in noise is my theory. </p>
<p>I used to be the main driver for our group of friends when we used to drive to parties in Europe from the UK. I'd drive for far too long at a time and as a (kind of) joke would drive on the rumble strip on the hard shoulder and tell the crew that if they hear that noise, then please wake me up..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I once invented an.. extremely annoying alarm clock. It took me about 2 weeks to learn to wake up 5 minutes before it went off to turn it off just so I wouldn't have to listen to it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think, its because of our subconscious mind. It's still working even when our conscious part of the mind is &quot;sleeping&quot;. There is lot more to our mind than we know. I think our subconscious is constantly analyzing the sensory inputs even when we sleep. Its just like someone waking you up in a way. Its just that input is different in the case of you magically waking up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always heard it that way, that the subconscious is kinda like another person, and heavy sleepers just have one that chooses not to wake the main conscious up when stimuli is happening, and only under specific circumstances. Like how you wake up to your name</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>any process that you aren't conscious of doing is subconscious... there's nothing really special about it, nor is there a subconscious mind.</p>
<p>your brain just has processes that don't require you to be conscious of them... such as recognizing people's faces and being able to attach names to them. </p>
<p>yes, you can do it consciously, as in, ”she has a big nose and red eyebrows, who do i know who has a big nose and red eyebrows... could be sara, could be jolie, but jolie is in france, so it must be sara”... but most people's brains do it automatically... subconsciously.</p>
<p>unless you are face-blind (have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia" target="_blank">prosopagnosia</a>) like me, then your brain doesn't do it subconsciously and humans pretty much all look the same if i'm just looking at their faces. i <em>can</em> recognize people by their faces <em>consciously</em>, but only if i have memorized the faces in question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I retired, I had to do a weekly Ctrl-Alt-Del, at least once a week. You know, to stop those subroutines locked in futile death spirals, endless loops...</p>
<p>Alcohol is pretty good for these soft reboots, but sometimes I needed to do a hard reboot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do believe there's a subconscious mind though, as we can do so many complex things without being conscious of it, more than basic body-functions, like when you're walking a familiar path, you can completely doze off in your thoughts and then you suddenly realize you're at your destination, having crossed roads at stoplights, taking stairs, and whatnot. Everything was done automatically, kind of like an autopilot.</p>
<p>If some stranger suddenly talks to me when I'm on autopilot, I'm often extremely confused as I was not aware of my surroundings a second ago.<br />
Same thing when I'm immersed in a book. I can even doze off during a conversation, and I would reply with &quot;mmh-mh, is that so?&quot; and nods and look into his eyes, acting like I'm actually listening and only later realize I was actually not listening at all.<br />
Another example is that when one is sufficiently proficient at playing an instrument, and very familiar with a piece, he can play it without any conscious effort, and have a conversation at the same time.</p>
<p>So our subconscious can handle GPS guiding, handling traffic lights and stairs, social interactions and even play an instrument on full auto-pilot.</p></div>		</li>
