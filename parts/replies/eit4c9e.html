			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a strong and interesting point. I think there was a paper that showed that classical mechanics could reproduce all tree-level results in QED, and field quantization was only relevant when loops became involved -- if you know what I mean, do you remember the authors? I'd love to read more about this...</p>
<p>This is not even covered in many graduate particle theory courses (at least not the ones we experimentalists generally take). Yes, we do cover QCD and QED in detail, but we don't show how exactly our results differ from the classical results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about a paper, but it’s pretty well-known that tree diagrams are equivalent to classical scattering, see (probably) any QFT textbook, say Nair.
