			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to Tijmen's comment, there are several very compelling pieces of evidence for dark matter besides galaxy rotation curves, most notably explaining the wiggles in the distribution of fluctuations in the CMB, the rate of growth of structure throughout the lifetime of the universe, and gravitational lensing to name a few. The end result is that it is very difficult for any modification to gravity to explain all of these things <em>without also invoking extra matter</em>. </p>
<p>Looking for modifications to gravity is an active field of research (in fact my current project is looking at how we could detect this), but if it turns out that GR isn't the right theory of gravity on cosmic scale it would be very tricky to do away with dark matter entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of smart people working on this, but in my opinion and the opinion of at least 90% of cosmologists, MOND (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics) fails. For example, it does not explain the patterns we see in the cosmic microwave background.</p>
<p>A very convincing demonstration of dark matter is the Bullet cluster. Take a look at:<br />

Two galaxy clusters have crashed into each other. The matter (mostly hot plasma) has undergone some drag and is shown in red. The total mass however, shown in blue, passed right through each other. Whatever it is, we can't see it and therefore call it dark matter!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the ways we are making progress in science is through disagreement and exploration of alternative ideas. </p>
<p>While we may currently be able to describe the galaxy rotation curves by models that modify Newtonian gravity, this description fails when we consider cosmological observations of the cosmic microwave background or large-scale structure of the universe (e.g. the distribution of galaxies in the universe). These observations are best described within General Relativity with dark matter. In fact, I think, the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background provide the best evidence for dark matter.</p></div>		</li>
