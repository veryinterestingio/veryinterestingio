			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the late response. This was a long question and we wanted to give you the answer you deserved!</p>
<p>To start with the first part of your question: the maturity of neural interface technology...</p>
<p>The HARDWARE for brain-computer interfaces is pretty well-established. No doubt you'll have seen videos like this one (<a href="https://youtu.be/7t84lGE5TXA" target="_blank"><a href="https://youtu.be/7t84lGE5TXA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/7t84lGE5TXA</a></a>) where someone is wearing a flexible cap with electrodes. This is a good way to non-invasively capture electrical signals from within the brain, and gives us enough information to translate basic thought patterns into relatively simple computer commands such as move a cursor (<a href="https://www.medgadget.com/2018/01/brain-computer-interface-lets-users-learn-move-cursor-seconds.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.medgadget.com/2018/01/brain-computer-interface-lets-users-learn-move-cursor-seconds.html" target="_blank">https://www.medgadget.com/2018/01/brain-computer-interface-lets-users-learn-move-cursor-seconds.html</a></a>) or control a robotic arm (<a href="https://www.medgadget.com/2016/12/non-invasive-brain-computer-interface-complex-control-robotic-arm.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.medgadget.com/2016/12/non-invasive-brain-computer-interface-complex-control-robotic-arm.html" target="_blank">https://www.medgadget.com/2016/12/non-invasive-brain-computer-interface-complex-control-robotic-arm.html</a></a>).</p>
<p>Note: there are also invasive neural interface technologies, such as deep brain stimulation where an electrode is implanted directly into the brain, but we will consider these at out of scope here because they tend to be used for therapeutic purposes, such as for Parkinson's Disease. (<a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/deep-brain-stimulation" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/deep-brain-stimulation" target="_blank">https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/deep-brain-stimulation</a></a>)</p>
<p>As is often the case with these things(!), the limiting factor is the SOFTWARE. In other words, physically picking up the signals is not the difficulty, it's processing them. The brain is clearly a highly complex entity and therefore difficult to model, so you have the challenge of how to make sense of the neural signals received, but also the processing / response time is a factor as you correctly identify, particularly for real-time control of things.</p>
<p>So, coming to the quantum computing aspect...</p>
<p>To avoid getting into a lengthy technical discussion here of the workings of quantum computers, you may want to take a look at these links to find out more background:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/learn/what-is-quantum-computing/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/learn/what-is-quantum-computing/" target="_blank">https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/learn/what-is-quantum-computing/</a></a>  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit</a></a>  </p>
<p>The main point is that quantum computers are (or will be) much faster than¬†'conventional' computers solving problems where lots of (independent) input values can be tried in parallel.</p>
<p>This is because a register of 'qubits' in a quantum computer can represent every possible value at the same time - it exists in a 'superposition' of states - so for example, a quantum byte (8 quantum bits) represents a superposition of all values between 0 and 255 (=2\^8-1). Each 'qubit' (or quantum bit) holds a superposition of 0 and 1 (as opposed to just plain old '0' or '1' as in a traditional bit), i.e. a probability of being 0 and a probability of being 1.</p>
<p>So performing a mathematical operation on a set of quantum bits effectively performs the operation on all possible values represented by those bits at the same time. So if I took my quantum byte and, say, doubled it, I'd get a superposition of all values between 0 and 511 (OK, you need an extra bit for the higher numbers but you get the idea hopefully).</p>
<p>Hopefully, this makes it a bit clearer how a quantum computer can speed things up. But the crucial point is, all these mathematical operations have to happen in PARALLEL. (Superposition of inputs) ==&gt; (Superposition of outputs).</p>
<p>A quantum computer can't speed up operations that have to happen in SERIES. (Value 1) ==&gt; (Value 2) ==&gt; (Value 3). Or at least, we're not aware of a quantum technique to do this. Ultimately, this comes down to the speed of your processor to execute the instructions in your software! Of course, you could derive a speed benefit by having some of the intermediate values as possible inputs in your quantum register, but the principle stands.</p>
<p>To answer your question then: whether a quantum computer can speed up a neural interface will come down to the design of the algorithm that interprets the neural signals. The ideal model would be an exact replica of the human brain in computer form, in which case hardware parallelisation / acceleration (for example with multi-core processing, GPU or FPGA) would give a huge benefit, because each neuron can be modelled as its own small logic circuit or software routine, just like it is in the brain.</p>
<p>And finally to safety...</p>
<p>Nature has a good article on the ethics of brain-computer interfaces. Take a look:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02214-2" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02214-2" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02214-2</a></a>  </p>
<p>In terms of implants, we would say that we've been doing that for years now into various parts of the body and seem to have got the hang of it. Pacemakers, cochlear implants, insulin pumps... These are all very common now and are regarded as safe. They even have wireless interfaces just like a brain-computer interface would need!¬†<a href="https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/direct-pacemaker-monitoring-via-smartphone-enables-high-rates-of-transmission-success/" target="_blank"><a href="https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/direct-pacemaker-monitoring-via-smartphone-enables-high-rates-of-transmission-success/" target="_blank">https://consultqd.clevelandclinic.org/direct-pacemaker-monitoring-via-smartphone-enables-high-rates-of-transmission-success/</a></a></p>
<p>A neural implant would be no different - a small electronic device implanted in the brain with a wireless interface. Physical safety is not a problem, we think that the area that will need more attention in the coming years is that of information security and privacy. </p>
