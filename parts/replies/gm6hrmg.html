I never really considered the significant lack of member presence that I'm assuming most unions have after the initial signing, despite having been a 16yo working as a bagger/grocery stocker (&quot;logistics&quot;) that thankfully never had the need to reach out to our union rep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this great answer:</p>
<p>Unions, or at least vaguely decent ones, also provide effective legal representation for any legal/contract/working condition disputes an employee might have with their employer. IMO this is huge, as an employees rights are only as strong as their ability to fully understand and fight for them. Private legal representation would be totally inaccessible to most “blue collar” workers as engaging a lawyer for a legal battle would bankrupt many people.</p>
<p>Over on r/legaladvice one of the most common themes is <em>“my employer is changing my contract terms/cutting my benefits/changing my hours to XYZ/firing me for [protected class]/moving my job to another state/etc etc”</em> and without real access to a lawyer the end result is “you can try do XYZ in response, but be prepared for them to sack you for some bullshit in a few weeks”. If they were in a union they’d just call their union rep and promptly have a very angry lawyer in their managers office asking why the employer is breaching contract/breaking the law.</p></div>		</li>
