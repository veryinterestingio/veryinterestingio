			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. This drives me insane in my field (vet med). </p>
<p>&quot;The vet said she was old and had NO CHANCE and we should euthanize, but she pulled through and lived another (6 months, year, etc).&quot;</p>
<p>No. Your vet very likely told you your pet had a very guarded prognosis and that euthanasia was one of several options available. We never pretend to know what is going to happen, because medicine likes to laugh at that. People want numbers desperately and then they immediately misinterpret them when given. It's very, very frustrating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes all the medical terminology, coupled with the shock and confusion of being shown stuff you don't know how to read (Most people don't know off the top of their heads what is and isn't &quot;normal&quot; in an MRI scan) can make it super hard to retain information.</p>
<p>Some people just don't listen. But it's rather easy to be overwhelmed, particularly with stressful situations like having a loved one in the hospital etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so true.  I'm in software, not medicine, but I'm the medical information dump for my family.  Several of my family members can't even identify the correct part of the body:  'brain surgery' which was carotid artery surgery, a lung tumor which was located in the right atrium of the heart, and a mysterious concussion which manifested as a sprained ankle.  </p>
<p>Anymore, the family waits until I fly out there and talk to the medical staff to tell them what's what.  I swear they hear the first three words out of a Dr's mouth (&quot;Hi, I'm Dr...) and the rest is like adults talking in a Peanuts cartoon.  I sometimes joke about what will happen if I get hit by a bus someday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God that must get so old. My vet gave us all the options and told us what the mean survival for hemangiosarcoma was with treatment. Euthanasia was an option because surgery and chemo expensive and it still kills fast. We did treatment and our dog was 3 days short of the median (totally worth it and I appreciated the vets honesty). The Facebook group for people with hemangio dogs is absolutely insane with people laying onto vets that ‚Äúwanted to kill their dog‚Äù and blaming their vet for not having faith in their dog. They hang onto the few 1+ years success stories while dogs are dying in a matter of weeks left and right. I can‚Äôt imagine having to deal with those people IRL.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was just discussing with some vet friends of mine how much we hate hemangiosarcoma... legitimately one of my least favourite emergencies. It usually strikes so suddenly, you have to commit to expensive, risky surgery out of nowhere to get a diagnosis (vs. euthanasia), and the prognosis even with everything we can throw at them is so crappy. With so many other cancers you at least get time to spoil the pups after an initial diagnosis. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(vet here) - that's exactly the disease I think of when people talk about mean survival time and whether you can predict things; probably because it is such an acute diagnosis most of the time, we're heavily relying on relaying these statistics to help folks make decisions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I always try to explain what mean survival time (MST) means (only because I'd heard it so well explained by another vet before!). But, in some of these situations, even the MST can be 'biased' because some of these statistics either include or exclude folks who immediately euthanized or whose dog died before they could be stabilized (so if you include everyone  who died almost immediately, the MST is way shorter. If you exclude it, it won't give the most realistic expectation because *lots* of dogs can't even get stabilized for surgery). And, that veterinary MST is different than what we hear from human doctors *because* we have the option to euthanize (it's not that the disease will kill a dog in 6 months - it's that half of pet owners have chosen to euthanize by 6 months).   </p>
<p>Ultimately, in a crisis, people process what they can. We can explain it clearly and still have folks think we gave them a guarantee (whether terrible or great). Some people retain  information and process bad news really well, and some of us don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, the problem with stats like this is they only provide a single median point and no indication of range or distribution shape.</p>
<p>But if the doc said ‚Äúpeople with this diagnosis tend to live between 6 months and 15 years, with a median of 3 years. But if they make it to 5 years they almost always exceed 10 years‚Äù, then it‚Äôs a very different picture.</p>
<p>Also these stats typically describe a large population and hence have very little prognostic value at the individual level (except perhaps to put a limit on what becomes statistically unlikely). The stats reflect a continuous distribution whereas the patient outcome is discrete - you can‚Äôt be ‚Äú90% dead‚Äù in 5 years, you‚Äôre either going to be alive or you‚Äôre not (ignoring quality-of-life issues).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>distribution shape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really important part. We get so used to basically linear or normal distributions, and start to assume that is just how statistics work. But there are plenty of cases with very different curves. </p>
<p>A classic example is historical life expectancy. Back before modern medicine, you might see an average life expectancy of 30, and assume it would be very rare to live to 60 or 70. But in reality, if you made it to adulthood, you would have a reasonably good chance of living that long. The reason the average was low was that so many kids died in infancy or from childhood disease, that it dramatically dragged down the average. As you made it through childhood, your life expectancy actually went up!</p>
<p>Likewise, if you have an illness with an average life expectancy of 2 years, it may mean that by year 3 or 4 you made it through the illness, and wont die of it at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People don't understand simple statistics, let alone the nuance of uncertainties or confidence intervals. If you gave most patients exactly the prognosis you described, what they would hear is &quot;people live up to 15 years&quot; and then you would constantly be dealing with angry patients when their family member dies much closer to the median 3 years. If patients live as long as 15 years with this disease, why did this person only live 2 years? You must be a terrible doctor.</p>
<p>I can't imagine it makes a lot of sense to spend much time on a &quot;best case scenario&quot; that has exceedingly low probabilities of happening rather than focusing people on the realistic median/mean value and then just being happy if people exceed that.</p></div>		</li>
