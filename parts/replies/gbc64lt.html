			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this - our brain is constantly bombarded by information from our body such as sensory information that includes vibration, touch, temperature, hearing, vision etc. Because we have so much of this information coming in, our bodies look at it and go &quot;is this information relevant to my survival?&quot; if not, then &quot;lets ignore&quot;. For example, you usually don't feel your clothing on your skin (except now you may because I mentioned it). This process is called &quot;habituation&quot;. When you see an insect, or a creature, your body goes &quot;maybe this information is relevant because there are dangers nearby&quot; so our brain becomes more consciously aware of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And stress makes you pay more attention to all these sensory stimulus, that's why long term stress can be so exhausting. There a theory that tinnitus is when people pay more attention to sounds that most people block out. The fact they can hear it results in more stress causing a feedback loop. I'm not a medical professional.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's like my ears get blown out from loud noise except its not loud noise it's like if I'm talking on the phone. The voice triggers like when you yawn and things get muted? Like it's constantly dipping in and out.</p>
<p>Anyone get that or know what it is so I can look it up?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Damn. I wish I couldn't feel clothing on my skin. I typically wear as little clothing as I can get away with, cause I don't particularly like the feeling of clothes in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the fact! It reminded me how ant is &quot;formiga&quot; in Portuguese so could definitely be related. I love etymology and will check. (Hormiga in Spanish)
u/SFloridian caught your excitement with a new word which I felt too :) here's another or two</p>
<p>Edit: etymology for formiga- comes from the Latin <em>formica</em> which is used for ants. Also where formication comes from. Thanks again, friend :D</p></div>		</li>
