			<div class="markdown"><p>My university is supposed to be a green university, but there was recently some data released that 97% of the recycling at our student center food court is contaminated because people don't know what they can and can't recycle. It's gotten to the point where it's cheaper to just throw the recycling with the trash because it costs more to think something is recycling and then transport it and discover it's trash.</p>
<p>And yes, at least in a food court (but in many other scenarios) contaminated recycling can't just be sorted out. It's often all trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This a pet peeve of mine, recycling in food courts is extremely hard.  They usually have 1 recycling bin for cans, 1 for everything else, a compost and a tiny slot for garbage, but unlike at home, you don't have a sink so you can't rinse your recyclables... and scraping your compost off of your non compostables is messy.</p>
<p>A few large food courts have people you hand your trays too and they do all of this, but it's rare.</p></div>		</li>

I think it’s part of the airport’s green initiative because they implemented a lot of new things recently and even all the food places compete in a “food waste war”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some rural areas of Oregon where I live are asking the state to let them end curbside recycling because China (the major buyer of our recyclables) has slowed their buying because of contamination, and that's after the most contaminated recycling goes to the landfill. So even much of what was being bought by China was contaminated too! But Chinese environmental regulations were lax enough to make it profitable. Now that China has (slightly) raised their standards, it seems like most household recycling is contaminated (and mostly by food which can't be solved by sorting the goods). We're a state with a long history of recycling where people take pride in doing it and we still can't do it right!</p></div>		</li>
