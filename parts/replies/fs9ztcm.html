I thought it was going to be magnetism or some sort of positive/negative ionization effect, but I guess it's just low tech being used in a super clever way.  Still cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought there was one magical item in this universe which was these blade less fans, like just looking at this awe inspiring objects at work shook me to the core. Like I didn’t even think how they work, I just thought it was like magic. This guy that explained how these fans work so well is like your parents telling you Santa isn’t real when you’re 4. Like the one magic/unexplainable thing in my life I had left were those mysterious dyson fans. To say I’m slightly disappointed is like that feeling right after you find your dad eating those cookies for Santa</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how much you care about the silence.  As fans, they are less effective and more expensive at moving air then a traditional fan, but a lot quieter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I've found the opposite (in relation to the noise). They're significantly louder than most fans because there's a <em>very</em> noticeable electronic whirring from the motor and whooshing from the air being forced through the slits. The amount of air moved also feels significantly decreased when compared to similarly sized conventional fans. </p>
<p>I've used multiple types of bladeless fans from Dyson and they all have the same issues. Even on the lowest setting they make significantly more noise and move less air than most conventional fans. As it stands, I don't use mine unless my other fans aren't doing enough. </p>
<p>Just for reference: I wasn't the one who paid for them. I don't have any buyer's remorse and have no reason to try and convince myself they're any better than they are. I think my opinions are pretty unbiased. At this point they're mostly sitting around gathering dust while conventional fans do the same work with significantly less noise, which is a shame because the person who paid for them shelled out quite a bit of money. </p>
<p>TL;DR - I don't like bladeless fans</p></div>		</li>
