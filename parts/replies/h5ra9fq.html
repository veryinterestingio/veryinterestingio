			<div class="markdown"><p>No one suggests it's atmosphere-like gas all the way to the core.</p>
<p>We know how gasses behave at temperature and pressure. We know how much pressure the atmosphere we can detect would react under the pressure it must be under for the size of the planet. We can then extrapolate the properties from there.</p>
<p>It's like those puzzles that give disparate clues; susie wears a green dress, frank is to the left of susie, jeff is not sitting next to someone wearing green. You have a bunch of readings, and only so many theories fit all the information we have. </p>
<p>A rocky planet like ours with a massive atmosphere doesn't fit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it's an open question whether gas giants and ice giants have rocky cores. We definitely know there's some liquid in there though. Specifically hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it depends what your definition of land is, but gas giants have solid cores if that what you mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't.</p>
<p>Most accepted theory is there is land sunk under a thick ocean of hot liquid hydrogen.</p>
<p>But it's also possible the land was eaten by the strong currents, and then there is only an ocean without solid core.</p></div>		</li>
