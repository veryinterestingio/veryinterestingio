<p>I asked my uncle (who was multi-lingual) what language he thought in, he didn't understand and sounded like he didn't have an inner monologue.</p></div>		</li>

Basically not everyone can picture things in their head. It's a &quot;relativly&quot; New discovery.
Here's a short articles on that.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course there is. The term is called aphantasia, and only 3 percent of people experience it. So there is a norm, and being able to see images in your mind is it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're absolutely correct! </p>
<p>The brain <strong>always</strong> thinks in images. That's the only way it knows how to think. Words are just symbols, which are just images too.</p>
<p>Comparative studies have been done on literate and illiterate people, and language seems to change the structures of our thoughts.</p>
<p>Literate people would for example group a saw, a hammer, a log and an axe into two groups: tools and material.</p>
<p>Illiterate people would rather group axe, saw and log into one group and hammer into a second group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can I get better at thinking this way? I am awful at it. I definitely <em>can</em> think in images/symbols, but it's so far from my default is frustrating. Any new thought I have comes as words. Even when counting in my head I have to think the numbers and that makes me slow down because I'm literally going through every syllable like &quot;twenty-seven, twenty-eight...&quot;</p></div>		</li>
