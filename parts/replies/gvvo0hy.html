			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a UC flare up a little while ago and the nausea got bad enough I couldn't even keep down ice chips. two days later the doc sent me off the to the urgent care clinic for 2 liters of IV saline and i was back home 2 hours later.</p>
<p>100 years ago i would just be dead. If i lived in a poor country I would probably be dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a side note, it's easy to see why people thought that &quot;the gods&quot; would strike people down. A seemingly healthy person is just walking along when he suddenly collapses dead. Why did he die? You don't know anything about heart attacks and what causes them, so it just seems like some divine judgement that kills &quot;random&quot; people at &quot;random&quot; times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying that this thought process hasn't happened before or is even rare, but I think to suggest that it was just the norm might not be giving people enough credit. Chest pain is a symptom of a heart attack. I would bet that many people would walk away from witnessing an apparent heart attack, like with symptoms such as sudden weakness and clutching of the chest, that sort of thing, saying &quot;I think his heart gave out&quot; or something similar.</p>
<p>I just don't think it's fair to say &quot;they all thought that god would just smite people&quot; as though no further thought was put into anything, and that only with our deep modern wisdom do we know the real truth they could never guess at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think heart attack was a bad example above because it is highly associated with your age or condition [a fat person would not feel the same under heavy exercise in the week previous to his/her scare], but a virus or bacteria killing you within days might be more like a punishment from God.</p></div>		</li>
