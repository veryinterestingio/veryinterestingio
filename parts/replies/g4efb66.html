			<div class="markdown"><p>When the fires are from accident, usually they are going by elimination until one possibility is left. A friend of mine had a house fire due to next door neighbor (split house).</p>
<p>When he received the report (for insurance claims purpose) the results stated that it was a cigarette from the neighbor that ended up in a sawdust pile next to the deck outside. He read the report deeper, and they had no outstanding evidence that this is what caused it, but they ruled everything else. They found that the fire started outside next to the wooden deck. According to the report, the fire started where there was no electrical wire. The sun was on the other side of the house at this time of day, so no possible lens effect from a glass debris. Also, no trace of fuel or foul play was found. They interviewed the neighbor and found out that the neighbor smokes a lot, and always smoked outside. It was very dry these days. Also, the neighbor did some repair on his fence and use his saw a lot next to his deck. So the only probable cause left was a cigarette butt thrown by mistake in a very dry sawdust pile on a windy day.</p></div>		</li>
