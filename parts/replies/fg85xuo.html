			<div class="markdown"><p>Rice is more common to the south the Yangtze valley--the original Chinese civilization in the Yellow River valley depended more on millet and wheat. It didn't really expand into the major rice growing regions until the Warring States period, and the area was still pretty much considered a backwater with a far smaller population than the North until at least the Tang dynasty. It was more a matter of fertile soil and flood engineering than rice cultivation.</p></div>		</li>
