			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s getting a little beyond my knowledge, but I can think of a couple possibilities. I do know there are atmospheric chemists who study the formation and if hazes and smogs and how to identify their individual chemical constituents from Earth. It’s certainly possible that if an exoplanet’s atmosphere were sufficiently smoky, we could tell and identify aerosolized carbon residues. I can’t really speak to the minimum detectable levels though. </p>
<p>The other thing that is, mind-blowingly, actually possible is seeing fires themselves if they get large enough (say continent-scale, as May have happened in the Carboniferous). We can already tell if a planet has an ocean by the way light scatters toward us off the water when the planet is between us and its host star. Likewise, we should be able to identify whether a distant planet is covered in vegetation by the way chlorophyll’s light absorbance changes from very high in wavelengths used for photosynthesis to nearly transparent in the infrared spectrum. This of course assumes photosynthesis could evolve independently on another planet to use the same wavelengths it does here on Earth—a fairly large assumption, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my understanding of the state of telescope development makes me think a sufficiently large wildfire could be identified even on very distant planets within our lifetimes.</p></div>		</li>
