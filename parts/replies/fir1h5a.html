			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct but one more detail is some tables will offer insurance bets <a href="https://www.onlinegambling.com/casino/blackjack/insurance-bet/" target="_blank">https://www.onlinegambling.com/casino/blackjack/insurance-bet/</a></p>
<p>From that page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless you’re counting cards in a real-life casino, you should never wager money on insurance in blackjack. All it takes is a quick look at the math behind the bet to see that statistically it’s going to lose you money in the long run.</p>
<p>The odds against the dealing making a blackjack are roughly 9 to 4. On average you will lose more than half of the insurance bets you make and since the bet pays out 2 to 1, it’s a losing proposition.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add-on to this: If you have blackjack and the dealer offers “even money,” this is buying insurance. Same bad bet, but lots of people take it because “it’s the only guaranteed win at the casino.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus if the dealer does have black jack and you buy insurance, you lose the original bet but win 2 to 1 on insurance which is half your original bet, so all you do is push. If the dealer doesn’t have it then you still have to win the hand and you lose your insurance. NEVER buy insurance and you will be a winner as far as that bet goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the player gets natural BJ, they win automatically, unless the dealer has natural BJ, in which case they push.</p>
<p>The dealer cannot catch up to the player by obtaining 21 once the player has natural BJ. </p>
<p>So the rules are the same for dealer and player.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Odds for blackjack are functionally about 50/50 <em>if</em> you play correctly. If you count cards you can make it so that you have a slightly better than 50/50 chance of breaking even money wise. </p>
<p>Counting cards won’t make you rich though unless you have massive capital and a dumb casino that doesn’t catch you. More and more casinos have continuous card shufflers which makes counting cards impossible anyways.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. 5-6 deck stacks that they reshuffle half way through. Counting cards is basically dead.</p>
<p>The closest thing you can do now is sit at the last spot and debate whether a 10 or small number is due based on other players hit cards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I’ve worked for the casino. They do watch players that are adjusting their bet sizings drastically. Obviously you need to be playing large enough for them to care: guy I saw was going from 100/hand to 5,000/hand when he thought the deck was hot.</p>
<p>They use software to evaluate how well you are counting. 99% of people can’t even get the count close enough to give them 50/50 nor can they remember strategy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This simply isn't true. There are plenty of double deck and single deck games on the strip and automatic shuffling machines are obviously not at every table. The thing to realize about card counters is this: they still make the casino money even if they beat the house at blackjack. Card counters get comped and spend more than enough money at the hotel shops, restaurants, etc. to justify not shutting them down completely. The counting game is alive and well, but I hesitate to discount your eulogy since it only makes the game more profitable for counters . . .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You alter your play based on what's still in the deck. Very easy to spot.  You and the spotters know if it's a rich deck, ie lots of 10s and Aces left.  When you up your bet on a rich, and drop it for the poor, they got you.</p></div>		</li>
