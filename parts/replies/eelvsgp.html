			<div class="markdown"><p>This theory is often the correct response when people suggest that war is a great way to promote economic growth. Their idea being that if we go into total war again like during world war 2 and the majority of the economy is converted to producing war materials and millions of people are employed in the military then the nation will experience significant economic growth.</p>
<p>They are right in the way that breaking the window makes the glazier money. War is a net negative to economic development because the goods being produced are then destroyed and used to destroy other investments and labour. There may suddenly be extremely low unemployment but at the end of the war you have a significantly reduced workforce, high number of disabled citizens, factories that are set up to only produce war materials and huge government debts. Huge amounts of cleanup, rehabilitation and negotiations take place to get the world back to a peaceful and productive place. Some areas that saw combat may never recover and have their natural resources completely destroyed.</p>
<p>It looks great when looking at the historic development of the United States and what their war machine was able to create, but for Europe, Asia and Africa the second world war set them back decades because of the amount of property that was destroyed and people that were lost with very little benefit in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

I was reading this thread baffled that this would be a fallacy common enough to be worth naming, but I definitely have heard people (jokingly or not) suggest another World War for the sake of the economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It more generally applies to proposals that the government do something to &quot;create jobs&quot; - since whatever money the government used to do that would have been used by whoever it was taxed or borrowed from in the first place to either make an investment or buy something. This isn't to say the government's spending or investment might not be more useful in the long run (as it would be when defending the nation in a war for example) - it's just arguing that it doesn't really create new jobs.</p>
<p>And reality is more complicated - not just because of political pressures but because many people deciding to save rather than consume at the same time can have a depressive effect on the economy (and they usually do that when the economy is already depressed for some reason).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number of people I've seen espouse the idea that if we go into a recession we should just declare war to speed things up again is ridiculous and terrifying. War will not make us a strong economy. It will make the people who own military corporations very rich but the average person will either suffer from dying, losing a loved one or having to care for a loved one who was injured, or will get a semi stable job welding missile casings. There isn't much being generated for the average person, just a lot of money moving around while we make things for the purpose of destroying things and people in order to rob other countries of their land and resources. The only way war is a net benefit is if you can pillage more value than you lost, and that means actually destroying other country's economies around the world. Doing so would disrupt our own economy as trade has become so global that it would be a net negative in losing a trading partner. The whole idea is silly but it got us out of the depression so it must be good!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the stimulated technological development? R&amp;D from the bedrock of economic growth and war certainly drives increased investment into that as well. Technology advancement eventually benefits everyone long term as well.</p>
<p>Sure from the point of economies being perfectly efficient war or any disruption is bad, but ignoring irrational behavior, politics, etc is not a good basis for economics to reflect, predict and advance reality</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Research and development in times of war is great, but that same research could've been used more efficiently for the purpose that benefits everyone. War just stimulates the feeling of urgency, so people are more willing to spend on R&amp;D to get the competitive edge. Historically this was used for the development of materials like rubber for boots, aircraft for air superiority, and radar for missile detection. All of these things could've been developed more efficiently for their current purposes had anyone felt the urgency to do so, but it feels more urgent to develop radar when you're anticipating an aerial attack overnight versus trying to improve passenger aircraft safety on the day to day. It seems like military R&amp;D was an extremely efficient exercise when really it was just that we were focused on it to be the winning army so we fast tracked all sorts of development that should've and easily could've been happening anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. The WW2 example also ignores the immense amount of rationing on all other goods because so much of the economy and workforce was devoted to making war materials. Research the “Food Rationing Program” started in the US in 1942. Sugar rationing began in 1943 with “Sugar Buying Cards”.</p>
<p>While there was much less unemployment, people also had far less than they did before the war. If the Broken Window Theory were true, all that should never have taken place.</p>
<p>Sure, WW2 “stimulates the economy” in the sense that the government started injecting a ton of money directly into production but it was terrible for the economy in other ways that only got better when the war ended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may not be fully understanding this but how doesn’t maintenance stimulate production? If something needs to be fixed, don’t you need a product to replace the broken thing? </p>
<p>Bastiat mentions the father not being able to buy new shoes. How is buying new shoes to replace your old shoes different from fixing a broken window? </p>
<p>Edit: I think I’ve figured it out. See edit on my comment below. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because fixing the broken window reduces available resources just to get you back to where you already were.</p>
<p>Imagine you're 18 and about to go to college for engineering. You've saved up $5,000 for a year's tuition. Then I smash up your car with a baseball bat. You spend $2,500 repairing your car, and can now only go to school for one semester that year instead of two.</p>
<p>The mechanic who fixes your car is better off, but society as a whole is not: the mechanic gets that money but it wasn't conjured out of nowhere, it was redirected away from the engineering professor. In addition, your education is delayed, so both you and society suffer.</p>
<p>Edit: this is the most upvoted comment I've ever made on reddit. Thanks everyone!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The missing component I think is an example of what new spending would do: if we were able to save up the money and build some new infrastructure, then it would have a shelf-life and overall require some level of maintenance, producing a net increase in the overall circulation of money.</p>
<p>But continual destruction of existing infrastructure ruins that - we never build anything new, just keep spending to keep up with what's being destroyed - the economy never expands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. I read the story again and I failed to realize the new shoes was an example of a luxury, not necessity. Thank you for the explanation. </p>
<p>Edit: wait I don’t even know. Some people are saying the shoes are a necessity. He says “new shoes or some other luxury item”. I can understand if it is a luxury because then you’re spending disposable income on something you didn’t NEED to spend on but chose to spend on. That money wasn’t doing anything before you bought the shoes but now it is helping the economy. Is that correct?</p>
<p>Edit 2: Okay thanks for all the replies. I think I know why I misunderstood. I was so caught up in the details that I forgot what this whole thing was about. The initial argument was that it’s a GOOD thing for the economy. I understand now that’s it’s neither good nor bad for the economy because the money was gonna be spent one way or another. Unless, like a few people mentioned, the money is being hoarded. I appreciate you all for helping me through my stupidity. If I still fucked it up, you might as well give up on me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what happens when those shoes or luxery items break themselves? Ie: smartphone planned obselesence?  Technically theres a fine line to draw here by companies breaking their own windows so that users can &quot;repair them&quot; by buying new windows..   stimulating the economy only goes so far when the glassmaker is making tens of billions of dollars.
