Before his father passed, we used to talk about how just a little nutmeg in the apple pie really helped blend all the flavors.

“Mamma, no shallow content” he would say, and we would laugh about how it’s important to drive traffic to affiliate links.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not the greatest, I cooked this for my family last night except I used heavy cream and vinegar instead of beef broth and sherry. I also used quinoa instead of beans. I didn't have any oregano so I used cinnamon instead and I also used pureed pumpkin instead of tomatoes. I brought it to a rolling boil and simmered for 4 hours instead of the recommended 2. The author of this recipe must be missing tastebuds or something. I won't be serving this again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite is annoying too.</p>
<p>&quot;What a delicious recipe! I added sauteed garlic and onions for extra flavor, tripled the amount of spices because your amounts were way too low, baked it in a 13x9 at 450 instead of in a 8x8 at 300 because your numbers made no sense, and then topped it with a homemade bechamel sauce. It came out fantastic, five stars!&quot;</p>
<p>It's certainly helpful for other readers, but then you can't really give the recipe a good rating if you had to adjust it so much that it's unrecognizable. You're not even reviewing the recipe at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a little too short and on point.  There needed to be a 400-500 word aside about how much the author preferred to get Only Available In Four Stores In Manitoba From 1983-1984 brand horseradish (an ingredient that will NOT be in the recipe) because it reminds them of family trips to visit a favorite cousin where they'd eat these chorizo and egg breakfast burritos on their way to a fishing trips in the summer.    </p>
<p>Oh also, to make egg salad you should boil some eggs and make salad with them.</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>If you write ANYTHING on your computer, YOU NEED TO GET GRAMMARLY. I write pretty much ALL DAY every day and GRAMMARLY makes my writing better. As a student I like that it's FREE It actually is... correcting everything as I'm writing it. Grammar errors spelling errors... IT EVEN helps me find the right words to use!! SO I can say what I want to say!! It catches all those embarrassing little mistakes BEFORE I HIT SEND!!! I download GRAMMARLY around my freshman year becuase I was just... Ｈ Ｏ Ｒ Ｒ Ｉ Ｂ Ｌ Ｅ... at typing! Grammarly is like my secret weapon for writing papers. It's just the PERFECT tool for your resume, you know you don't want ANY errors when it's your first impression. I use GRAMMARLY for important emails, social media posts (which there are a L O T of.) I've used EVERY TOOL OUT THERE!! And Grammarly is by far the ＢＥＳＴ for improving your writing. GRAMMARLY is making me a better writer. AND it's free...

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the old algorithm. The new algorithm relies less on key word stuffing and more on search words and bounce rate. For example, if you search for egg pie, the search engine evaluates all the websites you visit after that search and checks if you stayed longer or shorter. Quick bounce rates means you did not find what you were looking for, meaning the engine was not accurate in giving you what you were looking for - which will affect that website's ranking for that particular key word searches.</p>
<p>Stories lengthen how long people stay on a website because they read the stories first to see if the site has what they are looking for. This fools the search engines into thinking the website delivered what the searcher was looking for, and will rank that page higher for that particular key word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is truth but only partial truth. </p>
<p>They still heavily rely on content because of an era they too heavily relied on user metrics like click through and bounce rates.</p>
<p>During that era I worked doing Reputation Management and we literally just setup bot farms and had them move through search results clicking links and terminating their search query on that page. </p>
<p>We armed ourselves with enough bots and proxies to move Heaven and Earth with enough &quot;browsing time&quot;. </p>
<p>The typical formula today is Content + A Video + Those Bounce/Click metrics. You can cheese those three understanding what you're doing still but it's more time intensive than either of the approaches was alone.</p></div>		</li>
