			<div class="markdown"><p>That #3 is an interesting point. I work with apps, not games, and we only push to the respective app store when there's a code change. Media in the app is handled by the app itself because it updates faster for the user. No need to push ever-shifting soft content through the distributor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to mobile apps, it is a bit different too. There is a certain build size limit in App Store or play store above which you get a “connect to WiFi prompt”. This is undesirable because many people have access to mobile data only, or most likely because when they may decide to download your app they are on the move and a WiFi prompt might make them abort the download.  A small build size allows you to get the app and triggers a second download when your first session starts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See I find in-app updates like this annoying, since I have to open the app to begin the update process and leave it open to let it finish updating, rather than updates from the AppStore that download automatically in the background without ever interrupting my phone use. </p>
<p>For most apps it’s probably not a big deal, but game updates <em>coughBloonsTD6cough</em> can sometimes be rather sizable and require me to leave my phone alone on the update screen, preventing me from using it as normal. I’d much rather have it automatically download in the background via the AppStore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My entirely personal opinion? Those developers are, for one reason or another, bad at media management.</p>
<p>Nobody yells at Instagram for having to load for 5 minutes to get all your friends' new stuff, because they use different techniques to smooth it out dynamically.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Don't know, I got the 55&quot; version   </p>
<p>Not sure, I sent it back  </p>
<p>I can't tell you, mine was blue  </p>

<p>Why fucking answer?!?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get how that can happen. For some articles, Amazon will send you emails with those questions in them, when there's a new one. Making it seem like the question was specifically addressed to you. </p>
<p>It's not malice, but probably just ineptitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People answer because amazon often sends emails to people who’ve purchased an item with the question someone asked.  The way they phrase the email is almost like someone is asking you directly.  So if you’re not too tech savvy you think it’s rude not to respond so u answer something useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fairly positive the OP is mixing up the #1 case with a game update and thinks every first launch of a game has to download more updates. Really it's just installing the redistibutables already downloaded with the game, but the window does look like the update window, I guess, if you don't read/undestand what it says it's doing.</p></div>		</li>
