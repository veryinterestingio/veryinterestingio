			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists can measure the Moon drifting away from Earth by 4 cm each year. That's about <del>2</del> 1.5 inches over the distance of 380k km (one way). The laser beam needs to come back to a detector on Earth after bouncing from a small mirror on the Moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be calculated using trigonometry and a good old theodolite (of course with high enough arc-resolution). But yes, nowadays surveyors use a measuring station (built in GPS, etc) and a laser rangefinder combined with the angle measurement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's actually called a &quot;total station&quot;. There's no such thing as a &quot;measuring station&quot; in surveying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny that 1.4&quot; sounds like a lot in this case, but even as large as the bridge is, it's fairly minimal. For reference, some skyscrapers heights can change somewhat drastically over the course of the year due to thermal expansion. I believe the Willis Tower in Chicago has had a delta of something like 8&quot;.</p>
<p>I know the bridge was an example of Earth's curvature, not thermal expansion. But it makes me wonder how much that 1.4&quot; can change with sway and expansion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1.4&quot; is nothing. I'd wager a guess that you'd find larger gaps than that on the pillars of your average bridge simply due to things not being perfectly plumb and square. A 100' tall pillar would be 1 1/16&quot; further/closer to the next pillar at the top if it were 1/20 of a degree off plumb. I'd be amazed if a mile long bridge was built to such precision that the only difference was due to the earth's curvature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. With all the tolerances allowed within construction, 1.4&quot; is pretty negligible. I only know appropriate tolerances of buildings, not bridges or similar applications so it'd be cool if a structural engineer could weigh in.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm sure if you actually measured the distance as built, it's much greater than 1.4&quot;. That's likely just a calculated number based on the design if built with 100% accuracy.</p></div>		</li>
