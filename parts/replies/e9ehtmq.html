			<div class="markdown"><p>I can add a bit to this. When a bacterial infection kills surrounding tissue antibiotics can't get to the site to exert their effect. This is called necrotizing facitis. </p>
<p>Basically the &quot;flesh eating bacteria&quot; creates a bio-film that encapsolates itself further preventing antibiotics from reaching the bacteria and killing it. This is how it continues to spread despite antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>The cure is often surgery. The goal of surgery is to remove as much infection and dead tissue as possible. This often requires multiple wash outs to allow the healthy tissue and antibiotics to kill the infection.</p>
<p>This rarely happens in healthy humans. Usually this is the result of another disease process like end stage diabetes or immune compromised patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nurse Anesthetist here. Just to add a bit onto what these guys said. The reason you see people so horribly disfigured from necrotizing fasciitis is directly from those surgeries. They have to debride so much tissue to make sure they get all the infection that it often leaves patients with horrible disfigurements. This is why you hear about &quot;outbreaks of flesh-eating bacteria&quot; so much more than other common infections.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it because they look so disfigured?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this a scenario where maggots would come into play? Their enzymes are fantastic at destroying nectrotic tissue but leaving healthy tissue alone if I remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afraid not. You'd need to expose the infected fascia completely (often in a large or delicate area) and leave it open while the maggots did their work - and the patient probably wouldn't survive this due to the infection if not blood loss.<br />
NF cases invariably present acutely with not a lot of time for experimentation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit of a blast from the past, I know a podiatrist who treated diabetic gangrenous limbs with leeches, having decent effect, saving people from amputations. Her quote is that they leave the wound nice and pink and then the antibiotics would work again.</p>
<p>Checked the current UKs NHS treatments and they still offer biosurgery with maggots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of maggots, did you know maggots kill many sheep and rabbits?  Flies lay eggs on the bum of the critter, the maggots hatch and emit a toxin that causes a deadly infection in the animal - It's called FLY STRIKE or MYTOSIS.  It's why sheep get their tails docked (to remove feces that attract flies).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in microbiology and just wanted to clarify some things: The flesh eating disease we call necrotizing fasciitis is caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, or in the medical world is know as Group A Strep. There are other letter variants of Strep such as Group B, which is what pregnant mothers are screened for to make sure they don’t pass it down to baby. Anyhow, Group A Strep is also the same streptococcus strain that causes what we call strep throat. It can be found in soil which is a good reason to teach children to wash their hands when they get cuts. It’s uncommon to acquire topically in a wound, but we had cultured a mans foot who was working under his house in sandals and it entered through a cut in his foot. His lost said foot to stop the spread. The toxins bit is spot on: think of the bacteria as a construction worker, they know how to do the job, but if they don’t bring their tools (toxins) no work gets done. An interesting case is a person can be infected with C. diff, a pretty nasty poop bug, but sometimes the C. diff doesn’t produce toxins, leaving the person asymptomatic. Antibiotics is a fancy word for a controlled fungus we know kills a bacteria. Group A Strep is always susceptible to Bacitracin, which is in part how we identify Group a from something else. If the wound is necrotizing faster than the antibiotics work, which is most often the case, then surgery is involved. This often leads to amputations. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, antibiotics are bacteria-killing <em>compounds</em> that we usually get from fungi. The word does not refer to the fungus itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you’re right. The name of the antibiotic itself isn’t the name of the fungus. I was just speaking broadly on the subject. </p></div>		</li>
