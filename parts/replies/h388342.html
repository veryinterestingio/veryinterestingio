<p>I wish more people would be upfront with the fact that the underlying explanation is not known. I know it irritates physicists for people to think they ‘don’t know what’s happening’ because in a sense, they’ve studied a lot of mathematics and can describe in excruciating detail what will happen to particles (at least as far as is possible, given the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics). But when someone like OP asks the question, they get very confident answers that don’t accord with their everyday understanding and that’s because <em>our best answers do not yet have a fundamental explanation.</em></p>
<p>I also think it would help if physicists paid more attention to the different paradigms in the history of science. In a way, QFT does reintroduce the idea that an electromagnetic wave is a perturbation in a universe-spanning field. How such fields exist are a subject of debate, but it might help OP to understand why he or she is hearing contradictory things (e.g. early 20th C view of no medium/aether was superseded by later 20C view of QFT).</p></div>		</li>
