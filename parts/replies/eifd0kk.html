			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically of dynamo action you need some kind of motion in the medium. Convective motion is the most commonly considered (but you can have mechanical forcing from tides, libration, precession etc). For convection you want a large temperature difference between the interior and exterior. In the case of Mars it is possible that the exterior has been warmed (through a giant impact which there is evidence for) and hence insulating the interior. If you leave this for a while the core temperature remains the same but the exterior gets cooler and thus you have a larger temperature difference.</p>
<p>In physical terms for this theory it considers the solidification of the interior of Mars as top down (as opposed to Earths core solidification being thought of as bottom up) so Mars is solidifying from the outside in. I am definitely no expert in this theory!</p></div>		</li>
