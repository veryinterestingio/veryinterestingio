			<div class="markdown"><p>In nautical terms, which is the basis of Star Trek terms, full stop or all stop just means to turn off or stop the engines. It doesn’t mean stop the ship. </p>
<p>The joke being if you’re in orbit around earth and you jump to warp (which is based on the idea that space is moving around the ship or rather the ship itself isn’t moving, which is how it’s going faster than the speed of light), and the captain says full stop, or dropping out of warp at some point (let’s say a planet) based on where you were, then the planet would just zoom off in some direction cause you were in orbit around another planet circling a sun zooming thru space.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll probably never find it again, but there once a space sim I played, where you could travel the solar system, and everything was proportionally represented, including orbital speed. I can remember trying to do something so basic as safely landing on the moon and it was next to impossible because of how it moved. Matching orbital speed and trajectory is extremely difficult, and to this day I'm still astonished that astronauts have pulled it off so many times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In nautical terms, all stop means to completely stop the ship. It doesn't mean to just turn off the engines and start drifting uncontrolled, which is something you almost never want to do. In the past, the meaning could have been different, but what it means now is stop the ship, not the engines.</p>
<p>How would this translate to a space ship? I would imagine they wouldn't use the term. It would probably get replaced by terms like &quot;match velocity&quot; for another ship, and &quot;enter orbit&quot; for a planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, but pedantry is a hell of a drug.  It's pretty clear that full stop would either mean &quot;in relation to this thing we just found&quot; or &quot;such that we are neither getting closer to nor farther away from our destination&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing is true on Earth though, if I say my car came to a &quot;full stop&quot;, we wouldn't expect the planet to fly out from underneath it.</p>
<p>And this works for OPs question too, since everything is really a &quot;space object&quot;. My car is, in the grand scheme of things, &quot;in space&quot; and we figure out how to measure its speed in a useful way. If Elon Musk put my car on top of Falcon heavy, we'd still be able to measure its speed. And if in 1,000 years my car was floating in interstellar space and the starship Enterprise discovered, they'd be able to measure it's speed too. We'd all use the same rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speeds are measured relative to the bottom of the largest, nearest, gravity well</li>
</ul>
<p>When I'm on Earth, that's the biggest gravity well, if I get out of Earth orbit I might start orbiting the moon, and use that instead, further out it would be the sun, or maybe another planet. In interstellar space it would probably be the nearest solar system, but maybe something like the &quot;galactic core&quot; if we were telling fast enough, for long enough.</p>
<p>And that makes sense, gravity is the warping of space, so if we're measuring our movement through space, we should explicitly take in to account any large distortions in our area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is done with a frame of reference. In your example full stop would mean I turn the engine off, even if the car was still coasting down a hill, the cars frame of reference hasn’t change. It’s still moving/not moving relative to a nearby rock, and we are measuring if that rock is moving by comparing it to the mountain it’s sitting on, and so on and so forth.  </p>
<p>If the car magically and instantly teleported to Mars, all of the cars momentum from spinning around the earth and the sun may send the car shooting off into space. So from the car’s perspective, the planet would fly out from underneath it, and it’s doing this because it’s frame of reference was the nearest biggest gravity well, the sun.  </p>
<p>So if my car generated a warp field and took off towards the moon, and half way there I dropped out of warp, my car would take off in a direction relative to where it was on earth minus the correction earths gravity would do (like cutting the string on a spinning weight would send it off in a direct relative to the center of the spinning).  My car is doing exactly what it was expected to do relative to the earth. Relative to the moon, my car just took off. My car relative to me hasn’t moved an inch, and from my perspective the earth and the moon and even the sun just all took off in random directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not obvious that it would always be in reference to what they're chasing/observing/dealing with?</p>
<p>Their computers are absurdly powerful, these types of calculations would be a push of a button in their world. All you need is to already have your target selected, which, would absolutely always be the case.</p>
<p>Everything they do is in reference to something. How could it ever be anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually they just make shit up. My favorite is the Heisenberg compensator. Which just magically fixes the issues with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Basically fixes the issues teleporters have with knowing where you with out interfering with you.  </p>
<p>Or like the professors said: &quot;No Fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think &quot;Heisenberg compensators&quot; that break the laws of physics as we know them and &quot;coming to a stop relative to an object in space&quot; are quite the same thing.</p></div>		</li>
