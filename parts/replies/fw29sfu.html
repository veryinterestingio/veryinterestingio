			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to just think of sensors as sponges. They basically absorb light as long as you’ll let them. </p>
<p>But lenses matter too. You have to control the flow of light to make sure you absorb the right amount.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also I prefer to think of them as buckets, as a bucked has a well defined amount of water (light) that it can hold. Over fill one bucket and it starts to spill into adjacent buckets.</p></div>		</li>
