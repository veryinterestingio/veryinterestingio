			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more of a sci-fi question so at the risk of sounding dumb, could we someday terraform Venus if we figured out a way to suck the carbon dioxide with giant vacuums and vent it out into space? I guess the problem then would be to add the 80/20 nitrogen/oxygen mixture we have here on Earth and to keep it from escaping into space but wouldn't getting rid of most of the CO₂ at least take care of reducing the surface pressure and the temperature to a point where it becomes liveable for Earth based life? I realize this would be a massive and extremely complicated undertaking and that I'm simplifying it like crazy so go easy on me lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth did it.  If you take all the sequestered carbon on Earth (from limestone, oil, etc) and convert it back into CO2 then Earth and Venus would have a similar atmosphere.  Because life evolved on Earth, and because that life photosynthesized the CO2 was stripped from our atmosphere.  Unfortunately to do that on Venus would be difficult because a) lack of water, it evaporated away and was dissociated into oxygen and hydrogen by solar radiation, the hydrogen blowing away and the oxygen bonding with other elements and b) the extreme heat and pressure being unconducive to life and c) the process took billions of years on Earth, and Venus will be swallowed by the sun as it converts into a red giant before that happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's perfectly terraformable given some advanced technologies. This ventures in to Science Fiction but none of this is out of &quot;reality&quot; as we understand it. </p>
<p>There's a few papers written on the method of terraforming. </p>
<p>You would need to harvest a TON of the solar energy BEFORE it hits the planet - in space. That might be a good thing if you're looking to setup a large structure in space that needs a lot of power. All of this to cool Venus down.</p>
<p>Venus moves REALLY slow. A day takes an entire Earth Year roughly. A few people have proposed methods to speed the rotation of Venus up. Some theorize that when spinning faster Venus' active core may produce an electromagnetic field similar to Earth. </p>
<p>Venus really needs water after you've cooled it down. There's not a lot of easy sources for water. You're talking about borrowing a small ice moon and throwing it at Venus or a series of comets. Ice moon makes more sense as I <strong>think</strong>.</p>
<p>After that you've got mostly everything you need for a functional planet. Add something that can live in the water and turn CO2 to O2 and you're good on the first steps of life. Next you have to work on turning the ground to something usable. Microbes/fungus before basic plants. </p>
<p>Timelines were like 100-200 years given advanced tech to have a usable livable planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always figured in that distant future we would probably figure out more efficient genetically engineered bio reactors so seed the planet with microbes or algea that turn the c02 into usable O2 and all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comets makes much more sense, IMO. They've already got the momentum and aren't firmly possessed by the gravity well of a huge planet.</p>
<p>In any case, Venus would always be water poor, because there are not enough comets which journey in toward the sun to get you half of earth's water.</p>
<p>Finally, you could try cooling down venus in a few ways. Like you mentioned, try cooling it down <em>before</em> removing the C02, or you could try to remove/thin out the C02 first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but this is not feasible. Even with a solar sail that blocked all sunlight, the sheer mass of atmosphere would be retained. Given heating from the core, it would take millions of years to reduce that temperature by half (oven hot) .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would a terraforming project look like? I have seen many science fiction films with different types.? A massive power plant like in Aliens? Nuclear explosions to release and liquify underground water reserves?
One shows a algea that’s an extremaphobe which shits CO2 / methan</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On Mars, factories producing halocarbons to release into the atmosphere and increase the greenhouse effect, so that the frozen CO2 sublimates and thickens the atmosphere. Possibly orbital mirrors too. After a few centuries Mars would have a CO2 atmosphere that's thick enough to protect the surface from radiation and allow liquid water on the surface.</p>
<p>For Venus, the first step would be to build a planet-sized sunshade to make the CO2 freeze out of the atmosphere, leaving a 3 bar N2 atmosphere. Then the dry ice would need to be buried or removed somehow, before the sunshade is removed.</p>
<p>This first step, building an unbreathable atmosphere, would take just a few centuries but it may take thousands of years more to add enough oxygen to either atmosphere to make it breathable. But living on those planets would still be much easier after the first terraforming stage.</p></div>		</li>
