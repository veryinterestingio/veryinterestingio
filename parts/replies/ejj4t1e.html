			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. &quot;Colored person&quot; was someone's best effort to find an non-negative term to replace the word at the time &quot;negro&quot; because people found that offensive.  POC is someone's best effort to find an non-negative term to replace the word colored person. I guarantee in 25 years &quot;person of color&quot; will be offensive for some reason and there will be a new word and you will be chided for saying PoC  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>The conveyor belt thing is real, and your mental handicaps examples is a good one, but that’s not what happened with “people of color”.</p>
<p>They are referring to two different groups of people.</p>
<p>“Colored People” was a term specifically for black people. It’s no longer politically correct, and is now considered a derogatory term, but back when it was a socially acceptable term it referred specifically to black people.</p>
<p>“People of color” on the other hand refers to many different races. Black People are considered “People of color”, but so are Indian people, some South Americans, People from SE Asia, etc. </p>
<p>The term “People of color” didn’t come along as a replacement for “colored people”, it was invented to describe people like my Ex, who’s Filipino. Her skin is extremely dark brown, her skin is darker than most Black people’s, but she isn’t “black”, because that refers specifically to people with African heritage. So she always refers to herself as a “Woman of Color”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incredibly well said. I’m not saying you shouldn’t try to use the best terminology when I point out that it can sometimes be an arbitrary moving target. If I’m hearing you correct, making the effort to use it demonstrate your willingness to accommodate </p></div>		</li>
