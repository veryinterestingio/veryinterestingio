			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you checked out  r/singing ? There's a ton of info there!  </p>
<p>I have sung for about 28\~ years and I'm still shy about singing in front of other people. I have a about 2hrs drive each day for college and I practice a lot in the car. It helps to kill time!</p>
<p>Watch some youtube vids and learn some good techniques like diaphragmatic breathing. YMMV from these videos - having a proper vocal coach is pretty rad, but if you don't wanna pay for lessons, are unable to, there's still a lot of free resources out there that will help you to get on your way :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this! I've been singing for about 10 years as a hobby / side project, do a few local coffee shop shows here and there, but I've never had any sort of training or anything, just do what works for me and what I get compliments on.  I also watch some &quot;vocal coach reacts&quot; videos that focus on my favorite singers, to get tips on what parts of their techniques to replicate.  Always good to have more tools to learn from! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started typing this, and it kind of turned into a whole thing. I'm sorry if I went a bit overboard or if it's a little out of the park of what you're looking for, but I hope this can help you or anyone else trying to improve their voice.</p>
<p>I'm not a vocal coach, but I'm a singer and I've taken lessons prior. The main things that I tend to focus on are technique, tone, and pitch.</p>
<p>Using proper technique is the biggest part of the mastering and overall health of your voice. Some basic points of vocal technique involve proper breathing (inhaling with your &quot;stomach&quot;, not your shoulders) and learning to engage your diaphragm. These are easy things to learn, it just takes some time and practice for it to become second nature. There are a lot of good resources on YouTube that cover vocal technique basics. I would recommend starting there just to get an idea.</p>
<p>When it comes to the overall sound of your voice, tone and pitch play a huge part in how it's perceived. If you have good technique, your natural tone will start to shine through on its own. However, you can adjust your tone to fit different styles of music by changing the placement of your voice in your mouth, and the way you enunciate. For example, singing more from the &quot;front of your mouth&quot; may make your tone lighter and brighter, while singing from the middle/roof of your mouth may give you a bolder and throatier tone. (This is obviously not proper voice-speak, but hopefully it makes sense.)</p>
<p>If you tend to listen to or sing a specific style of music, pay attention to the aspects you like of those singers and practice replicating their tone and enunciation. This can help you get a sense for what actions create what sounds, and what tone you're going for. Something as simple as smiling or gritting your teeth while singing can affect the sound and mood of your voice, but may not be something you've ever tried.</p>
<p>Pitch is arguably the hardest part for most people to master as it requires building muscle memory. The best way to go about it is just to practice. Spend time singing and trying to match different notes with accuracy, whether it be from a song, and instrument, or on your own. Eventually it'll become habit.</p>
<p>Mostly, just make an effort to sing every day, even if you're not specifically setting time aside for it. It can be in the car, in the shower, while you're making dinner, etc, just focus on incorporating these different tools and go from there. Record yourself on your phone and play it back. It'll give you a good perspective on how you sound to others, plus you can always listen to the older files when you need inspiration. It'll feel amazing three months from now when you go back and hear how much you've improved. Just remember that no one likes how they sound on recordings initially, and phone mics can give you a canned sound that doesn't exist in person.</p>
<p>Again, this is really long and may not be the best, but maybe someone will get something useful out of it! Happy Holidays friend! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going to chime in to correct one common misconception that really hindered my progress for a long time. &quot;Sing with your diaphragm&quot; should be retired as advice and replaced with the more correct phrases &quot;relax to allow your pelvic floor to lower&quot; and &quot;balance your abdominal muscles so that there is pressure inside and out&quot;.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lowering your pelvic floor is what actually allows space for a deeper breath, and you need to find out how to let it relax down rather than forcing it, which creates tension.</p>
</li>
<li>There needs to be pressure inside your stomach, pushing out to prevent the air from just coming out and letting everything collapse. However, your also don't want to just hold your stomach out, which creates unnecessary tension. There needs to be a balance of pressure preventing total collapse while allowing everything to deflate in a slow and controlled manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm also going to throw in my top two pieces of advice. Singing should never hurt and if it takes you a long time to warm up then you aren't doing it correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) As I said in the other comment, the biggest obstacles are all mental. Singing is coordinating muscle movement. You will make funny sounds. You won't always like what you hear. To get better, you have to <em>get over worrying about what it sounds like</em> because eventually you'll make a sound you like and once you know how that feels you can replicate it. THIS is the biggest reason people think kids have &quot;talent&quot; singing---really it's just that kids don't give a shit what kind of noise they make and some make sounds they like sooner than others. Other kids get told by adults that the noises are &quot;bad&quot; and they stop singing altogether which makes me REALLY FUCKING MAD (sorry that rant is not aimed at you). </p>
<p>I like to compare it to running. Some people are built for running, some of us really have to work hard at it. And we all know how, to a certain extent, but if you do it a lot (or try to do certain things) without any training you can hurt yourself, and that's where teachers/coaches come in. If it hurts, you're doing something wrong. If you feel tension around your neck, shoulders, or jaw, pretend you're chewing gum while you sing and <em>gently</em> rock your head side to side (ear towards shoulder). If you can still produce a tone you're happy with while doing those things you're probably ok.</p>
<p>2) Vocal folds vibrate for sound as a secondary function. Their primary function is to keep you from drowning (hold your breath with your fingers on your throat. That tension you feel is the folds sealing together). With that in mind, in order for them to vibrate freely (and make the sound better) you need AIR. Air in, air out. My biggest pet peeve is with pop singers that do what's called a &quot;glottal attack.&quot; That is when you use that tension in the vocal folds to either slam shut or explode apart for percussive effect. If that sounds bad, that's because it IS. Examples of this are Katy Perry &quot;Roar&quot; or American Authors &quot;Best day of my Li-i-i-i-i-i-i-fe&quot;  Easiest way to avoid it (words that start with vowels) is to put a little silent &quot;h&quot; sound before the vowel. Start the air flowing before the cords start making noise.</p>
<p>3) The voice is a wind instrument. You need air for it to function. Anything that impedes air flow in or out is going to affect your tone. There's a ton of great YouTube videos that can teach you about different breathing techniques but just keep in mind that the air should flow freely and that tension in the neck/shoulders makes that harder.</p>
<p>TL;DR Don't be afraid to make funny noises, get over yourself, breathe deep and go for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny you mention the part about &quot;bad&quot; sounds. I used to love singing as a kid, then I was told someone around my age (I was like 10 at the time) that it was bad and I never sung again after that lol. I'm 19 now.</p></div>		</li>
