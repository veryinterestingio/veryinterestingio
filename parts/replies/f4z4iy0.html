			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna be a little pedantic and point out that while the response curves of the eye's cone cells are centered around the wavelengths that correspond to red, green and blue light, there's another step to the process once that information reaches the brain.</p>
<p>The brain perceives color as a two axis &quot;opponent process&quot;: Red vs green and yellow vs blue. There's no such thing* as a reddish green or yellowish blue because these colors directly compete with one another. Using only mixtures of red, green and blue to produce colors cannot produce all colors that humans are capable of seeing because the colors that fall between those 3 primaries necessarily form a triangle, and the human range of color perception isn't shaped like a triangle. Most humans will probably live and die without ever seeing the extreme limits of color perception because these colors don't typically occur in nature and aren't reproducible by television or computer monitors. Some TVs have experimented with adding a yellow phosphor to increase the range of possible colors that can be reproduced, and it looks amazing on demo footage.</p>
<p>*Actually, for some people, it is possible to briefly see these &quot;forbidden colors&quot; by exhausting the opponent neurons by staring at specific colors for a long time. They describe the experience as seeing a color they've never seen before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of why a lot of blockbuster action films, certainly from a few years ago at least, relied heavily on a blue/orange colour palette in their films and on their promotional material. The contrast of those colours in particular supposedly tested well and were more pleasing for audiences.</p></div>		</li>
