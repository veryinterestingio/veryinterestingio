			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny, in a sad kind of way. The things that should give a person credibility like intellectual honesty, knowing where your knowledge ends, acknowledgement of uncertainty, etc. can be used by people with no expertise or with bad intentions as an opportunity to discredit everything that person says.</p>
<p>“They expressed uncertainty in a conclusion from  an expert in a similar field, their entire body of work is bullshit!”</p></div>		</li>

<p>Science is always proving itself wrong!</p>

<p>Yeah, that's the scientific method. That literally all that science does, and it can't really even do that with 100% certainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also when people have just enough knowledge of science to think that makes them an expert.</p>
<p>I remember there was a post on I think /r/Futurology about a new material discovered that was theoretically better at generating electricity from heat (gradients) than any other known material. Someone in the comments was heavily upvoted for pouring bullshit on the whole thing, among their arguments were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“they’ve used units that don’t make sense, therefore they’ve made a bunch of assumptions that are probably wildly unrealistic - such as the thickness of the material - but not told anyone so no-one can recreate the experiment!” In actual fact: the units made perfect sense to anyone with a physics background. Metres were involved in both the thermal gradient and the surface area of the material which cancelled to give things like “AK^(-1)m^(-1)” - they couldn’t understand how it could be “per metre”.</p>
</li>
<li>“there’s no mention of Watts anywhere in the paper, the power production must be terrible and they’re trying to hide it!” I did a control-f for “power” and found it in seconds, and it supported their claims of being better than other materials. The reason they found nothing is <em>you don’t write the full name of units in scientific writing</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>and from this they’d concluded it was all bullshit, part of a gravy train for grant money, scientists were lying and cheating to make their stuff look better etc. </p>
<p>Just made me so angry that someone who clearly knew nothing about the science was claiming it was bullshit simply because they didn’t properly understand it and had gone looking for holes that didn’t exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, just think about stuff you know for certain. There's not a lot of that. You know a tree falls down but you don't really know &quot;why&quot;. Gravity, but why? Keep asking why like a child and you'll find out why scientists refrain from &quot;absolutes&quot;</p>
<p>Heck, I'd even argue that quantum physics confirms the fact that there's no fact, if I knew anything about it.</p></div>		</li>
