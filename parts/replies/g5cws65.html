			<div class="markdown"><p>The variety of job titles might give the hint that this isn't exactly a normal career path! I'm a full-time freelancer, meaning that I pull together different gigs. It also means it's been highly non-linear: it wasn't a series of steps leading to this current moment so much as it was a dance that's always changing with the music.  </p>
<p>It's been a lot of creating opportunities, taking opportunities, or shaping circumstances to hopefully manifest into an opportunity later down the line. It's also been a lot of trying things out, then backing away when I realize reality didn't match up with expectations.  </p>
<p>Part of what I love about this combination is that I get to do a blend of work from extremely heavy, serious projects to complete cotton-candy adventures. It's also an excellent mix of big, long-term projects and quick-hits of rapid response. Between them all, I can get a balance of different styles of work that keep every day interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/Tong__ asked a really great question. I'm 27 years old, and I'm getting into IT, most of it is freelance and I have along away to go, so it often leaves me frustrated. Reading your answer has given me some hope in regards to my future. Hopefully I will be able to understand what opportunities I should take, how to shape future opportunities and when to walk away from something. Both of you, thank you for the insight!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been full-time freelance for over a decade now, and part-time freelance for ... uh, I think just under two decades? I'd need to fact-check that!</p>
<p>it took about three years of full-time freelancing to have regular anchor clients so I wasn't stressing out over rent each month, five years to have enough of a reputation that I'd get cold-pitched on projects instead of always needing to seek them out, and a solid decade before I started getting cold-pitched on dream projects that left me astonished that this is somehow my life.</p>
<p>The best advice I have on freelancing is to be fearless about rejection.  The way I figure it is that if you're never getting turned down, it's because you're under-pitching and never pushing the boundaries of what you can do. You'd have to screw up massively for a pitch to go so poorly that they think worse of you than if you never asked in the first place, so getting rejected only costs ego not future opportunities. Since it's extremely rare to get opportunities you don't ever ask for, go forth, pitch, and acquire your rejections.</p>
<p>It can be <em>extremely</em> helpful to set rejection goals. I tend to aim for 10+ rejections a month when things are slow, and one noteworthy rejection a year. My current Best Rejection is making it the top 15% of Canadian astronaut candidates before being cut. That means I made the technical qualifications, but that my skillset didn't align with what they needed so I didn't undergo physical or temperament screening. Considering my objective was to hit the 50% paperwork cutoff, I'm damn proud of how far I made it through the process!</p></div>		</li>
