			<div class="markdown"><p>Very generally, if there is no wind and the forest is roughly the same density and material it's just a matter of pinpointing the center. If there is wind it's a matter of experience and gathering data like the wind speed and direction and things like that. Of course that's extremely simplified.</p>
<p>Also, if a bedroom on the rear right side of the house is completely destroyed and the front left side of the house is largely untouched....The fire probably started in the back on the right side. </p>
<p>Again, very basically, an investigator for a house fire will do kind of a reverse investigation. Instead of trying to find the cause(if one isn't obvious) they start eliminating causes one by one until there is only one explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for forest fires, they’re not likely to have grown to a significant size before they’re observed / reported, so knowing that a fire was roughly 10-50 acres before it blew up and charred hundreds or even thousands of acres narrows down the starting point significantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also would like to add that accelerants make the fire hotter as well, and sometimes leave trace chemicals that can be identified later. some popular accelerants you may have on hand are</p>
<p>nail polish remover (acetone)
gasoline(duh)
terpentine(common in paint thinner!)
kerosene
alchohol of a proof exceeding 135</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Accelerants can actually cool the fire as well, believe it or not. Wood burns substantially hotter, and a pool of liquid can keep the floor cool as it evaporates and burns. Alcohol will burn down to about 80 proof, and lower than that if poured into a hot fire</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sadly, sometimes they just make shit up. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham" target="_blank">Cameron Todd Willingham</a> was executed because the prosecution had an &quot;expert&quot; who was just talking out his ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn’t there also a big thing about how the leading expert on fire forensics - the guy that literally wrote the book on the topic turned out to have just made it all up based on what he assumed would happen, rather than testing anything?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Science had nothing to do with fire investigation up to the late 1970s and early '80s. Before that it was based on old wives' tales. But now we use the scientific method.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't be surprised. John Oliver did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScmJvmzDcG0" target="_blank">show on forensic science</a> once. A lot of it turned out to be pure bullshit. In one case, a man was convicted of murder based on testimony from an &quot;expert&quot; who it turned out couldn't tell dog hair from human hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, what a tragic story. I've been learning a lot about how flawed almost every kind of forensic &quot;science&quot; really is. Eyewitness testimony is also completely unreliable. I'm beginning to think the only way to not be convicted of a crime when you're innocent is to be lucky enough to never be in any way associated with any crime</p></div>		</li>
