			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. There's a lot of other posters talking about the body going into a resting phase, and I don't think that's what anybody experiences. When driving not only do you have to be alert at all times, but you're also constantly using making very small movements with your muscles to adjust the steering wheel, pedals, even just keeping your posture up while seated is expending energy. </p>
<p>In athletic training there's always the comparison of doing a really difficult thing a few times versus doing a really easy thing a few dozen times. Driving is like doing an infinitely simple thing a few million times an hour. It's absolutely expending energy in ways that are unlike most everything else we do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Driving is like existing with a 2 year old and your senses are always in a state of being alert.</p>
<p>Its like walking through life constantly scanning around you.  Imagine walking down the road and scanning.  Or sitting in a chair but you are on alert, listening, watching. </p>
<p>You don't get to 'relax'.</p>
<p>I notice a huge difference in my car when I engage the auto driving.  I go from being 80% alert to something like 30% alert, as I am letting my car drive for me.</p>
<p>After a couple hours on the highway there is a distinct difference between how I feel after being a full time driver for the time vs being a part time driver for that time.</p></div>		</li>
