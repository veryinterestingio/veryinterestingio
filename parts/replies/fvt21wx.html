			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you're talking about the CHP exam?
It's a real tough one that's for sure. Unfortunately with section 1 it's all down to prior studying and reviewing the past exams they have online for the type of questions. </p>
<p>The second section on the other hand I think it is very important to take it very slow. It's 4 of 8 questions you need to answer and time should be spent on selecting those questions which you are most familiar with. </p>
<p>On top of that the exams are marked by people who are extremely familiar with the field so try not to over explain standard topics or ideas. No time  ELI5 in the exam.</p>
<p>Study hard and I'm sure he will get it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have windows, definitely open them. Helps with humidity too. Just make sure air is moving.  I've seen levels go from 4 to sub 1 just by opening windows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might get some surprising results if you open the windows and run some fans in the basement. You'll really want some airflow to move the radon along. I'm not an expert at radon in homes and usually work in natural environments, so I don't want to prescribe a solution to your home specifically, but you're essentially doing the same thing as the ventilation system. The biggest advantages to venting the slab are that you don't have to worry about outdoor/indoor temperatures, which might not be an issue depending on where you live, and it's nice to plug in and forget about. If those don't make the cost worth it to you then absolutely open the windows and circulate the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the perspective. The vent is on the list. We just bought the place and it’s hard to get work done in a pandemic. But $1500 is probably about 90% less than a single chemo visit, so I think it’s worth it.</p></div>		</li>
