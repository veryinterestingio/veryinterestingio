<p>Like I said before, I will get you close enough to be dangerous on trivia night, but I am not a medical expert.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting thought...</p>
<p>But you've already lost the body heat in warming up the water in what you ate or drank long before you pee.</p>
<p>Peeing doesn't change your body temperature - just the total heat content of your body because you lose some mass in the urine you deposit. </p>
<p>The heat was redistributed long before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you responded to but I believe it is because once you relax the sphincter muscle the positive pressure of the fluid against the bladder is what causes the urine to be excreted. Once the bladder returns to its natural size and there is no pressure so you have to use the surrounding muscles to squeeze the bladder to get the rest out. </p>
<p>Think about it like filling a balloon with water and letting it go, the balloon will force most of the water out just returning to its original size but once it gets there there still might be some residual water that you could get out by manually squeezing the balloon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm... That is a great question!  I never even thought to wonder, as I am a guy, so I have experienced this.  I thought everyone had this experience!</p>
<p>This is just like how people react on r/earrumblersassemble !  </p>
<p>Either people have done it all their lives and assumed it was normal and everyone did it too, or have never done it, had no idea it was a thing, and their minds are blown!</p>
