<p>I can only speak of the UK as the US system is quite different.</p>
<p>In the UK Maths  has been the top A-Level subject for a couple of years now. If studdents do Further Maths A-level then they see a lot of Maths before they get to Uni. We get many really excellent students at the University of Bath - so yes in some senses our students are given a good maths training. I'm aware that it is less comprehensive than in other countries, but too much maths isn't always appropriate.</p>
<p>I'd try to steer away from making policy sugestions about how maths is taught as I don't think I know enough about the landscape of school maths. However, I'd really like to have more emphasis placed on applications of maths and where is can take you, rather than just Maths for Maths sake.</p>
<p>I work on a broad range of topics from theoretical to very applied. I've wroked on egg-shell patterning and locust migration. I still work on developmental biology (looking at problems with developing embryos) and in simulation methodologies.</p>
<p>Yes the distrust of experts is a bit of a shame. I think we should all actively strive for evidence based policy and descisions at all levels of society and we need experts to help create that evidence.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say Maths for math's sake I'm guessing you don't mean pure mathematics/number theory/logic - I say this because after doing further maths followed by a pure mathematics degree I realised that pre-university I only really studied what I would call &quot;applied&quot; mathematics. </p>
<p>&quot;real maths&quot; for lack of a better word (think proofs ect) is really different and requires a different way of thinking, which personally I enjoyed and some of us found easier, some other's on my course finding it much harder than the applied modules we could take. It's a real shame this type of mathematics isn't shown at school level - although granted it's by definition not applicable to anything in particular. Instead I'd argue it tends to sharper logical thought process, problem solving and ability to abstract a problem - which I actually think has given me a real edge in my career despite not going down a pure mathematical route. </p>
<p>I really wish there was some more focus on understanding scientific papers/statistics, p levels, beyond just the raw numbers and formulas for stats ect at a school level, understanding bad assumptions and how to interpret findings. It seems mad to me that these things are only barley touched upon at A-level but given equal footing - to say decision mathematics, which really at A level is something confined to certain niche declines likes the logistics industry.</p></div>		</li>
