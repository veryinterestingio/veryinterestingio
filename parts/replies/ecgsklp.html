			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had that shit happen once. 1/10 do not recommend. It legit felt like a some evil demonic presence was hovering over me. Tried to scream and move and nothing worked. Finally was able to recognize features in my room and after what felt like minutes (probably really only like 30 seconds) I could move again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, a little cat sized demon was sitting on my face and suffocating me. I knew I was awake but couldn't do anything so it felt so amazing real.</p>
<p>I eventually channeled my inner Uma Thurman and wiggled my big toe and ended up oscillating my body back and fourth until I woke up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Woke up, couldn’t move and there was a horrific looking demon looming over me. </p>
<p>Turns out I was just quite tightly tucked in and my mother in law had brought me a cup of tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be terrified of SP. I've never seen any apparitions but I would always feel an unfriendly presence looming over me, like something was coming to harm me, but never arrived. It happens so often, though, that I'm no longer afraid. Sometimes I'll wake up after it happens, try to sleep and will feel it coming again, at which point I'll either let it happen or wake myself up. I'll usually let it happen and try different methods of waking up. Most efficient so far is to just relax while trying to move, starting with your fingers/toes and working your way up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never gotten full on sleep paralysis, but sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I can feel it creeping up on me if I lay still for 5 seconds, then I get spooked and move whatever limbs I can to snap out of it, then it starts again 5 seconds later. If I lay on my side, then it'll feel like some ghost is pulling my hand and then my arm and then my chest feels like it's getting pulled too, but in reality I'm not moving at all.</p>
<p>And I'm also conscious and i'm like &quot;isn't this like the first step to getting an epic lucid dream? But then again, this stupid ass ghost is literally dragging me down to hell so is really worth it?&quot;</p>
<p>Scary shit, and that's still not even close to the stuff I read online </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is closely connected to lucid dreaming, which is awesome. I've put myself in sleep paralysis trying to induce lucid dreaming a few times. </p>
<p>Once you know it's sleep paralysis, it kind of loses its power over you. Still can't move or anything, but when you instantly realize it isn't real, it's much less frightening. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What’s creepy is that, sometimes you can be awake while all your muscles are paralyzed in a state called “sleep paralysis”. Generally in this state people experience abject terror(terror that is far greater than most people experience in their lives)- and hallucinate malevolent beings “looming” over them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get this once every few months or so...and it's always, always terrifying. You actually believe there are demons in the room with you. I have to think this is what people with schizophrenia have to deal with on a daily basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep paralysis can cause vivid hallucinations. It has something to do with you being in REM sleep, but you perceive yourself to be wide awake. The hallucinations manifest themselves in different ways for different people, but they usually are menacing/shadowy figures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good question. I had SP on and off for 25 years and never have I thought it was a demon or some evil character.</p>
<p>I did sense someone there or someone was on their way to me but it was always someone I know.</p>
<p>It was scary because I couldn't move and that's the only reason it was scary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had sleep paralysis. You have this feeling that you can't breathe because you don't have conscious control of your diaphragm so it feels heavy. I remember seeing green flashes of lights and thinking the devil or ghosts were there. And you can't move; you try to make your body move and nothing will move. It's quite terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about demons, but for me it’s always an ominous malevolent presence.</p>
<p>It’s a deep, visceral feeling of terror. When I’ve faced terrifying situations, even including possibly losing my life, it was nothing like sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>For anyone who has not had it:</p>
<p>Imagine the feeling you would have in the most terrifying situation you could possibly imagine. Now imagine that feeling drilling to the deepest primal parts of you, right down to your core, and you’re mostly-to-completely paralyzed. You can’t turn your head to look where that terror is coming from. You can’t move your hands, feet, head. You just have to live it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I usually woke halfway through by the missus panicking, because I'd try and put up the step ladder against the bed to get into the loft that wasn't there. That one made ME shit myself, let alone her!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah yeah, we all know that's just what you <em>told</em> her when in reality, you were having that recurring dream that you were Macho Man Randy Savage, about to drop a sick elbow and win the match</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few weeks ago, my mother found me at my desk. I'd fallen asleep playing a video game. Thing is, I was completely spark out, snoring my head off - but I was still playing the game.</p>
<p>Not the first time that kind of thing's happened to me with my mum. A few years ago, she called me up and asked if I could do her a spreadsheet. I did it in about half an hour and emailed it to her. An hour after that email, I woke up in bed, got up, did stuff, none the wiser. Spoke to my mum at lunch and she thanked me for the spreadsheet. I had <em>no idea</em> what she was talking about. Looked on my PC - a new spreadsheet on my desktop, emails where I sent it to her. Turns out that I answered the phone, held a full conversation, got up, booted my PC up, made a spreadsheet, sent it, called her, told her I'd sent it, confirmed she had it and it was OK, shut down the PC, and gone back to bed, all while asleep.</p>
<p>Now if I could do it reliably or in a way I could target it, I'd be literally able to sleep through work and then have all my waking hours to myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out Mike Birbiglia’s movie “Sleepwalk With Me,” which is based on his real life. He has REM Behavior Disorder, which can cause him to act out his dreams because his body isn’t paralyzed while he sleeps. This let to him jumping out of a closed second story window to escape a missile in his dream. </p>
<p>It’s a very funny movie, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm mostly just curious how it translates. Do their dreams adapt to fit the environment they have to move through or does their body take the dream sequence and &quot;map&quot; it to the real environment?</p>
<p>In this instance, if you're dreaming of escaping a missile, how do you end up jumping out of a real window unless the house in the dream was set up just like that person's real house?</p></div>		</li>
