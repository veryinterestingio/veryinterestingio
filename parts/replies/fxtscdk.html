<p><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/smartphone-power-compared-to-apollo-432/" target="_blank">There's more computing power in a USB-C charger or TI-84 calculator. </a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. But it's much more incredible than you might think.</p>
<p>The sensors mentioned here are (at least in case of gyros and accelerometers) micromechanic, actually microelectromechanic parts.</p>
<p>Accelerometers e.g. have a tuning fork shaped miniature metal part inside them. Much like a a big piece of thin metal, this thing has an inertia, so it tries to rest at its place when you move it. By measuring this inertia, these sensors determine if something is accelerating them.</p>
<p>And they have this structure in a 3d shape, so they can detect the acceleration around all 3 axes. Yes this thing is within your phone and it is smaller than a lady bug.</p>
<p>If anything is wrong in this, please correct me.</p>
<p>Gyros are a bit harder to explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing is that the accelerometer doesn't measure the inertia of the mass inside, it measures the force that mass applies to its support structure. Mostly just semantics, really. </p>
<p>Oh, and yes, smaller than a ladybug, but much, much smaller. A package containing a 3 axis accelerometer, a 3 axis gyroscope, and the board to interpret the results from both is about half the size of a ladybug. Crazy stuff.</p></div>		</li>
