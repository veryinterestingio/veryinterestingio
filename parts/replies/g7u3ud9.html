			<div class="markdown"><p>Once happened to me in church.  Christmas Eve mass.   Most heavily attended mass of the year.  I was in the choir.  Facing sideways, closest to the congregation.   I did a really good foot plant too to make sure it was loud and noticed by everyone.   Good times.</p></div>		</li>
