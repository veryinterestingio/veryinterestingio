			<div class="markdown"><p>Size (and consequently, how it supports itself), pests, and environmental stresses (too much water, drought, high winds, etc.) are the three things that typically take down a tree. You can also add forest fires in those areas that get them frequently.</p>
<p>Otherwise a tree will typically continue to live as long as none of the four overwhelm it. Bristlecone pines are an excellent example of trees continuing to truck along for <em>many centuries</em> without a care in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some pine tree forest require forest fires to maintain a healthy environment! My university is built on a natural Florida pine forest and the university burns certain parts of the preserve on campus to maintain the low shrub level that a lot of organisms in this environment prefer, and to ensure other invasive tree species don’t take over. The pine cones also pop when temperatures rise in a fire releasing the seeds to help with reproduction! Just a little known fact about Florida trees I find interesting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out the Carboniferous period. In a nutshell, it was the time when trees existed, but the bacteria to break them down (rot) did not. Trees would grow to be absolutely massive, and would only die or fall due to structural issues. Once fallen, there was no bacteria that could really break them down, so they piled on top of each other. As they got covered, this formed a lot of the coal that is now mined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Admittedly it’s been a while (years) but last I looked into heartwood there was some debate over whether or not it should be classified as “dead”   The wood is definitely chemically inert but doesn’t decompose like wood otherwise would so not everyone agreed it should be described as dead. </p>
<p>Has that been settled?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood doesn't normally decompose without some help.  In fact this was suggested to be the major reason why during the Carboniferous-Permian period there were massive amounts of coal formed because of large plant debris that were not broken down.  The exact causes of why this happened is up for debate with one side saying it was because fungus had not evolved enough to break the lignin in the wood to another saying it had more to do with the climate of Pangea.  But we do know that if left to its own devices wood will just hang around because of all the large pieces of wood we have dug up in coal mines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would consider it to be dead. It has no nuclei, no biological activity, and no ability to grow or reproduce. The reason it doesn't decompose is because the tree secretes compounds that inhibit decomposition into its heartwood, and because the tree generally tries to maintain a barrier between the outside world that keeps out pathogens, just like animals do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe your answer is misleading or i'm reading it wrong but trees do have lifespans. Many live longer than humans so they seem ageless but they do have a limit. </p>
<p>A good example of this is a tree that's super common in the Midwest is a Quaking Aspen. It's a pioneer species so it's one of the first trees to grow in after a forest clearing such as a wildfire. However, their lifespans are only about 20 years so they die and make room for more permanent hard woods to grow in. </p>
<p>These hard wood trees also don't live forever, but still for a very long time</p>
<p>Here's a link from Virginia Tech to back up my point

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point but this is distinctly different than what we think of when we imagine animal lifespans. </p>
<p>These aspen <em>are</em> a pioneer species and they <em>do</em> die in roughly 20 years. They do not &quot;die to make way&quot; for the hard wood species, however. That would imply that the Aspen would die regardless of outside influence, which is not true. What actually happens is that the slow growing, shade tolerant hard wood trees eventually grow taller than the Aspen over that 20 year period. Once they're tall enough to shade the Aspen, the Aspen dies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesnt quaking Aspen also form clonal colonies from its root system? So even if one of the trees dies there are still several others that are genetically identical and connected to the same root system.</p></div>		</li>
