			<div class="markdown"><p>How much of it is olfactory satiation, I wonder? This is to do with the phenomenon of &quot;it tastes better the next day&quot; - the idea being that if you've spent an hour+ labouring over a dish in the kitchen, your sense of smell becomes somewhat dulled to that particular dishes profile which lessens your taste of it as well when it comes time to eat.</p>
<p>Giving your palate time to &quot;reset&quot; so-to-speak can enhance the flavour of a dish (even more reason to let that poor steak rest after searing it before you dig in!) by allowing your olfactory to acclimate to a more &quot;neutral&quot; profile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little trick is that in many dishes adding a hit of acid can enhance the flavor nicely beyond what can be done with just salts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up, restaurants probably butcher their own meat, so they'll buy the whole section of the animal and cut and trim it to their own uses. Like you buy a steak, they buy the whole part the steaks are cut from, and cut their own steaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filets cost about $15 a pound bulk. A good steakhouse will buy the whole tenderloin and turn the bad cuts (end cuts/fat/gristle) into hamburger. If you are paying less than $15 a pound for your beef, don’t expect restaurant quality. The key to good steaks is HIGH heat (several bags of charcoal) for a shorter time.</p></div>		</li>
