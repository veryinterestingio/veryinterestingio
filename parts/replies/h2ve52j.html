			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't help that sugar is so abundant in everything nowadays. Thinking of a medieval person that I assume would eat mostly grains and legumes, with some lard and the occasional meat. I don't imagine they would've felt such effects if their brain wasn't accustomed to a constant stream of sugar. Ketosis happens even if you eat but don't eat any carbs, like a hunter only eating game, or nowadays, people on the keto diet. They often describe the switch to such keto diets as something similar to going cold turkey on a lesser drug, for about a week, after which you start to feel maybe even better than before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the start of your &quot;fasting&quot; and if you are inexperienced with fasting? Sure.
But over the long run brains who stick with the keto diet functions exactly like a &quot;normal&quot; brain would.
There is even evidence that strict ketone diet can actually enhance your cardio output, but we're talking about people running ultra marathons (50 km - 1000 km)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For that transitionary period yes, your brain is like a sputtering car. But we have internal mechanisms to fuel the brain with or without carbs going into our mouths. After that mechanism kicks in you won't feel very different, it will be like an electric car that runs a diesel generator. </p>
<p>And with that last bit you'd think, well yes, and that sounds terribly inefficient. But apart from medical reasons, many others choose keto diets because they keep the body on its toes, survival &amp; energetically speaking. Someone on a keto diet with a very slight caloric deficit will consistently lose weight in a pretty controlled manner (body will prefer fat instead of muscle) because their body's fat gets picked up along the rest of the stuff that gets converted to carbs. They might literally lose fat while they're sleeping. To normal diets this doesn't happen because even if you don't eat after 6pm or whatever, not much ketosis will have happened by the time you wake up. On a keto diet, you're always in ketosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. Most likely its a sugar crash that makes someone feel sluggish at noon time when eating sugary breakfast is the norm.</p></div>		</li>
