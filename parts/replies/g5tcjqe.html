			<div class="markdown"><p>It seem like a huge loop hole these days where the previous president has plenty of time to pardon anyone under a current federal investigation but in time the next president comes in. Wouldn’t this be to the benefit to either side of politics to end that loop hole? Or is it a loop hole that’s left open to be used?</p>
<p>Please understand this is a question from someone stand on the side lines looking in and wanting a better understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right, many of the things we do in terms of government are outdated. But Americans are very resistant to changing stuff like this. There is a high value of doing things as theyre written in our constitution, which was written back in the 1700's lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the system is slow to change by design. That's not to say there aren't changes that should be made, but it's less about current attitudes and more about the philosophy of government that the constitution was written with in mind.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>Since its creation in 1901, Australia has changed its constitution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Australia#Alterations_to_the_Constitution" target="_blank">eight times</a>.  In the same time frame, the US has made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution" target="_blank">twelve</a> changes.</p>
<p>As /u/tsuuga says, there's a ton of stuff in the US Constitution that assumes people and information move no faster than horseback and sailing ship.  But the Australian Constitution was written over a century later.  In 1901, Australia's Constitution-writers had access to trans-continental telegraphs, steamships, and a large railroad network that would cross the continent a few years later.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think Australia and the US are more similar than different in the election challenges they face and their resistance to Constitutional change.  If there's a big difference, it's that the more recent Australian system assumes higher technology, and its parliamentary system allows government to switch over more quickly, without waiting for electors to meet in person.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this is very common, and it is often used to good reasons as well.</p>
<p>I don't think there is a single president who has not pardoned multiple people in my lifetime.   </p>
<p>Remember, that other than pardons a president can't do much on their own that could not be easily undone once the next president takes office.  Presidents do not make law on their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept is called “lame duck” and it applies not only to the president but all elected officials who have this gap. Do some googling around that, there are a lot of interesting stories!

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note that this system was designed to operate in a time when transport was horse or sail.  So if everyone in the state voted on November 3rd, that gave time for all of the ballots to be collected from all over the state and then counted.  Time for the members of the electoral college to travel to the capital to cast their votes on Jan 14th.  Time for the Senate to take their Christmas break and then come back and count the votes from the electoral college.  Time to let the candidate know that they won and, if need be, move all of their stuff and family to the capital.  </p>
<p>Back then it took three days to get from Philadelphia to New York.  Six days from Boston to New York.  And plenty of people had to come from much farther.  Georgia to New York is almost a thousand miles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you want change, vote in smaller elections.</p></div>		</li>
