			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I believe these stores have essentially no inventory, the mattresses are just made and shipped from the factory after being bought. So the business has low overhead, because the real estate footprint is just the showroom, no stocking issues, etc.</p>
<p>It does raise the question, however, why competition has not been more effective at cutting into those profits. I assume those bricks and mortar businesses will eventually be destroyed by the internet-only firms selling foam mattresses, but I suppose it depends on how much people value being able to lie on a few mattresses before making up their mind.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>One reason for consumers’ insistence on buying in a store is that each mattress chain commissions unique models from major manufacturer, available only in its stores—and nowhere else. In truth, these models vary only superficially, but the naming differences make it difficult to compare prices and quality across different stores. Also, without truly objective measures of mattress quality, the shopping process is a crapshoot. Should I pick the Dual Effects® gel memory foam from one manufacturer, Posturepedic™ foam from a second, or the SmartClimate™ System with Tempur® foam from a third? (Notice that all the names are trademarked.) Many shoppers find they can’t answer such questions without consultation with a salesperson.</p>

The rub was that there wasn't any store - it was always an enterprising guy (or couple of people) who bought surplus for pennies on the dollar and would just post on the internet and deliver mattresses from a truck all day.</p>
<p>No try-before-you-buy and so the best you could do was pick size and firmness (so it's a bit of a crapshoot) but the mattresses were definitely totally new and from well known brands. I did this 3-4 times in my 20's (2x in NYC, 1x in SF, 1x in Boston) and every single time the mattress I got was fantastic quality and very clearly unused/never unwrapped before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer that question.  People run businesses for a profit.  If there is more profit to be had by keeping your prices even with the next guy.  You both make more money and do less work.</p>
<p>If you undercut, you have to do more work, and make less, and this can also cause the other guy to then cut his prices. Great for consumers, terrible for someone trying to make as much money as possible.  And these companies are looking to make as much money as possible.</p>
<p>As a business, would you rather sell 4 mattresses and make $2000 profit or 10 mattresses for $2000 profit.</p>
<p>I've had my own furniture store for 10 years now.  Other than last year, I've had growth in all sides of my store.  Online mattress sales might be taking some sales, but I'm not seeing them take from me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yea, mattress stores are going to be one of the last things to go online, if ever.</p>
<p>You don't make the purchase often. When you do, you want to get it right, because you'll be using it for several years. As in, LITERALLY using it for years worth of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thoughts are correct, but to put perspective on things. Markups are more like 40-50% of the cost of manufacture. Most retail is less than 10%, so mattresses make a lot per unit.</p>
<p>Everyone sleeps on one (probably). So there are 100-200 million mattresses in the US that need replacing every 5-10 years.  If we say that there are 100 million mattresses and they are replaced every 10 years, that's 10 million mattresses being bought every year. If there are 5000 stores, each store sells  an average of 2000 mattresses per year, that's 5.5 mattresses sold per day in each store. At 5000 stores in the US, that makes them approximately as common as McDonald's restaurants. (5000 vs 14000) There's enough where you see them 'all over the place.'</p>
<p>Average mattress price is $1000, so the mattress store only needs to sell 20-30 mattresses a month to cover overhead, basically 1 per day. At $1000, cost to manufacture is \~$700, and $300 of profit. $300 of profit times 30 days is $9000/month, more than enough to rent retail space and pay at least several people to work in the store.</p>
<p>If you sell 5 per day, you're clearing $1500/day profit X 365 day and you're talking a (multi?)million dollar store. Multiply that million dollar store by 500 across the country and you're into the range of the company making a billion dollars in profit.</p>
<p>Also, most people aren't going to say &quot;hey, lets go hang out in the mattress store&quot; so the people who do go are usually serious about buying a mattress and that cuts down on foot traffic. If 10 people walk in the door, 5 are probably going to buy something (while the other 5 are comparing between stores and eventually buy something elsewhere).</p>
<p>Also, &quot;back in my day&quot; people would go to the department store to buy their mattress. With their demise, the 'specialty' mattress store has opened and that's part of why they proliferated.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several independent websites devoted to providing info and ratings on all things related to mattresses. The one common comment you will find on the sites, and provided by insiders in the industry, is that mattresses are actually marked up 8X  to 10x, or more,  their hard production cost, depending on the point of purchase.  So your post is good info. in a general economics perspective, but the numbers you assume for the cost of the product are way, way off. </p>
<p>The answer to the OP's question is pretty simple. The product is sold at staggering mark-ups, and that gross profit can support a hell of a lot of advertising, and high cost retail stores. Throw in commissioned sales staff, and you get the greasiness of a car dealership,  and the markup of a street corner drug buy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus it works like any other business. You go in buy a mattress then you need box springs, mattress  covers, pillows, pillow cases, warranties etc. Plus they pass the cost of shipping to the consumer by charging a delivery/setup charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless cleaned <strong>extremely</strong> well, probably. Every night you're going to deposit dead skin cells and the dirt on them into your sheets, some of which will get ground down into the mattress' outer layer. This will create fun smells and the possibility of leaving something on the mattress that can reinfect you at a later date.</p>
<p>Plus, depending on the internal construction (tempurpedic is obviously different) things like spring are going to wear out over time and won't support you properly. I'd visit the Tempurpedic site and see what their recommendations are for replacement times though.</p></div>		</li>
