			<div class="markdown"><p>Incredible. This should be the law everywhere. Put out a lie? You have to publicly recant and pay for it out of your own pocket. Maybe add scaling fines or jail time for repeat offenders. It would definitely cut down on lying in advertisements, and hiding behind false or biased studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's fair to call it a lie. If they were just going to lie, they could not bother with actually performing any tests. The whole point of the shady process there is so that you can make such claims <em>without</em> lying (although the claim is not scientifically sound).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deceit is lying.  If they didn't know that they were being deceptive, then they have to own up to the mistake when pointed out.  If they did know they were being deceptive, then they have to own up to the mistake.  We can often understand someone's motives by careful observation of their methods.  The fact that they didn't care to share the N number of tests that contradicted the results that they liked strongly implies that they were willfully being deceptive and, therefore, lying.</p></div>		</li>
