			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much ‘north Germany’ more like ‘west Germany, maybe a little to the north’ and definitely not falling into the sea. There’s a whole country between the Ruhrgebiet and the sea, it’s called the Netherlands that is sinking and at risk of ‘falling into the sea’. The video you linked explains it quite well, the valleys are at risk of flooding from rivers that can no longer flow where they used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could just build an open aqueduct to the Sahara desert. It would desalinate itself and the water would go where it needs it.</p>
<p>Problem is: how does the water to flow there? Usually gravity is reliable, but if you are below sea level, it gets more complicated. Specifically, it's moving against a potential energy gradient. That's going to take energy in some form.</p>
<p>Giant sea walls, dykes, tidal gates, and pumps keep most of the country above water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an open valley with no obstructions, maybe, but it’s a densely populated area and I believe it would span a very large distance. Both making the initial investment cost quite steep.</p></div>		</li>
