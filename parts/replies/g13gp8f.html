<p>I really liked Amadeus because of the way they cast Mozart as more punk rock than classical musician because that is how he was perceived within his culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The depiction of Mozart in that film was probably exaggerated, although the effect it has on us is probably similar to the way his behavior was viewed at the time (which I think is what you're saying). Also, neither J.S. Bach nor Mozart were famous in their time to the extent that they are known today. Bach was a church musician whose fame didn't really go beyond the cities he worked in (mostly Leipzig), and Mozart was a child prodigy whose fame subsided in adulthood--he was known among musicians and in courts, but mostly he was a music teacher and composer for hire who wouldn't get recognized on the street. Bach's music was revived by Felix Mendelssohn in the 19th century, and Mozart's wife worked throughout her life after Mozart's death to preserve his legacy and eventually bring him to national and international fame. </p>
<p>Beethoven, on the other hand, was quite famous in his time. He was the one of the first musicians to become wealthy through sheet music sales alone, obviating the need for a noble or church patron.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, Bach was fairly well known as an organist. He was often called in to test out a newly built organ (<em>Orgelprobe</em>), but certainly would not have been in the top 10 most popular composers of the time.  (But your point about Bach the composer stands.)</p>
<p>By the time of his death (1750) his composer sons Carl Phillip Emmanuel, William Friedman, and Johann Christian were composing in the new, fashionable galant style that would develop into what we call the classical style.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bach, in a way, was not breaking new ground at all. Bach's music would be the equivalent of a new band coming along today and doing 1960's rock so well that in 100 years it's just talked about as if it were one of the best works in the style. In other words, Bach's earlier baroque musical stylings were already somewhat out of vogue by the time he produced them, but they stood the test of time and he's regarded as one of the best baroque composers now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to consider that classical music is composed completely differently than soundtrack music. There are different structures and such that dictate how motifs are elaborated over a piece or set of pieces. Soundtrack music is not generally composed in this way.</p>
<p>Someone who listens to classical regularly can feel that there is less structure in this way. It's the same kind of difference if you read a lot of structured poetry and then you read some kind of freeform stuff. They're both &quot;poetry&quot; but they are vastly different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to explain the difference between good and mediocre classical music without sounding pretentious because without your audience being exposed to enough of it you're left only with technical sounding things.</p>
<p>If people were more used to listening to all manner of classical music of all eras, it would be more obvious. </p>
<p>Best example I can think of is TV.  What makes a good series better than a mediocre one?  Well, structure, themes, character, meaning. These are all technical, but because we're more exposed to television it's easier for us to discuss the merits and relative qualities without having to be as technical.</p>
<p>If we were alive in the age of Beethoven, his genius would be much more obvious to us because we'd be more exposed to other examples AND because we'd naturally be well versed enough to identify how well he's using things like theme, structure, counterpoint, etc. (and good thing the internet didn't exist back when Beethoven wrote Fidelio).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it’s inaccurate to say that they serve different purposes and therefore can’t be directly compared. You read a graphic novel for its own sake; it’s a standalone work. Wallpaper serves a different purpose: it complements other features of a room or backdrop, and it is in a sense only complete in that context.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is kind of meaningless because not all classical music is composed the same way. A Bach cantata has very little in common structurally with a Debussy fantaisie yet they’re both lumped into the “classical” category.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck.  You can see that even without going back 200 years.   Pick a year in the not-too-recent-past, say 2002.  Lookup the billboard top 100 from that year.   How many of them would you say were still popular (at least popular enough that you'd recognize it).   Now, go back to 1992, then, 1982.  Most songs that were popular in their day are no longer listened to and, the songs that are still listened to are frequently NOT the ones that were at the top of the charts in their day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I think you're stretching a bit on some of that...</p>
<p>But, my point is just that the farther back you go, the less familiar most of those songs and artists are.  Yet, among the chaff, there are some which have stood the test of time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are those that are not on the billboard lists at all, but are still regarded as quite good.  Led Zeppelin IV, released in November 1971, is nowhere on either the 1971 or 1972 lists, and that's the album with Stairway to Heaven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the only &quot;recent&quot; composer I wholeheartedly believe will stand the test of time and become a legend centuries from now like Beethoven would be John Williams (Star Wars, Jaws, E.T, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park many more classics), and that's mainly due to the movies themselves being timeless masterpieces. Everyone knows the Jaws Theme, everyone knows the Star Wars OT theme, everyone knows the Jurassic Park theme due to movie popularity as these films were so groundbreaking and influential to the industry they've become part of movie culture as a whole, along with their respective themes.</p></div>		</li>
