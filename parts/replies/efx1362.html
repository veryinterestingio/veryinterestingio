			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not. I'm talking about 1926. First known case of land subsidence due to oil extraction. I can try to find some citations and edit in a sec...</p>
<p>Edit: Source: Pratt and Johnson found more than one meter of land subsidence in Houston caused by oil extraction. First known case, published in Geology, v. 37, 1926.</p>
<p>Edit 2: but to be fair, I completely agree that groundwater extraction is a way bigger culprit almost everywhere. Possibly even in Houston. </p>
<p>I'm not an expert on Houston's subsidence. The cases I studied were New Orleans, Dhaka and the Yellow River Delta. </p></div>		</li>
