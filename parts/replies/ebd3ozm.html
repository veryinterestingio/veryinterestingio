			<div class="markdown"><p>A shock wave technically doesn’t have a frequency - frequency is how many waves occur per second, and explosions generally only produce a single wave. It would be like trying to find the slope of a line from only one point, there’s just no way to do it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true.  A shock wave certainly does have a frequency; it's just very high.  Remember, you've got a rise in pressure as the shock wave hits then a drop in pressure back to normal as it passes -- actually, IIRC, below normal, before it equalizes.  So you've got at least half a cycle to work with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both yes and no. The shockwave is just that, one massive but singular wave, and as such does not have a frequency per se, as frequency is the measure of the number of waves per second (s^-1 ). The shockwave displaces a large amount of air, so as the wave passes you have the progression from equilibrium - hightened pressure from blastwave - lowered pressure as consequence of previously displaced air - equilibrium (1 full wavelength). This can also be translated into frequency, which is high as a result of the speed, and as such the wave is theoretically high frequency, while not being a frequency in the first place.</p>
<p>This is considering the initial shockwave itself, and not the following mass of airwaves behind the blastwave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the confusion's coming from the conflation of soundwaves and shockwaves. Explosions still occur over time and have frequencies within them based on how they occurred. For instance if you took black powder and contemporary smokeless propellant and configured them in shells to have the same burn-time, you would have the same period for both shockwaves but the black powder would be a lower pitched lower amplitude shockwave, whilst the smokeless powder would be a higher pitched yet higher amplitude shockwave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to describe it as having a frequency -- which is a somewhat dubious proposition in the first place -- it has &quot;all the frequencies&quot;.  If you're representing it as continuous repeating waves, you end up needing an infinite number of them, with different frequencies... they end up canceling out at every place other than that one location with a peak.</p>
<p>Note that this applies to everything from explosions to claps to sparks.</p>
<p>However, waves don't necessarily travel at the same speed.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeuI8AJMIxU" target="_blank">Thus, if you're far away, you might experience them sounding different from a sharp crack.</a></p>
<p>E: This is also why you can hear it.  If it was all high frequency, it would be outside your hearing range.</p>
<p>Also, at very long distances, high frequencies get attenuated... which is why you can just hear a low rumbling from explosions far enough away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The glass breaks because the resonant vibrations have standing nodes with constructive interference, which build up until it can’t bend any further. The resonant frequency of the human gut is ~200Hz IIRC, which is why some festival subwoofers will shake your stomach. Obviously it varies from person to person, but either way it’s in the audible range </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are right. Im not saying you would have to hit the human guts resonant frequency to pull a person apart, it was just an example of air moving, and breaking things. </p></div>		</li>
