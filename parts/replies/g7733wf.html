			<div class="markdown"><p>A few different tests. Polysomnography is the main test, either with or without the head wires. We can measure peoples respiratory effort, oxygen saturations, airway pressures, ECG and if necessary, leg movements. Mainly, its to help diagnose OSA, but also CSA, RLS and PLMD. We also do Multiple Sleep Latency Tests, which involves multiple naps over the day to diagnose Narcolepsy or Hypersomnolence. In the lab, I attach everything, analyse the data and write the report for the sleep or respiratory consultants. My actual title is a Neurophysiological Scientist because I do EEGs etc, but most of my job role atm is sleep related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I never really got about sleep labs is it sure seems like people would have difficulty sleeping in a strange environment with a bunch of shit attached to their heads and institutional grade bedding?  How in the world do you still manage to get valuable data?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I spoke with a sleep scientist once about how accurate sleep trackers are and he basically said they are marketing gimmicks. Unless you sleep perfectly still and your heart slows consistently whilst sleeping theres nothing to go off of.. sleep is largely determined by brainwave activity so unless your Fitbit can attach electrodes to your head it cant account for much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don´t know, mine is pretty accurate. It clocks exactly when I wake up, and obviously I can´t say for sure when I fell asleep, but there hasn´t been any surprise so far, like I am going bed at 1, remember the podcast until 1:20 and the watch says I´ve been asleep at 1:30 or so.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Oh Ok one surprise: I was on my first party since lockdown last week, outdoor party of course, so we camped instead of crashing inside the house. Yeah it was cold. I was drunk as hell and slept for 4 hours, so my clock should have told me I had slept shittily. But it estimated my sleep as really good because my pulse and breathing was very low- which was because I had almost frozen solid.</p>
<p>So yeah no, my resting pulse rate is normally about 48, not 43, it was not due to my being rested, it was due to my being cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's accurate to a degree, like I said on a previous comment they are good for sleep hygiene so going to sleep and waking up they are fairly accurate. The problem arises when people take stock of what it's saying overnight. My opinion on them is that use them, let them give you an idea of what your sleep is like, but like with your party they can be inaccurate sometimes so take any results with a pinch of salt. If you're really worried, get a proper test!!</p></div>		</li>
