			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, LA spearheaded the idea of reuse of existing facilities for the 1984 games to massive success. They are still one of the most profitable games ever hosted. By negating the need to spend millions building specialized facilities for athletics, swimming, rowing, etc and then capitalizing on sponsorship deals they ended up with a very large net profit. Every city from Tokyo forward is using this same model at this point.
I think part of the reason we see this question often is because a) it makes bigger news when countries see huge losses (Rio, Sochi, Tokyo*) as opposed to when a country is successful (London, Beijing, LA) and b) because it was only recently that the IOC really started to consider the full bid packages (since they have caps on gifts and are being watched more closely) and have considered long term impacts on cities and nations. Tokyo, Paris, and LA all won their bids in large part because they were simply revitalizing existing venues and don’t have a need to build new infrastructure (roads, public transit, etc) to successfully host the games. Tokyo got screwed since they are seeing no tourism from this and are not even selling tickets, because of the entire situation they have also lost a ton of huge sponsorships too. </p>
<p>To answer OPs question as well, cities generally see a sizable uptick in philanthropic activity immediately before and for some years after they host games as well as an uptick in exports for similar periods as it serves as a signal to the world that they are open and prosperous. It is also a way to influence spending on needed infrastructure like public transit and roads that otherwise may not get the funding needed (this is not in itself a justification to host the games, but rather another tangible benefit).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the IOC has since learned to stop awarding wins to famously corrupt governments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness while the Sochi games &quot;cost&quot; 55 billion, that figure was part of a comprehensive regional development project. Only about 10.7b was spent on the games themselves, which was itself massively cost overrun due to all the normal corruption/ect.</p>

<p>Why would the IOC care? The host country is responsible for whatever costs are associated beyond the various sponsorships. It's no skin off their back if China/Russia or whoever waste money on a prestige project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LA is reusing again, they are building some new things like I think a swimming stadium which will be used by one of the colleges after iirc and better train transportation to LAX which doesn’t exist at all.</p>
<p>I don’t think Tokyo and upcoming Paris really had to build too much, not like some of the last games anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite frankly it will be worth a loss if LA can get better train transportation to LAX. That’s a truly hideous drive. And lately the traffic has been so bad there. Last time I was being dropped off there, the last mile took almost thirty minutes. I thought I was going to miss my flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth breaking down a bit who is making a profit and who a loss. The government making a loss to enable the private sector to make a profit, for example, is arguably a legitimate function of government (and is frequently an illegitimate one to boot) and so if that's happening no one minds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we accept that the government should make an intentional loss to support private businesses for the purpose of public benefit, we must compare it with what benefits the corresponding investment would have made if the actual games were excluded.</p>
<p>Too often the games are celebrated as a success and net profit of a huge investment, when there is no comparison with a similar huge investment without the games.</p>
<p>E.g. if infrastructure, hotels and businesses were helped along the way with billions in subsidiaries and tax relief but not building enormous facilities for rather obscure sports.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the Olympics but the Commonwealth games is being held next year in Birmingham UK where i live.</p>
<p>I think the money they will make from all the new housing they are building to create the athlete's village will probably make the whole thing profitable on its own.</p>
<p>As far as i know all the sporting venues are either pre existing or have a solid use lined up for afterwards.</p>
<p>Add in all the income from visitors to the city and we should at least be breaking even on the whole thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. While the legacy aspect of London was great in theory the reality has been somewhat mixed. </p>
<p>All of the London athletes village buildings failed subsequent fire safety checks after Grenfell. The result is the majority of owners many of whom only own a partial share, are on the hook for up to £100k each to fix cladding and fire barrier issues. </p>
<p>The local property market literally exploded overnight and is still cooling off. In an area you could get a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment for ~£400k pre-Olympics, within a year they were going for up to £720k, immediately pricing out all the locals who’d sat and watched the new apartments be built and suffered the disruption. </p>
<p>Now the wider regeneration of Stratford and the lower Lea valley is real and ongoing. The Olympic park is still under heavy construction a decade later building more housing and cultural quarters. Overall the games were a positive boost for a long planned regeneration, but I wouldn’t say the housing part of the legacy has been any kind of meaningful success beyond fuelling the already bonkers London property market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting!</p>
<p>I think it did a good thing for the rental market though. I rented one of the flats for a while and in a world of greedy and selfish london landlords, it was the best experience I've had and an awesome community to live in. I wish there was more decent and affordable rentals in London like this.</p></div>		</li>
