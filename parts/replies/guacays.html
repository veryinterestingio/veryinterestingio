			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so .. I'm confused. Its path is a singular point and other objects pass through that point? Or a photon's path is a 2-d line? Or a line projecting out into every direction, if so what is the central point of that then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A photon would see the universe as 2d, with it's beginning and end being the same points. From this perspective nothing happens, everything just is. </p>
<p>Of course if the photon gets reflected at any point it's not as simple as just squishing the universe in one dimension, you need to take into account light cones and causality like normal, but a photon litterally doesn't have time to see that. It's like a long exposure picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation I heard was that the speed of light is also the speed of time, in a manner of speaking, because light is 4 dimensional and time is the 4th dimension of spacetime. This means everything travels at the speed of light through space-time, all the time. It's just that for normal objects, most of that velocity is in the 4th dimension.</p>
<p>BUT, if you start to add a 3d space vector, it takes away from your 4th dimension vector. The faster you go, the slower you go through time, until--well, since real objects evidently can't go the speed of light through space, we have to look to photons to see what happens. You get a particle that moves at lightspeed through realspace, and doesn't move at all through time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my favorite description of spacetime, it really shows how time and space are equivalent and how they interact. </p>
<p>It gets crazy again when you realize that less speed through time means you experience less time, but you don't slow down, rather things look shorter.</p></div>		</li>
