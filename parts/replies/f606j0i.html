			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst we can’t prescribe a set routine, as outlined below, regularity or consistency is important.</p>
<ul>
<li>Light is the strongest signal that controls your circadian rhythms. Keep your days bright and your nights dark. </li>
<li>Food intake and activity also impacts your rhythms, so eating and moving at night can throw off your rhythms.</li>
<li>It’s important to consider what chronotype you are (how early or how late you typically get up and sleep) - if you can, try to work, be active and sleep according to your individual rhythm</li>
</ul>
<p>The clocks in your body are influenced by light (via the brain), but also respond to additional “environmental” and lifestyle cues such as food, physical activity, and even signals from molecules and drugs like caffeine. This means that if you are suddenly shifting your wake time, exercise routine, or eating schedule (for instance, because of shift work or jet lag) this may disrupt your body’s rhythms. Conversely, knowing how ‘timing’ of these environmental and lifestyle factors influence your circadian rhythm can help you maintain a more “optimal” circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Light is the strongest input signal (“Zeitgeber”) to the circadian system, so this will be the most important cue to consider. Light in the morning is really important to anchor your clock to the 24h day, and by keeping a regular sleep/wake schedule, you help your system to receive the input it needs to be in synch. If your wake and sleep time shifts a lot, it can produce what’s known as social jetlag. Evening light will shift your clock later. So unless you are trying to wake up later, try to minimize evening light exposure prior to bedtime. </p>
<p>Moreover, research over the last decades has shown that the body favors the alignment of multiple of these circadian cues. For instance, food intake occurring during the daytime (i.e. when we typically would be exposed to sunlight), promotes metabolic health and also possibly better sleep. Conversely, food intake that is out of sync with our normal “daytime” has been linked to impaired metabolism. This is what often occurs in shift work, in which people are exposed to light and food at “unexpected” times of the day, in relation to their “usual” schedule, which is what our body’s circadian rhythms is programmed to follow. In terms of food intake, our bodies also favor having a defined daily recurring time period when we eat (e.g. a 6-12-hr long window). When this time window is maintained as a routine, this allows the body to align our internal rhythms accordingly. This optimizes our ability to digest and metabolize food, which also will include a daily time window when to fast (which research shows should also overlap with our sleep period).</p>
<p>There is also emerging evidence that, in and of itself, curtailing sleep can disrupt circadian rhythms. Given that sleep has many restorative properties, this is perhaps not surprising. Sleep basically “restores” our internal systems down to the cellular level, which thus encompasses all levels at which the circadian clock operates. Adults are recommended to sleep 7-9 hours each night, but this is highly individual and should be based on how much sleep an individual needs to feel well.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that the timing of our body clocks varies between individuals - a common categorization is larks and owls (or morning people and evening people) and there is certainly a spectrum of sleep timings (chronotypes). So it’s also helpful to take into account these individual differences, and to find out your chronotype. Light in the evening delays the clock, and so the use of blue blockers in the evening may be especially useful for those who have trouble getting up in the morning (the owls, or later types) as this would reduce the impact of evening light. Similarly, reducing the brightness of screens in the evenings will also help to reduce evening light exposure.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the summer, it seems ideal to go to bed at sunset and get up at sunrise.  But as the nights get longer, is it healthier to go to bed at sunset, or to get up at sunrise?  Which should I use as my set-point?  Or should I use local-midnight* as my set-point, going to bed at local-8pm and getting up at local-4am regardless of the season?</p>
<p>** Local, as in, forgetting about time-zones entirely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And... assuming that's just not an option? I live in Norway. Which means that for a depressingly (hue hue) long time of the year, it will be dark when I go to work, dark when I go home. The intervening time is often not really practical to spend out of doors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use lights that can change color temperature. So during the day and early evening I use daylight temperatures (more blue, like full sun) and warm white (more orangeish) nearer to bedtime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded! As someone with narcolepsy, what's the optimal time to go to bed? Does it change with the time sunset happens? How do you figure it out?</p></div>		</li>
