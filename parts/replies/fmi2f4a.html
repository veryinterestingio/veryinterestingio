			<div class="markdown"><p>Having grown up in a house in Australia with no aircon during our boiling hot summers I have to say that I've never seen a single fan with the highest setting closest to the off setting. We had every type of fan you could imagine, box fans, desk fans, pedestal fans etc. and every fan we ever owned went from off to lowest to highest. There were some 2 speed fans we had where off would be in the middle and you flicked the switch either side depending which speed you wanted. Do anyone have a photo of one of these fans that go from high to low instead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Also Australian and I've never seen a fan like OP described. Maybe it's an American thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, half the people in this thread are now convinced that every fan needs super power to start moving their tiny fan blades. I lean more toward it's purely a design decision. When I was a child most fans started in low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assomeone who's been around dozens of fans, the vast majority of them go from Off to Low/Light or have Low and High on both sides. I've almost never encpuntered one where Off is next to High and doesn't have Low on the other side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Against my better judgement .. the reason ceiling fans go from high to low is that the 1st position is on. It's full mains voltage connected across the fan. The second position introduces a capacitor .. this causes the motor to slow. 3rd position  introduces a bigger capacitor. These motors are induction motors with no permanent magnets. It is however arbitrary for normal operation if you connect the big capacitor first or last. It is likewise arbitrary if you connect full mains voltage first or not. In the long term,  the capacitors will fail and the fan will (usually) continue to work on high and often on one of the slower speed settings too. Most consumer fans are designed to fail at some point and the easiest component to engineer failure into is the capacitor. The windings of the fan will fail but are generally very reliable because the manufacturer doesn't want a fire just under the ceiling. The design brief of these fans/ motors/ controllers is quite specific. The switch however is most reliable over time, usually,  when the first position supplies voltage without the voltage lag caused by the capacitor. As for start up torque,  this is a design criteria and usually the job for the recent graduate to calculate as an exercise. Most often,  for the size motor we're  talking about it isn't an issue. But when the fan starts to fail .. either coil  windings start to fail and or the capacitor(s) begin to break down,  you can see a fan that hasn't quite got enough grunt to tick over yet give it a spin by hand and it'll chug all afternoon! I'm gonna stop now. I don't think humanity is any the wiser but maybe it helped <em>you</em> decide where on the fence to sit!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The weird thing about what you're saying is that I've never seen a ceiling fan start in high first. I've only seen it on small room fans. Every ceiling fan I've ever seen starts in low.</p></div>		</li>
