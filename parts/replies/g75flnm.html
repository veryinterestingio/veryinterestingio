			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an almost unbearable knot in my lower back, right side.. NOTHING helped.  One day I noticed I was sitting at a small, almost imperceptible angle to my computer.  Keeping my body in that endless slight twist, was causing the irritation.   I got a new chair, made sure I was sitting straight at the computer, bought an arm support and a wrist support, and it literally went away almost immediately.    Try to see if there's something like that--a position you're sitting in too long that stresses your muscles, or a repetitive motion?   </p>
<p>You could also try acupuncture, stretching exercises, yoga, talking to a sports doctor, or a neurologist.   It could be muscles, tendons, nerves, our bodies are weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People underestimate the power of your office chair. It isn't crazy to spend a few hundred on a chair that's comfy and keeps your posture correct. But you've got to go sit in them, test your desk height, remember that the floor models are a lot softer than the one in the box, and keep looking at many stores to find your perfect chair. A lot of gaming chairs are awful for example, they prey off the young gamers who don't know any better. You as an adult need to pay more attention to your back, I don't care if the chair has lights on it you need to focus on your posture. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. I started a new job in January and used the office chair they provided. After a month I had developed hemmroids and lower back pain. Brought my Ergohuman chair in to the office and within two weeks all the problems went away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are doing something on the daily to stress it, and over time it's never gotten to relax again, like a repetitive tension injury, or there's something wrong and it needs looked at. Should always go get stuff like this looked at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massage school graduate with overly flexible joints and lots of muscle tension to compensate here, ditto what this person said.</p>
<p>With perpetual knots like this, it's usually the result of an injury or repetitive strain that is causing the muscle and other tissues to tense up like armor to protect from strain.</p>
<p>If you can, I would highly recommend having a physical therapist or someone trained in Alexander Technique evaluate how you move or sit or what may be causing the tension, and give you exercises and adjustments.</p>
<p>It's important to note that repetitive strain and tension doesn't have to be dramatic, and can also come from muscles being too weak to carry out daily functions with ease.</p>
<p>Trying to stretch out these strained muscles all the time can actually make it worse, by making the muscle too flexible such that it has to work harder and tense up even more to carry out the task. Vicious cycle and etc.</p>
<p>Training and strengthening the muscle groups that are overworked seems counterintuitive, but it's like upgrading to a better engine--it won't crap out as much because it's better equipped to handle daily needs.</p>
<p>This is coming from my personal experience as someone who has overly loose joints, and as a result of trying to protect said joints without doing more strength training, muscles that are underpowered and always pushed to their limit + tense.</p>
<p>BUT. YMMV. So if the pain is persistent and serious, or in a delicate nerve area, get checked out by professionals.</p>
<p>edit: for anything close to the spine--doctor. Also hydration and sleep make a WORLD of difference. If not sleep, water pls. It's lube for your muscles and bones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconding this! I have hypermobile joints too, very very loose shoulder joints (if I fully relax my shoulder it partially dislocates), a lot lot lot of my muscle tension is just from holding joints in place. Doing PT to strengthen those muscle groups helps so much. World of difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha. Good luck with that. If you're young they'll just treat you like a pill seeker and deny that is destroying your life. </p>
<p>The last 15 years of my life have in part been a tragedy. I haven't been able to run in 15 years. For a while there I couldn't even walk. Doctors couldn't figure out why and essentially said it was my own fault. Because I was fat. .....I wasn't fat until I became disabled. The pain started before the weight gain. They didn't care.</p>
<p>I'm no longer overweight. How strange that I'm still in constant pain......the most recent doctor told me I should be happy I'm not dying of brain cancer and literally raised his voice at me to stop crying. I wasn't crying. I was misty eyed. Because apparently there is no hope for me. </p>
<p>Welcome to bring a woman in  chronic pain. Most of us have the same story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of shit doctors out there, good ones are rare. I got help for my physical stuff, but I'm currently being abused by every fake ass &quot;mental health clinician&quot; I come into contact with because my parents are lifelong abusers and none of these idiots are competent enough to grasp that abuse happens far more often, and is far more often the cause of, than any mental illness. Basically people are stupid and will take any opportunity to inflict cruelty and abuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this for a shoulder problem a few years back. </p>
<p>I remember I walking in and starting to do it was very unpleasant, but that was quickly outweighed by MASSIVE relief in the muscles. Feeling the tense and then release was like the best massage ever. </p>
<p>I walked out of there feeling like a newborn baby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had wrist pain for 9 months before I went to a doctor and was prescribed dry needling. Because American health insurance, I waited 3 more months before I actually went to PT. I was also extremely skeptical that it would work, but I was so tired of being in pain all the time. </p>
<p>They did the dry needling on my forearm and even some TENs on the needles. It was like a guitar string that had been too tightly tuned had suddenly been released. It was a little sore for a day but I could tell it was immensely better. I kept going to therapy for a few weeks, only had dry needling twice but worked on strength and flexibility, and was incredulous how it actually helped. </p>
<p>Turns out having your muscles wound up + weakness is a good recipe for pain. </p>
<p>Prologue: I had to stop after 6 weeks, because my insurance cycle reset and I have a $3500 deductible. A few weeks later I tried some knitting and brought the pain all back. But it's healing more quickly and I'm running my own home OT program based off of what I did with the actually qualified professionals. I hate our healthcare system.</p></div>		</li>
