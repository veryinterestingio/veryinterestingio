<p>ELI5 is not for literal 5-year olds.</p>

<li>A five-year old would be able to determine from context and the word 'reaction' that a Maillard reaction is some kind of thing that happens when food is exposed to high temperatures, perhaps intuiting that it must be at least a little bit gentle, with the oil mediating the heat transfer, so that the food doesn't burn. If he doesn't, perhaps he would ask 'and Mallard reactions'? and then you could explain them in turn.</li>
