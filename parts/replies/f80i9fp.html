<p>This part blew my mind. I've read this comment 100 times and still, it seems so correct. My mind can't stop thinking it's <strong>not</strong> missing something.</p>
<p>I already forget how many I counted, because I keep reading this thing over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I've heard professional transcribers will take 2-3 hours per 1 hour of audio to accurately transcribe audio, provided the recording is in good quality, which is odd.</p>
<p>It sounds like the transcribing industry need to hire professional stenographers instead to do it in live time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons, as far as I know:</p>
<p>One is the stenographers work more quickly. If you wanted to record audio and then play it back in the moment (&quot;Can you read that back to me&quot;) you'd have to rewind, and it's easier for a stenographer to look over their notes and find the right place than a guy pressing rewind. </p>
<p>Second is that if you went the transcription route, both lawyers would want copies of the tape to review, since presumably transcription isn't happening in front of them. They want to be sure the transcript matches what they heard. </p>
<p>Third, everything's going to be on paper anyway, because it's the easiest to review. Putting it on tape then on paper is just another step that's inevitably going to slow things down when reviewing the tape.</p></div>		</li>
