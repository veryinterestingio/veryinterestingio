<p>Think of it like this: The US government creates dollars by spending them into existence, and it destroys dollars through taxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The federal reserve creates money through low interest, sometimes &quot;no recourse&quot; <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-real-housewives-of-wall-street-246430/" target="_blank">loans</a>. </p>
<p>So basically, they create it out of thin air by lending it with super advantageous terms to the people who already have the most money, so they can lend it out to everyone else at higher interest rates using loans that can be enforced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for the fact that MMT is universally rejected by economists. In the <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/modern-monetary-theory" target="_blank">IGM Experts Panel</a>, literally every top economist disagrees with MMT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, what you linked and what mmt is are not the same thing. Does MMT mean you can finance unlimited spending of everything? No, of course not. I would be in the &quot;strongly disagree&quot; camp as well. Turns out runaway inflation can devastate an eneconomy (see: Venezuela) - that however is not a rejection of MMT. MMT just means you understand the rules of macroeconomics. You can use a fiat currency to finance anything - at the cost of inflation.  Where you put that money and how it gets removed should be the central topic of public policy.</p></div>		</li>
