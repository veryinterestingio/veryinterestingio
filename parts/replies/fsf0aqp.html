			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some 2-kanji words which the 2 characters have a similar structure (like a common radical), but are almost never used alone (at least in daily speech). People can still understand if you flip those 2 characters (And there are people who make the mistake of flipping them naturally, probably)</p>
<p>Like 拶挨 蛛蜘 躇躊 賂賄 琶琵 etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unintended, but you just made my day a lot better. After years of learning I could actually tell what these words were, though I wasn't sure if you wrote out the correct ones or the flipped ones, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read the entire first 2 sentences and didn't even realize that they were out of order. I was thinking that the second paragraph would be the same thing, but jumbled. </p>
<p>Wow. That's amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my Japanese isn't great and I barely noticed that it was happening until Cambridge, but to be fair that word would take me a second even in the right order. Katakana words are... special sometimes. A few words took some reasoning, and the common factor with all of them is that the small ゃ/ゅ/ょ was no longer attached to the right character, and I think it would be even more comprehensible if you treated the whole sound as one &quot;letter&quot; when scrambling.</p>
<p>I think there's also a slight equivalent in kanji, where you can use the wrong character for something and if you still leave the &quot;shape&quot; and primary radicals of the word intact it will remain readable. Like if you were to write... 憂鬱 as 優鬱 I probably wouldn't notice if I was just skimming the text because the main radical is the same and the 鬱 kanji is so visually distinctive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I knew that I was supposed to be noticing something, and I still didn't get it. Took me about 20 seconds to figure it out.</p>
<p>That said, I <em>instantly</em> notice when a website is displaying <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTDfw_H6Qc2Rq48RJZ5xgRJB7S4hkG-z0Dg_BSI81Wa6ox6smar&amp;usqp=CAU" target="_blank">Chinese rather than Japanese variants</a> of characters because of a coding mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really an 'encoding mistake' but rather a missing language marker which tells the computer what kind of font to use. In this case, if the system language is Chinese, it will use a Chinese font, if it's set to Japanese, it will use a Japanese font. The Japanese web designer doesn't even notice the problem because it's displayed correctly on his computer.</p>
<p>But if the system language is set to English, German, Spanish, etc., it uses a Chinese font... probably because there are more Chinese speakers in the world.</p></div>		</li>
