			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard yogurt salves can sort of reset the bacteria at your smelly bits (cousin did this for her feet). Due to severe, diagnosed skin conditions, I take showers less than 3x a week and use spot cleaning with gentle soap (for the important bits, and hair) and alcohol-based perfume (aka axe that doesn't make me gag) for my pits and turn out pretty good after a week, maybe more, of adjustment. Provided you work a desk job and avoid manual labor. Once I start working out regularly, this will definitely have to change. Already, moisturizing takes significantly more than 2 minutes even with my SO assisting.</p>
<p>I'm oilier to the point where it's annoying with my phone, but work and live with close friends who promise I am up to snuff as it were (literally uncomfortably close sniffing, they're really good people lol). And my own nose is hyperactive, even to my own bo. I sneeze by Yankee candle (or if someone burns anything other than unscented beeswax), or on the regular with people's parfum/aftershave on the regular. Not to mention actual bad smells.</p>
<p>Definitely not for everyone, but a possibility for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you tried a Norwex body cloth? They're designed to clean with just water. The dead skin cells and debris are collected between the microfibers, leaving you with clean skin. You still might want to take your 3x week showers, using this cloth on necessary parts on the alternate days. I use mine daily, on my face in the morning, and every-other-day on my body during my shower. On alternate days, I use a regular washcloth and a gentle skin cleanser.</p></div>		</li>
