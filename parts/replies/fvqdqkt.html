			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty cool. I guess I'm behind on this stuff, I didn't know any had been approved yet, but it's been over 4 years since I looked into gene therapy.</p>
<p>Would point out that this is just one specific engineered virus for a specific cancer, not a generalized personal gene therapy, so not yet what OP wanted. But it's very impressive, the amount of progress that has been made while I wasn't looking is shocking</p></div>		</li>

You can add antigen binding domains to viral envelopes which can grant them specificity to cancer antigens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem with targeting cancer antigens is specificity. We don't have great characterization of cancer cells and how they differ from healthy cells in a specific enough way to be precise targets. Take FAP+ cells for example: we used to think they were going to be the key to targeting cancer cells for therapies. But further studies have shown this marker doesn't denote a homogeneous population and isn't specific to cancer cells. And sometimes the antigens or markers we can identify are internal, making them a less effective target. We're making a lot of progress! But we're not quite there yet to develop therapies which exclusively target cancer cells. And if we were to sensitize the immune system to itself, well we'd basically be giving someone an autoimmune disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes we do, and there are numerous adenoviruses and lentiviruses that have been extensively modified to infect specific cells.</p>
<p>Theres a ton of companies that can do it, and it's a whole reason Cell and Gene Therapy has taken off.</p></div>		</li>
