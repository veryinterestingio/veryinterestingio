			<div class="markdown"><p>In my school district the local chapter of a veterans group supplies the entire third grade with a dictionary every year. I mean most of the third graders don’t even use them because they all have school use chromebooks and it’s not necessarily a “must have” anymore but point is they still get sold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not here to agree or disagree with you but a lot of education revolves around technology these days. While I do agree that my district maybe relies a little too much on technology I think that having access to technology constantly is an important part of education in a modern world where most of the workforce is going to be using similar materials. </p>
<p>To me the most important part of education is learning how to acquire information, not necessarily memorizing information, so at least with my students I constantly stress how to find answers using the resources available to them instead of relying on others to answer things for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see both sides. Some kids will go home and be handed a tablet and spend 75% of waking hours in front of screens. Some of those kids will only have access to technology through school. I see a lot of the college freshman I have taught not be proficient in excel which is really important in stem majors. There isn’t really a class to teach them either it is on individual professors or TAs. By proficient I mean summing a column or std deviations not some of the fancy stuff I see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being able to use a physical dictionary and using Google to find a definition are basically the same, Google is just quicker. It's also <em>better</em> if you don't really know how to spell a word it will help you there too.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe in a power outage being so reliant on tech is a negative, but for at least a few decades now that's been the case. For essentially every other scenario being able to seamlessly use tech is a net positive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little over 30 years ago having access to a dictionary during finals saved my ass.  Only resource we could use.  Had to pick 4 from list of 5 items to write about.  All things we had read in the semester.  I only recognized 3 of the works.  The other two were poems and I couldn't remember them. (We read over a hundred that semester). Went to the huge unabridged dictionary and looked them up.  Ode to a Grecian Urn was in there.  Written by John Keats.  Keats great! It's all about death then.  I can fake this. A+ baby.  Thanks Merriam-Webster.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But death stuff - wasn't that what Emily Dickinson was for?</p></div>		</li>
