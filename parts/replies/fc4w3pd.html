<p>Bonus interesting tidbit; some chickens lay white eggs, some lay brown eggs, some also lay blue or greenish eggs and certain ducks lay all black eggs. Theres two ways to get color in eggs, one is the actual shell is colored, the other is a final color coating after the shell is made. For example blue eggs have blue shells all the way through, brown eggs have a top coat of color, you can breed chickens to get both genetics and you will get a blue egg with a brown coating that looks olive. You can often guess what color the eggs will be based on the color of the chickens earlobes.  </p>
<p>I had ducks that laid black eggs, you could wipe the color off and as the season went on they ran outta &quot;ink&quot; and would go from black to grey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like in humans, an egg is fertilized when a sperm enters it (in chickens, this is called a germinal disc, and it is attached to the yolk). This has to happen early on in the egg formation process, before it develops a shell, so shortly after it's released from the ovary. At that point, it's just a small yolk with some albumen (the egg white) attached to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that makes sense. a part of why i made this post is because someone told me that the laid eggs get fertilized by the roosters walking by them, i was so confused how that was possible. do you know how long it takes to form a shell?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and no. There might be some fertilized eggs in the store but the chance of that is very very low. And even if they are fertilized, the eggs need breeding to hatch so nothing will grow really.</p>
<p>There are some videos of people hatching supermarket eggs. Although im convinced 9/10 are fake and they just bought a fertilized eggs for their video</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most commercial farmers dont keep any roosters at all. No need, so they won't be fertile.  </p>
<p>If you crack a fertile egg before it's been incubated there will be a very small white bullseye on the yolk. Infertile eggs have just a small white dot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fertilized eggs have a red dot on the yolk. That's the embryo. It's usually too small to see until a day or two after laying. A white dot is likely a bit of the Chalaza, which is like a shock absorber spring coil made of protein that keeps the yolk centered and keeps it from bouncing around in the eggshell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a rooster were to be put into the barn with the hens, then many eggs would be fertilised. You would not be able to see from the outside, but if you were to carefully inspect the cracked egg, or shine a strong light through the egg, then the embryo could be seen.</p>
<p>As a rooster looks very different from a hen, it is unlikely to happen by accident, for eggs produced in barns or cages. But I would expect that many eggs from free-range hens could be fertilised - although the embryos would not survive the distribution process.</p></div>		</li>
