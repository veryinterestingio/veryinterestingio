			<div class="markdown"><p>The last phase of litium ion charging used a constant voltage output that is the same as the target voltage of the cell.  So the battery will only charge until its voltage is the same as the input. A simpel way to detect it if is fully charge is to measure the current into the battery and when it is low enough you consider it fully charged</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not notably.</p>
<p>It should however be noted that the optimal charge level for a battery is around 70%. If the battery is maintained at that level, you will get the best battery life.
Also the least usage, because why the hell would you have a battery, if you need to keep it at the same charge level at all times...</p>
<p>This is why new phones usually come with their battery around 70%, instead of 100%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the way lead acid chargers work and some simple li-ion chargers work, but good chargers will stop completely when it starts to trickle because it has a large impact on life with no measurable increase in charge.</p>
<p>Because of this, sometimes you can see your battery drops a few percent after being on the charger for a long time, it's because the charger actually stopped and it might allow the battery to self discharge a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium battery chargers rely on voltage.
Nickel based batteries decrease their resistance once they're full, so chargers for it watch for a sudden drop in resistance </p></div>		</li>
