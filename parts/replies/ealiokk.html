			<div class="markdown"><p>Cause spicy doesn't belong to the taste sense, it is a part of tact. Any part of the body can sense spicy too, it's just that it is more powerful in the mouth as it has very developed tact.</p>
<p>The only part of your body with taste sense is the tongue, so only it can sense proper taste sensations such sweet.</p>
<p>Lastly, fats and sugars, which are stuff that makes pancakes tasty, gets digested in your guts, so it wouldn't be there on the other side, while some capsaicin survives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's complete bullshit. It's because capsaicin does not bind taste receptors. It binds an ion channel on neurons that detect heat - which are not specific to the mouth. Instead, the neurons that detect heat are present just below the mucous membranes in your mouth and around your anus and capsaicin can readily cross mucous membranes.</p></div>		</li>
