			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh gods, don't remind me.  </p>
<p>Anyone that works in fast food - especially if y'all have a leaky drink fountain/ice cream/Frosty machine - get you one of those cheap-ass combs, remove a few of its teeth to match your tread width, and clean them fuckers <strong><em>before</em></strong> you go in your home. Or take a sprayer nozzle to em, just get that shit <em>out</em> of the treads ASAgdmf-ingP.  </p>
<p>Aside from eventually defeating the non-slip part if they gunk up bad enough; ants are <em>not</em> as easy to see/knock out of your shoes as one would imagine. Especially if you're like my dumb ass and wait until the last minute to head in. Pretty sure I still have some version of &quot;PTSD&quot; from that shit (didn't sting/bite me until <em>after</em> I hit the highway-_-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It was standard practice at my last restaurant job to spray out your treads with the pressure sprayer at the end of every shift. Also keeps them from tracking rotten food everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Combat boots work good for this as many have soles that allow for more contact with the floor yet don't allow the nasty stuff to gum up the tread.  Vet here, I had to assist in the DFAC (Army cafeteria) a few times and Combat Boot were used by us and the Army cooks to easily walk on the slippery kitchen floors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Work boots too.  You don't have to look for special 'slip-resistant' work boots, that's just a standard feature for all of them.</p>
<p>Seems like that would be obvious, but apparently it's not; people want to try to do that type of work in flip flops, sandals, tennis shoes, loafers, anything but proper work boots for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Treads are not designed to increase surface area. In fact, they sacrifice contact patch for the purpose of the removal of water from under the rubber through the use of engineered channels. See: boat shoes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also how tires work, for anyone that might be curious. Compare a winter tire to a summer tire, and notice how the winter tire has many more grooves that are also deeper than the summer tire.</p></div>		</li>
