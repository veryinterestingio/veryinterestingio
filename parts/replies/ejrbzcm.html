			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the first 44,000 years is such a small proportion of the total regardless. Exponential growth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because there are a lot of variables and assumptions involved in creating these sorts of estimates; you'd have to go estimate by estimate to compare them for specific differences. I didn't do that because I just wanted a general idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number of people, religious or otherwise, who honestly think the world is only 6000 years old is about the same as the number of people who really think the world is flat.  That doesn't mean there aren't larger organizations that might encapsulate such ideas, not to be indoctrinated as scientific fact, but as a small component of a larger theme, derived from a collection of stories from multiple authors, retold and re-translated numerous times over a period of over 2000 years.  Organized religion as a whole isn't all that interested in debating scientific fact as it is in having a secured interest in its own attempts at guiding society as a whole, as well as perpetuating its own existence, and bringing in sufficient revenue to assure that.  </p></div>		</li>
