			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but indirectly. The most dangerous viruses are the ones that jump from animals to humans, because we don't have defenses against them. (HIV, ebola and SARS are three that have made the jump in 'recent' history.) The more people going into the jungle to exploit it, and the more animals coming into human towns because we destroyed their habitat, the more chances there are for something to make the jump.</p>
<p>Bats in particular are bad because they're carriers for the most nasty-death sort of viruses (like ebola, and several cousins of ebola). Bats are important jungle pollinators. There is already much more bat-human contact due to deforestation. It's a matter of time before we get another hemorrhagic fever outbreak. If we're lucky it will continue to be like ebola and die if the local climate is below shirt-sleeve temperatures. If we're not...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yah, bats have weird ass immune systems, instead of fighting it off they just kinda ignore viruses. they end up with higher concentrations of the virus making them more likely to spread it. poor disease riddled bastards, they gets sars, mers, whatever and just keep going without the standard fever or inflammation of tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last year in southern part of India, people who had a bad case of fever was found with the Nipah (Henipavirus). The government followed the protocol for ebola and set up isolation zones. The bodies of the victims wasn't allowed to be given back to their families and where burned. Towns around the hospital and the area where it was reported remained almost completely empty. People was so frightened to go out. Virus was traced to the fruit bats in the area. It was contained after virus claimed 17. No new case or death has been reported since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a malaria strain that mosquitoes can carry from monkies to humans but, we think, not from human to human. The WHO has been ignoring it because of the lack of human-to-human transmission, but in southeast Asia areas with lots of active deforestation (the habitat loss drives monkies into human-occupied areas) there are huge numbers of cases. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's finally Canada's turn to export a disease scare. For years we've been worried that climate change would make Canada the new home of West Nile virus but now you're telling me the people who live near the West Nile are going to have to start worrying about Mackenzie River virus because climate change is that drastic?</p></div>		</li>
