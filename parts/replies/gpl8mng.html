			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that last point true? I must be doing something wrongâ€”seems like in A for example you get E, B, F#, C#, G#. So far so good but the next note would be D#, not D... ðŸ¤”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to start in a weird spot, so you don't actually start with the fundamental. For instance, for a C major scale: start on F, a 5th up from that is C, then G, then D, then A, then E, then B. If you started on A, then you got the E major scale.</p>
<p>edit: your confusion is actually the impetus for George Russel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_Chromatic_Concept_of_Tonal_Organization" target="_blank">Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization</a>, which is really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many nonwestern music traditions that have their own systems of organizing music. Many of these traditions do not organize their music around groupings of notes like we do in western music. </p>
<p>For instance, some African musics are based on the patterns of tonal languages which inform how harmonies are produced. Many Asian traditional tunes use a series of notes that sounds like the pentatonic scale, but might not sound in tune to western ears. The long story short is that there are as many ways of organizing pitches and timing as there are cultures. There's LOTS of nuance! I earned a master's degree in ethnomusicology, and these differences were fun to study.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gamelan music (from Indonesia) sounds really cool and it doesn't use the same 7-note scale that Western music does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>technically, yes. The harmonics just keep getting more or less &quot;out of tune&quot;. but also many of the harmonics are just octaves of repeated notes, which is why it takes so many before you get a &quot;new&quot; note.</p>
<p>a lot of this is simplified very much from how it physically works, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music\)" target="_blank">the wikipedia page is fascinating</a>.</p></div>		</li>
