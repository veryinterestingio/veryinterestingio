			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another physical problem that you didn't mention, which is that UV light tends to damage cells. Our biology usually tends to block UV instead of using it, because the biological cost of using it isn't paid back. But some hunting birds have developed regenerating retinas so that they can see the reflections of UV light from rodent piss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I gathered, the reason eyes evolved in that specie spectrum is due to the fact that this specific wave length range penetrate water the best.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicely explained. I hadn’t considered wavelength as a limiting factor, I’ve often been curious what the mantis shrimp actually sees at it’s said they goes off both ends of the spectrum compared to us.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mantis Shrimp are bloody fascinating animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that they can see a slightly wider part of the EM spectrum, it's that the 16 cones in their eyes (compared to our 3) are sensitive to more discrete parts of the visible spectrum and can also detect light polarization. It's not even about the colors they see as it is the ability to discriminate differences in the most minute ways.</p></div>		</li>
