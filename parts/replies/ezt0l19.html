<p>Had to dedicate memory and processing power displaying a loading bar instead of loading/processing the stuff you're trying to load faster because people will assume it's broken if there is no visual feedback.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Writing metadata doesn't take any time that is in any way noticeable by a human in modern computers but it does happen yeah.
For standard Windows installation, it is indeed antivirus, probably Defender, scanning the file where slowdowns happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a Mac, it depends on the file type. If downloading disk images, for example, they will at some point be scanned for both integrity and for developer signatures. Setting the metadata doesn't take long, but collecting the information in order to set it can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Closing a file does not usually flush the contents to disk. Flushing to disk needs to be done explicitly with e.g. <code>fsync()</code>. Closing only flushes potential user space buffers to the kernel cache which is also in RAM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why? I have not used Windows for a long time but at least on Linux I do not think USB drivers are treated any differently from the built-in HDD. Which is why you should always &quot;eject&quot; (unmount the file system) before unplugging the USB drive or else you will lose the data which is in the kernel cache but have not yet been written to disk.</p>
<p>The exceptions I were thinking of were more like if you have opened the file with <code>O_SYNC</code> or exotic file systems.</p></div>		</li>
