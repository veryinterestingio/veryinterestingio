			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people (mostly older people, but not exclusively) struggle this way when trying to learn about computers. </p>
<p>They want a step by step list of instructions when asking how to do something, like they can just follow a list of steps to get a desired output.</p>
<p>When in fact it's more like trying to understand what you want at a higher level, and utilizing your overall knowledge to get to your desired outcome. </p>
<p>I usually respond by asking them to give me a list of steps to drive to the supermarket. Then I follow up with things like &quot;how long do I press the gas? How hard to I push the brake? What happens if a child runs into the street? What if the road is closed?&quot; A list of steps can't help you get to the supermarket in the same way that a list of steps can't get done what you want to do on the computer. You need to know what to do if you get an error message, or a file doesn't open because you don't have a reader installed, or you're out of storage space when saving a file, etc. </p>
<p>Building a brick wall of knowledge vs building a web of understanding is a great analogy for computer learning, I'll be using that next time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As my family’s “tech guy” I see this way too often. I think it often comes from a fear of taking risks with the unfamiliar, technology in this case. The people who most easily learn computers, or any skill really, seem to be the ones most willing to treat it as play. </p>
<p>You gotta be willing to poke it and see what happens, then go from there. The ones who don’t, at least in my experience, are the ones who struggle the most. They’re too worried about breaking their toys to ever play with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% on the play around point. I recommend this for anyone learning anything. Pool, skateboarding, programming, you name it - when you start you will suck. It’s important to be ok with that, and it’s best if you just enjoy the process and laugh off any mistakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers are also insanely intimidating because of how complex they are. You don’t actually need to know all that much about how they work to use them, but beyond basic startup there aren’t really linear instructions for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true. When I was young, all of my computer experience came from pressing every button to see what it did, opening every menu to see what options I had. Even to this day when I get a new program that I don't understand, I just press buttons and go...&quot;huh. Neat&quot; and keep going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think the analogy is better suited as when somebody reaches a missing page in instructions.  </p>
<p>Some people: &quot;I need this missing page, I need to find this missing page to continue&quot;</p>
<p>Others: &quot;Well, looking at what the next page looks like, along with what I have left, and what the completed box art shows, it seems like this is what it would have said&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are all results-focused.</p>
<p>Every time we chose a movie or tv show to watch, or video game to play, or safety equipment to use, or mattress to sleep on, or food to eat, we are results-focused.  There is almost nothing we do that isn't results-focused.</p>
<p>Even hiking a trail: even if you're ad-hocking your equipment, you almost certainly chose a trail because it is better-curated, even if that didn't cross you mind explicitly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meccano intentionally printed obscure or even <em>incorrect</em> instructions so people (mostly kids) had to improvise, either following the instructions and ignoring the false picture, or following the picture and ignoring the incomplete instructions.</p>
<p>This lead to a lot of kids being disappointed, a lot of parents being frustrated, and a lot of real-life mechanics who can <em>just build</em> and use their intuition. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Old style <a href="https://playclassic.games/games/point-n-click-adventure-dos-games-online/" target="_blank">point and click</a> adventure games are very useful for this, as the solutions are often silly but obvious using abstract reasoning and the repetitive trial and error nature of these games makes it so persistence always pays off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of movies telegraph this stuff, though. They make it obvious or foreshadow the possibility of a twist or a certain piece of character development. I don't think being able to deduce a possibility or general cleverness is directly linked to thinking abstractly. </p>
<p>This is kind of warping the original concept into something its not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say yes. The dude talking about movies telegraphing stuff didn't really consider that the punchline of a joke is also related to the context delivered in the joke.</p>
<p>A story with an obvious twist is probably tropey. On the other side of that coin, a completely obscure twist is a good sign that the story isn't well written, or decided to break it's own rules.</p>
<p>A good story is like a heavily winding forest path. The way forward is obvious, but where it leads is shrouded in mystery (Brandon Sanderson is actually pretty dang incredible at accomplishing this). Another good writing style is where you more or less have a map of the woods, that while accurate, can't do the forest justice.</p>
<p>Aaanyway, yes, in my opinion both good jokes and good movies share the trait of foreshadowing, but wealth of experience with the form is what let's you pick up on the more subtle strings.</p></div>		</li>
