			<div class="markdown"><p>I've talked to quite a few Chinese exchange students and they just have a different mentality.  </p>
<p>My favorite quote was, 'Wow, there are 6000 bears in New York. If there were 6000 bears in Guangzhou, and hunting was legal tommrow there would be no bears in Guangzhou.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more of an in-joke among Chinese communities - southern Chinese people (from the area around Guangzhou) are stereotyped by other Chinese people as willing to kill and eat any sort of animal. Kind of like how Americans would stereotype people from West Virginia as hillbillies or people from Alabama as incestuous rednecks, or whichever regional stereotype you prefer. It's not &quot;We Chinese people all love to consume endangered animal parts.&quot; I'd estimate 95-99% of Chinese people have never seen a rhino horn or elephant tusk or had the desire to buy one, but a few percent of 1.3 billion is still a <em>lot</em> of people which is unfortunately what's driving the demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A Chinese coworker once told me this joke: If a Martian landed in Beijing what would they talk about with the locals? Culture, science, etc. If the Martian landed in Shanghai, the locals would ask for an exclusive deal for distribution of Martian merchandise. If the Martian landed in Guangzhou the locals would ask “what parts of you are edible?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean there were no almost bears in NY at one point, because hunting had wiped them out. As America got richer and more urbanized, wild bear populations came to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kinda ironic given that Americans completely exterminated another species of pigeon (passenger pigeon) that once numbered 3-5 billion, within the timespan of less than 100 years in the 19th century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. In China pigeons GTFO as soon people come near it. In Europe they hang around you and you have to actually make an effort to scare them away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense. I saw a post about the most expensive foods. Two of them were watermelons and cantaloupes from Asia. They were both thousands of dollars. I'd pay a little extra but geez. </p></div>		</li>
