			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxybenzone can be found in blood samples in summer.</p>
<p>While most of it does wash off (and stays in the outermost layer of skin and falls off), some will reach systemic circulation, and may end up stored in fatty tissues, before eventually being eliminated through metabolisation and eventually the kidneys, like you said.</p>
<p>0.5 to 8% of the Oxybenzone is absorbed and eventually ends up in urine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, neither Zinc oxide nor Titanium oxide get absorbed at significant levels.</p>
<p>ZnO and TiO2 are both virtually insoluble in both water and oil, so they can't pass through the epithelium.</p>
<p>If Zinc vapours are imahled, they are quite toxic, like most metal vapours, but that's not a concern for pigment based sunscreen anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know there was some BS study that people who wear sunscreen had higher incidences of cancer, but they were also in the sun more.  </p>
<p>Have there been legitimate studies done about it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to remember that sunscreen wears out REALLY fast from your skin, so if you apply sunscreen once and then spent the next 8 hours in the sun, it's like you didn't apply sunscreen at all. Besides most people won't apply the recommended amount, in the first place, per cm2 on skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tons of studies about the effects of the sun and sunscreen. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpp.12109" target="_blank">This</a> might be similar to what you're looking for. One limitation of course is that melanoma is a looonnngggg term thing and it can be a little hard, and expensive, to do fast good science about it.</p>
<p>There are just... tons of studies about oxybenzone so it's a little hard to even START unless you have a really particular question about it. Like, it's one of those things that are recognized as safe. Scientists are now less about figuring out IF it's a bad thing (it isn't) and more about what NON-human effects it may have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zinc oxide is actually thought to possibly be harmful to reefs as well. Many formulations that allow for zinc oxide to go on without giving toooo much of a white cast are “nano” particles of zinc oxide (note: sunscreens that use zinc oxide don’t have a standard definition for when it’s nano scale or not). But evidence suggests (though doesn’t conclude, but not necessarily less convincing than research in other sunscreens that may harm the environment) that small particles of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide may disrupt cellular integrity in marine species and may also be “reef dangerous.” It’s hard to say, because “physical” sunscreens don’t easily divulge the size of particles used and it’s not readily known at what particle size in the nanometer range will cause significant damage to marine life. </p>
<p>For example, perhaps sunscreens are using 400 nm size grains but it only hurts marine life at 300 nm? mayeb some products use a larger particle size but it’s almost impossible to know. And some sunscreens say they are nano or non nano based on a percentage of the particles that fall in a particular size range, not in the totality of the particles. So maybe they are non nano because 75% of the particles are larger than a particular threshold, but the rest can kill marine life? Is that okay? Probably not. </p>
<p>The long story short is we need more research to see how each sunscreen affects marine life, and in what concentrations and in the formulations that are used. </p>
<p>The jury is still out on most sunscreens but if you are working on a “better safe than sorry” system, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide might also be problems.</p></div>		</li>
