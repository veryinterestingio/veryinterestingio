			<div class="markdown"><p>There's been a LOT of data going around but not a lot of context. The main problem is the accuracy of the tests. Every test has a small false negative and false positive rate. These vary wildly from test to test, but they are improving overall. When you are doing 100's of thousands of tests a day, every single possible accuracy permutation will occur eventually. While an individual getting a false positive and then later getting a false negative is extremely unlikely, over a whole population, it's basically guaranteed to happen. It's like winning the lottery. An individual won't win it, but someone in the population will. Korea had the most extensive testing of any country at first, and they had a number of examples of patients who tested positive, then negative, and then positive again. These were assumed to be reinfections when they turned out to be false negatives between two positives. As your viral load drops, the odds of a false negative go up because you are less likely to get a viable sample on the swab.</p>
<p>Here are common situations that may have been reported as reinfections but are not:</p>
<ol>
<li>A presumptive covid case that was actually flu. Then someone gets covid later. (symptomatic twice)</li>
<li>A false negative test between two false positive tests.</li>
<li>A false positive test, assumed asymptomatic (or the patient &quot;feels&quot; tired), then they get covid later.</li>
<li>Someone who recovers from covid, and months later gets a large exposure, and then is tested. While they won't get sick again, the PCR test is very sensitive, and they might have some viral particles trying to replicate in their nose when it is performed. There was an example of a physician in a covid ward who had this happen. He didn't develop symptoms on his &quot;second&quot; infection, but he still isolated himself out of precaution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now reinfections can be a thing for any disease. Viruses mutate and every immune system produces a slightly different response. The thing is, if reinfection in 5 or 6 months was normally possible, you would see huge waves of reinfections in China, London, Belgium, Milan, and NYC. We aren't seeing this. We are seeing potentially isolated anecdotal cases of reinfection. This means that, most likely, the plurality of people are immune after they recover at least for the current duration of the pandemic (\~9 months). We don't know if you will still be immune in two years as this virus hasn't been in the human population long enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t seem very responsible to characterize a 20% false negative rate (for PCR testing) as “small.” ([And that’s assuming the best case, that the person is tested around days 8-9.](<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-1495" target="_blank">https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-1495</a> )) Are you talking about some other test, or tests in general, perhaps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the initial reports of reinfection were not reinfection but just finding dead virus in their stools 3 weeks later. There have only actually been 3 instances so about 1 in every 2 million</p></div>		</li>
