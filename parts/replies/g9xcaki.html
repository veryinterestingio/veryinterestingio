<p>Specifically the placental syncytium, which is the merged layer of cells that forms the boundary layer between the fetus and the mother. It's formed using old retrovirus proteins called syncytins, that merge cell membranes together.</p>
<p>The virus would've used these proteins to merge into the membrane of a host cell, but we instead use them to produce a tight seal between the mother and baby so nothing gets through that shouldn't.</p></div>		</li>
