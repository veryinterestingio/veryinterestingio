			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh. I'm fine with the &quot;no time zones&quot; part. I think we should adopt a UTC-0 24-hour clock globally.</p>
<p>Cows don't give a damn what number is on the clock when the sun comes up, and it's a lot easier to schedule meetings for 13:00 when nobody ever has to ask &quot;which one?&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DST is different, but to an extent timezones are natural since the sun doesn’t set at the same time everywhere. </p>
<p>For instance where I live it’s 2pm, but that wouldn’t work in places like Japan since it’s early morning, and most are still asleep. Solar time is the best way, but they would still be timezones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty cool tbh, wish I had a clock with this time just cuz why not.</p>
<p>Also change is super hard, so no wonder it didn't take off. Change is hard enough that we have a tendency to build and build onto faulty systems and patching things instead of scraping the idea and starting a new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that change is hard, but it turned out that they wanted to replace the 7 days with 1 day off system with a 10 days with 1 day off system.</p>
<p>That's going to be a hard sell.</p>
<p>There would have been some days at the end of the year that would have also been off, but people obviously didn't feel convinced about the trade-off.</p>
<p>Throw in that the day/month/year system is actually fairly simple (at least compared to the measuring mess that the rest of the metric system replaced), so there was not really a pressing need other than a feeling of completeness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, the DMY system is not simple, we're just used to it</p>
<p>A lunar month is 28 days, and we have a year that's ~365 days long (ish, I'll get to that in a bit). Simple right? Divide 365 by 28? Sure, that's 13. Well that's not very round, make it 12; and scatter the remaining days inconsistently between the 12 months. Let's also name them ordinally so they start with the number they are (Sept, Oct, etc.) So now we have 12 months of mostly 30/31 days. In order to make it harder to remember which month's which, let's shift the start of the year a bit so <strong>Sept</strong>ember is the 9th month. Now one of the months is a bit shorter than all the others for some reason, so let's give it an extra day: but not all the time as that would make the months out of sync; only if the year is divisible by 4 (unless it's divisible by 100 (unless it's divisible by 400). Cool, now we've done that, let's add some leap seconds (and about 3 different ways of dealing with leap seconds). And for all of those still not confused by this system, let's remove the year zero, remove a few days that never happened, base it on the birth of someone we don't even know when he was born, make date separators inconsistent (/ . , -); and make it so that unless you know who wrote it, 04/08/11 is almost impossible to know when it is. </p>
<p>Additionally, make the year, the school year, and the tax year all start on different days</p>
<p>And that's just the Gregorian calendar..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh it's a silly idea. As many other people have pointed out here, the faulty system that we're patching and building onto is the decimal system itself. It's pretty objectively worse for most purposes than a base 12 system like the Sumerians used to use. Taking the last little scrap of a good system and replacing it with a worse one for consistency is kind of a depressing idea, so I'm glad it never took off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not properly awake yet so not given it a proper thought, but I don't see how decimal time works... Decimal time seems to act like there's 100000 seconds in a day, but there is only 86400 seconds in a day.. so how would that work.  </p>
<p>I mean we base a day on the earths rotation, if it takes 86400 seconds then that's what it takes, we can't just say it takes 100000 now for convenience.  Or do we change the definition of how long a second is so it matches up with what we want?  That sounds like an even bigger change tho, isn't that determined by the movement of atoms or some shit.  </p>
<p>The idea of a day not being a full rotation of the earth doesn't sound right to me .. I know it's not exact right now, bit were not nearly 4 hours off</p></div>		</li>
