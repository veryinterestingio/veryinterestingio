			<div class="markdown"><p>Now imagine the super-rich guy in the nearby castle is also stuck eating food prepared using nothing but salt. How much do you think <em>that guy</em> would give you for a few barrels of spices? He probably makes more money in an hour than you'll make in your life. Maybe you wouldn't kill for your own food to taste a bit better, but I'd definitely jump at the chance to be that guy's supplier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Spices were desirable for obvious reasons, they were expensive because they were regional and you had to go get them and bring them home, often from countries that took weeks to sail to and from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm American but have lived here for 5 years. You can get great food in England, but a lot of it is from other countries. Just here in Nottingham there are excellent Italian, Indian, and American restaurants. I generally don't like British-style Chinese food but there are some good places here. My wife makes a great roast dinner, and there are some British foods that are good, but I totally see why they colonize half the world to get better food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's a thing. I've heard of people eating only potatoes or only rice (monodiet) for a period of time and after that basically anything tastes amazing. I want to try it sometime because it would be a really interesting experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tried it, and honestly... After a week of only potatoes even potatoes tasted more. And then I started in on non standard potatoes... Hoo boy. Gave up after about two weeks tho. The experiment wasn't exciting enough to give up on real food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, people commonly either gain weight (eating sugary/fatty foods that still taste good), or lose weight (I was already bad about eating lunch, but without smell you don't even catch a whiff of something tasty and think &quot;oh man I should eat&quot;).</p></div>		</li>
