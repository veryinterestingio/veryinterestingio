			<div class="markdown"><p>This question and its answers strike me as good reminders of what environmentalism is all about. We don't need to save the Earth. The Earth is hundreds of millions of years old and has supported life for most of its history; Earth will be just fine.</p>
<p>What we have to work to preserve is the Human ecosystem, and the fragile systems we've built to support our societies.</p>
<p>Earth doesn't need us to conserve water; people living in places with little natural potable water need us to conserve water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always liked the analogy about climate change that I first heard from Burnie Burns. When we get a virus, our bodies natural defence is to heat up and kill the virus with a fever. The Earth is doing the same thing, except we’re the virus that is going to burn to death. </p>
<p>There are obviously more nuances to climate change than that but the idea is the same. Climate change prevention isn’t about us saving the planet, it’s about us saving us. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Humans would make it through the ongoing climate change, many other things I have doubts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While a decent analogy, it's important to stress the difference in the case of climate change. Global warming, after you reach a certain CO2 density and global average temperature, is a feedback loop with a runaway effect. The Earth has survived 4 billion years because our greenhouse effect has been regulated by the existence of large bodies of liquid water. Once the temperature rises enough, the CO2 doesn't remain dissolved and instead sits in the atmosphere, further increasing the temperature, and evaporating more water, which dissociates more CO2, etc etc etc. We need to be wary of the climate changing because at some point, the effect is irreversible and the planet DOES die. See: Venus. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No. As people were saying, conserving water matters for you and the area you're in. For example people in the midwest wasting water helps other people in the midwest in the future. It has no direct impact on people living in west africa that have issues with poor access to clean water. Heck, as far as I'm aware it doesn't have an impact on people living in the US west that have a shortage of water. The extra water you have can't be feasibly transported to another area of the world to help them out, so you shouldn't feel that every bit of water going down your drain is somehow hurting poor people around the world. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I observe that the only reasons to conserve water are the people who need more water, but I don't imply all water conservation helps people who need more water. E.g. if I had said &quot;Fires don't need us to use fire extinguishers, people on fire need us to use fire extinguishers,&quot; I'm not implying that using a fire extinguisher in Alaska will put out fires in Russia.</p>
<p>Probably if I had said &quot;Earth doesn't need water conserved; people living in places with little natural potable water need water conserved,&quot; it would've been much clearer. And we should probably use a fire blanket on that person on fire.</p></div>		</li>
