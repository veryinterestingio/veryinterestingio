			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also some sites in this day and age where if you click on the forgot password link you’ll be emailed your password. That means they know your password because it was sent in clear text!  This should never be the case. They should only know the hash, and it should be salted uniquely to each individual user so that in case of a breach, hackers can’t compare common hashes for common strings like password123</p></div>		</li>
