<p>The simple reason is to check if there's damage/debris/fire that would make it unsafer to use that exit/emergency exit, or that side of the plane to escape from.</p>

<p>Exactly.  No point opening the wing exit if the wing is on fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Western kids - especially Americans - have decades of positive reinforcement telling them that their ideas are so creative rather than being wrong.  American kids learn that opinions and feelings matter just as much as the singular right answer. </p>
<p>No you little shit, that idea is stupid and you're wrong.  </p>
<p>This is my opinion. See I can do it too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about this. I listen to the captain of the airplane, since he's the one guy who is in charge of the thing that keeps me from falling at 30k feet.  If he asks me to do jumping jacks, in the middle of the flight, then I will.  </p>
<p>I used to think, flying a commercial jet, has got to be easy, pull up on the stick and give throttle, and boom, you're flying. do the same in reverse.  Then i bought flight simulator 2020. Holy crap, there is a gazillion things you need to be doing all at once and paying attention to.  Even programming the auto pilot, ahead of time, and making adjustments. paying attention to all the radio stuff. etc. New found respect after playing that game/simulator for pilots, especially commercial ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a test flight in a heli. Planes? Like single engine Pipers etc? Fucking piss easy to fly with next to no training, landing and taking off is the hard bit and require a lot of practice tho, also communicating to ATC. The simplest helicopter? Fuck that. For the entire 30 minute flight every time the pilot came me control of the stick and the collective I messed up within 5 seconds. Never will I be able to pilot a heli, just not in my bones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can fly single engine planes okay, but found out that commercial airliners are a WHOLE different beast when I got to sit in the jump seat with one of my pilot friends on a regional flight. 80% of the time was checking instruments while the autopilot did it's thing, but the 5% takeoff/landing and the 15% programming the autopilot and double checking EVERYTHING just blew my mind.</p></div>		</li>
