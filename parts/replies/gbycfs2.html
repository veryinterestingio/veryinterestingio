			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the first time I've truly understood spin. Thank you :D</p>
<p>EDIT: In the same vein as the above edits, I didn't mean to imply that this is a complete explanation of spin. Rather, it provides useful historical context missing from my own education which helps me to form an intuition that I had trouble with previously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing they left out is that this spin also carries actual angular momentum. Otherwise we would have just called it the intrinsic magnetic moment or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get it. How can an object have angular momentum while &quot;at rest&quot;? Are one of you referring to the orbital rotation and the other referring to the non-orbital rotation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I didn't mention that because, I didnt really wanna go into details, i just wanted to give him an easy to understand idea, because i am pretty sure that he would do the details while actually studying it, just trying to share the idea behind it, and the angular momentum is also intrinsic, the particle isn't actually spinning,and that is where the magnetic field comes from, so I think it's safe to say that the magnetic field created itself is intrinsic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this was beautifully explained. others just state the definition of 'spin' without actually explaining the background and forthcoming of the understanding of what it is. I appreciate your comment and wish I knew this back in high school taking ap chem. it would've helped me, in some regards, understand more about subatomic phenomena</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add that keeping the name 'Spin' makes sense mathematically, because the algebra used to describe Spin in quantum mechanics is the same as the algebra used to describe angular momentum (or orbital momentum). In fact, quantum mechanics add* both of these up to define the total angular momentum for a system, which can be a conserved quantity just like the classical angular momentum can be a conserved quantity for classical spinning/circling objects. Quantum mechanic just adds a new kind of angular momentum so to speak. </p>
