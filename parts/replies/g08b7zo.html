			<div class="markdown"><p>Food scientist here to address the effect of carbonic acid on the overall flavor: yes, it will add up to the flavor but also gives in-mouth texture and the scratchy effect on the throat. It also lessens the sweetness from the sugar and other sweeteners which (along with cold temperatures) makes them feel &quot;refreshing&quot;. It also helps stabilize colors and aroma compounds. So if we use a different gas, soda will feel sweeter, heavier and not as refreshing.</p>
<p>As a side note: it's also the main reason carbonated beverages are easier to damage teeth as they combine with sugar and also the reason why coke cleans jewelry and toilets.</p>
<p>Edit: I stand corrected: I forgot about the lovely phosphoric acid in coke which is actually the one that makes it clean jewelry. However, coke is the only beverage to add enough phosphates to create phosphoric acid in such a quantity that it can clean it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has less carbonation and relies on a different kind of tap to aerate it and get that thick foamy head.  Plus less carbonic acid because of the relative lack of co2.  Though beer on nitro does have co2 in it...  Nitrogen doesn't dissolve well enough to be used alone.  It'd just be flat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mouthfeel i believe. I believe the nitrogen bubbles are smaller than CO2 bubbles? Also, the type of beer has a huge impact to flavour of course. Not sure if brülosophy has done any tests on pale ale with CO2 vs pale ale with N2. I'll do a quick Google and see.</p>
<p>Edit: didn't find an exbeeriment on this, but found some good info here <a href="https://www.generon.com/how-to-nitrogenate-beer/" target="_blank">https://www.generon.com/how-to-nitrogenate-beer/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tl;dr - Nitrogen doesn’t dissolve into beer, and has relatively little to do with mouthfeel and flavor itself, but it can increase the serving pressure without affecting the carbonation level. This is useful when used with what we call a nitro/creamer faucet. </p>
<p>Nitro beer is intended to replicate the mouthfeel and carbonation of a cask beer dispensed via a hand pump, or “beer engine”. In order to produce this with standard draught hardware, you basically take the beer and shove it through a special tap containing a plate full of small holes, in order to force the carbonation out into very tiny bubbles. This, combined with a relatively low-carbonation beer, produces the characteristic velvety, creamy head and body of a “nitro” beer, not so much the nitrogen itself. </p>
<p>This faucet design is very restrictive, so to push beer to the required serving pressure with co2 would result in very over carbonated beer, because the concentration in the liquid is directly related to the pressure applied. To get the needed pressure for dispensing through the restriction of a creamer faucet, the serving gas is mixed with nitrogen to a ratio such that you can run pressures 2-3x that of ordinarily CO2-dispensed beer without altering the appropriate carbonation level. This is done specifically because nitrogen is nearly insoluble in liquid, and doesn’t actually end up dissolved in the beer, it just increases the pressure behind it in the lines. </p>
<p>For very, very long serving lines, where the internal line resistance would cause problems with flow rate (eg. bars with very remote keg rooms), they will mix nitro into the serving gas on “normal” beer for the same reason - to increase the pressure at the keg without throwing the CO2 level of the beer off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sparkling mineral water tends to be sourced from hard water aquifers which have a lot of dissolved salts (including calcium carbonate, or chalk). That chalky taste might not actually be from the carbonic acid itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly....</p>
<p>The widget is actually just an empty plastic ball with a tiny hole in it. They drop it in beer, and then they add a drop of liquid nitrogen to the top of the beer and seal it up.</p>
<p>As the liquid nitrogen evaporates inside the sealed can, pressure increases, and this pushes beer into the widget.</p>
<p>When you open the bottle or can, the pressure releases on the surface of the beer which then causes the pressurized widget to jet beer out of the tiny hole.</p>
<p>That creates the thick froth.</p>
<p>(source: I read the patent on the widget a few years ago to understand how it worked)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re thinking of nitrogen, not N2O. Nitrogen is poorly soluble, so it’s ideal for creating high pressure with little effect on the dissolved gas in the liquid. What creates the particular type of foaming associated with “nitro” beer is largely low carbonation combined with forcing the beer at a high pressure through a restrictor plate in those special “stout faucets” you see. This plate has a bunch of small holes that agitate the beer and to knock the low-volume CO2 (and a small amount of dissolved nitrogen) out of solution, creating very tiny, frothy bubbles. If you’ve ever had a cask beer poured from a beer engine with a “sparkler”, this is what the “stout faucets” are emulating. The nitrogen in the beer gas mix is there to push the beer at a higher pressure that would overcarbonate the beer if it were done with CO2.</p>
<p>As pointed out in another comment, the “widgets” in packaged versions achieve something similar by releasing the beer through a small hole in the widget to agitate, rather than pushing it through a restrictor plate. The nitrogen in this instance increases the pressure in the bottle without overcarbonating the beer.</p></div>		</li>
