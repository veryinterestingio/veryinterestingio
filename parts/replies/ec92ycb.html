			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I feel like the extra weight would counteract the floatyness.</p>
<p>And if it's magnets like OP was asking about, you have the weight of a magnet strong enough to counter 50lbs of weight or the weight of a battery powering some sort of electro magnet that counters the 50lbs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if using magnets for levitation is anything like using them for attraction, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CMS-Magnetics-Magnets-Diameter-RB60/dp/B000WMQFQO" target="_blank">magnets with a 50 lb pull</a> are about the size of one of those quarter inch thick <a href="http://hgtvhome.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/hgtv/fullset/2012/11/2/3/original_Myra-Hope-peppermint-candy-wreath-step-one_s4s3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.1280.960.jpeg" target="_blank">peppermint candies</a>.</p>
<p>I have some I bought on ebay that are the more traditional neodymium look with the chrome plated exterior that are solid discs. They're impossible to pull straight apart (can't get a good grip) but you can slide them apart and then separate them. If you put them on both sides of your hand, it's not quite painful but somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I have every bit of confidence a backpack type load could be suspended by 8 pairs or so (so 16 magnets total). That works out to maybe a few hundred grams (~120 per cubic inch, each magnet is roughly a third of that, quick math says approx. 640g or 1.5 lb). That's approximately the weight of <a href="https://imgur.com/WpnJTZf" target="_blank">this book</a>, which isn't much.</p>
<p>The main issue I think the idea has is using magnets for damping. Magnet attraction/repulsion drops off quite radically with distance, and the idea for cushioning essentially requires spreading out the force required to change something's direction of motion over a longer period of time. I'm not sure magnetic force is best applied to this problem...you might get better results from placing a pillow in the bottom of your normal rucksack.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They aren't a hiking pack company, they're a gimmick pack company, so I doubt the usability, quality, and comfort are that good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more running or general up and down you do, the more of an advantage the magnetic backpack would have. </p>
<p>In terms of raw numbers though, I think you're probably adding a lot more than a few pounds of magnets. If the magnetic contraption weighs 50% as much as the stuff in the backpack you lose all benefit and then some. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The floating isn't doing much when walking.</p>
<p>That's why the whole video is people jumping and running. No one is running 10 miles with a 50lb pack. Lol. Shorter distances makes it less of a benefit, so does packing lighter.</p>
<p>So... Who is this for? A masochistic navy seal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where you're wrong. There's an entire sport built up around carrying heavy packs for distances from 10 to 45+ miles over tough terrain. It's got roots in military life, but it's actually more popular among civilians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because if you fall on your back, it'll launch you into the air, duh. </p>
<p>Seriously though, I imagine magnets take up less space, since you're using their force to push, rather than taking up all that space with the springs. Not sure which would be lighter overall though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Springs would be much better for this. Magnets repel each other with a force proportional to the inverse square of their distance. This means that the effect is almost nil until the two magnets are almost touching, and then it ramps up hard. It would be almost as much jolt as an undamped load. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes. But that backpack is useless.<br />
1) Hiking is dirty. Moving parts don't like dirt.<br />
2) Every ounce counts. This system weighs at least a pound or two. When you're out hiking 20 miles in a day, that's a whole hell of a lot of weight. I've ditched extra pants and sleeping rolls because of the added weight.<br />
3) Moving parts break. Imagine you're 3 days into a 7 day hike and this thing seizes up. Now you're stuck with that extra weight that's serving absolutely no purpose. Chances are it got stuck somewhere on the track where your load isn't balanced, either. Now you have a heavy ass bag that you can't balance properly. </p>
<p>I would stay away from this contraption. It's a gimmick and anyone who actually backpacks knows it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know if I'd go that far. To decide that, I think a caloric comparison of someone carrying the extra 6lbs from this backpack walking for a day, and someone with a normal backpack would suffice. How the backpack works seems pretty intuitive if you ask me. I can easily see it saving calories, or at the very least straining your back/joints less even with the added 6lbs.</p></div>		</li>
