			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is that the FDA wasn’t designed to be able to handle that many applicants in terms of budget and with regard to its mission. Also the legal definition for what is required to be screened is narrowly tailored. It would have to be broader in scope, where to be able to include all supplements, it would have to say anything that is consumable. Would ready made smoothies from a supermarket fortified with vitamin C or cupcakes with Vitamin D from a bakery require FDA approval. It’s a slippery slope.</p>
<p>Yes, times have changed, but often it takes time for institutions to adapt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it’s not that vitamins don’t have to be screened by the FDA, but anything that claims to be “healthy” needs to be screened by the FDA. You want to screen everything by the FDA, whether or not they say anything? Where’s the end to that line of reasoning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooo I want to chime in that I used to work for a major vitamin company, and while the bottles all had the FDA disclaimer, we did still get inspected/audited by the FDA every year. Maybe it was voluntary, maybe it was just for producing consumables, but I know it happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are private organizations that set standards that are pretty solid. I am weary of some though, because they operate for profit (which doesn’t automatically mean they aren’t trustworthy) as some believe it is in their interest to “pass” products for financial gain, but then again others argue it isn’t in their interest to pass everyone as it lowers credibility. </p>
<p>NSF is a pretty solid 3rd party and you can’t go wrong with them from what I know. But there a number of other good ones as well. They created the American National Standard for Dietary supplements, which are guidelines and tests to check for purity, pollutants, and content.  They also set the standard for GMP- good manufacturing processes. However, just because they aren’t NSF verified doesn’t mean they are not good. There are just so many brands on the market today, I’m talking in the thousands throughout the world (a lot of them come from the same manufacturers).</p></div>		</li>

Many supplements were contaminated with ingredients not listed on the label, ranging from potentially dangerous fillers to actual drugs and banned substances. There is absolutely no oversight and their only trade-off is that they're not allowed to make any claims about their product. And all because a bunch of idiots in the 90s thought the government was going to take away their vitamins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, supplements are regulated under 21 CFR part 111 (and parts of others) which is enforced by the FDA. The problem is the vast majority of companies can do whatever they want, as long as they don’t attract too much attention, due to a lack of enforcement.  Essentially, the barriers for entry are so low for making and marketing a supplement that the market is flooded with them and the FDA doesn’t have enough resources to audit every one.</p>
<p>Instead, FDA mostly focus on companies making unsubstantiated claims, or companies that have had a reportable adverse event. Basically as long as you keep your head down and don’t attract any attention to your supplement, the chances of getting audited are very slim. The disclaimer seen on many labels is one way of doing this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are some exceptions. Like if your doctor determines that you’re anemic (low iron), then they might tell you to increase the iron in your diet and take iron supplements. But in my experience you have to be pretty anemic, and they want you to come back for more bloodwork. Doctors don’t just tell you to take supplements willy-nilly.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the typical person <strong>eating a varied diet that includes fruit and vegetables</strong> does NOT need vitamins and will not benefit from taking them.</p>

<p>If you’re a broke college student living on packets of ramen, a multi-vitamin may be beneficial.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even a broke college student’s diet is almost always varied enough to cover the total daily recommended values for different vitamins. You can avoid scurvy by having a slice of lime in your drink and not even eating the lime. </p>
<p>The “must buy vitamins” panic is not based on medical science. It’s to the point that in public health graduate school classes they tell doctors and healthcare professionals to ask <em>what supplements or vitamins are you taking?</em> and then they can explain why they are harmless or unnecessary. </p>
<p>It’s my understanding that if they’re harmless but unnecessary the doctor says nothing unless prompted by the patient because maintaining a positive relationship is more important than calling out snake oil. Also patients are personally offended when a doctor tells them that taking xyz is in no way beneficial. They’re less likely to go back to that doctor, and their impression of the medical community is sometimes irreparably damaged. </p>
<p>But I ask my doctor “what supplements, if any,  <em>should</em> I be taking based on my blood work?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protip for said college students: many breakfast cereals are fortified with a huge variety of vitamins. Check the labels, but if you need a dorm-friendly food that's relatively cheap and might be able to make up some nutrients you're missing, that's my go-to.</p>
<p>Also, instant mashed potatoes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're giving too much credit for how close most individuals' diets are to the average diet.  The average probably doesn't need supplements, individuals are picky or lazy or busy or all three.  I agree about people taking an &quot;array&quot; of supplements, but a cheap multivitamin wastes a few cents a day at worst, and catches your deficiencies when they crop up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there's no harm in taking a proper multivitamin. Most vitamins are either harmless in excess or your body has ways to digest/dispose of most of them so taking them is harmless. The notable exception is Vitamin A which is lethal in large amounts. Another one worth noting is iron if you have hemochromatosis, which is caused when your body no way to limit your iron intake so you just keep absorbing it until it's a problem. I mention it because it is one of the few diseases where blood letting actually works.</p></div>		</li>
