			<div class="markdown"><p>Compressing air does not necessarily heat it up. For example, if the compression happens very slowly and the container is a good heat conductor, the temperature of the gas remains a constant. This is called Isothermal compression. </p>
<p>However, if the container is perfectly insulated or the process happens very rapidly, the temperature of the gas raises. This case is called Adiabatic compression. Adiabatic processes are characterized by zero heat transfer with the surroundings. In the case of perfect insulation, the container stops the heat from flowing and in the case of rapid compression, the process occurs too fast for any heat transfer to occur. (Heat transfer is a slow process.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's  an equation called the ideal gas law</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PV = nKT</p>
<p>P = pressure, V = volume, n = # particles, K = a constant and T is temperature.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The two sides must always balance each other, so if the pressure doubles,  then it's either accompanied by a doubling in temperature or # particles.</p>
<p>If a submarine at 100 meter depth and normal pressure suddenly loose containment, then the pressure will rise about 10'fold. Think of the water like a piston putting pressure on the air trapped in the submarine. According to the equation,</p>
<p>P --&gt; 10 P</p>
<p>leads to</p>
<p>T --&gt; 10 T</p>
<p>and you cook :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure increases 10x because the volume decreases by 90%.  And this is only at static equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been years since I did any chemistry of this sort, but isn't the increase in P offset by the decrease in V? In the case of the imploding submarine, the pressure is increased (from water flooding the vessel) and the volume that the air molecules occupy is reduced?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s right. The surroundings did work on the vessel and that energy goes into temperature and entropy cost to compress in an ideal gas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but there's also an increase in temperature.</p>
<p>There are two unknowns here (V_final and T_final), and there are other equations that must be taken into account.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something fast like that would be adiabatic compression.</p>
<p>PV^gamma = const
where gamma = 7/5 assuming most of the air is diatomic</p>
<p>So the absolute temperature would be 2.5x for a tenfold decrease in volume. Still pretty hot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on the scientific answers here: I used to work at a dive shop. We had a pretty robust tank-filling air compressor with large bank tanks. You could fill a normal-sized diving cylinder off these bank tanks very quickly. The tanks themselves are made of about an inch or so of aluminum and when they're filled up quickly, the rapidly compressing air makes them pretty warm. Not like painfully hot, but because aluminum doesn't transfer heat well, they're much hotter inside. So I can imagine the same  effect applies to submarines as well.</p>
<p>Edit: had my science wrong apparently</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum is an excellent heat conductor. It’s fifth after diamond, silver, gold and copper. Diamond is actually carbon but the other carbon allotropes aren’t good heat conductors. </p>
<p>When I used to dive the tanks were put in a water bath. I was told that was in case they exploded during refill. I gather that’s no longer the practice?</p></div>		</li>
