			<div class="markdown"><p>As somebody who is a bit over 2 meters tall:<br />
I do have lots of stretch marks on my back.<br />
And every growth spurt made my whole lower legs, especially the shin area hurt like a motherfucker.<br />
I would just lay on the couch in the evenings hurting like hell...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I hit a growth spurt in my early teens, I started to develop a pretty bad pain in my knees. It got so bad I went to the doctor and he basically told me my bones were growing faster than the rest of my body.  I had a golf ball-sized knot on both my knees where the bone was protruding out.</p></div>		</li>
