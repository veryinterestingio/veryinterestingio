			<div class="markdown"><p>People sometimes mention this sort of stuff when they wake up. I think it’s because when you’re induced you essentially switch off, and the next moment you remember is waking up. There’s nothing really in between (unlike sleep, where you probably do process stuff from your external environment albeit subconsciously) so there’s this period that might feel like a second to you, but in reality it’s been hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an op a few years ago that put me under for a few hours. When they &quot;woke me up&quot; they were surprised how quick I came to, to the point where I was still intubated when I woke up and they realised &quot;oh fuck, we need to get that out of him&quot; and so was conscious having the pipe removed. I calmly said &quot;morning ladies&quot; to the nurses, and then threw up in a bowl because of the taste of whatever shit they put on that tube. Was an interesting story to tell the Mrs when I got home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually normal and expected for an awake extubation (taking the tube out). We don’t mind patients remembering that bit...just not the cutting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I remember as a kid sometimes I would get lucky enough to catch a sleep just like you described:</p>
<p>I would close my eyes and then all of a sudden it's morning, like no time passed.</p>
<p>It hasn't happened in years, and it would be a rare occurance.  </p>
<p>I wonder if it is just a child thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely is not a child thing. I still occasionally have that sort of sleep. </p>
<p>You have to be extremely tired (physically) for this to happen. Go on a long strenuous hike, do a long tiring workout or any physical activity you enjoy (games, adventure sports, anything really) - you have to make sure you are really tired at the end of it (and maybe have sore muscles). I'd say at least 5-6 hours of heavy physical activity in a day, more if you are used to doing physical activity every day. You'll sleep like a baby that day and will have that feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been under anesthesia no less than four times in my life due to various health issues, and I do get what you are saying and are worried about. The fears of being an 'impostor' of some sort are very common, but i believe a whole lot of it stems from pop culture and not so much our own experiences. Anesthesia is an incredibly unnatural event in anyone's life and not all of us deal with it that great. You're not crazy. I would certainly echo another comment's advice about learning mindfulness, that has been invaluable to me. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anaesthesia can cause brain damage, it is more similar to drinking to excess and passing out, than regular sleep, which is healing for the brain.  It is a miracle to avoid the pain of surgery, yet it can come at great cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're telling me! I sure ain't exactly mentally sound now due to 20-some years of medical adventures - my short memory has sucked for a long time (although there's been some improvement with learning meditation) - but I'm fine with chalking that up to just being a human in 2020. :) Cheers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's been a long time, but no, I don't remember going under. But it's just that I was gone for hours but there's no sense of like continuity, I guess. Like I left one person, there was nothing, no time, nothing, then a different me woke up. Like I have the same memories but I'm not me anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not normal to? I remember them telling me to count backwards and I don’t remember past 6. </p>
<p>Leading up to that moment is choppy. The nurse came in and went to where the (IV?) stand was and the arm with the needle. I didn’t even notice her injecting something. As she’s pulling the needle out she goes “I just have you something to calm you before we take you to the operating room”. Within seconds I felt AMAZING. The ceiling tiles were the best thing ever. They could have taken me anywhere and I would have been thrilled about it. No worries in the world. I remember as far as leaving through the doors of the ER. </p>
<p>Next memory is them putting a mask on my face and telling me to count back. Whatever the gave me was something I will always remember and must be dangerous in the wrong hands. I can see how people crave it.</p>
<p>I was told I reacted aggressively to the sedation. I remember being wheeled out and all the way to my room. I was angry. They took my “friend” (my appendix) and wouldn’t give it back. My dentist has also said they had to give me “a lot of drugs” to keep me under IV sedation and I fought them at the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first surgery I was put under general, had ORIF done on both left and right wrist. They had to put my IV in my foot which sucked major ass because the first nurse couldn't do it so I got poked a lot before another nurse took over. </p>
<p>Anyways, they gave me the meds and the nurse turned to my mom and said &quot;she won't remember anything after this point&quot; I remember thinking HA! I am determined to remember. </p>
<p>There was a time skip in my memory and they wheeled me into the surgery room and a very large lady moved me onto a different bed and the lights were really bright then... Nothing. Woke up in the recovery room and chatted with a nurse and then threw up a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is hilarious! I wonder how the medical team would handle that kind of thing. Like, if they promised to bring you your, &quot;friend,&quot; would you be rational enough to calm down? Or is the anger just your default after anesthesia and your brain has to come up with something to explain why you're angry?</p></div>		</li>
