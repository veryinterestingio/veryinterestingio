			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had a not-quite paralysis where I've fallen asleep on my arm to the point that I couldn't move or feel it, and so woken up in the middle of the night to a) a missing right arm, and b) a random arm that couldn't be mine cause I can't feel it. Had one hell of a freakout thinking I was being grabbed </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but not in the way you're looking. The nerve cells are sheathed in fat that helps to insulate the signal allowing it to travel faster. They theorize that people who are carriers for Tay Sachs and gaucher's, a terminal fatty storage genetic disease, have added insulation on the nerves allowing the signals to travel faster. </p></div>		</li>
