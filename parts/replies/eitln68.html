<p>Horizon distance = sqrt[(Moon Radius + Eye Height)2 - (Moon radius)2] = approx. 2.64km.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A consequence for the curious: if you were to stand at the center of any of the larger craters (diameters from tens to ~100km), you wouldn't know you were in a crater.  The crater walls (mountain ranges) would be far beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>For reference, here's <a href="https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/celestial-objects-to-watch/the-mysteries-of-plato/" target="_blank">Plato</a>.  The four larger craterlets on the crater floor have diameters of about 2-2.5km (so the crater wall would be discernible in those).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this true? the 2.64 km distance isn’t the max distance you can see, just the point at which an object on the ground wouldn’t be visible due to curvature, if the walls of the crater were 2 meters or more tall then you’d still be able to see them, at double this distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well written. Should we go for slightly different question then? How high (in terms of altitude) you need to be above the surface of Earth to start noticing curvature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Using the same method but plugging in the earth's radius of 6371km, and adjusting your eye level height up in order to get a curvature of over 1cm across a meter stick held at arms length, you would need to be at a height of 2300m.<br />
That is high up, but not crazy high.  It's taller than any man made tower, but there are mountains that are certainly that tall. If you could find a mountain that has a flat horizon you can see, then you should be able to tell (maybe looking out over the ocean on a clear day from Mauna Kea at 4200m).<br />
Airplane cruising altitude is at least four times the height you need. At a cruising altitude of 10,000m you would see over 2cm in deflection across your meter stick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much. I knew it had to be lower than B737 cruising altitude, since I can see the curvature almost everyday :) Have some silver!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could guarantee that the correct part of your eye stays in the same spot when changing where you look and keep the movement smooth, theoretically no it's not relevant but practically yes it is relevant.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Turning your head is going to add error to your results greater than the effect you're trying to measure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes.  Picture this:  over 120 degrees of your view, you are viewing a large chunk of the horizon.  If you hold a meter stick at arms length, the meter stick takes up your whole view more or less.    It would be much easier to notice a curvature across the whole meter stick than it would be to notice a curvature from the 49cm tick to the 51cm tick (if you had a very narrow field of view). </p></div>		</li>
