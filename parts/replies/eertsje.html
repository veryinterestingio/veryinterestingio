<p>Non-aluminum antiperspirants often have to add in another antimicrobial (triclosan, polyhexamethylene, etc.) as a substitute for exactly the reason you state. Well, plus the smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about magnesium? I'm super sensitive to both aluminum and baking soda in deodorants and antiperspirants, and I'm currently using one that has magnesium, beeswax, sweet almond oil and fragrances. Does it have a similar effect to the antimicrobial effects of aluminum cause it works really well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acne is from clogged oil ducts around hair follicles (sometimes these are called pores also).  Bacteria feed on the oil (sebum) and if the opening is clogged they can continue to grow in the pore forming pus and such.</p>
<p>Antiperspirants form a gel that temporarily blocks the pore for the sweat gland which is mostly salty water, not oil.  It isn't as hard a blockage as with acne and oil ducts and sweat doesn't have much for bacteria to feed on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's looking likely that this is a yes. </p>
<p>My undergrad cancer lecturer (Dr Phillipa Darbre) has published 30+ papers on the link between deodorants/antiperspirants and breast cancer. Specifically looking at aluminium salts and parabens. There is an increasing awareness, thanks to her tireless campaigning (of the clearly obvious fact in hindsight), that these deodorant based compounds and subsequently formed complexes act to alter differentiation decisions in a cell. The first article I've linked is an old review she published. The second is a more recent research paper from another group looking in vitro at aluminium salts and carcinogenesis. You can follow the rabbit hole yourselves but personally I've stopped using deodorants/antiperspirants in general. If I feel the need to use one (rare), I'll use a product free of these ingredients. </p>

<p>as i understand it, the real culprits are more likely antiperspirants (as your links seem to support) rather than deodorants, the aluminum compounds hinder perspiration, while deodorants simply mask the odors, these findings are why i only use deodorants, if it's white and chalky, don't use it, go for the clear/gel ones</p>
<p>i'm sure there's more to the story, so please correct me if you have more knowledge </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. People who claim that &quot;Aluminum is a neruotoxin&quot; are not exactly incorrect, but the Aluminum from antiperspirant isn't getting into your brain. The &quot;heightened levels of aluminum&quot; found in damaged brain tissue are a result of the damaged tissues absorbing aluminum and many other metals and compounds, not healthy tissue absorbing it and becoming damaged.</p>
<p>The perceived increase in Altzheimers is a result of people living longer, being better able to diagnose it, and conditions like CTE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention aluminum is pretty ubiquitous in the environment. Both water and soil contain trace amounts and this will end up in food. I did ICP analysis on food raw materials and you'd fine PPM values of aluminum in just about everything. So any time you eat something you are exposing yourself to aluminium via ingestion. Worrying about the aluminum in antiperspirants is silly in context.</p></div>		</li>
