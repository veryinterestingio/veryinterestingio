			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Back then it fell under the category of ‚Äúold age‚Äù.</p>
<p>Nowadays, very rarely does somebody die of ‚Äúold age‚Äù with no other cause of death. Multiple organ failure, pneumonia, cancer, etc all used to make up the old age classification but have since become separate from the original title.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That article is actually a case of, to quote The Onion, &quot;A new medical report warns; getting screened for cancer is a leading cause of finding out that you have cancer&quot;</p>
<p>Unless you happen to live in radon housing you're not being exposed to more radiation today than you used to. And given that we're not using open fires to cook our food, probably less carcinogens as well.</p>
<p>The reason why people are diagnosed with cancer, and dying from cancer, more often these days is that we've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gotten much better at not dying from other things like typhus, smallpox, diarrhea, bacterial infections etc etc</li>
<li>Gotten much better at finding out that you're dying from cancer. Instead of &quot;Old age&quot; , &quot;atrophy&quot; or &quot;congestion&quot;. Back in the day (pre-20th century) &quot;cancer&quot; was usually only used as a diagnosis if the cancer manifested close to the skin (so that it could be seen or felt).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that life expectancy was shorter is because more young people, specially infants and children died more often. This doesn't mean there were no old people, it was in fact not uncommon for people to life to 60+ years. Just that when you take the average when a lot of people died young, it's going to be lower. Of course nowadays more people live longer compared to, say, 100 years ago. And we got much better at reducing child mortality. I just don't think longer life span explains the &quot;increase&quot; in cancer. Besides young people also die from cancer. It's more likely to be our ability to diagnose it.</p></div>		</li>
