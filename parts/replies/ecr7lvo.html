Can’t emphasize enough the difference between going to see a licensed traditional medical professional and he or she prescribes a specified quantity of herbs from a licensed traditional pharmacy, and just going to a market without seeing a professional to get the biggest Ginsen root there and hope it cures arthritis. </p>
<p>The latter is probably much more prevalent thanks to TV advertising and lack of nutritional supplement regulation, and is what most people think traditional medicine is, but there are still professionals and rules and regulations in that industry. Not saying it is scientific, but it has a system in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to further add on to this, as comments above made stuff up like how tcm is some exotic stuff grounded up and it’s “secret medicine”, proper traditional tcm has a prescription, which you can then get the herbs from any normal chinese apothecary.</p>
<p>Also proper concept of tcm is not “drink this cure all wonder”, rather it’s consuming certain herbs in a certain way with the correct prescription to strengthen your body and immune system so that it can naturally fight off the sickness. </p>
<p>of course, tcm has its limitations, it obviously can’t cure cancer or blood related diseases or any disease that your body can not naturally fight off on it’s own, any “folk medicine” that says that is pretty much a quack. </p>
<p>To further highlight something relevant, european cultures and other cultures which have a longer history has a “food culture”, where certain ingredients should not be consumed together, however all this is lost in america where there is no emphasis in “clashing foods”.</p>
<p>there are ingredients in TCM which are acknowledged by western community as having certain properties, eg cordecyps and ginseng. there are also ingredients in tcm where it’s beneficial when eaten alone but combine them with certain other ingredients it’s a poison. most of this is science, just 3000 years worth of science that white people derisively sneer at. </p>
<p>Licensed TCM is just like licensed doctors, there are the good ones, and those that are really bad. </p>
<p>Final point, problem with what people think is tcm and what people view as tcm is “eat this it’s good eat that it’s good” but folk remedies and proper licensed tcm is totally different. </p>
<p>final final point, western medicine and antibiotics has taken root so much that “you caught something, here take antibiotics” to the point where we have created superbugs that’s resistant to antibiotics. but in the first place, normal sickness which the body can fight off on its own by boosting your naturally immunity should not even been given antibiotics in the first place</p></div>		</li>
