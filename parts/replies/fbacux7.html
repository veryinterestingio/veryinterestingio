			<div class="markdown"><p>The collision avoidance wasn't a failure of their algorithm, but a failure of the SpaceX communications system.  As in, their paging system didn't tell them that the collision probability had been increased by the Air Force.  It had absolutely nothing to do with the satellite, SpaceX just never got the message telling them &quot;Hey, we've recalculated the probability, and it turns out that it may be an issue after all.&quot;</p>
<p>It's right there in your link (just ctrl+f and search for &quot;SpaceX traced&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  That is not a failure of the algorithm.  That is a failure by SpaceX's communications with the Air Force.</p>
<p>It can very easily be read like this:</p>
<p>1 in 50,000 probability, both ESA and SpaceX agree no maneuvers needed.</p>
<p>Update to 1 in 1,000 probability, only ESA gets the message.  They call SpaceX, ask if they would move.  SpaceX, having not received any new information, thinks &quot;I thought we already agreed no maneuver was necessary&quot; and declines.</p>
<p>At no point does it say that the ESA updated SpaceX about the probabilities, it looks like they had assumed that SpaceX saw the same update they had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... There's also this response from the CEO of Iridium Communications, which operate the currently second largest satellite constellation in orbit (After Starlink).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. We move our satellites on average once a week and don't put out a press release to say who we maneuvered around...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention ESA posted a long ass tweet chain complaining about a bunch of stuff and ended it with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ESA is preparing to automate this process using #AI #ArtificialIntelligence. From the initial assessment of a potential collision to a satellite moving out of the way, automated systems are becoming necessary to protect our space infrastructure #SpaceSafety<br />
ESA's future will be decided at this year's ministerial council in November. Find out more about the Agency's #SpaceSafety proposal here:  <a href="http://blogs.esa.int/space19plus/programmes/space-debris/" target="_blank"><a href="http://blogs.esa.int/space19plus/programmes/space-debris/" target="_blank">http://blogs.esa.int/space19plus/programmes/space-debris/</a></a>  and stay tuned for a machine learning competition in which you can play with ESA's #spacedebris data!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read this as ESA pulled this stunt and blew it way out of proportion to plug their AI collision avoidance program in the hopes to get government funding.</p>
<p>There's also &quot;this SpaceX confirmed to <em>Quartz</em> that its Starlink satellites have made a total of 16 autonomous maneuvers in space, <strong>but did not say when they occurred.&quot;</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, just to be clear here, your argument is that a multinational scientific collaboration went out of their way to defame a private company for profit, rather than said private company manipulating or obfuscating the truth in the name of PR?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting funding for research is like an eternal struggle for scientists.</p>
<p>They want money to build cool shit, politicians didn't want to give them money. Agencies constantly having to justify why they should receive more funding is not a new thing.</p>
<p>That's not saying the problem isn't real. Estimating satellite orbits via ground observation and manually shifting through the data is archaic. It's crazy we don't have some kind of system where all satellites can broadcast their exact position and velocity to each other every millisecond and make autonomous adjustments.</p>
<p>We desperately need a system like that and with Starlink going up it will get way worse in the future. Pitching that to politicians with orbital simulations and collision probabilities though... Posting on twitter, &quot;Look, these things in SPACE almost crashed!&quot; is way easier. Everything they said is true, it's just not nearly as big a deal as they make it out to be. By the look of this thread they obviously succeeded with that.</p>
<p>How do you think we landed on the moon? Did NASA scientists go to the white house with a power point presentation (or the 1960's equivalent) and pitched all the different scientific merits of going to the moon? No, the way NASA got funding for their scientific missions to the moon was with news articles about the russians watching us with their spy satellites and flying over our heads 24/7, pitching it as a way to show technological dominance, a way to show capitalism being superior to communism and a way to take back space from the russians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because governmental agencies have never lied, misled the public, or otherwise obfuscated the truth for political benefit?</p>
<p>ESA's twitter rant was just to scaremonger politicians into giving them money for their &quot;collision avoidance program&quot; thing that they announced at the end. It's politics.</p></div>		</li>
