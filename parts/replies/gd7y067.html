			<div class="markdown"><p>And then working along with the melatonin, which helps you regulate WHEN you should fall asleep, you have adenosine. Adenosine is the neurotransmitter (like dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline) that makes you feel tired and tells your brain IF you should sleep. It slowly builds up as the photoreceptors are actively engaged by light, then as you sleep they seep back into your brain and you feel awake/refreshed again. Caffeine blocks adenosine on the brain, keeping you from feeling more tired than you already are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think research has been coming out that the Cerebrospinal Fluid actually helps flush out the adenosine.  Where it goes, exactly, nobody really knows.  Adenosine is a byproduct of ATP metabolism so it probably builds up with brain activity and needs to be physically removed instead of reabsorbed.</p>
<p>Edit: Nevermind, it's adenosine deanimase that reduces concentration of free adenosine in the brain.   The CFS does wash some adenosine away but apparently isn't responsible for the majority of adenosine concentration reduction.</p></div>		</li>
