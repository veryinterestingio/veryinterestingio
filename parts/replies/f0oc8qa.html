			<div class="markdown"><p>1: More a question for Maria than me, but I'm not aware of any <em>concerted efforts</em>. Most individual editors, at least in the STEM fields I'm familiar with, are super concerned with their individual metrics for getting papers reviewed and triaged with appropriate speed.</p>
<p>This is one area where preprints really make a difference. You can often establish precedence and allow people to read your work regardless of how long the review process takes.</p>
<p>2: I've always found this opinion faintly ridiculous, but it has an annoying longevity, especially in biology. If the same result is found through similar-but-not-the-same methods, this collectively is MUCH better than it being found once. When you have a publication process that takes, say, nine months, and an experimental series that takes, say, three years, the idea that someone published ten days sooner and therefore 'establishes precedence' is deeply silly. The focus on novelty in this context is actively bad for science IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, part of why I ask on #1 is that, in at least one case I'm aware of, preprints do not get used to establish precedence necessarily. One of the main sites for exoplanets uses the first paper to be published in the case of independent discoveries of exoplanets, so it's possible for one team to get their preprint out first, but another team gets the priority on the name for getting the publication out first.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if any other fields have similar circumstances.</p>
<p>And on the 2nd one, then what has to get done to get those similar papers published? Is this something the community can push on the journals, or do the journals have to push it on the community? Or is this varying by field?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I have no idea why. There is such a resistance to the idea which is built out of the total necessity in some fields for prestige publishing. It's totally antithetical to progress IMO.</p>

<p>... Why do we have to fight? These are obviously both real contributions. Putting one on a pedestal because of the vagaries of the publication process is just not congruent with how modern science works.</p></div>		</li>
