			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a reason why so many games (and also movies) have huge “pipeline” teams whose sole job is to look after the process which moves assets along into a finished product.</p>
<p>In the Bad Old Days people like 3D artists would need to re-bake assets for engine changes. Now it’s mostly a job for the pipeline team to adjust the parameters, and let the computer do the work. Which is important when you potentially have thousands and thousands of assets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, which is why I said &quot;not the only reason,&quot; however it is a <em>massive</em> reason. Unfortunately the situation is complicated.</p>
<p>Nobody looks good if your game doesn't look as good as the trailers, and game designers aren't dumb. Problem is you need to pitch the game years ahead of time, and usually you're either pitching it to business types who don't understand the details of exactly how games are made, or you're putting your trailer right next to a dozen others and need to stand out. You set goals high (possibly too high), and cross your fingers hoping either technology will catch up or you'll be able to optimize your engine enough by launch to release the product you promised.</p>
<p>It gets even more complicated when talking about games releasing in the window of cross-gen. There's a reason the biggest &quot;this game looked nothing like the trailers and demos,&quot; games are usually released in this cross-gen window. Big devs get heads-up and dev-kits years before release, however the final performance of these consoles are still just guesses up until right before release. Hardware and architecture changes, performance gets better and worse, etc. When you're targeting what you think final hardware will be able to do, <em>and</em> trying to push the hardware <em>and</em> trying to make your game stand out among the others, it's pretty understandable why this happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it shows a complete lack of understanding of how games are developed by gaming journalism. Like whenever I see &quot;game uses brand new technology that boosts performance by removing geometry you can't see!&quot; posted for the millionth time.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there's a level of responsibility on the part of the devs to communicate early on when downscaling happens, and certain devs do this more than others, but people need to understand that it will always be part of the process to some extent.</p></div>		</li>
