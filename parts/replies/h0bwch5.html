Mass (and energy and other stuff but I'll just say mass to keep it short) causes the way we measure lengths and times to vary in our relationship to that mass. The changes in rulers and clocks mean that the line of motion with no force acting on an object appears 'curved' into an orbit. Ignoring air resistance, 'falling down' or a ball being thrown, etc. are all <em>technically</em> really small parts of an orbit that just happens to be stopped by the ground. So when you're in orbit you're actually not experiencing any 'real' force. </p>
<p>It's only when the ground is preventing you from moving through your orbit, that the ground is pushing back up at you. The ground pushing up on you <em>feels the same</em> as you being 'pulled' toward the center of the Earth and being stopped by the ground. Same deal as being in a car going around a curve and feeling like you're pressed into the car door, when it is really the car door pressing you toward the center of the circle. </p>
<p>So &quot;gravitational waves&quot; are a bit of a misnomer. They're catchy because gravity is something we're all familiar with. But what they are more truly is a wave of ruler and clock changes. Distances between stationary objects briefly get a little longer then a little shorter and oscillate a bit. If you were to plot the apparent distance between the stationary objects, the plot would look like a wave.</p>
<p>However, I'll also note that given a whole bunch of waves of different wavelengths, we can make any arbitrary form we'd like. So it's <em>possible</em> that the overall constant 'pull' of gravity we feel is actually the sum of a whole bunch of waves at once. The parallel here is like a constant electric field. If you have a capacitor, for instance, there's the appearance of a constant field between the plates. However, we know that electromagnetism is carried by photons, which are wavy-things. So it's <em>possible</em> that there are similar wavy-things carrying space-time curvature information, these being 'gravitons.' We haven't figured out how to make the maths of that work out, so we don't know if it's the best description of reality yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Are you by chance familiar with The Radcliffe Wave? It's a &quot;spoke&quot; of solar systems in our galaxy that perfectly follows wave logic. Although not in their paper the researchers have also claimed the matter even follows rules for overtones. I'm curious of your thoughts on that relating to my initial question; as it seems for practical purposes that (ostensibly) gravity functioned as a wave forming a system of matter echoing its properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not familiar with exactly that thing, but it <em>sounds</em> like you're talking about what we call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wave_theory" target="_blank"><em>density</em> wave</a>, which is a different thing from a <em>gravitational</em> wave. Essentially one of the theories about how spiral galaxies have the arms they have is that variations in density tend to go like waves. So think of traffic on a highway, one person brakes, the next person brakes a little harder, etc. and then you have this wave of apparent slowness that passes back through the traffic even though no one is slowing down 'for' anything beyond not hitting the person in front of them. Something similar might happen in galaxies where when stars clump up, they create a gravity well, slowing down stars passing through, but then stars eventually exit that 'well' and you just have a denser region of stars and gas in the galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is why objects in orbit around each other spiral inwards - they lose potential energy in the form of gravitational waves. For systems like Sun-Earth, this is negligible even on cosmological time scales. However, for black hole/neutron star systems like the ones LIGO and Virgo have observed, this is a very real effect that causes the objects to collide.</p></div>		</li>
