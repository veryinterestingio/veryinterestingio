			<div class="markdown"><p>The expansion of the universe is technically measured in units of inverse seconds, (which has the same units as what you said) but that doesn't really tell you much. Expansion rate is usually quoted in units of km/s per megaparsec. What this shows is the 'speed' of expansion of two objects in the universe a megaparsec apart. </p>
<p>Because the rate of expansion increases with distance, giving a speed/rate for universal expansion is meaningless without also saying how far apart the two objects are. But if you do specify the distance between the two objects, then you can start talking about the speed/rate of expansion. Because speed increases linearly with distance, the rate of expansion between two objects will eventually be faster than light if you go far enough. This doesn't violate relativity because objects are only limited to the speed of light when traveling <em>through</em> space, whilst expansion is the expansion of the universe itself rather than objects moving through it, so it isn't bound by the speed of light. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth adding that once this happens, you would not be able to see anything. Light is essentially being pulled back from you and it would never reach your eyes.</p>
<p>The night sky would eventually be black.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It always bugged me that cosmic expansion meant that somewhere, sometime, two object were moving apart faster than light... but is that really true?  I thought galaxies around us were red-shifted which sort of led to the expansion theory, but doesn't it mean then if those galaxies are moving away from us because of expansion, then there are acutally zero relativistic effects due to that movement?  That just seems kind of crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expansion is a measure of frequency (in theory). In SI units the current Hubble constant (rate of expansion) is about 2x10^−18 s^(−1).</p>
<p>That means that each bit of space will be getting bigger by a factor of 2x10^-18 every second. So if you have a distance of 1m now, a second later it will be 1 + 2x10^-18 m long a second later.</p>
<p>That's a very small number.</p>
<p>Usually it is measured in km/s / Mpc - kilometres per second, per megaparsec - which gives a number of about 70. I.e. something 70 megaparsecs away from you will appear to be moving away at 70 km/s.</p>
<p>This means that things further away are moving away faster. So logically there must be a point where things are so far away that they're moving away at &quot;<em>c</em>&quot; (3 x 10^8 m/s, the &quot;speed of light&quot; or &quot;local speed limit&quot;). Using the numbers above, we get a distance of about 14bn light years. Stuff 14bn light years away from us appears to be moving away from us at <em>c</em>. Stuff further away will be moving away faster. [And we can currently see some of the stuff that is now moving that fast - the edge of the observable universe is about 46bn light years away.]</p>
<p>But doesn't special relativity tell us that nothing can move faster than <em>c</em>? No! It only tells us that stuff can't go faster than <em>c</em> locally, or in flat spacetime (locally enough all &quot;smooth&quot; spacetime will be flat). Universal expansion means that spacetime <em>isn't</em> flat, but over large distances curves outwards (i.e. distances get bigger the further away you go). So speeds can get bigger over larger distances.</p>
<p>Another way of thinking about it is that it isn't that stuff on the other side of the observable universe is moving away from us, but that the space between us is getting bigger. It is effectively the same thing, but can be an easier way of thinking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using this expansion equation, and the idea that we are on a 'balloon' that is being blown up, and therefore creating more space between point A and B, would it be a valid analogy to say that the point where the Kms-1Mpc-1=c is analogous to the horizon on the sphere that is being created, from our point of view? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The expansion itself is measured as you describe, correct. A given point in the universe, however, is a certain distance away from us (at a given time), and therefore is receding from us at a certain speed. The furthest reaches of the universe, therefore, are receding at faster than the speed of light, and are thus completely unobservable to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Big Bang happened everywhere in the universe; it was just a much smaller universe then. </p>
<p>As for the expansion, it’s not expanding into anything, but rather the space between points is expanding. (Note: on very large scales, not like on Earth or the Solar System, where gravity is far stronger than dark energy driving the expansion.) One analogy I like on this is imagine a number line: 1,2,3,..., infinity. Now multiply everything in the number line by two: 2,4,6,..., infinity. The numbers are twice as large, but you still have the same number of them- that is what the universe’s expansion is like. </p>
<p>Some people also use the analogy of raisin bread in an oven, and how the space between raisins grows as the loaf is baked and expands. I don’t like this analogy because it brings about the issue of implying the universe is expanding into something, and it’s not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep hearing explanations similar to yours, but I simply cannot wrap my head around it. The big bang exploded from a singularity, which means there must be some sort of epicenter where that singularity was located, right? Sure, everything expands away from each other after that, so you can't really assign a particular area as the &quot;center&quot; as an observer, but there must actually be a &quot;center&quot; where that singularity was located, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive had this conversation with a few people by now, and I hope that I can boost your understanding of this concept as well with the following remark:</p>
<p>We often make the mistake when thinking about the big bang by placing ourselves in a 'third person perspective'. We imagine the big bang as something happening in front of our eyes, we observing how it 'explodes' and fills the empty void that we think of as 'space.</p>
<p>Naturally, from this visualization, questions arise like 'what was before 'the explosion', and what is the nature of this void it is exploding into? These questions dont have a physical meaning and there is no answer for them, because you are conceptualizing the concepts of time and space (as defined in modern physics) wrong.</p>
<p>What can help: there is no other place to be at the very beginning of the universe than the being 'inside' the very big bang itself, there is no such thing as a third person outsider perspective, because this is the very birth of the concepts time and space. The only possible place to be in inside it, experiencing the expansion of space as it goes. There is no 'where' because all space is compressed, and there is no 'before', because the notion of time only starts there. </p>
<p>The where/what questions you pose are as irrelevant/inconceivable as asking (using S. Hawkings analogy here) 'what is north of the north pole'? It just a question that cannot be answered. It only shows that you are visualizing these concepts wrong.  </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinning out is not what made the universe transparent.</p>
<p>The initial universe was very hot - so hot that hydrogen nuclei (protons) couldn't &quot;keep&quot; their electrons, and both flew around individually. Free electrons and free protons both interact with light, so it was &quot;foggy&quot; in this analogy. The universe expanded and cooled, and eventually most electrons and protons combined to neutral hydrogen atoms. These don't interact with the light any more, and the universe became transparent. The fog evaporated?</p></div>		</li>
