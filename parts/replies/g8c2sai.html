			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s interesting to look at the spread in North America from Mexico up to the US and into Canada. As it already semi-rapidly in Mexico and into the southern US is was a worry, however as it kept going up north it became less and less <del>rapidly spreading</del> severe and lower transition rates. By the time it hit Minnesota it wasn’t really a worry in the US and Canada had very few severe cases.</p></div>		</li>

SARS CoV-2 symptoms were so low-key in some, that it spread easily. To this day, I have patients with 2 months with positive PCR, which are deemed non contagious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it just amplified the remaining DNA of the virus, but the virus itself is consider dead in your body. I think most of the fake positive are cause by this. PCR is a technique that amplifies DNA strands by trillions. So if you do a lot of cycle of PCR, like 45 apparently, you'll have a loooot of amplified DNA and so the test will be see as positive.</p></div>		</li>
