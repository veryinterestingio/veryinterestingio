			<div class="markdown"><p>With a pump. Not much different from any other pump that pumps water. Same thing in space with air. In space when they close the airlock they evacuate as much of the air as they can out of the airlock and back into the station, but inevitably they end up losing some. That's okay though, because it is better than losing everything every time you open the door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about space, but subs have several stages the lock needs to go through so a person can go from several pressures to &quot;normal&quot; pressure safely and this is a very long process.<br />
As I understand it space air locks are much less complicated, having to handle only -1 pressure instead of +10</p></div>		</li>

<p>You just have drains in the floor then a pump that sucks in water and pushes it outside. Nothing fancy. On a spaceship airlock you just let air in through valves</p></div>		</li>
