			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. Yes a lot of it may be high in sodium but that's only one element of diet and generally these elements are used as garnishes and seasoning.</p>
<p>I always point out that historically people wouldn't have necessarily been eating foods like this in great quantities- a lot of foods we take for granted now simply wouldn't have been available except as occasional luxuries. </p>
<p>So for example if you eat North Indian food you might make butter chicken, naan and maybe mutter paneer. But that would have been once in a while, special occasion food- your average North Indian would have had a couple of chappatis and dal (lentil gravy) for their average meal. The same is true of any culture- it's just that we have access to relatively cheap high fat, high sugar food that is addictive to our Paleolithic brains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Historically your average Frenchman wouldn't likely have been able to afford the butter and cream in very large quantities. And even today they don't eat meals as large as all that. Portion size is key.</p>
<p>If you have relatively small portion sizes and aren't totally sedentary you can get away with quite a lot. The trouble for a lot of us is that we can afford to eat like Kings for every meal and don't really do much beyond sitting in offices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh god, dal and chappati were the mainstay when I visited - probably twice a day. Wealthy Indians have other problems (white ghee), but for the most part they don't eat high-calorie food except for special occasions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the region- in Kerala where I'm ancestrally from the problem is vast amounts of rice. And in the North as you say large amounts of fat can be an issue.</p>
<p>Beyond that Indians are genetically much more prone to health problems at lower BMIs than European or East Asian descended populations so even though it might not look high cal the effect on us can still be bad with more vulnerabilities to diabetes and the like.</p>
<p>But yeah dal (without ghee) and chapati has been a major help with my weight loss project. It's a reliable 200 kCal dinner that fills my stomach.</p></div>		</li>
