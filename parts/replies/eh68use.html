			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. I think I get your question. I will try to explain with a simple analogy.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to divide 10 by 2. But you don't know how to do division.  So we will invent a transform called the Confused transform.</p>
<p>It is defined as f(x, y) = number of subtractions of y from x until answer is 0.</p>
<p>So the Confused transform of 10/2 = number of subtractions (10 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 0). The answer is of course 5.</p>
<p>You have managed to accomplish division by only using subtraction and counting. In this same way, the Laplace transform converts differentiation to algebra using the magic of complex numbers and e.</p>
<p>So what you are solving for is a linear equation in terms of a complex number s, which is exactly the same as solving a differential equation in terms of x, provided that s is the Laplace transformation of x.</p>
<p>Here's another analogy that is more tactile. I want you to make a square hole in the middle of a piece of paper. This would require some rather fancy tools. But what if you could change the paper itself? Fold the piece of paper twice and cut off the corner with simple scissors.  You have cut off a triangle at a corner.
But when you unfold the paper... voila, you have a square hole in middle of your paper.</p>
<p>This is a kind of transform. Like the Laplace transform, the folding paper transform changes the 'space' in such a way that creating a square hole in the center problem is converted to the much easier cut a triangle from the corner probem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The square hole analogy is excellent. Did you come up with it, or is it from somewhere else? I ask not because I doubt your creativity, but because if it's from somewhere else, I probably want to read that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You solve an equivalent &quot;problem&quot; in a transformed domain. There is a mapping between the starting domain of functions and the transformed domain, and an exact correspondence of manipulation of functions.</p>
<p>Take a first order linear differential equation, say:</p>
<p>y(x)'' + 2 y(x)' + y(x) = 0</p>
<p>and try to transform it into its equivalent algebraic problem, in the Laplace's domain.</p>
<p>Do you see by this example why it is convenient?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright, maybe I didn't phrase my question well. How did Laplace himself came up with this transform? How does it work that, when I solve an equation that is almost entirely different from the original, I end up with the solution? What's the significance of s?</p></div>		</li>
