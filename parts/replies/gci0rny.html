			<div class="markdown"><p>Another potential reason (without any specific knowledge on my part either) is that the company simply has not yet validated storage and stability at that temperature. This is based on a product I developed a few years ago in a research lab, which has many -80C freezers. We just stored our products at -80C during all the pre-clinical research, just to ensure best storage conditions. Now we are at clinical trial stage it is a lot of work to go back and validate for room temperature or 4C storage, even though we are quite sure of the product stability at those temps. Hindsight is 20-20 I guess!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How critical is -80? I thought I've read -75 C. The difference seems important because dry ice sublimates at -78 C, so it seems to me it would be easier to distribute to clinics without specialized freezing equipment if all you needed to do was keep it packed in dry ice.</p>
<p>If it needs to be colder than dry ice, does that mean liquid nitrogen is the best alternative? And is there enough liquid N2 to provide for billions of doses of vaccine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Highly unlikely that there's anything magical about -80C for keeping the vaccine safe.</p>
<p>-80C is a standard deep-freeze design, <em>probably popular so that you can maintain dry ice</em>. My best guess is it happens to be the available storage at the biotech co that developed the vaccine, and that they haven't yet validated storage at higher temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason.  Pfizer chose not to validate at -20degC and said they were focusing on speed to market in lieu of slowing the process down and doing extra studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One additional data point: CureVac, another German biotech company who are also working on an mRNA-based COVID vaccine, have stated that their product is stable for at least three months at 5°C. That roughly fits in with the Moderna candidate vaccine, and  is a hint that the BioNTech/Pfizer one might very well remain stable at higher temperatures, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an extra piece of information (because I so rarely get to contribute to such discussions), in addition to verifying the long term stability of drug product at temperatures, it's also necessary to test the container closure integrity of the platform you choose to distribute the drug product in (such as, for example, vials made by a specific manufactuter), often times replicating transportation hazards in a lab, at those temperatures as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can talk about this with a fair amount of authority! (Finally, something to contribute to!)</p>
<p>Both are mRNA based. They both encode for a full length spike protein similar to the virus, adapted to be in the “pre-fusion” state, much like it would be if you had free floating virus in you during the early stage of infection.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they also take the same approach towards delivery: lipid nanoparticle encapsulation. The difference lies in the exact makeup of the lipids they choose to use such as DDA or DOTAP and of course, whatever tricks they used to keep the mRNA in an “unfused” shape).</p>
<p>So in many ways, they are the coke and Pepsi of upcoming vaccine products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, nice to see someone with more in-depth knowledge! </p>
<p>So could Pfizer easily change their vaccine to handle higher temps? (As the safety related risks will probably be tied to the actual mRNA string? Or am I wrong on that?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the thing to remember here is that clinical trials are some of the most mind numbingly boring but necessary work in all of medicine. (Trust me, I’m now in a lull after working on a prominent treatment that was all over the press a few weeks ago)</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible that switching the delivery system can affect how stable it is. BUT it could also affect literally a million other things as well, such as how effective it is, or how much it costs to make, or the dose, or how long it is effective for, how many doses are required, or even whether it is toxic or not( I could go on and on)</p>
<p>That’s why you NEVER CHANGE IT in the middle of a trial. Instead, you start a whole new trial with the new version and then compare results once both trials are concluded (or have reached the same phase). </p>
<p>So Pfizer could switch up the recipe, but they would be late to the game (probably) if moderna’s version legitimately works. So instead, they will likely try to beat them on delivery and distribution, locking in contracts before moderna can scale their solution. (But that’s total speculation, I don’t do strategy at Pfizer. I’m a third party in the industry giving my two cents. I’m curious to see how it unfolds)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certifying stability takes time, and there is a really good chance that they never bothered to do much testing. That means the vaccine might handle higher temps just fine.</p>
<p>Imagine: they've been storing candidates in -80 freezers as they have been making them, and periodically checking the samples. To certify them for a higher temperature would require time that they don't have anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think they need to change it. I think it's probably stable at -20c for more than a month (I'm a molecular biologist that works in pharma/biotech). There's no real point to testing it before they have their scale-up batches intended for distribution.  They aren't going to change it if it's not stable, and they can update their packaging if it is. There's no point to testing early because each batch can be slightly different. Better to test it with the real deal and know for sure. Unfortunately stability testing is slow. If you want to know it's stable for a month, you gotta wait a month. You also need to make all the assays that you will use to decide whether it's still good or not and qualify that they work and correlate with potency. Lots of T's to cross and lowercase J's to dot along the way to certifying shelf life and pfizer won't say &quot;it's <em>probably</em> good&quot; until they know for sure. That would be a massive fuckup if they did that and it turned out to be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The half lifes your talking about are in vivo, and are not because of inherent stability of the molecule, but because of the presense of RNA degrading enzymes in the cell. RNA when extracted from cells and free from these contaminating enzymes is fairly stable, though not as stable as say DNA. The reason why they suggest -80 is because thats what they tested. To be honest it would 99% be fine at -20, and probably fine at 4C for weeks. The problem is they didnt test that so they cant change their protocol till they re test that and show it is just as effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 to this response. OP is barking up the wrong tree. A lot of people think of RNA as being very fragile and prone to degradation, when really the concern is contamination with RNA degrading enzymes (known as RNases). Without enzymes actively breaking down RNA, it will stay pretty intact (as long as the pH is reasonable – and I'm sure these industry types do a bunch of other stuff when making a product that we don't do in academia).</p>
<p>But RNA isn't really that fragile – except if it's like, on your skin (we secrete RNases as a defense against RNA viruses).</p></div>		</li>
