<p>Because only one set of rules gives you a not completely fucked result. The most you can change is the symbols you use to write down the same thing, you can't make the rate of change of x^2 not be 2x.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because the area under a curve is the same in England as the area under that same curve in Bolivia. Math describes things that are <em>physically true.</em> If Bolivia had different rules for calculus, they'd be <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Vs. language, where you can call something an &quot;apple&quot; or a &quot;pomme&quot; or a &quot;jabuka&quot; and none of those are wrong, just different words for the same thing. They all mean &quot;apple&quot; if the people that speak the language think of an apple when you say it.</p>
<p>Importantly the rules of math are not <em>created</em> by humans, they're <em>discovered</em> by humans. That's why independent mathematicians in different countries all came up with the same rules without talking to each other.</p>
<p>If Bolivia and England had a different equation for the area of a circle, you could <em>measure</em> a circle and find that only one if them is right. The area of every circle in the universe IS pi*r^(2). Another country can't change that; it <strong>is</strong>. Now, they could call &quot;pi&quot; and &quot;r&quot; some other names, but the <em>rules</em> of math are fixed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s a philosophical debate whether math is invented or discovered. The phenomena it describes are inherent to the universe, we’re arguably just discovering how to describe what’s already there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because although calculus is a sort of language, the concepts behind it are the exact same and are &quot;set in stone&quot;. Gravity works the same in England as it does in Bolivia, and flower petals are arranged symetrically in both places as well.</p>
<p>Where it differs with language is that language is more of a &quot;cultural&quot; thing and is open to interpretation. You can see that by comparing languages:</p>
<p>Vacuum cleaner (because the device uses a vacuum and is used to clean) in english, stofzuiger (&quot;dustsucker&quot;, because, well, it sucks dust) in dutch, aspirateur (&quot;sucker&quot;, because it sucks) in french.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it is a human invention.</p>
<p>The universe doesn't have a language. The universe just <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>We're the ones who needed tools to describe how it works, so we developed those tools.</p>
<p>That's like saying that if I somehow sent a phillips screw to the past using a time machine, and someone makes the first phillips screwdriver they would have discovered, not invented the phillips screwdriver. They wouldn't have. They saw the screw, realized it needed turning, and invented the tool to turn it.</p></div>		</li>
