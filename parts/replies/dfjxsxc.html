			<div class="markdown"><p>Yo dawg hook me up with some perspective, so Left ventricular hypertrophy seen in runners is seen as a positive as it increases stroke volume. But how does that work when you factor in Starlings law. A larger left ventricle means that it won't be able to stretch as much as a smaller muscle due to the restrictions of the pericardial sac. Is the lowered stretch not as big of a deal as I'm making out to be when it comes to Cardiac Output? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's some serious hypertrophy to hinder ventricular filling. You're correct at the end: the lowered stretch is barely perceptible and the gains help increase cardiac output while lowering stress on the heart. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your heart gets inputs from your nervous system to increase or decrease its heart rate. The nervous system has two major inputs to the heart: sympathetic (which is will increase your heart rate) and parasympathetic (which will decrease your heart rate). When you are stressed you have an increase in your sympathetic input with an accompanying decrease in your parasympathetic input. Therefore your heart rate will increase because when you get stressed your body starts to perceive the environment as a threat and gets ready to mobilize, or run from danger (this is inherited from our ancient ancestors). There is also catecholamine which is a little chemical that circulates in your blood and can help to increase heart rate as well, so in times of distress you typically have higher levels of that in you blood</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that when you aren't physically active and your heart is working hard your blood pressure spikes in the wrong areas. For example during exercise blood vessels dilate in skeletal muscle increasing flow in that direction while constricting blood vessels that lead to digestive organs. Overall blood flow throughout the body increases. </p>
<p>When you aren't exerting yourself but your heart rate increases due to a stressor the blood isn't flowing as much into muscles. As such, pressure builds up in the heart and other organs. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer is that 5 minutes of panic attack is not enough training for the heart muscle to grow, when you compare it to runners, who train it probably like 20 hours a week.</p></div>		</li>
