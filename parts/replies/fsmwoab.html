			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live, single use plastics are banned. My state did so by charging a fee for the plastic bags, which seemed to work. Currently, there is a temporary stop on this ban due to the pandemic, but overall I think we should limit the use of plastics. </p>
<p>From a materials point of view, plastics take a long time to degrade.  As such, they end up in the ocean and then end up in fish and then end up in our bodies after eating the fish. Our bodies cannot break down plastic, so we end up getting sick.  So in my mind, plastics, no good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single use plastics does not only mean plastic bags from shops.  It covers packaging on food from supermarkets, fast food and takeout food packages, packaging on items from anything you might buy from toys to stationary to toiletries, and so much more.  It covers any plastic you only use one then throw away. </p>
<p>Banning plastic bags is an ok start but it really just a start on tackling the war on plastic waste.  </p>
<p>Alternative packaging such as bio plastics, glass, paper products and metal all are either more expensive, heavier or more prone to degradation.</p>
<p>I suppose my question was more about the movements towards alternative packing products and the movements to zero waste.  Some shops offer bring your own containers to limit packaging for example.  Will consumers motivation to reduce plastic waste and pollution become a larger influence than the economic benefits of single use plastic?  Or is it only for those consumers who can afford to pay more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the medical field we are limited to single use plastics for a number of devices for infection control measures. Everyone has become very familiar with face masks but there are also catheters, plasters, nappies, bandaging, gowns etc. Medical waste is incinerated not recycled. Likewise in research we get through ridiculous amounts of plastic labware; syringes, pipettes, well plates and T75s. </p>
<p>How can we go about changing this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People can influence a reduction if they are informed about the impact of plastic. If we knew about the harm it caused and that it impact us as well, there might be some change. </p>
<p>I am reminded of the microplastic beads in toothpaste. Some young folks found out about how fish were consuming it and that it was ending up in our food. They then held a wide campaign to ban this toothpaste. In many places you can't find this toothpaste. So, to change the course of how we use plastics, it is going to take activism. Economics won't solve it.</p></div>		</li>
