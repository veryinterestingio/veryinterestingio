<p>Here is a good picture:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wafer sizes at the majority of semiconductors are currently 150, 200, and 300mm.   Several large companies hoped to move to 450mm, but it has been nearly abandoned because the dev cost of the tools and outfitting a new Fab have shown to be excessive with foundry costs getting so low per die on 300mm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, you deserve some gold!</p>
<p>My only question is what happens if a transistor(s) fail after a consumer gets their chip?  Does the CPU have added logic to detect that and save the whole chip by sacrificing clock speed or a whole core?  Or does this not happen often enough to worry about it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically a transistor failure will knock out a part of the chip.  However, it's not always a total loss.</p>
<p>Memory sections can be switched off.  You may end up with a lower grade cpu chip with, for example, less level 1 cache or a memory chip with half the memory switched off.  You may switch off cores, so you have a 2 core chip not a 4 core chip or have some other reduced function.</p>
<p>Failures can be total but often they are graduated.   A logic element that fails at a max clock speed may work at a lower speed so the chip may be sold at a lower speed.  Memory chips and CPUs often have versions with different speed ratings.  The chips are tested and the best ones go out with the higher rating.    Overclockers might buy the lower rated chip and try to run it at a higher speed - it may mostly work but crash occasionally.</p>
<p>The chip makers are both pushing the envelope of chip performance and trying to fabricate perfect chips at the lowest viable cost.  Those objectives oppose each other.   It ends up being a bunch of economic trade-offs.  Slow the chip speed design and you get more chips that pass the reliability line but they sell for less.   If you can split the output into expensive and cheaper chips that's a benefit (if that's what you're producing.)  The hottest chips are always going to sell at a premium price but they are harder to make reliably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A transistor failure would likely cause the GPU to crash when the drivers are installed, it could do basic display outputting on the standard windows driver but would not be able to do 3d acceleration.</p>
<p>HOWEVER on a newer process there are certain transistors that are known to be the most likely to fail and they can actually build in redundancies, this is how the AMD 5870 chip could yield much better than the 480 of the time regardless of the impacts of chip size on that. This is why being the first to make a chip on the process (in this case the HD4770) can be a big advantage as you can learn where the weak parts of a process are and design in protections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand it that’s exactly the case. I believe that’s also the reason that they don’t make larger wafers as the edges would be too far out of focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite: the wafer isn't exposed all at once, and yield normally is a donut. The very center is bad, the edge is bad, and the rest good.</p>
<p>The focus is done per field. Each exposure field is about 25x35mm. The fields are stitched together to make a whole wafer exposure. Near the edge of the wafer, this is harder, as you have no measurements on partial filelds. There are also physical reasons from etch and deposition tools that make edge focus a bit worse.</p>
<p>The same effects that cause defocus also cause placement errors.</p>
<p>There is a good course from Chris Mack (lithoguru) on YouTube where you can go through the fundamentals of lithography and semiconductor processing.</p></div>		</li>
