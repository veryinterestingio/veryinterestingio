			<div class="markdown"><p>You are not wrong, but chip cards are more safe than that. To break the cryptography in it, even if we take the &quot;easier&quot; one (AES) would take the best computer on earth around a billion years. And that only uses 128bits on worse case scenario. If we consider that banks can use RSA or other strong crypto methods, we can be safe that this are not hackable with our current technology (with quantum computing this may change).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, there's so much control here for the bank to literally use unbreakable crypto for this. Since they create the card and their server, they could probably just load the card with enough one time pad memory to have provably secure transactions for the lifetime of the card.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you are mixing up encryption methods.</p>
<p>AES is symmetric cryptography algorithm and RSA is public-key cryotography algorithm.</p>
<p>They can't be compared directly because they are used for different things. Also security of both depends on the size of the key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many sources online state that both methods (even though they are different) are used in CC crypto, depending on what bank do you use. I don't know if that is true, but I was basing my comment on them. Anyway, my comment is not wrong, AES 128 bits IS the &quot;simpler&quot; form of crypto they use, it takes more than a billion years to break (instead of the 10 years my dude just said). I just wanted to let him know (and people know) that was not 10 years at all!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This probably won't change anytime soon, even with quantum computing, at least not until someone figures out P=NP, because the quantum computer will still have to brute force the encryption. Meaning while it would be able to guess and check much faster, we would still be looking at a very long time for it to fibd the answer.</p>
<p>Once that happens, we will need a whole new system of encryption, because none of it will be secure, as almost all modern encryption relies on not being able to prove p=np.</p></div>		</li>
