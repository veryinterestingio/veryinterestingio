<p>Have never seen that actually typed out but I’ll be goddamned if that isn’t how I read it every time, apparently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting! As an anxiety sufferer who's taken on plenty of extra work and stress the past year I've gone through cycles of poor sleep and general anxiety throughout the week, and periods of good sleep when I'm able to identify and deal with triggers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sex linked differences in the brain can be a pretty politically fraught research topic; though I think the biggest reason is that people don't realize that like, even on those metrics where people have gone &quot;Yeah, high estrogen during puberty definitely changes these circuits in these ways,&quot; it's still just <em>on average</em>. I vaguely recall one researcher saying something like, &quot;Even if our research is right, on this one metric, there's a distinct difference, but it's less than a standard deviation apart. That is, about 40% of women have brains more 'masculine' than the mean-male, and vice versa.&quot;</p>
<p>But even that metric was something more complex than the average person can really grok, something about non-task network activation because of interruptions in a task; and gestalting vs abstracting. I'll try to find it and edit a link in if I find it tonight.</p>
<p>Anyways, <strong>to answer your question</strong> I'm personally unaware of any sex linked differences in the hindbrain in general. The main ones I know of was something in the visual cortex, and some stuff relating to the amygdalas, which are part of the temporal lobes (sometimes called the bridge between the monkey and human brains (in the, again, rather outdated triune layer model)).</p>
<p>If I <em>had</em> to speculate, and I'm not sure I should, I'd wonder if society isn't just a little more menacing to women than to men.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a lot of sense. I don’t understand everything you said, but it sounds like a negligible difference if any.</p>
<p>Maybe a little bit of confirmation bias playing a part too.</p>
<p>Thank you for the insight!</p></div>		</li>
