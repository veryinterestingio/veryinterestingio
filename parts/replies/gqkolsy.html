			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question -- the short answer is that we still have a lot to learn here. Basically, your grandmother was correct: eat your fresh fruits and veggies. Switching to a low-fiber diet can lead to a decline in gut microbiome diversity (i.e. extinction events for species in the gut -- especially spore-formers). This study touches on that (i.e. switching people to an Ensure diet -- which was lower in fiber than their natural diets): <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30783-1" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30783-1" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30783-1</a></a></p>
<p>Lots of recent work indicating that the Mediterranean Diet is generally pretty good for people. This diet includes a lot of plant matter, it's low in red meat, lots of plant oils (e.g. olive oil, nuts, etc.), fish and fish oils. And the microbiome seems to be a mediator in the beneficial effects of this diet: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01223-3" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01223-3" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01223-3</a></a></p>
<p>It's likely that personalized diets will eventually be optimal (e.g. this has been shown for glycemic responses: <a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)01481-6</a></a> or lipid profiles: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0934-0" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0934-0" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0934-0</a></a>), but we aren't yet advanced enough in our understanding of the gut ecosystem to steer the microbiome in a specific, personalized direction that holistically optimizes for a specific health aim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question. This paper that I linked to tries to infer how the effects of the Mediterranean Diet are mediated by the microbiota by looking across people with naturally-occurring variations in the composition of their gut microbiomes (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01223-3" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01223-3" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01223-3</a></a>).</p>
<p>One way to answer it is to focus on metabolites that are produced exclusively by the microbiota (i.e. they wouldn't be present in the body in the absence of microbes -- like secondary bile acids, for example). But controlled feeding studies would be needed to answer this question well -- ideally including 'germ free' humans (i.e. humans without microbes, maintained in a sterile environment -- this is not ethical or possible, but we can do this in mice). While we can't make germ free humans, we can build metabolic models of the human body that include or exclude gut microbiota, and we can 'feed' these models different diets -- not a perfect solution, but a possible way forward (<a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20198982" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20198982" target="_blank">https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20198982</a></a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I can make one food recommendation, it would be to eat foods high in fiber, and ideally also in micronutrients and antioxidants, and to prioritize getting these nutrients from real foods. In short, colorful vegetables, fruits and legumes. There are many other nutritional impacts on the microbiome from other foods (such as bile acids and specific amino acids), as well as many we probably don't know about yet that are also quite important. But I'll explain my answer:  </p>
<p>Humans have adapted over millennia to eat diets high in plant based materials, such as fruits, veggies, legumes, leaves and tubers. As such, our gut and our symbionts (the microbiota) are tightly evolved to benefit us when we eat those things. Fiber in particular gets broken down by the microbiota into short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which have numerous and profound effects on our body. Butyrate in particular is the primary source of energy for your body's colon cells, improves the barrier of your gut (between your body and the content of your intestine), and reprograms your immune system in an anti-inflammatory way. This helps keep your body functioning well without inflammation. And we get it from eating fiber.  </p>
<p>Only some microbes can break down the fiber we eat into SCFA like butyrate. Those microbes, like all bacteria in our gut, compete for survival against other microbes with different food sources and abilities. If we don't eat enough fiber or don't eat it very consistently (and many consuming western diets do not), those bacteria cannot compete as well against other species and less SCFA are produced.   </p>
<p>Plants also shape the microbiota through their phytonutrients, vitamins and antioxidants, which is why I suggest getting fiber from whole foods rather than supplementation. They also exert beneficial effects of their own, such as protecting against oxidative stress in the case of antioxidants. Although the data on these nutrients is more dispersed.   </p>
<p>As for regional diets, the diet that I've seen the most consistently in the research to positive effect is the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fresh foods, legumes, fish, limited red meat or refined carbohydrates, and family meals in community. Likely connected to a very relational lifestyle, this may potentially contribute to Italy's high population of centenarians. Although on a personal level, I'm cautious about diets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have an on-topic question, you mention that inconsistent fiber intake has negative effects on the microbiome.</p>
<p>My question is, how does intermittent fasting affect then the microbiome? Do we have enough information/data to have a rough guess at the impacts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the first linked article above, this answers your first question: </p>
<p>“To date, several human studies have observed the reduced risk for depression in diets higher in fruits and vegetables, fish, whole grains and olive oil.”</p>
<p>I just grabbed an Apple and put Fish oil capsules on my Amazon shopping cart.  We eat fish, but not often.  I have a question in a separate post asking if fish oil is adequate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only issue with fish is mercury or other toxic compounds. I recall in southern China where a fish was  beautifully presented but caught from some of the most polluted waters in the world. I didn't eat it, albeit I had no idea if it had been contaminated. I don't think we do enough to examine the compounds in fish and their consequences for health. We did a study in Tanzania where mercury is an issue from Lake Victoria. When women and children ingested yoghurt supplemented with probiotic lactobacilli known to bind to mercury, the levels of mercury were lower compared to the control group. The concept was that the lactobacilli bound to mercury and it was excreted but more studies are needed into this concept. Clearly, the omega 3 advantage of fish consumption is important.</p></div>		</li>
