			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese-English translator/interpreter  here. I can verify. Most of the time we just skip the pun or say something light hearted so people react to the situation. What’s funny to westerners and what’s funny to native Japanese are in entirely different realms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are a westerner and you're in Thailand, you're going to hear &quot;farang, farang&quot; frequently by children and drunk men. &quot;Farang&quot; is the Thai word for &quot;westerner&quot;, but it also means &quot;guava&quot;.</p>
<p>One day, I was heading back to my house, and a small child, about two years old, is outside with his grandmother. He sees me and starts yelling out &quot;farang&quot;. I responded, &quot;Mai chai farang, Khon ben baksida&quot;. He looked at me with utter confusion, but the grandmother heard what I said and started laughing.</p>
<p>ไม่ใช่ฝรั่ง ຂ້ອຍ​ແມ່ນໝາກສີດາ</p>
<p>Basically translated, I said, &quot;I am not a guava (in Thai), I am a guava (in Lao).&quot; &quot;ໝາກສີດາ&quot; &quot;baksida&quot; is the Lao word for guava, I lived 30km from the Lao border, and many of the people I lived with spoke Lao.</p>
<p>&quot;ໝາກສີດາ&quot; does not translate into &quot;Westerner&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's also interesting is translating within the same language - be it between Texan and British English or Shakespeare to modern. A pun in one region may fall flat in another, and most school kids miss all the innuendo in old books.</p></div>		</li>
