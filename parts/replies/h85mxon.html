			<div class="markdown"><p>The ion stuff you mean is why water dissolves salt.  Like NaCl (a salt)—&gt; Na+ &amp; Cl- ions dissolved in a solution because water makes them split up (it’s been a while since my chem classes, someone else go deeper if you want).</p>
<p>In this case, it’s a matter of concentration gradients.  Water will go (if a membrane is permeable to it) where there’s a higher concentration of stuff, to even out both sides of a membrane so that there’s an equal concentration of other stuff and water on both sides.  The kindey’s collecting system is set up to take advantage of this (look at a video of “nephron collecting system” or an image just to see how wildly intricate it looks).</p>
<p>Earlier on in the collecting system, there are transporters/channels for salt ions.  Later down the line, the tube is permeable to water (the degree of permeability can be adjusted by the kidney depending on the body’s needs).  If a lot of salt was already picked up, more water will be absorbed to dilute that out.  This is how some diuretics work, by blocking the salt ion transporters so water has less of a reason to follow and so remains in the tube &amp; gets pissed out.  Kidney is wild, there are a lot of nuances, I’m keeping it like we’re all 5 pls.</p></div>		</li>
