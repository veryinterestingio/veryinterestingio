			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason galaxies, planetary systems, and planetary rings are all disks. If you start off with a bunch of particles moving randomly in a cloud, there will be a large number of collisions; when two particles collide they tend to average out their momentum. Given time this will cause them to all trend towards similar momentums, which in an orbiting system means  circular orbits with the same inclination, at which points collisions are minimized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've recently undergone a collision, or other event that disturbed their shape--or perhaps, due to the influence of other galaxies, indeed never evened out. Because stars in a galaxy take so long to orbit, and galaxies are much less dense than smaller structures, this process takes much longer for them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At 2:50 into this video he brushes on this concept, you will have to use a bit of Imagination to see everything coming from all directions but after time and so many collisions everything finds a uniform or preferred orbit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is one sign a black hole is newly formed is that the accretion disk is still a sphere ? Also how long would this typically take ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't the age of the black hole, it is how long the infalling matter has been there. Initially new matter might have a more spherical distribution depending on how it falls in, over time it will form a disk (but due to the electromagnetic interaction between its particles, unlike the parent comment claimed).</p></div>		</li>
