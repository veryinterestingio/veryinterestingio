			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to question the validity of the bends theory. The bends happen specifically because divers breathe compressed air while they are already deep and pressurized. If you breathe air at the surface you can dive down and return rapidly without getting the bends. See: free divers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a function of how long you are under water and at what depth not where the air comes from. Free divers can't stay down long enough for their tissue to absorb the gas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, the same deco limits exist for free divers and divers? </p>
<p>The only difference I see is the free divers collapsed lung limiting gas exchange. But as an intert gas nitrogen concentrations should not really change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that's more like 8 times the pressure. The pressure is proportional to density times height of liquid above you. The density of water doesn't change too much with depth, so the pressure is almost exactly proportional to depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free divers can and do get bent (see my earlier post).  The lungful of air at the surface becomes compressed air at depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, the more time spent at increased depth, the more time for gasses to dissolve into the blood. </p>
<p>Whales spend a lot more time underwater at much greater depths than free divers.</p></div>		</li>
