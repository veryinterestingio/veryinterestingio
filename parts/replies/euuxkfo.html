			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing. And there's no issue with that. If you want to put an item on retail shelves, then that's where there's issue. but many many barcodes simply reference an internal database. If you took a 12-pack of coke from Target and scanned it at Wal-Mart, it would still scan because they both have their own databases, and the number/code references the same product in each of thier databases. But let's say you took a Sam's Choice Cola pack and tried to scan it at Target. Either a) nothing would happen because they likely don't have a product in their own database with that code, or I supppose b) there's a very very slim chance that another product could use the number that's only available at Target...but that's unlikely because the manufactures likely keep to their own numbers...but for things like inventory tracking, serial numbers, etc...that's all simply internal.</p>
<p>Imagine if you and your siblings all gave each other nicknames that you only ever used inside your own home. It doesn't matter if any other families in the neighborhood use the same nicknames in their own homes, because there's no crossover. However, look at the screen actor's guild. If there's already an actor with your name, you have to pick a different name to be a member so that there's no duplicates. Michael Keaton is actually Micheal Douglas...but there already was a Michael Douglas in the SAG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, regarding your Target and Walmart example, some manufacturers share or sublet their UPCs to smaller manufacturers. So it is possible that manufacturer 111 is some generic company who then sets up 111001 as Store Brand A and 111002 as Store Brand B. To the UPC database, they both have the same manufacturer code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, but why does it matter?</p>
<p>I doubt your name is unique in the world, but unless two of you are in the same room it doesn't matter. Companies use the same identifiers internally all the time. Every database in the world has something (and probably several things) with an ID number of 1. Does it matter that New York and Los Angeles both have a Fire Engine 1? Nope. Does it matter that the UK and US have both have Locomotives with the number 8027? Nope.</p>
<p>If a sofa company uses their barcodes to put things on racks in their warehouse, and another uses theirs to put things in postboxes in their sorting centre... who cares? It's not like the postal company is accidentally going to put a sofa in the postbox by accident</p>
<p>As long as the companies don't interact and need to scan each other's barcodes, it will never matter</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they barcode their serial numbers then it doesn't matter that it's used elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What that is technically correct for any product in a major store there is actually a master database of barcodes called the &quot;GS1 global registry&quot; or &quot;Global Data Synchronization network&quot;</p>
<p>If you want a product on the shelf at Kroger, Walmart, Meijer, target, etc. you must subscribe to a service to get your product info into the GDSN.  GDSN isn't as simple as &quot;UPC xyz = 16oz spicy BBQ sauce from Historic BBQ&quot; - It has much more data. You have to specify things like product dimensions, case size, pallet configuration, ordering lead time, shelf life, ingredients, nutrition claims, warehouse locations, and more. GDSN data providers charge based on your sales volume and can be a significant expense. </p>
