			<div class="markdown"><p>Came to the comments looking for this answer and the link to the World’s Fair and this book, which is probably one of the best books I’ve ever read from an educational standpoint. I learned so much. I was astounded by how many things we have today came about because if that World Fair, and I was surprised I never really learned about it in school. For instance, these floating foundations were developed expressly for the construction of the World’s Fair. </p>
<p>I’m guessing it would have been remembered as a much more important part of US history had the World Wars not happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is still a building practice in places where structures are being built on loose and swampy soil.  Piles are more common in permafrost areas and for smaller structures.   It is still seen in road construction.</p>
<p>Most of the Canadian Pacific Railway between Winnipeg, Manitoba and Thunder Bay, ON is floating on large cribs made of massive British Columbia douglas fir trees, with millions of tons of rail ballast on too.</p>
<p>Some old railroaders say the real last spike on the CPR was driven less than 150 miles from the first spike ,in Thunder Bay, because of the terrain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the practice itself is much older than early Chicago! I thought it was pertinent information pertaining to how we struggled to manage that exact problem in the past and thought OP might be interested in the whole history of the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Word has it in the 80's when some new engineers came to inspect the tracks they felt the need for a drainage ditch, which local engineering crews highly advised against because of the unique terrain.  More of a passed down maintenance plan that lasted for over 70 years at that point.</p>
<p>This new and senior engineer from another area ordered the work anyways, and the entire mainline, which had been kept floating on this ballast, immediately collapsed as they dug out the material that was supporting it.</p>
<p>They did not know how it was really built, so in a panic they dumped over 1000 rail cars of ballast on the spot just to see it all disappear into oblivion of a swamp.  Clear lake water was coming up, with tiny fish, as this happened part of a huge muskeg lake. </p>
<p>After that fiasco, they basically had to track down the original engineering plans, from the turn of the century, and scour it for how they built it, and discovered the ungodly huge cribbing they originally put in to support it. The technique they used was called cordurying, as they laid many logs down resembling corduroy fabric, and ballast went on top of that.</p>
<p>From then on, annual track maintenance basically continued to be as it had before, add ballast and tamp to level everything, and keep the tracks centered over the cribbing.</p>
<p>40 years on there is still evidence of the mistake, where they're still forced to slowly correct the placement of the tracks.  It also spelt the beginning of the end of the double-track that ran from Winnipeg to Thunder Bay for the grain rushes.</p>
<p>There was a reason it took so long.  Stories written down would described crews of a thousand men doing tremendous amounts of work, only to wake up the next morning to see everything under water.</p>
<p>Even the train bridges could not have steel piles driven, despite bedrock being very close, because the piles they'd drive would basically hit sloped walls and keep going forever.  They didn't know what was going on until they extracted a pile and saw how it was damaged.   They were forced to take giant bundles of Douglas Fir trees again, drive those in so they'd, be floating piles in the soft swampy muck.</p></div>		</li>
