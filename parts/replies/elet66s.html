			<div class="markdown"><p>The things to consider also is that mammalian species tend to have much more fat than reptilians do, so some people argue that it's easier to depict a dinosaur this way. However reality is that we don't know, and that we have to make these qualified guesses based on knowledge and intuition like this. It's awesome to learn more stuff though. Hearing dinosaurs wearing feathers was such a cool thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love that book too!  They really did an amazing job of depicting dinosaurs in much more believably (even if speculative) life-like ways than what is usually done.
