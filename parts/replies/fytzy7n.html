<p>The Oxford vaccine hasn't gone through stage 3 clinical trials yet so we can't be certain it will work.  But we do have some idea that it will work, in fact we have evidence that it will work.  We know it induces cellular and humoral immune responses and produces neutralizing antibodies.  It is of course <em>possible</em> that it still fails to produce immunity despite this, but this isn't just a shot in the dark that might or might not work.</p>
