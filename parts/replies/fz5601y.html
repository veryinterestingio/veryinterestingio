			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if its also that 12 was a special number, I recall a thread recently about why we have 12 hours instead of 24, and apparently 12 was how high they counted on one hand, twelve would seem to be a product of a base 12 system that was then shifted to a base 10...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also 12 is easily divided into halves, thirds and quarters while still using whole numbers. Good for bartering among the less educated back in the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One video I watched mentioned that people have 3 segments on 4 fingers of each hand (because of our knuckles), and that can be used to count to 12. </p>
<p>And another guy also noted that 12 is divisible by three numbers below it, making it more convenient than base 10 sometimes. No idea how pertinent this is, but worth noting.</p>
<p>We still have words like “couple” and “few” for two and three, so maybe some stuff just stuck around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A dozen is 12 because 12 was a common number number for counting. You have a dozen inches in a foot, a dozen hours in a day, a dozen shillings in a penny (once upon a time), etc., all traces of an ancient tendency to divide things by 12, as opposed to 10 as we tend to do now. It helps that 12 is easily divided into halves, quarters, thirds and sixths — you can only cut 10 in half and fifths.</p>
<p>As for why it’s called “dozen,” that comes from the French word for 12, which of course comes from Latin, where it’s literally “two ten.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Babylonians tended to work in 60's for that reason but with that many individual numbers it wasn't super long lived. We still have the 360 degree circle though.</p>
<p>But the idea is that the largest smaller units in common uses would be 12. For a time people commonly counted in twelves because that was just useful for the quantities people typically worked with. Along with the day and night being divided into 12 hours each. Close to 12 lunar cycles (months) in a year. Inches in a foot, etc. Gross for a dozen dozen would get used if you really needed to count that high.</p>
<p>After that Europeans tended to work in multiples of 20 for a while with the vigesimal system and the score as the standard unit. Started with counting things like flocks of sheep and heads of cattle. So the numbers from 13 to 19 get their own names. Heck when Lincoln was around he used the words four score and seven years ago, which was considered normal at the time.</p></div>		</li>
