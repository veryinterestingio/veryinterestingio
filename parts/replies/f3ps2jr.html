			<div class="markdown"><p>The authors address this question somewhat directly here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A permissive acceptance threshold is a threshold that accepts large differences from the template and will result in more acceptance errors and fewer rejection errors. It will be favoured when intruders are rare relative to nestmates, when the cost of admitting an intruder is low, and when the cost of excluding a nestmate is high</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So conceptually the 'prevalence of disease' can be seen as one plausible extension of 'the cost of admitting an intruder'. What this means is, 'stringentness' or 'the relative likelihood of allowing admittance of a non-hive member' is a complex variable where multiple factors, including the cost of admitting foreign illness, combine to form the value for one particular set of hive guards.</p>
<p>Other factors that would be included would be the hive birth/replacement rate, an extension of the cost of excluding a nestmate due to mis-identification. And the prevalence of bee-like predators, an extension of the cost of admitting a foreign visitor who would cause harm by mis-identifying the predator as a hive-member.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just copied this from my comment down below...</p>
<p>I may have just made a strange connection..</p>
<p>I have sentry carpenter bees (due to an old structure on the property) throughout my yard in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>I used to smoke and sit near where one was stationed...
I would always feel the bee get close to me and then felt something wet hit my hand/arm/wrist and when I would look, nothing was there! </p>
<p>Could they have been marking me to let other bees I was a safe person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're seeing are most likely male carpenter bees.  They are somewhat territorial, and will spend most of their day hovering around and trying to chase away other insects (or sometimes people).  Some carpenter bee species do leave pheromone marks around to attract females from farther away (e.g., see <a href="https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1991.tb04805.x" target="_blank">Minckley et al. 1991</a>), so they might have been doing that.  If that's the case though, they were probably just treating you as part of the scenery more than another living thing.</p></div>		</li>
