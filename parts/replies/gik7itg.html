			<div class="markdown"><p>This, a lot of people see the wasted food and say it should be sent to homeless shelters or something. But buffet food has been served and is now ‚Äúdead‚Äù. If the buffet has servers who actually plate the food, it can be packaged and sent to shelters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, sometimes at homeless shelters, you have to sign a waiver to get certain foods.   Usually the leftovers from a large company, like pre packaged sandwiches from a large supermarket.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be. The thing is that lack of food has never ever been the problem in modern times. The problem is always logistics, and how that costs money. Cost of packaging hot food while ensuring it gets to where people who need it can consume it while ensuring none ever goes bad and it's still palatable at delivery is so much more work and cost than so many other possible solutions to hunger. But even those much much cheaper solutions than what you're suggesting still cost money. It'd be relatively quite cheap to feed everyone in america, we have the food in abundance. It's just not a popular idea, not going to get anyone elected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah I can vouch for these rules. I'm Canadian and I had a summer job at a fast food buffet many years ago. We wasted a <em>ton</em> of food because it was only allowed to be out for 20 minutes and anything left had to be immediately thrown away (not even into organic waste, right into the garbage) and replaced at 21 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have to explain this to people at Chipotle. They would say the beef was too rare and try to hand the bowl back to me to cook it more. I said we can remake the bowl with new beef, but I cannot take back anything you hand me. You must throw it away or eat it. I can't &quot;fix it&quot; without contaminating my controlled food safety environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup most people don't understand I can't bring the food back over the counter, it's contamination. Then bring up how the last person did it for them, which telling me probably isn't a good idea since I'm the manager.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oop. Restaurant I worked at, we would just throw their steak back on the grill to cook longer. Pop it back on the same plate and everything. Managers told us to do it. In retrospect, we also cooked beef and salmon on the same over-fire grill. We cleaned everything thoroughly end of night, but we only cleaned it mid-shift if a customer specified an allergy.
