<p>Left a gravitational potential? Difference in potential energy.</p>
<p>Bounced off a receding mirror? It gave the mirror a bit of kinetic energy.</p>
<p>Expansion of the universe? It's gone. There is no global energy conservation in general relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, isn't the cosmological redshift caused by energy spreading out over a larger volume? So shouldn't total energy still conserved?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I misunderstanding, or are you saying general relativity disproves the law of conservation of energy?</p>
<p>Or is the claim that the universe doesnâ€™t count as an isolated system?</p></div>		</li>
