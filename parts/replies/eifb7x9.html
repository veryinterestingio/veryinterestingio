			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a proposal to manage the cooling.</p>
<p>Put a satellite at the Mars-Sun L1 point. Have it be a relatively large satellite with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long loops of superconductive wire</li>
<li>Cooling system to keep the wire superconductive</li>
<li>Solar panels to generate power for the cooling system</li>
<li>Magnetic ram scoop to suck up the particles of the solar wind</li>
<li>Heat exchanger to pump heat into the particles of the solar wind</li>
<li>Thruster that blasts out solar wind particles at a billion degrees, thereby dumping the heat</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

Nasa did not propose anything. A couple of scientists met at a workshop and basically did some brainstorming. This <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/V2050/pdf/8250.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;paper&quot;</a> is what they came up with. 1.5 pages with 5 references. From this &quot;paper&quot; this annoying phys.org article was spawned. There are some interesting thoughts but overall it is not particularly interesting. There is not much substantial information there. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This new research is coming about due to the application of full plasma physics codes and laboratory experiments. In the future it is quite possible that an inflatable structure(s) can generate a magnetic dipole field at a level of perhaps 1 or 2 Tesla (or 10,000 to 20,000 Gauss) as an active shield against the solar wind.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this quote is also blatantly missatributed. The &quot;paper&quot; never claims that a 1-2 Tesla field can protect the planet. They say a 1-2 Tesla field can protect a spacecraft and its human inhabitants. They don't make any claims about the strength and size of the dipole field that can protect Mars. In other words, don't take this paper more seriously than having some ideas but no words if it ever feasible or not to implement. </p>
<p>PS: It is not even clear yet if the lack of a magnetosphere caused the loss of the marsian atmosphere. It is more likely that the atmosphere escaped simply because Mars is too small to hold any substantial atmosphere over a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a thicker atmosphere have a better chance of sticking around, or is the rate of loss a constant due to gravity (or lack of), this “more atmosphere” would only buy you a little more time versus hitting a critical mass and becoming stable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure about this. I mean, clearly Venus doesn't have an intrinsic magnetic field. yet it has a dense atmosphere even though it is much closer to the sun than Mars and should be exposed to more intense solar wind. This definitely tells us that an intrinsic magnetic field is not required for a planet to have an atmosphere. Mars only has about 10% the mass of Earth and 13% the mass of venus. That means the escape velocity on Mars is only about 1/3 than the escape velocity of Earth (The square root of 1/10 is approximately equal to 1/3). This means it would be easier for the solar wind to accelerate atmospheric particles enough for them to escape the planets gravity. I just don't know if that is enough to explain why Mars has (almost) completely lost its atmosphere. There are other factors to consider. For example Mars used to have an intrinsic magnetosphere. Did Mars lose its atmosphere during this transition time maybe? Another important factor to consider are the induced magnetospheres. Mars and Venus both have induced magnetospheres. Basically ionized particles in the atmosphere will counteract the solar wind magnetic field (IMF) and protect the rest of the atmosphere from the direct impact of the solar wind. I don't know enough about this to tell you really concrete facts, but I think it would be conceivable that a thicker atmosphere could lead to a stronger induced magnetosphere. Perhaps Venus proximity to the sun also leads to a stronger induced magnetosphere because the ionization by UV and Xrays is stronger. There are lots of other factors that need to be included. It is a pretty active field of research. It also doesn't help that it is very difficult to measure particles escape rates around other planets.</p></div>		</li>
