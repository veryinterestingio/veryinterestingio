			<div class="markdown"><p>another thing that no one in the thread has metnioned is nitrogen balance.  when leaves turn brown and fall off the tree the tree is removing nutrients and nitrogen from the leaf. that means the pile of leaves has super low nitrogen.  Most fertilizers want to increase nitrogen, this is eli5 so you could thing of a pile of dead leaves as like reverse fertilizer, it makes soil worse instead of better.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, the dead leaves do contain Nitrogen, and that will be added back into the soil.... eventually. The issue isn't the Nitrogen, but the Carbon to Nitrogen ratio. Microbes eat the organic material (leaves), and since there is an overabundance of Carbon, the microbes multiply rapidly. The microbes also need Nitrogen, however, and since there is so much more Carbon than Nitrogen in the leaves, the microbes need to get it from somewhere else, usually the soil. Eventually, the microbes die, and the N is redeposited into the soil, but until then, it's just existing in their bodies, causing what's called a Nitrogen tie-up. </p>
<p>ELI5: tiny little creatures want to eat the leave's Carbon, and think it'd be mighty good to have some Nitrogen as well, so they steal it from the ground till they die.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is insanely untrue. Sounds like fertilizer company propaganda. </p>
<p>How do you think forests work dude? All the trees drop their leaves and “reverse fertilize” the soil? Of course they fertilize the soil, what plant would evolve to poison its own environment? </p>
<p>Edit: Decomposing leaves are literally part of the nitrogen cycle, it’s how the element gets made in the first place!  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hickory, walnut and butternut trees will release a chemical called  juglone that will poison other plants up to 40-60 feet away, depending on how big the tree is. Black walnut are the worst for this and every part of the tree will release juglone into the soil, including the fallen leaves and fruit. There are some plants that are resistant to juglone though.  </p>
<p>That being said, and I don't have any walnut trees nearby, I've composted leaves and mulched fallen leaves with the last mowing of the fall, and my spring lawn is usually the greenest on my street.<br />
EDIT: speeling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not totally true, leaves make for effective fertilizer, in live soil, due to the bugs, worms, and grubs that'll eat them.</p>
<p>In fact there are certain aphids that exclusively eat decaying plant matter, leaving the top soil well fertalized for shallow seedlings.</p>
<p>Also thyme, Rosemary, Sage, and parsley thrive in high acidic soil, so dead leaves only, would actually make decent fertilizer.</p></div>		</li>
