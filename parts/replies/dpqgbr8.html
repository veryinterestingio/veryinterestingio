			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya they get pre-rinsed and it does go through the 3 stages, wash, rinse, and sanitize. Depending on the style of the machine it either uses chlorine or is a high temp machine. Also the plates are usually pretty &quot;clean&quot; as in there isn't stuck, old, crusty food on them.</p>
<p>The machines are suppose to be able to do all 3 steps as required by the health department.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I've seen that before. So we tell them to redo the dishes. I watch to see if they will put them away or run them again. The one time it happened they were going to put them away and I pointed it out. Ended up dinging them for it (not the dirty dish, the fact that they were going to put away a dirty dish).</p>
<p>It sounds shitty or what not, but we know they change their habits when we're watching so imagine what they do when you're not there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sanitize?
Wash rinse
Maybe rinse wash rinse. The rinse has the sanitizer solution and the rinse temp  is also sanitizing(at more the 190°f it starts cooking onto the surface)</p>
<p>Glad to see theirs health inspectors put there been working in kitchen equipement repair for 8-years havent seen one inspectors but plenty of shitty places. Bar glass-washer/dishwasher are full of horrors</p>
<p>I only drink  bottled beer if i go to bars I dont know.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it depends on the machine but it's either chemical or high temp. So for chemical it runs, we see the machine pump the detergent. Running... running... running... then it cycles in the sanitizer and rinse-aid then it's pretty much done. We open the machine and test the water (on the door, in a cup, on a plate, wherever but not in the bottom of the machine). We have instant read test strips so we don't have to wait 30 seconds or whatever. Compare it, it has to be 50 ppm or higher, which is a mild purple color (darker the more concentrated it is). It's not exact but good enough.</p>
<p>High temp is easier, we have irreversible indicating test strips. Slap that on a dry dish or cup or whatever, run it through and if it doesn't change color it's not hot enough. Our old ones had white to black bars and our new ones will go from black to some color (red, brown, or orange depending on the temp).</p>
<p>We also inspect bars but that's just once a year and a lot of them don't even use a machine as the 3 compartment sink is cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we don't do restaurants and as such we don't have awesome stories but I can tell you one that was told to me. We go with DBPR (they do restaurants and hotels and other places) if we have a food borne illness of 2 or more or 1 confirmed (went to the doctor, gave samples, came back positive).</p>
<p>So it was a Chinese restaurant which I will tell you right off the bat that is already bad going in. They are notoriously bad. Anyway the chicken wings they sell they were thawing out in a mop sink. A mop sink found on the floor and the water wasn't even running. So raw ass chicken on a tile floor, not in a bin or a pot, just on the floor. Imagine you dropped a raw chicken breast on the floor, now dump the rest on the floor and walk away.</p>
<p>The only bad (gross) one I ever personally witnessed was at a sushi/hibachi place. Overall very good, good temps and all that but the bad part was the line cook was plating food with his barehands. We know, he knew that was wrong because when we both walked back there we all made eye contact, he stopped, wiped his hands on his apron and grabbed tongs. The other inspector was like &quot;no no no, throw all that away and do it over again.&quot; He was like &quot;oh you know when we get busy I accidentally do that and didn't know I could use my hands as long as they're gloved.&quot; Bro... you have ONE ticket up, you are not in the weeds. Fucking liar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>90 seconds. Rinse, drain, sanitize, rinse aid, done. If you want to be fast, you have to get all the bits off. If someone hands you a pan with crusted-on breadcrumbs, you're gonna have to soak it and scrape off the bits because not only will bits block the drain mechanism in the dishwasher, but they might not even come off in the first place. What I like to do is pick all the semi-clean stuff off the pile first, wash that, then while the 'clean stuff' is basically just being super-heated because chemical sanitizer is only really there as a back up sanitizer, I scrub off the nasty shit from the other pans.</p>

<p>The place I used to dishwash in had a &quot;decarboniser&quot;. It was essentially a big chest full of hot/boiling &quot;stuff&quot; that turned everything but metal to mush. People wore arm-length, thick rubber gloves when putting things in and out of it. </p>
<p>Evil stuff. Worked well though. Just don't get it on your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do realize that many of those machines have a booster heater connected to a 3-phase 60A circuit at 480V or over 150A at 208V 3-phase. Now the gas ones do not require such a large electrical circuit, but I doubt you have sufficient gas flow for those either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>150 A 208V 3 Phase is a little high. That would be one big ass dishwasher. You can see another comment I made. One of the more common dishwashers I work on has a booster heater. The machine runs at 50A and 208 3 phase. The machine also has a heater in the wash tank. There is a relay that only allows one heater to run at a time and the booster takes priority. We also have another that requires 90A at 208 3 phase but this does not have a booster but does have 4 motors that run at the same times as well as two heating elements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing with home dishwashers and detergents is that you want to keep some food particles on them so that the agents in your home detergents have something to cling onto. It's difficult if you're washing dishes once or twice a week because certain things dry and are nearly impossible to clean off (I'm looking at you, raw eggs and bread dough.) I trust your statement that your dishwasher is garbage because a lot are but if it's that bad have you tried cleaning the filter? Depending on the model it can be either tool free or a semi-hassle with some tools but especially if you aren't the only person who has ever used it, I'd recommend checking it out. When I moved into my house the dishwasher didn't seem to be working well so I did that and I knew the people living here before had kids but I didn't know they put a lot of those shitty plastic plates with stupid stickers on them and the stickers had created a quarter inch layer over the filter so a bunch of gross shit was just getting cycled back up into my dishes. Awesome! </p></div>		</li>
