			<div class="markdown"><p>Occasionally I'll read an entire page in a book, and at the end of the page I realize my mind was thinking about something else and I didn't actually comprehend anything I read. It's fascinating that the brain will continue moving my eyes word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence, while it is wholly focused on something else. </p>
<p>What other type of auto-pilot things does your brain do without you realizing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost Everything, really. It's fascinating because it reminds me of how the high tech robots like that dog from Boston dynamics operates. It's software is built on top of layers and layers, each single one listening for orders (more like goals) from the layer above, unless the rules in that layer forbid it. So the operators output is in reality just a request to move for example to the right. I think we are also built like that but of course much more complex. The highest layer sets our goal, it drips down to the other layers and all layers try to fulfill that goal as good as possible, interfering only if needed like if there is an obstacle in our pathway to work for example. That's why we don't think about breathing, we dont think about giving the 50 muscles or so electrical stimulance in such a perfectly orchestrated way to walk for example. you can choose countless simple examples of how complex our actions actually are in terms of brain power if we were actually needed to think about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is me everytime I try to read, I'll get to the end of the paragraph and have to reread the paragraph several times before it sticks. Because of this I've only ever read one book in my life, getting my bachelor's in dietetics was incredibly difficult, I had to take notes and summarize what I had to read, then I'd summarize and take notes of the summaries and read those several times before anything stuck. I've been diagnosed with ADD but it doesn't seem to be normal ADD, meds don't work for me, I've been seeing a neurologist for a few years now trying to figure this out, so far nothings worked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can feel you brother, for me also, I don't remember the words clearly as I read it, but say if I can form a visual from it, then I can remember it when someone says and explains it to me. But with subjects like Physics, Electricals and subjects where there's basically only assumptions and hypothetical, man I don't even know the basics of it. Currently I'm in second year of my Undergraduate degree and now I'm having a little of hard time with subjects because we are the first batch and the professor are you know professors and my friends also can't help me with it. Really hate that I spend an hour or more just to understand and read one topic. I haven't gone to doctors or neurologist as I thought it was normal for some people to have such habits of reading, you know like some people read novels in a day while some take a week and so I thought I would fall under the one who can't read category. Glad to see there are people who have similar problem as me. Hehe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. So when a thought is &quot;discarded&quot; ... what actually happens to the electric signal in your brain? Does it just... dissipate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe your confusion is that the memory is the electricity instead of the pathway.  If the pathway is not there then the memory is not there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To start with, it is an alternance of electric signals and chemical signals, not just electricity. </p>
<p>I think you believe that an experience would produce an electric reaction chain and that the chain would be the memory but that’s wrong. The reaction chain is merely the thought of the memory. The memory itself is the neuronal layout.</p>
<p>When you read something, your neuronal layout updates itself if it’s worth remembering. If it judges it isn’t worth remembering, the reaction chain that is the thought won’t properly update the neuronal circuit. </p>
<p>But even if it did update itself (so even if you do end up adding the information to your long-term memory) the electrical and chemical signals would eventually stop repeating, because you’ll eventually stop thinking about it. </p>
<p>If you are still wondering where the electricity goes, you should remember electricity isn’t the electron, but the movement of the electron from an atom/molecule to another. When electricity stops, it’s because the electrons stopped moving, not that they moved elsewhere. So, essentially, I guess the electric signal just stopped existing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A long term pathway didnt form and therefore no supporting structure that resembles the memory exists. You received the stimuli but it wasnt encoded because the signal wasnt strong enough. Im talking out my ass though here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those very, very few that have photographic memory cannot forget things and it sucks for them.</p>
<p>I don't have a pure photographic memory.  I have to turn it on manually during the experience.</p>
<p>When I turn my memory on, it plays like a movie.  I can re-read text, I've taught myself to read books in dreams.  I can play back a memory in detail, I can remember absurd numbers as long as I see them.  Doesn't work with sound except for music.  I can play music in my head.  I can play Beethoven's 9th to myself so I can fall asleep.  First and fourth only.  The middle bit is lame.</p>
<p>The thing is, I have to hit the record button.  If I don't, I'll lose the memory.  I literally say to myself &quot;Remember this&quot;.  Then it sticks.  Otherwise, memories are vague as normal.</p>
<p>Memory is all kinds of weird and different for everyone.  I remember my baptism at 9 months old clearly.  Validated by my parents.  I have zero memory of what I ate for breakfast today.</p></div>		</li>
