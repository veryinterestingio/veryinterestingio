			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. Syrup is just a high viscosity fluid. Peanut butter is not the same state as far as I know. Those may indeed be colloids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also sort of starts to fall into the semantics argument area. Everything just is what it is, we as humans try to classify them in ways that help us. Scale and context really come into play in this subject, it's not always cut and dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's probably even wrong about his colloid definition.</p>
<p>In any scientific use I encountered colloid is defined as a suspension at micro or nanometer particle size.</p>
<p>Things like milk.</p>
<p>They are quite important in pharmacy because the properties of colloids are different than regular suspensions for many drugs, like increased absorption by the intestine etc.</p>
<p>Thus you are absolutely right: Peanut butter is a suspension of peanut solids in oil in addition to being an emulsion because it's water droplets in oil.</p>
<p>And syrup is simply a solution of sugar dissolved in water.</p>
<p>Thus both are highly viscous liquids.</p>
<p>Oh and the thing between liquid and solid would be pitch tar. Which flows over the time of decades. So any short term observation would say it's solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is at least one phase between liquid and solid, a liquid crystal phase. LC materials have a distinct phase between liquid and solid that's caused by the structure of the molecule, so not all compounds have that phase.</p></div>		</li>
