<p>Switching converters mean we need much smaller ones though.</p>
<p>Instead of a big transformer (think 500 grams or 1.5 pounds), you can have a small transformer and a bunch of electronics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunno. Capacitors are different from transformers, but same kinda principle. If the capacitors are the biggest thing in the amp, then unless they come up with a clever trick to eliminate them, you're stuck with them.</p>
<p>A transformer needs to hold all the energy that it transfers per &quot;cycle&quot;, so a switching converter works around that by doing a lot faster cycles (this is over-simplified). Capacitors also store energy, but typically, the way they're used means they stay charged - they don't get charged and discharged over and over, so that particular solution won't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Capacitors are different, they store electric charge (again, basically limited by physics) but can dump this charge out <em>really</em> quickly. So if you need an occasional huge wallop of power - a kick drum for instance - then you need capacitors. They're expensive to manufacture though and so cheap gear only has little ones. Hence ... cheap audio gear having weedy shitty bass.</p>
<p>The capacitors in a good quality home theatre subwoofer are a sight to behold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhh, they don't use transformers. They use a <strong>FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER</strong> to rectify the 120-240VAC with a capacitor on the end to output DC. That DC is then converted down to the necessary voltages needed by the control circuitry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's wrong, power supplies got much smaller some decades ago.</p>
<p>They use to be much heavier because the actually used a transformer. Nowadays it's just a step down module, which is much smaller lighter and cheaper</p></div>		</li>
