			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, recognize it, take a deep breath and really think about the suggestion, but mostly you can learn to rephrase the way you communicate to others, so they don’t react this way. </p>
<p>If you want to go somewhere with someone, instead of saying “Let’s go to the....”, which upsets the pre-laid plans the recipient had. You can instead say, “I feel like going to...., do you want to join?”, this still won’t get positive response in all cases of course, but you’ll notice an uptick in positive responses.</p>
<p>It’s about making it the recipients choice, instead of you forcing it on them, that’s the key here, our lizard brain owns us so much more than we are willing to admit.... due to the lizard brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I wish people would do, but they don't. So while this is good for advice for people who realize those around them are reacting this way, it doesn't help those of us who involuntarily have this reaction like the person you're replying to asked about. I wish there was a way to suppress this in myself but I've not found a way. It's like an innate reaction that I can't control. For sure I can control what I do with that reaction, but I can't stop the feeling and it's exhausting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oppositional defiant disorder is a condition that is permanent and strongly affects the way a person thinks.   It can be managed but not cured.   It is a disorder.  </p>
<p>Psychological reactance is a transient phenomenon that can be experienced by anyone, including neurotypical people and people with oppositional defiant disorder.  It’s literally just being contrary.  </p>
<p>It’s like how depression is an illness, but sadness is an emotion that anyone can experience - even people with depression.</p>
<p>If you were about to offer to fetch someone a coffee and they turned to you and said rudely, “Go get me a coffee!”, and you suddenly felt like you didn’t really want to make them a coffee anymore, that is psychological reticence.   That is different from ODD, which would have you having a similar reaction to any request, no matter how polite, sensible, or in-place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it the same and do adults who have ODD have this because of something from their childhood or is it totally different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of when we were kids, my Dad would snap, &quot;Go wash those dishes!&quot; and I'd hate every second, grumbling to myself the whole time about how much I fucking <em>hated</em> doing the dishes.</p>
<p>My Mum would go, &quot;Oh, would be able to do me a favour? Can you help me out by washing the dishes for me?&quot; and we'd be like &quot;Of course!&quot; and happily do it, pleased to be helping out, then often do even more on top, like cleaning the kitchen and asking if there was anything else we could help with. It was lovely. She made it feel like you were given a choice instead of being given an order.</p></div>		</li>
