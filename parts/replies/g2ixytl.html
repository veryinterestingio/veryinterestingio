			<div class="markdown"><p>Mechanic here; the last hiss you refer to as the safety valve should never be hear unless your system is broken and over pressuring. It is actually the air dryer purging out moisture when the governer senses the system has reached max working pressure and tells the compressor to stop pumping air. When pressure drops the the lower working limit (90 to 100 psi) the governer will again sense this and tell the compressor to start pumping air, max work pressure will be reached and the air dryer will purge again. The safety valve will pop around 150 to prevent your tank blowing up if your compressor doesn't stop pumping, but then you have other issues to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, totally the air dryer. I’m surprised I had to come this far down the comments to see it mentioned. </p>
<p>It’s what most people are probably recalling when they think about the sound OP is talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, when you pull the parking brake valve you are <em>releasing</em> the pressure in the parking brake circuit, not adding it. The spring brakes engage immediately when you do this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they engage as soon as enough air pressure has dumped from the reservoir on the (whichever part of the air system as been released) truck/trailers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Not a mechanic, but i believe the jake is a mechanical device added to the engine that works by using the engines expelled gasses to slow the engine itself down, thus slowing the truck without applying the brakes. I feel like this is a very bad explanation of how the jake brake works though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, thanks! I always saw signs in small towns where I grew up that said &quot;NO JAKE BRAKES&quot; and I've lived my whole life corrupted by that propaganda and have had a blind hatred for them ever since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Jake brakes alter the timing of the exhaust valves in the engine.  Its creates that loud rumble you hear</p></div>		</li>
