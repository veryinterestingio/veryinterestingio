			<div class="markdown"><p>Those types of simple calculations are just so, so important. They show the scales of issues in mostly relatable terms, and are an actually very good proxy for the real world (often more so in my opinion than complex and optimized models)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those scales are the reason why the only major feat of geo-engineering we've managed to do so far, is also the easiest: dig out flammables and burn them.</p>
<p>Any idea that involves reversing that (or the effects thereof) on a global scale, becomes a hugely resource intensive task - if at all possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help in several ways, since heat and wind off the Sahara desert also causes most Atlantic hurricanes. Unfortunately it also fertilizes the Midwest with minerals every year, so that would be gone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But even though it's a larger area, it still only buys us a couple of years. Even so this is quite an interesting idea which may actually happen during our lifetimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People have discussed it, mostly before accurate maps of the sahara were available.  There isn't actually that much area below sea level.  The Quattara depression is really the only place you could do it.</p>
<p>It's probably not a great idea, you might wind up with something like the Salton Sea but bigger</p></div>		</li>
