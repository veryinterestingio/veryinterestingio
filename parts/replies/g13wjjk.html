			<div class="markdown"><p>You can constrict your pupils pretty easily by focusing on something close to your face. You might be able to focus your eyes for up close vision even if there isn't something up close to focus on, and that will constrict your pupils. When you look back into the distance your pupils should dilate a bit. I'm not sure if that's what OP's doing but everyone can do what I described because it's part of your normal accommodation reflex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can do it too, it's something you're born with, comes from the way your muscles around your head are attached. I can wiggle both together, or the right independently, but not the left. It's similar to how some people can make their eyebrows dance and some can't.</p>
<p>Edit: commented on the wrong post, meant to reply to the ear wiggling, derp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty simple. I stare straight and my mind goes on what's focused if you focused the foreground your eyes widen of you focus the farther stuff your pupil will shrink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned how to do it. AFAIK it's essentially giving yourself a little shot of adrenaline</p>
<p>For those wanting to try: it's the feeling you might get in your chest from trying to tap your fingers on a table really fast, i.e. from pinky to pointer and repeating. Then just isolate that feeling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why lobotomies were so insane. The ones that &quot;worked&quot; pretty much left the survivors as bland, personality-less lumps. When they didn't &quot;work&quot;, survivors had a huge variety of changes in personality, sanity, abilities, etc. If they weren't made damn near completely mentally incapable, a la Rosemary Kennedy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember someone who had the part that connects the two hemispheres together cut to try and treat epilepsy I think it was.
They would hold a picture up in front of each eye so only that eye would see one pic. One pic was of an apple or something bland and the other was a naked woman. when asked what he saw he would say ‚ÄúApple‚Äù and giggle like a school kid. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add in to this, there are experiments performed on people who have had the connection between halves of their brain severed (sometimes done in cases of severe epilepsy). In the experiments they communicated separately with each half, and the halves seemed to have their own thoughts, hopes, goals and desires. When communicated with separately they were like 2 people in the same mind, when communicated with together they instinctively presented a more united front and seemed to try to mask their differing perspectives... Extremely fascinating stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, good old alien hand syndrome. My favourite obscure syndrome. People with the above problem(separated halves of the brain) sometimes discover that one of their hands(usually the left hand) begins to act on its own occasionally. Trying to perform various actions at any time. More or less your hand begins to act as if it were controlled by someone else.</p></div>		</li>
