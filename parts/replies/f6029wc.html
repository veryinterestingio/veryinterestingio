			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree, spent two years working on a ship; went (around) hurricanes, never sick. Couldn't sleep, but not sick. But was on cruise with family, I could feel the ship moving and they couldn't in a light swell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then I envy you. I love what I do, but motion sickness can suck it. I can't even travel as a passenger in a car without feeling it. Oddly I don't get it on planes too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never get VR sickness (very similar to motion sickness), I love my VR setup.</p>
<p>One time I played Project Cars for 6 hours straight. After 6 hours I started to feel slightly nauseous. I finally had a little sympathy for people who get sick after only a few minutes.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is that I agree that everyone gets motion sickness eventually. It's just that some of us have a tolerance so high that we may go our entire lives without ever actually experiencing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight aside, have you found seasick &quot;contagious&quot;? I usually don't get sea sick but if one person vomits, I would wanna throw up as well. (I dont think it's because of the vomit scent)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only in the sense that you mentioned; seeing, smelling or hearing other vomit is an almost sure-fire way to set some people off. Even happens when I'm shoreside if I'm already feeling a bit ropey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've yet to find anything that works 100% of the time. Pills help, but Sturgeon makes me sleepy so I darent use it as I get up for watch. Sometimes I take it in the last hour to knock me out once I get to bed.</p></div>		</li>
