			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question specifically w.r.t. Navier-Stokes, you would win the million dollars when: you can prove there exists a velocity vector and a pressure function that satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations and are well-behaved or physically reasonable (the solutions should be smooth and the energy should be bounded).</p>
<p>These conditions might be too restrictive, meaning there is no solution at all. If you can prove that, you would win the million dollars too.</p>
<p>Now what does it mean for a 'solution to exist'? Basically what people do is: they define a space of functions, and prove that within this space, there is a function satisfying the equations. The space of physically reasonable functions for instance is rather small and hard to work with. The usual strategy of mathematicians is to prove there exists what they call a weak solution in a much large space, and then they try to show that this weak solution is in fact a physically reasonable solution as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify the post above: we expect the Navier-Stokes equations to be complete in the same sense that Newtons laws of motion are complete: they should provide highly accurate predictions within their scale of validity. This is why we think the equations are important, because we expect them to contain (at least theoretically) all we need to make predictions.</p>
<p>However, very little is actually understood about the equations. For example, we have no idea whether or not there exists a (global and smooth) solution to the equations in three dimensions given some initial conditions. That is, we have no idea whether or not the equations can predict the future (in a reasonable manner) at all given some arbitrary but reasonable starting state.</p>
<p>So on one hand we expect to have this theory which completely predicts the motion of fluids, but on the other hand we do not even know if it can make any (reasonable) predictions at all. Adding to this the desire to understand turbulence, it is not surprising that someone has put 1 000 000$ as a bounty for insight into these equations.</p>
<p>Edit (Why I think this is a hard problem): In mathematics there are kind of two different ways to look at things: <em>local</em> and <em>global</em>. A local statement could be: &quot;every person on a hypothetical social network are friends with at least two people&quot; because it is information about what is immediately around a point of interest. On the other hand, a global statement could be: &quot;there exists two people on this hypothetical social network that have at least 3 friends in common&quot; because it refers to some property which concerns the entire system. The act of relating local properties to global ones is rarely easy, and it is the great challenge of mathematics. In the case of the Navier-Stokes equations, we see that the equations themselves are local (they predict the immediate future of a point by looking at how things vary around that point), but the question about whether or not the solution make sense is a somewhat global one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are so many ways to approach a proof. The most common I've found is the contradiction. If you can find a single contradiction, you've proven it false. If you've failed to find a contradiction, you'll have to try a different approach. Sometimes you can prove there can't be a contradiction but you haven't solved the problem and that can be a little annoying</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short/general answer: make a logical deduction which leads to the desired conclusion.</p>
<p>Long answer:</p>
<p>The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations, which basically means that it relates how some things change to how some other things change. So by knowing how for example density change when we move in space, we may put it into the equation to see the density changes as time changes. But since reality is not so simple, so we replace density by a whole bunch of parameters, whence we can relate their space- and time-changes and we have the Navier-Stokes equations.</p>
<p>In a sense these equations always have solutions, because they can take in any starting configuration of all the parameters and predict how they will look like in the next moment, and then the next moment, and the next ad infinitum. However, and this is the million-dollar-question, <em>we do not know whether or not the future prediction will make sense</em>. The future prediction making sense involves for example that everything changes smoothly (since fluids should not admit discontinuous changes). I imagine that trying to prove this involves some kind of argument in the veins of proving that the state being smooth in one moment implies it being smooth in the next moment, but (since the million dollars have not been claimed) it is not clear exactly how it should be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is is possible to approach this problem in another way, for example, rather than predicting the motion through the Navier-Stokes equation, can we observe the motion first and then formulate an equation based on the observations then finally through a large set of data arrive at somewhat of a general equation which is similar to the Navier-Stokes equation and thus proving it or a completely different equation thereby disproving it?</p>
<p>I am just a curious individual and you seem to be a knowledgeable person, so I thought I would ask.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only have a surface-level understanding of this topic myself, but I think the thing with Navier-Stokes is that we are pretty sure they are the right set of equations for fluid dynamics. They are the result of iterations of fluid equations which became increasingly more sophisticated, as well as taking into account general principles from physics. Most importantly, they do not contradict experimental evidence, and we can and are using them to produce good predictions, so for most practical purposes the equations are correct.</p>
<p>However, there exists phenomena with fluid dynamics which we don't understand sufficiently. The typical example of this is turbulence, the act of fluids moving in seemingly chaotic ways. It is easy to observe this phenomena (just look at moving water), and it also appears in simulations with Navier-Stokes. But if we are to understand the precise <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> of turbulence, simply simulating it wont cut it. We must find a reason as to why the equations imply their existence, and doing that requires a certain understanding of the equations. Thus the millennium prize problem concerning the Navier-Stokes equations can be viewed as rewarding the first step in achieving the deeper understanding of the behavior of fluids (it asks essentially the most basic question possible: does Navier-Stokes equations make mathematical sense as a model for fluid motion), which may down the road lead to greater understanding of all fluid-related phenomena.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea you’re suggesting about observing physical phenomenon and then generalizing that into an equation is exactly what Navier-Stokes is. However, no matter how much data you show Navier-Stokes agrees with, that cannot constitute a mathematical proof. To ‘prove’ something in the math sense is very different than the experimental sense of physics and other sciences. In math, a proof means that, given a particular logical system and a particular set of axioms (assumptions), then the validity of the statement can be entirely derived through logical arguments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is sort of done with empirical correlations. Experiments are done at certain temperatures, flow rates, etc and data is recorded. Curve fitting software is then used to fit weird polynomials and logarithmic curves to these data sets, the problem is, they are only valid for these specific conditions and I'd you try to use them to predict fluid behavior elsewhere they no longer apply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Local vs. global hidden variables is also one of the key problems in determining a correct interpretation of quantum mechanics. We know that QM seems to violate locality under specific circumstances, and one of the approaches to try and solve this involves the initial starting position of the particles in a system being a global hidden variable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Knowing that the Poincaré Conjecture is true isn't terribly groundbreaking since we've already investigated the assumption of its truth. </p>
<p>The method of the proof was interesting, but aside from the novel use of Ricci flow (and a proof about the problem of infinite cutting) that can potentially be applied to other problems, doesn't really make waves. </p>
<p>The Poincaré Conjecture was mainly interesting because it was very, very hard and a lot of famous smart guys failed to work it out, even though we worked out the equivalent conjecture in other dimensions and we knew it should be true because it just <em>has</em> to be, right guys?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not at all qualified to answer this, but I will try to say something in general about these millenium-prize problems.</p>
<p>One may generally say that these problems are important exactly because how many implications the solution would have for their fields of study. There is a reason why there are millions of dollars in awards to any who can shed light on these problems.</p>
<p>However, if you are thinking about more practical implications for the everyday person, I am not as sure. If you take a look at these problems, it becomes evident that it will takes years of focused study in the relevant field to even understand why they are important. I think that speaks to their depth, but also to how far removed they are from practical applications. Of course, some questions might have more immediate practical implications than others (P vs NP?), but it is normal that results in mathematics often sits in the cellar aging for one hundred years or two before it finds use in the real world.</p></div>		</li>
