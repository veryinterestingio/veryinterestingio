			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been curious about backend telco systems.  I'm so used to tcp/ip networks that I want to know more about this different environment.  I understand at a high-level there are servers that relay text information from source to destination. But I know it's not tcp/ip.</p>
<p>But I'm looking for more specifics that I imagine isn't that available in public knowledge. </p>
<p>Like, what are these servers running? In my mind it's either Windows Server, Linux, As400, solaris running some kind of specialized program. But I know nothing about ISP/SMS inner workings and want to learn more about it.</p>
<p>Edit: googling SMS gateways gave me a little more background information on companies like Twilio and Click send which I assume are the software vendors for SMS gateways that you can install on servers. Hmm interesting!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's about it.  I think it's largely Linux, running specialist code.  Much of it is IP, especially now in the era of 5g.</p>
<p>Here's some bedtime reading.</p>

<p>I don't know of any telco systems running on Windows other than the desktops/laptops of technicians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when someone sends me an email that I've never received but the address is correct (like for example resetting a password needs an email to send the reset link) is it just sitting on my internet provider's system never to make it out to my inbox?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Their server has a mail queue that holds onto messages that are undeliverable.</p>
<p>It's up to the mailserver provider to decide how often to retry, and how long before it gives up.</p>
<p>When it gives up, it will usually send the sender a bounce message explaining why.</p>
<p>If the bounce fails too, often it'll either be frozen and require someone to do something about it, or just deleted.</p></div>		</li>
