SAAMI is an organization that that determines the standards for safe and reliable interchange of cartridges in the US.  Those standards are different in Europe so some European ammunition could be too &quot;hot&quot; for your particular fire arm off the shelf or vise versa.  Handloads, reloaded by anybody who wants, can also be loaded hot. And sometimes the same # of grains of powder in a commercial cartridge with thinner brass walls will yield more, possibly unsafe, psi of pressure when measured into a military cartridge with thicker walls, because the change in volume affects the pressure.</p></div>		</li>
