			<div class="markdown"><p>Just speaking from personal experience, when I had the flu in college, one of the worst symptoms was inflamed nerves in the back of my head and other areas. Had constant pulses of pain for weeks after the illness passed. So I'm not surprised that this could be a very long term result of the illness in others. Just goes to show that just because you likely won't die from something, doesn't mean you can't suffer other bad consequences, which is what so many anti-vaxxer people are not getting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>well mono didn't kill me but it sure did give me post-viral myalgic encephalomyelitis which kinda wrecked my entire life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here bro! Got mono when I was 24 and now I’m suffering, but it’s def up and down, “iron suit” feeling in my skin, no energy fir anything. Going through school now at 30, and the additional stress is rough. It only started getting worse last year. Got worse after vaccine shot #1. Feeling better after 2 months and moderate workouts, no running!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also post-viral syndromes, not necessarily related to direct organ damage from the virus.</p>
<p>ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) is a fairly common example of debilitating neurological symptoms following common viruses. Absolutely including long-covid, even cases that were relatively mild in their acute stage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, from post viral fatigue to ME/CFS and many other autoimmune disorders that were considered idiopathic - in the end, we have no idea if COVID-19 infections are associated with more long term damage or disorders because we've barely studied it. For people who presented with &quot;long&quot; versions of other viruses, they were told that's not how viruses work and more likely to be given a psych diagnosis than an autoimmune one.</p>
<p>Beyond the obvious damage - but we have no reliable way to diagnose ME/CFS or post viral fatigue or even Long Covid. Before Long Covid, most ID doctors didn't really believe in chronic lyme or even post viral fatigue. Now they're starting to believe in it because millions of people got it all at once, but I'm expecting after most get better, the ones who still present with chronic symptoms will be marginalized and told to exercise more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Research for post viral syndromes and me/cfs have systematically been suppressed, in the uk and us. Thats why its so important to watch and acknowledge patient outcomes. Long-covid IS happening, and we do need research to catch up for viable treatment options.</p>
<p>There is diagnostic criteria for me/cfs. Its fairly clear in differentiating from other neurological illnesses. It would be better to have a biomarker or blood test, I do believe that's coming soon. Theres been recent promising research, despite the embarrassing lack of funding allocated to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you also have the inherited mutation(s) for the disease, then viral infection is a possible trigger for pretty much any autoimmune disease. The genetic plus environmental trigger seems to be the initiating event for these diseases to occur. You can go decades of your life without thyroid issue or not having rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis or etc… but you have carried the inherited mutations that make you susceptible due to contributing to a dysfunctional immune system, and that when combined with a strong inflammatory trigger such as viral infection, can elicit the disease above clinical threshold.</p></div>		</li>
