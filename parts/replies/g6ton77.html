			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me find my escalator explanation again... here we go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fun&quot; fact: Escalators move at a constant speed.</p>
<p>A dozen people weigh about a metric ton. A full escalator still moves at the same speed. <em>An escalator does not slow down if you add several metric tons of additional load to it.</em></p>
<p>Now think what that means in case someone gets in the way of the escalator.</p>

<p>I'd like to let you know that this is not true - well technically at least: The escalators in Europe slow down after the last passenger gets off into a kind of energy saving mode. They move way slower until someone steps on - then they increase the speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are models like that in Canada as well - energy savers.  I used to work at an airport that had them and it never failed to amuse me how an (often early morning) traveler would step on and then ‚Äústagger‚Äù slightly when it increased from ‚Äòresting‚Äô to ‚Äònormal‚Äô speed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My friend got pulled into an escalator at the old Yankee Stadium when we were kids. The edge brush was missing and his loose shoelace got snagged and it pulled him in. </p>
<p>He only ended up losing a toenail from his big toe and in exchange he &amp; his family got tickets the rest of the season and a bunch of swag.</p></div>		</li>
