			<div class="markdown"><p>reminds me of this philosophy test i had. It said present a statement that is absolutely true. I wrote “i think therefore i am”, got it wrong. Still don’t understand why, its such a simple elegant statement. Where is the fallacy. I’d love to hear counter arguments for this logic. I never did go ask the professor, and now its been something i think of every random now and then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets really crazy when you consider the possibility that your consciousness is the only one and is just a floating brain in a simulation. That means that YOU may have created the &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; statement but it had to come to you in the form of wisdom from some long dead philosopher for you to accept it</p></div>		</li>
