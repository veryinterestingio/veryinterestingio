<p>As mentioned above, mutations could also become an issue. The reason why there is a new flu vaccine every year is because it mutates so rapidly. In fact, the vaccine you get is an &quot;estimate&quot; of what scientists believe the flu may look like that year, so it could be entirely ineffective, or pretty spot-on. </p>

<p>I think you should point out that influenza is unique in just how well it can mutate and remain viable. Coronaviruses in particular contain proofreading encoding in their RNA which reduces the number of mutations. </p>
<p>I think influenza not only is more prone to errors in replication (direct mutations) but is unique in being able to combine parts with other strains and create new variants, even without traditional mutation (Though I'm not well versed on this topic)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, it's genome is comprised of 8 separate RNA strands, which allows for much recombination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll just add to your &quot;since it started in bats&quot; comment that since it (probably) started in bats and we aren't about to eradicate bats that we have no reason to believe this or other viruses won't continue to jump to humans. </p>
<p>It isn't the first, in fact most of the worst viruses originate in animals because of our close relationship with them and the densities we keep them in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bats are particularly good natural repositories for a cross species jump. On the other hand many of our current endemic diseases originate from post-domestication cross-species jumps relatively recently.</p>
<p>Ultimately it doesn't matter significantly what the original source is. If humans exist new diseases will show up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, bats just have just been found to be a natural reservoir for leishmaniasis in Spain.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why they're the &quot;worst&quot; isn't because of how we keep animals though. It's because the viruses are evolved to infect the animals but not kill. If it jumps to humans then it kills at a much higher rate which in the long run is bad for both the virus and the human host. Given enough time covid-19 would balance out to be less lethal than it is today.</p>
<p>PS: for clarification, enough time as in hundreds or thousands of years and at the cost of millions of lives, not suggesting we just let it run its course</p></div>		</li>

<p>There isn't much, if any, evolutionary pressure for this to happen though. People are most infectious around when symptoms appear but don't die for weeks after that.</p></div>		</li>
