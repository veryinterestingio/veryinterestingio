			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic is that in the 4 stage of sleep it <a href="https://www.sleepadvisor.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Stages-Of-Sleep-Graph.jpg" target="_blank">looks like this</a>. only at stage 2 and 3 your body is actually relaxed and heart is slown down.</p>
<p>When you wake up during a REM, you will feel groggy and tired and as if you haven't slept at all, because  you still have high levels of melatonin, which causes sleepiness. This is why its generally bad idea to undersleep OR oversleep. The term for this is sleep inertia. </p>
<p>When you wake up from stage 2: NonREM light sleep, you are waking up with every part of your body relaxed, thus you feel refreshed and alert.</p>
<p>Just because you slept a full night does jack all to the state you wake up, what really matter is which state of sleep you wake up in.</p>
<p>As for the time perception. During stage 2 and 3, you basically loses all perception of time, your brain and organ relax. But during Rem and stage 1, your brain is active. Thus the more time you spend in those cycle, the shorter the night feels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are waking up and feeling BODILY tired, you are sleeping like shit.</p>
<p>If you are waking up and EYES are super tired, that might be from dry eyes but could also be a sign of over sleeping.</p>
<p>you could also be suffering from sleep apnea, ELI5 is basically your body suffocating you.</p>
<p>Also stress and depression. But generally first set a good sleep pattern (unless shift work) and if still tired after a month of proper sleep pattern, consult a doctor.</p></div>		</li>
