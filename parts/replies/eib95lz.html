			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm probably a borderline alcoholic, nearly 31. I haven't noticed any health issues due to drink. I work and function basically normally. I'm a touch overweight.  </p>
<p>I can feel a sort of bulge on the right side of my abdomen. I have quite bad IBS which causes bloating. I sometimes wonder whether it's my liver fattening up or just bloating from IBS.  </p>
<p>I sometimes get a pain under my ribs on the right side. I'm worried it's pancreatitis, but hoping it's IBS again. I've had non stop diarhhea for 5 years. All doctors tests have come back ok, no occult fecal blood, no Crohns.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Were you honest with your doctor about your drinking?</p>
<p>Alcohol irritates the lining of the stomach and digestive tract, and wreaks havoc on your gut bacteria...</p>
<p>Before I stopped drinking, every shit was like a Flock of Bats leaving the roost at dusk! It cleared up nicely after I stopped boozing, along with the constant stabbing pains in the gut...</p>
<p>A simple blood test can also see exactly how your liver etc is doing, and if there is any damage, it's best to catch it early when it is still reversible...</p>
<p>If you want some help with your drinking, come and join us on r/stopdrinking!</p>
<p>'Functional' is a <em>stage</em> of alcoholism, not a <em>type</em>...</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m curious what the thought is. I am also in some kind of stage of alcoholism I’m sure.</p>
<p>Me and my wife drink every day. Never a lot but after work we will have a beer or glass of wine and watch a movie. We will take some cider and go quadding around the property. Etc. I’d say we average a drink a day since we do miss week days and drink a bit more on weekends. </p>
<p>We are never drunk. Maybe 2-4 times a year. Sometimes less. 0 health issues that I know of. We have had surgery in the last few years and all liver tests are good. </p>
<p>Is it that recommended that we just stop? We consciously drink because it makes activities more fun, and overall just enjoy drinking a little.  </p>
<p>Curious what are your thoughts on it since I’ve never frequented such a subreddit. I’ve never felt I had a problem but I imagine many alcoholics don’t and the reading in this thread makes me curious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>31 is a good age to hang up your spurs.</p>
<p>It feels like you are really doing it good, but its actually when you have a crossroads. </p>
<p>You can have a rager or even a few benders left, but my advice as someone in the same place as you is start slowing down.</p>
<p>I also had all that shit you talk about. It ended up being from a heavy dose of antibiotics from a giardia infection I picked up in Mexico when I was 29. Still have the IBS moderately and pretty regular diarhhea and I'm going to be 40 in two weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the diarhhea is from IBS, which started before I was drinking a lot and runs in the family. Booze doesn't help by any means, but it certainly isn't the sole cause.  </p>
<p>I agree though, I do need to cut down.</p></div>		</li>
