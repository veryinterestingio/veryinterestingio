<p>They were operating without complete knowledge.  Whoever did it still won, because he pays 1/2 of the child support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, in the US, if this is a Civil case, all you need is a &quot;preponderance of evidence&quot;. Translation: more than 50%.  </p>
<p>If a judge/jury decides that twin A is more than 50% likely to be the father; and a judge/jury decides (separately) that twin B is more than 50% likely to be the father (mom might have to go after them separately), it might work.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not included in that summary, but my understanding is that they were shitheads, and that is why the judge ordered them both to pay. They had a history one would 'date' a woman, but the other would take her out on a date, and then sleep with her. That sort of thing, manipulating women by using their genetic similarity as a tool.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So the judge decided to hit them both with the smack down.</p></div>		</li>
