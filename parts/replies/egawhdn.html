			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's quartz vibrating 32,768 times a second. Since that number is a power of two, it can be easily counted digitally and when the 15-bit counter overflows, your clock increments one second.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds like something from a fantasy novel. Oh wow, they use vibration crystals </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People seemed amazed at this &quot;chip&quot;. That's how all watches work, even the very old ones.</p>
<p>Different materials vibrate differently when putting energy into it, either by hitting it with a hammer or putting electric current into it. we can measure how many times it vibrates per second as this is constant, and go from there to make the watch mechanism move.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to ask, &quot;of all things, why they decided to choose timekeeping as something that keeps running even when the phone is off?&quot;</p>
<p>But apparently because it's a simple technology that is already employed in watches? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also GPS is just a bunch of synchronized clocks at different distances broadcasting the time.  The difference between the signals your phone receives tells it how much farther away they are in comparison to each other which is then used to calculate your position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t need to have the right time to use GPS, though. If your clock is set to the wrong time but is working you can still measure the difference accurately. The important part is that your computer knows accurately how long a second takes, and quartz clocks are great for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real time clock is probably a more accurate term but they usually use a crystal oscillator.  They don't have to, though.</p>
<p>E: also something can have an oscillator but not an RTC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well....</p>
<p>What he's really talking about is an RTC. Real Time Clock.</p>
<p>An always-on counter. </p>
<p>The source for an RTC is usually a 32khz oscillator. Although ceramic or resistive/capacitive are common along with quartz.</p></div>		</li>
