			<div class="markdown"><p>The question here makes answering difficult, because there are two separate considerations, the more important of which I don't think commenters here are aware of:</p>
<p>Most mammals do not have a menstrual cycle; they go into estrus (&quot;heat&quot;). This is biologically distinct and significantly different from menses for many reasons other than length of cycle.</p>
<p>So,  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dusmeyedin/" target="_blank">u/dusmeyedin</a> , your question requires understanding of:</p>
<ol>
<li>The emergence of the menstrual cycle replacing estrus in select few species;</li>
<li>The stabilization of a set cycle length of roughly a month; and</li>
<li>The period in time these things reach the point we currently observe them.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just because these factors correlate does not inherently mean they are connected. We don't have a great deal of data, though due to the fact that there is convergent evolution of this trait and cycle length is a strong indication of advantageous arrangement.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Evolution of Menstrual cycle</li>
</ol>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3528014/" target="_blank">2011 study</a>, it is argued that <strong><em>menstruation is not an adaptive trait for reproduction</em></strong> (evolved as useful for the female), as it is more costly and painful for the female. The loss of blood and nutrients is greater, and causes discomfort that could be incapacitating during fight for survival.</p>
<p>Stranger still, the bleeding exhibited in human menstruation is not constant among other menstruating animals, such as tree shrews (which do not build up and shed uterine lining unless the body has copulated with a male and anticipates pregnancy, whereas this is done beforehand in humans).</p>
<p>It is therefore theorized that the evolution of menses came about as a consequence of the significant changes that the bodies of pregnant females in these species underwent. While a single model/cause is not agreed upon, it's very possible that it evolved as an adaptive trait by the fetus. In other words, babies that demanded more nutrient connection (via genetic/hormonal markers) had better survival, even if their parents' survival lowered.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For example, If 1000/1000 pregnant women survive, but 1% of babies survived, that's a total of 10 babies.  If 750/1000 women survived pregnancy, but 25% of babies survive, then that's 187 babies. This model exhibits a clear reason for this evolution, as well as explanation for the convergent evolution. However, it's less clear why it is not more common; perhaps even a small shift generally reduces survival by the parent so much that it's not viable?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR(1): It's theorized we didn't evolve menstruation for our lives as adults; we did so in a fetal state, to survive despite killing many potential parents.</strong></p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Length of cycle</li>
</ol>
<p>This question is more directly addressed by other comments here, though not decisively, and I can't offer much better. It's worth noting that a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0152-7" target="_blank">2019 study in npj</a> found that only 13% of women had a 28-day cycle, though the vast majority fell within 25–30 days. Still, 25-30 is a significant difference, which can't easily be waved off when examined in the same populations, as it immediately calls into question most assumptions about synchronization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>women's cycle length decreases with age</em> (they happen more often), meaning a correlation opposite that with assumed fertility. Therefore, the idea of it being a matter of availability is also oversimplified.</p>
<p>I really don't have much more to add on this part; it's a good question, and quite confusing, though again, it's important to note that it only applies to mammals that do menstruate, which are extremely few in number.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR (2): Menstruation cycle length varies significantly in populations, such that common explanations of synchronization and sexual availability are suspicious and oversimplified.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------</p>
<ol>
<li>My apologies, but this is far out of my awareness, despite being the central question. Hopefully, understanding of the foundations of the reason for this change is meaningful as well.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you can help clarify (or dispute)?something I read a while back, and now can’t find a source on:</p>
<p>If I recall correctly it stated that the placenta in humans embeds far more firmly into the uterus than in a lot of other mammals, which makes nutrient transportation to the foetus more efficient etc but also makes it harder for the mother to expel said foetus if her life is threatened by it due to a sudden decline in available food or whatever.</p>
<p>The theory posited there was thus that shedding of the uterine lining came about as part of the ‘fight for survival’ between Mum and foetus, a means to expel the foetus when needed, and once that process was developing it was a much shorter step to a monthly cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm personally <em>really</em> dubious about the fetal-maternal conflict hypothesis in mammals, which is what you are talking about.  The idea is that the fetus might want to enhance its growth and survival even though this might hurt the chances of maternal survival after birth.  After all, fetus and mother are separate organisms, natural selection acts on them independently, so they could be in conflict just like any other two organisms competing for resources.  </p>
<p>But with mammals, I think there's a big flaw in this argument.  Fetal survival after birth is <em>highly</em> dependent on maternal survival.  And not just survival, but health!  The baby gets all its food from maternal milk, and relies heavily on maternal care.  In humans and great apes this goes on for years.  An infant is unlikely to survive at all if the mother is not healthy enough to provide plenty of milk and care for it.  Sure, occasionally an infant with a dead mother will get adopted by another individual in the group who happens to be lactating and will have a chance to survive, but this chance is much lower than it would otherwise be.  </p>
<p>So I don't buy fetal maternal conflict in mammals, because the baby's fitness also relies on a healthy mother.  </p>
<p>Now in livebearing fish on the other hand, where  it's been experimentally demonstrated, it makes perfect sense.  Because these fish don't provide parental care and therefore the fitness of the baby fish doesn't depend on their mother staying healthy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you certain of the theory stated there? The lining sheds regardless of whether there is a pregnancy is humans, which is different from some other menstruating mammals, so it seems a more universal model would need to be accounted for if generalizing the advantages of the system.</p>
<p>I don't see a compelling argument in the last statement; why does shedding of lining lead to shorter cycles? It's possible to rationalize that it gives more opportunities to reproduce, but ultimately, it's clearly not necessary; animals like the shrew just skip the shedding if not <del>pregnant</del> copulating. So, it's difficult to argue that it's an advantageous system. You can argue that we simply evolved an inferior system, but... what's any of that based on other than conjecture? I'd be curious to see the research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine the crazy high infant, fetal and maternal mortality rate and the number of failed pregnancies in the evolution of our species had a huge part in that too. If you have a failed pregnancy or your infant dies you can try again without having to wait for a specific season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are actually quite bad at reproducing. I don’t know if theses numbers are same for apes l, but:</p>
<p>Each ovulating cycle with well timed sex (that is, sex a couple days before ovulation and day of ovulation) has a 30% chance of resulting in a pregnancy (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC188498/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Ten to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pregnancy-loss-miscarriage/symptoms-causes/syc-20354298" target="_blank">source</a>). Rates across all “pregnancies” is closer to 30-50% (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage#Epidemiology" target="_blank">source</a>). After the sperm and embryo meet and fertilize, it takes approximately 9-12 days to implant in the uterus. Development can arrest at any time before an embryo implants, or shortly after implantation. And the mother would likely never know because her body wouldn’t have time to begin producing HCG at detectable levels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So our adaptations (namely our intelligence) give us a 5% advantage over other apes. I don't know what the mortality rates during childbirth though.</p>
