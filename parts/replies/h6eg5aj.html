			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand the main difference is that in traditional cars you have a direct, hydraulic connection from the brake pedal to the brakes. They use engine power to improve brake force but even with the car (engine) turned off you can still brake (though you need much more force).</p>
<p>In bigger vehicles apparently they don’t have a direct connection. Instead there are springs which close the brakes per default and there is a pneumatic system to force the brakes open if you <em>don’t</em> press the pedal. Pressing the brake pedal releases air from the pneumatic system and allows the brakes to close. In case of a failure they would also close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first point is correct, your second point is a common misconception. Modern air brakes use a spring park brake disabled by air.</p>
<p>The service brakes are then held in the default position with the help of a set of small springs and then applied with the use of compressed air acting on a diaphragm which moves a rod that applies the brakes. The brake pressure is released when the remote valve opens and vents the compressed air.</p></div>		</li>
