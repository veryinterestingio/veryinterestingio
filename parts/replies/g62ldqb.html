			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an Arabic word. It means &quot;people of principle&quot;. Really far from a &quot;hashish eater&quot; in meaning. They sound similar so it probably started with a misunderstanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The word “assassin” derives from a secretive murder cult in the 11th and 12th centuries called the “Hashishin”, meaning “hashish eaters”.  While much of the origin of this cult has been lost, the original leader was Hasan Ben Sabah, a prominent devotee of Isma’ili beliefs.  Hasan’s group was a cult of the Isma’ili sect of Muslims.</p>
<p>The name itself is from a possibly fabricated tale (perhaps fabricated by enemies of the Hashishin, as a way to explain how Sabah got his followers to be willing to be sent to their deaths so readily) that Hasan would have men kidnapped and brought to his strong hold.  There, they were drugged up with hashish and put into a hypnotic state.  After this trance-like state was induced, the men were offered sensual pleasures- beautiful handmaidens and harem girls and made to believe they were in heaven.</p>
<p>When they came out of the trance, they were sent out on gangland-type missions.  The men were told that if they attempted to kill prominent targets and things went sour, they would be given a quick return trip to paradise in order to make them fearless in their mission.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hashish thing was made up later. It used to be &quot;asasiyyun&quot;. Wikipedia page explains it in detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;asas&quot; in Arabic means principle. The &quot;Asāsiyyūn&quot; (plural, from literary Arabic) were, as defined in Arabic, people of principle. The term &quot;assassin&quot; likely has roots in &quot;hashshāshīn&quot; (hashish smokers or users), a mispronunciation of the original Asāsiyyūn... </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really understand that part of the article. Which comes first, the Old Man calling his disciples asasiyun or their enemies calling them hashashiyun? Is it related? not related? Hmmm looks like there is a reason that section &quot;may require cleanup&quot; according to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Edit: also what is actually the misappropriation, whether people of that time actually call them hashashin, or whether they actually use hashish? &quot;Used by foreigners but not Muslim historians&quot;? but next it tells that the one who use them first are their enemies from another Ismaili sect in Egypt, which by lots of definitions are also Muslim and more importantly, from the same era, which can also be the correct derivation origin of the current English word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is obviously total speculation, but I would guess that it started out kind of like how you have certain people here in the US calling their political opponents &quot;Demon rats&quot; instead of &quot;Democrats.&quot; </p>
<p>It sounds vaguely similar, and is insulting, so they use it as a way of denigrating their opponents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think this also implies that someone who is assassinated is most commonly, in the end, killed by someone else, rather than the person who wants them dead in the first place? Thats what I often used as a distinction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought pretty much the same.</p>
<p>However, apparently that isn't necessary. As long as you are committing a murder for a political purpose the term assassination is correct. (Business related murders, like killing the CEO of another company would be ambiguous.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Interesting TIL-side note: For the common German definition an assassination needs to be illegal; as our basic law has the right of resistance and tyrannicide is not excluded from that right, that means that by definition the killing of a tyrant would not be an assassination. (Given that you would solve the tiny little problem of getting everyone to agree that the person you killed was in fact a tyrant and that all other means of resistance were either tried or impossible.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have to prove all other methods of resistance were impossible? That seems a high barrier. Surely it should be sufficient to show they were a tyrant.</p></div>		</li>
