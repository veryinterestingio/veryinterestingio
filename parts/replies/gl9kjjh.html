<li>There's actually a trick where you turn your headlights on for a few minute before starting the car.</li>
<li>This causes the battery to warm up since it's providing all the power for the lights.</li>
<li>Once the battery warms up it is more likely to be able to produce enough current to turn the starter motor and start the car.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel engines also have glow plugs that turn on when the key is turned but before the engine starts to warm the cylinders enough for proper compression. I'm sure that's also helpful to warm the battery up as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Glow Plugs in a diesel have nothing to do with compression.    They're there so when the cold fuel is injected it will hit the glow plug and have a much higher chance of igniting.    The engine has the same amount of compression whether the glow plugs were on or off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, I never heard this before, good tip, bro. I've heard of guys who have an electric heating pad under the battery to warm it up for a few minutes on a cold morning before they try to start it. He was from Alaska.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Up here in Canada we can buy a 'battery blanket' that wraps around the battery. You plug it in to an outlet and it warms the battery so it can provide more power for starting. I used to leave it on all night in the coldest winter nights. I think it only used about 70 watts. That was with a non fuel injected engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for low starting current you've given here is correct, but it's not the spark plugs that are the issue. It is the very large and very quick inrush current required to turn your starter motor that is the culprit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the correction! I'm a chemist not a mechanic or engineer so I don't know too much about the specifics.  Would've figured it was the spark plugs delivering that current, but after reading up on the inrush current you mentioned, it makes a lot of sense that the sparkplugs couldn't do that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most chemical reactions occur much slower in cold temperatures. Slower reaction = less electricity generated per second. </p>

<p>Yup, yup, this is the answer.  Car batteries list &quot;Cold Cranking Amps: CCA&quot; on their labels, which is defined by tests carried out at 0^o F (CCA can be approximated by other tests at room temperature, such as the free battery tests at many local auto parts stores).</p>
<p>(Because modern oils don't change viscosity too much at cold temperatures, the oil isn't the full answer to the hard winter starting problem.)</p></div>		</li>
