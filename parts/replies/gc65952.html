			<div class="markdown"><p>The book &quot;childhood Disrupted&quot; does a brilliant job of explaining childhood trauma and provides practical excercises on how to help with the trauma. It also explains ACE scores and has a practical test included in the book.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a positive thing to hear for sure but I guess I’m more curious from the medical/scientific side. I think it also helps to have the therapist confirm a positive attitude can also help, but I also wonder just how much it helps versus how much is just permanent physical damage, if that makes sense</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The basic notion is that childhood trauma can lead to long-term health problems like heart disease, diabetes and stroke.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not at all agreed upon in the scientific community. Yes, a <em>correlation</em> is there, but as we all know, repeat after me &quot;<em>correlation is not causation</em>&quot;.  </p>
<p>I'm in uni getting my masters on forensic child and family studies, by the way. According to my teachers, all those ACEs questionnaires online are total bull.  </p>
<p>Basically, there are way too many confounding factors involved in both ACEs and health. For example, people who are poor often have worse health outcomes because of stress, no access to (mental) healthcare, low education, more dangerous jobs, bad food, etc.<br />
Poor people are also more likely to abuse, again relating to stress, low education, (mental) health problems, etc.  </p>
<p>So do people with a lot of ACEs also often have worse health outcomes? Yes. Is this <em>because</em> of the ACEs? Hard to say.<br />
It's definitely not &quot;you see your dad hit your mom, this gives you a stroke when you're 60&quot;</p></div>		</li>
