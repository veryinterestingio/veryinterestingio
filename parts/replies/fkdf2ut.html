			<div class="markdown"><p>You get $5 for your birthday every year, but this year you don't just <em>want</em> that new video game you <em>need</em> that new video game. So you cut a deal with grandma who promised $5 a year until your 18 to give you $60 today (grandma saves $5 over the next 15 years) in exchange of foregoing birthday payments. Now you can buy that <em>very much needed game</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in your example $5000 gets injected into the economy? Also shouldn't there be 6 remaining payments totalling $60 000 when you've already gotten $20 000?  </p>
<p>And as I understood, banks or whoever has the capital just makes more money on what they have while the rest of the participants of the economy bear the cost of inflation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like a loan. The bank gets cash up front, but loses the money from the bond. It's supposed to help the whole economy function. It's efficiency is debatable, but it does à lot more than give free money to banks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what’s missing is that bonds are  bought at a discount price.  So you buy $100k worth of bonds for $90k.</p>
<p>Also some bonds can be traded on the market, meaning you could ...say... sell half of them for an extra 2% knowing you’re going to make 10% back to cover it on the recall (probably not that simple, just an example)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I wanted to know is who benefits from this action directly. And as far as I see it is the banks even if the process is more obfuscated than just printing money. Then indirectly the stability of the markets benefits everyone as long as the whole system doesn't collapse on itself.</p></div>		</li>
