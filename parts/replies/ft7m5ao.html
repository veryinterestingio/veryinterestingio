			<div class="markdown"><p>the hydrogen ignition is not the reason. First, if you film the reaction with a high speed camera, the hydrogen ignition visibly happens after the metal explodes. Second, the metal still explodes even when no oxygen gas is present to ignite the hydrogen.  </p>
<p>The metal explodes because it rapidly loses electrons and the remaining metal cations are too close together. They therefore fly apart. In doing so they kinda drag the surface of the metal out with them and increase its surface area, causing even more reaction to occur.</p></div>		</li>
