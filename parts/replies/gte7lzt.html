			<div class="markdown"><p>Flavor is just how we perceive taste, u/ComadoreJackSparrow ‘s comment covers how taste works (at least for salt). Salt only has taste because we have receptors the ions can interact with, if we didn’t, it would be tasteless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flavour and taste are not the same thing. Tastes are perceived by the tongue and cheeks and they only cover 5 tastes: Salt, Sweet, Sour, Bitter and Umami. What most people call flavour is detected by the olfactory bulb in the back of the nose and the receptors there are far more complex and varied than just the 5 tastes of the tongue. </p>
<p>Salt has a very strong taste but an almost imperceptible flavour (it does have one, but you need to basically snort it, it's so sleight. Think of how a warm cup of salt water smells. Lo-salt has a much more pronounced flavour because it's a different chemical salt).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crystalline salt you find in the kitchen can come from many different places and isn't 100% pure sodium, so it tastes like wherever it was harvested, the easiest example being sea salt tasting a bit like the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a 25lb bucket of sea salt at work that most certainly tastes different than our boxed kosher salt. I'm sure you'll say I'm imagining it, but I assure you that you can smell, feel and taste the difference quite easily. I'm sure that some kinds are processed to be as generic tasting as possible for sure.</p></div>		</li>
