			<div class="markdown"><p>What about gum though? Doesnt the simple act of just chewing also release chemicals? People chew their nails when they get nervous too. Even dogs chew things for comfort. It seems like the act of chewing, even if not necessarily for nutritional value, releases some of the chemicals that are also associated with security.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think chewing staves off stress in the body as a evolutionary reaction, because you wouldn't be stopping to eat if you were in danger, and if you had food you probably wouldn't be too worried about going hungry. </p>
<p>But there's a reason doing these behaviors doesn't actually really calm someone down. Perhaps it's an instinct to chew while stressed because eating is associated with 'happy', or maybe even someone who is nervous feels vulnerable and goes back to needing something in their mouths like a weaning child. </p>
<p>I'm not behavior expert but these are guesses I'm throwing out there</p></div>		</li>
