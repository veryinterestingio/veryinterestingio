			<div class="markdown"><p>I got involved first as someone studying the impact of  'introduced or invasive species'--  specifically,  mudflat snails that were transported from the East Coast to San Francisco Bay when oysters were imported  after the completion of the Transcontinental RR!    My field research studied the environmental impact of a 'hitch-hiker' organism upon the native mud snail in SF Bay.    Subsequently,  I also studied the effects of 'introduced' species on agriculture and natural resources,  as well as the policy issues associated with coastal management (ex. ships and ballast water; dams,  powe-plants, dredging etc)--and later how to deal with the potential impacts of genetically modified organisms-- a man-made consideration with both beneficial or detrimental impacts-sepending how you look at it.      So human missiosn to mars  or even robotic hardware,  likewise have the potential to 'contaminate' other places-- and its important to consider have to continue to make progresss,while avoiding or minimizing impacts.</p>
<p>re- transfer of microbes on Mars... see the comments about martian dusts...first you collect data and basic infomation-- then you begin to model the implications etc.-- in the context of what we know about life, enviroments etc. of different types</p></div>		</li>
