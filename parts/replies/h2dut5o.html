			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. At first intuitively I thought that the average amount of hay bales will be 2. But then it clicked - probability of back breaking from just one is basically zero. So it's always either 2 or more. I wonder how you prove this being equal e mathematically?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a fun problem. I think I got the answer.</p>
<p>What's the probability that n hays doesn't break the camel's back?</p>
<p>The weight of n hays is represented by 1 point in the n-dimensional cube, randomly chosen. The sum &lt;1 is the tetrahedron with vertices at points with a single coordinates being 1. For example, if n=3, then we have a random point inside the cube with length 1, and the tetrahedron we need is the one with vertices at (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1).</p>
<p>The volume of this tetrahedron is 1/n!.</p>
<p>So the probability that n hays break the camel back is 1-1/n!.</p>
<p>So the probability that EXACTLY n hays break the camel back is (1-1/n!)-(1-1/(n-1)!)=(n-1)/n!, but this formula only work for </p>
<p>So the expected number of hays that break the camel back is the sum of all terms of the form n(n-1)/n!=1/(n-2)! (for n at least 2). This sum is e.</p></div>		</li>
