			<div class="markdown"><p>My best friend and our groups have house rules for a ton of games, and one of the house rules we have for backgammon turns out to be a common house rule. We invented it totally independently--but because it &quot;naturally&quot; occurs to people to make that modification after playing for a while, it happens all over the place simultaneously. (We double the value of the gambling cube before the game starts if we both roll doubles initially.)</p>
<p>It's kind of a form of &quot;selection&quot; that helps evolve the game. But sometimes, old rules come back. It could be that, during a particular region in a particular period, people had more money so gambling rules became more prominent, and when people lose money and gambling becomes more expensive the rules change again. Or more subtle things, like a time of war making more offensive strategies dominant, or materials for pieces changing and offering an opportunity to change what information a game piece communicates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, same way everyone's &quot;House Rules&quot; have ruined Monopoly, they made chess better.</p>
<p>(Seriously, play Monopoly under the real rules and it's a fast-paced cutthroat game of skill, strategy and luck. Play it under &quot;house rules&quot; with free parking and money for everyone all the time, and it's a boring slog that never ends)</p></div>		</li>
