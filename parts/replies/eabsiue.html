			<div class="markdown"><p>one of those offshoots is the texas longhorn, which is a mix between African and Indian aurochs. I always took them for granted before really thinking about the horns and how much they look like ancient European cave drawings. </p>
<p>They also almost went extinct because they don't fatten up like modern cattle and less farmers bred them at the turn of the century, but they got revived in the 1920's. They go for big $$ now because they are more hardy and disease resistant than other cattle which makes them good breeding for hybrids. They also calve better for first time mothers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;don't fatten up&quot; you mean they are broadly unappetizing. They were only popular in the first place because they were cheaper and could survive in the scrublands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just survive but thrive on scrub.  They could also survive being driven whereas with other cattle you experienced a greater loss percentage on the trail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nelore cattle in Brazil are similar if not even more Hardy... (more like a Brahma though) , alot of how good a steak is goes to how you cook it and as the Brazilians do rotisserie is the way to go ( unlike a steak on the grill moisture is retained longer as it cooks allowing for longer cooking times as well).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They weren't doing it with genetic sequencing, though. What they really bred was a mishmash of cattle breeds that looks like an aurochs.  I have no clue if it actually resembles an aurochs genetically, but I'd bet not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're still domesticated cattle genetically, they just look like aurochs. Also, they're smaller and more docile. Kind of like tamaskan dogs, that are bred to look like wolves, but behave like regular dogs. </p></div>		</li>
