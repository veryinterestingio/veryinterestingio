			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of grades of stainless steels.

Yes, they are a bit less rust/corrosion resistant, but they generally have higher strength and better performance in high temperature environments. It just depends what you need.</p></div>		</li>

I guess the contention here was my use of the word “true.”</p></div>		</li>
