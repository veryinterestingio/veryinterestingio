			<div class="markdown"><p>Shampoo has to be at a pH of 4.5 to 5.5 to do its job. Eyes are at a pH of 7.0 to 7.3. The slightest change in pH stings your eye. All that “no tear” shampoos do is add chemicals that numb your eye. The chemicals and change in pH is still not good for your eyes at all. “No tears” shampoo is actually worse as your eye doesn’t irrigate as much to flush the eye and rid it of the chemicals. In other words, the stinging is actually beneficial to help your eyes do their job and get the shampoo out!</p>
<p>Edit: I stand corrected! After doing some research I have found that as of May 2013 Johnson &amp; Johnson has reformulated and eliminated formaldehyde, parabens, triclosan, and phthalates from all their baby products. No anesthetics are currently being used in baby products. Thank you for the information and I apologize for being unknowingly being misleading!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know it’s refinery 29, so not the best source, but apparently a manager of R&amp;D at Johnson &amp; Johnson says they use “larger molecules” because “it’s harder for large molecules to penetrate the skin versus small ones...”</p>
<p>No mention of anesthetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shampoo does not need to be acidic to work.</p>
<p>It is often acidic because that's best for your skin flora.</p>
<p>Actual soap, i.e. the one made by hydrolysing fat with sodium hydroxide is actually basic.</p>
<p>However you are right in that any slight mismatch in pH will cause a burning sensation in the eyes.</p>
<p>When eye drops are made, their pH is changed to be inside the natural range of your eyes, but since that natural range is a range that means that the same eye drops will sting for one person, but not for the other. </p>
<p>The actual pH range is actually pretty wide, goes from 6.5 to 7.6, with the mean being 7.</p>
<p>However pH is not the only thing that causes your eyes to sting.</p>
<p>A pH adjusted solution of sodium lauryl sulfate will always sting as well.</p>
<p>Any strong tenside/surfactant will cause stinging eyes.</p>
<p>No tears shampoos lose far less effective tensides.</p>
<p>It's a trade off between being able to wash away oils and stinging less.</p>
<p>Hence adult shampoos not being no tears. It just doesn't make sense, adults normally can just keep their eyes closed, and their world doesn't end when they accidentally do get some shampoo in their eyes.</p></div>		</li>
