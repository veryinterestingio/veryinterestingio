			<div class="markdown"><p>Telecom engineer here. This...this is brilliant.  Such a simple yet accurate illustration of the concept. Bravo.</p>
<p>One addition I just thought of to take the analogy further is when everybody is trying to leave at once, not only are they getting congested in the narrow aisles and hallways, but they are also bumping into each other causing more slowdowns and confusion. </p>
<p>These make up two of the main factors in reliable service from a cell tower: congestion and interference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then when you get outside the stadium the surrounding roads are jammed up, because even if there are enough exits (channels) the transport (transmission) from the base station away is over capacity.</p>
<p>You could build a stadium with freeways heading straight from the car parks in every direction, but that is a lot of expense for 16 games per year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, those ‘hallways’ in a stadium/arenas are called ‘<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomitorium" target="_blank">Vomitoriums</a> ’. </p>
<p>I assume this is because people spew from them like vomit from a mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Latin word vomō or vomere means “to spew forth” and while we still say “vomit” for when that happens to your stomach contents, it really just means anything where things exit quickly.</p>
<p>So the vomitorium is just so lots of people can get in or out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, in some hyper-unrealistic hypothetical, if there was 1 Verizon customer at a festival in a sea of AT&amp;T customers, would that one Verizon phone still be jammed up by all the other AT&amp;T phones using their data?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, they own their own pieces of the radio spectrum.  There's some handshaking, too, so a phone will ping a tower and know what frequencies are even available to try at that spot.</p>
<p>The noise floor might be a little higher just due to thousands of devices existing but they're pretty well engineered/ regulated to not be a nuisance.  Cleaner than, say, a CB radio party with people using all 40 channels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the frequency band being used by the 1 VZW guy versus the ATT clan. Carriers own and operate their networks on many frequency bands (low frequency bands are useful for coverage over far distances and through buildings while higher bands are useful for higher data rates and, thus, reduced congestion in densely populated areas). If the VZW user happens to be connected (you generally only connect on one band at a time) on a band relatively close in frequency to the band(s) that the sea of ATT users are on, then he will face interference issues that may result in higher rates of packet loss, but not much congestion (assuming he is the only one on the VZW cell). His throughput would suffer, but he probably wouldn't have issues actually getting service, whereas the ATT users would be suffering from both congestion and interference and have trouble doing much of anything.</p></div>		</li>

Not so sure about HSPA+, which is more like 3.5g, or the fake LTE before LTE was actually out.</p></div>		</li>
