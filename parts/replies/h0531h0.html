When a  roams 3-D object expands in normal 3-D space (the kind of scale where Newtonian laws are “good enough” approximations), there’s the object and then there’s the space that it sits in   The object expands into the surrounding space. </p>
<p>When 3D space itself is expanding, there is no “outside” in the 3D sense.  </p>
<p>As other people here have noted, the 2D analogy would be the surface of a balloon. The surface of a balloon doesn’t have an edge to a creature who’s walking around the balloon. They just go around and around. But if you blow the balloon up, the creature has to traverse a longer and longer distance on every walk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I ask myself what's the meaning life for some reason I go into this deep thinking of the universe but I can to the conclusion the perspective is everything we might be nothing in the universe from the perspective of the universe but as humans we are self centered making you are the centre of the universe to you and to you nothing in the universe really matters more than you staying alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... we don't matter, but we matter to us, basically.    And that's enough for me.   Despair is just not that useful.    Basically, all life has one primary job... to be here tomorrow morning.    As they say, do that for 100 years and you'll live to be an old man.    Good luck, amigo.</p></div>		</li>
