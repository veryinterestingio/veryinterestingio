			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really the answer. </p>
<p>It has to do with humidity levels and the fact that a heater is going to pump out slightly hotter air than the target temperature, and an AC the opposite, pumping out slightly colder air than the target temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. Our bodies sense temp gain and loss, not absolutes. That's why you feel cold with a fever, your body is overproducing heat and is thus 'losing' it faster too. Sunburns give me chills, i wouldn't be surprised if it's for the same reason.</p>
<p>Edit: kinda related but you can test your body's ability to send temp signals to your brain by taking three adjacent fingers, putting the outer two on something quite cold (some coins put in the freezer for a minute or two should work), and then the middle one on the same type of item but at room temp. A lot of people will sense that the center coin is also cold, but it's your brain cutting corners a little on bandwidth.</p></div>		</li>
