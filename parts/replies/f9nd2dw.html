<p>If you looked at this drawing closely, you could see each of the colours the artist has used, representing each of the things the skull is reflecting. There's no &quot;silver&quot; chalk that's been used, but because the drawing is so convincingly done, the overall effect is that your brain insists this object is silver.</p></div>		</li>
