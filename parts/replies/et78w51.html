			<div class="markdown"><p>So while the original answer is correct, not all species identify this way. Some others use patterns recognition, mating dances, best preparation and other methods to find mates. It can range from incredibly simple to incredibly complicated. </p>
<p>As far as mimicking smells, I don’t know off of the top of my head, however amazon mollies do need the sperm of a closely related species to actually reproduce, although they reproduce clones of themselves that are 100% female. </p>
<p>Also the cuckoo catfish of lake Tanganyika, Africa is a brood parasite. This means that the parents lay the eggs of the cuckoo catfish in the “nests” of species that mouth brood. The host species then picks up the catfish egg with its own eggs, the catfish then hatched and begins eating the other fishes eggs. Also the mouth brooding parents carry it around protecting it, feeding it, and caring for it as if it was their own.</p>
<p>Fascinating things happen in nature  all around us without most even knowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll piggyback on this comment to add that this is how most marine organisms know where and with whom to aggregate. Spiny lobsters, for instance, release infochemicals called conspecific aggregation cues that basically say to other members of their species &quot;hey I'm on of you and I've found a cool spot, come hang out with me&quot;. Conversely, they release alarm odors when injured or killed that basically say &quot;hey I'm one of you and something just ripped me in half, run away!&quot;</p>
<p>Olfactory cues are also how coral larvae know when and where to settle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a paper recently that placed injured spiny lobsters in some of the most popular aggregation sites of rocky reefs and it changed the species distribution for a while, as conspecifics move away from injured lobsters that might attract predators.</p>
<p>The implication was that divers injuring but not extracting lobsters when hunting them may have indirect effects on the local population.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's very interesting. I don't suppose you could link me to the paper?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not “smell” as in the same way we perceive it. We sense smell with our nose which is a chemoreceptor, fish have specialized chemo receptors that help them in an aquatic environment, it is similar to smell, but not equivalent. So to answer your question directly, molecules are dispersed from point a and pass over or through chemoreceptors on fish at point b, triggering a reaction.</p>
<p>Fun fact: sharks can tell if they’re close to a “smell” or if they’re further away.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Physically, it would diffuse more slowly, carry more directionally (ie tend to stay in the same current rather than spread between currents), and probably be detectable a lot further off because of these factors.</p></div>		</li>
