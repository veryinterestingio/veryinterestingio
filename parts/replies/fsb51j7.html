<p>The had a dictionary with words that did not exist in Navajo like a Tank was the word for Tortise</p>
<p>You can read the dictionary at <a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/navajo-code-talker-dictionary.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/navajo-code-talker-dictionary.html" target="_blank">https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/navajo-code-talker-dictionary.html</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>It would be weird for them to know tank but not tortoise. ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</p>
<p>Thank you for the information, by the way. Very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did indeed. </p>
<p>And they knew that the Americans had used native language speakers in WWI. So both the Germans and Japanese spent time and money trying to get resources on Native American languages in the interwar years. However there were few to no resources to acquire. For example virtually no college programs were teaching any native languages. The first partial Navajo to English dictionary wouldn’t be published until 1958. </p>
<p>They were able to identify the language as Navajo, but didn’t have any tools to do anything about it. They did capture a Navajo speaker in Bataan, Sargent Joe Kieyoomia. Once they realized that he could speak Navajo, they tortured him to get him to translate the messages. But he didn’t understand the code and so could only provide them with gibberish.</p>
<p>To break the code, the Japanese would have needed to have a pool of excellent Navajo speakers who also had some skill and motivation in code breaking and were also fluent in English and Japanese. A dozen such men could have broken the code in a week. Unfortunately for the Japanese there wasn’t even one such man available to them in the 1940s. </p>
<p>For anyone else the fluidity and flexibility of the code made it a morass. For example if you were talking about a tank the code talker could call it a CHAY-DA-GAHI (tortoise), their code for tank, or BESH-YE-HA-DA-DI-TEH, the code for armor. Or he could spell it out and each letter in English had three code words, so A-WOH WOL-LA-CHEE TSAH BA-AH-NE-DI-TININ (tooth ant needle key) and THAN-ZIE TSE-NILL A-CHIN JAD-HO-LONI (turkey axe nose kettle) would both spell out T-A-N-K.</p>
<p>I’m not aware of any book focusing solely on Navajo code talkers from the Japanese point of view, but Ken Kotani covers it in his <em>Japanese Intelligence in World War II</em></p></div>		</li>
