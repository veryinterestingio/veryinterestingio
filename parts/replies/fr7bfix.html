<p>Insulin is widely available and cheap.</p>
<p>You could start a new business to make it, but if you sell it cheaper, you're not going to make any money.</p>
<p>If you want to be a nonprofit, sure, you can go for it.  You're going to need $10s of millions to get your product approved and distributed, and you're going to either lose money on every vial you sell (meaning you need even more money, forever), or you're not going to be that much cheaper than what's already out there.</p>
<p>edit: if you want to develop something new and better, then on top of expertise (and luck that one of your efforts actually works whenntested), you need about $1.5-2 billion for testing and approvals</p></div>		</li>

The manufacturers would protect their corrupt market with everything.  Theyâ€™re eating everything they can and shipping it overseas.</p></div>		</li>
