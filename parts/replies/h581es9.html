			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. My understanding was that the synovium makes the synovial fluid so total removal of it would therefore mean no more fluid production?</p>
<p>Edit:so the acid injections would be the replacement? Is this the only real replacement we have at this time for a long term situation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyaluronic acid injections, or viscosupplementation, are no replacements for synovial fluid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no &quot;true synovial fluid&quot; replacements currently, long term or short term.</p>
<p>HA is a component of synovial fluid, but cannot play in itself all functions of synovial fluid.</p>
<p>In addition, even if synovial fluid substitutes were to be invented, it wouldn't necessarily mean any possible joint damage would be reversed or addressed.</p>
<p>Synovial fluid is merely one necessary part among innumerable necessary parts of a good functioning joint. Fixing one element does not fix the whole damaged thing.</p>
<p>As such, HA joint supplementation is often performed, but the evidence behind it is moderately strong at best, and mostly only works on some mild to moderately severe arthritis.</p>
<p>The market for injectables and biologics is booming currently from the idea of curing arthritis with a simple joint injection. These products are quite new, are not so standardized (different companies produce different products, with different composition which may or may not correspond to the studies done). Injectables are interesting and their efficiency still have to be more established.</p></div>		</li>
