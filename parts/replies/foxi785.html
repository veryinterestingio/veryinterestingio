			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess what’s interesting about the paragraph, and perhaps some people consider this beautiful, is that it is purely descriptive of physical phenomena from the bottom up. It dispenses entirely with things like “why are stars bright” and “how do black holes behave” and all other observationally-driven questions. It just says that there are some particles obeying some laws, period.</p>
<p>Everything else you could say about life the universe and everything is emergence, complexity, assignment of meaning, etc. Those things are all wonderful too but they are outside the province of physics to describe. So I’m sure for a physicist there is a certain satisfaction in just dispensing with all the human interpretive layers and just saying <em>there’s some</em> <strong>shit</strong> <em>that does</em> <strong>stuff</strong> in a concise way. Turns out there is such a way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the perspective of a mathematician, I think they are calling upon the type of beauty found in pure mathematics. They have found in a sense an eloquent way to model the universe and that the math works out. Mathematical beauty is so foreign as it's so impersonal, but amazing in the ways that things work out logically and what seems to be unreasonably nice ways. It also calls upon the uncanny way that math works so well for describing the universe, yet at the heart of it we don't really know why the math fits so well. It creates very interesting epistemological questions. But I can't deny that this type beauty comes at the cost of dispensing the questions it started from as you mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My degree is in computer science, not math or physics but I always thought of it like this: math itself isn't a physical thing, it's just a set of rules that must be applied consistently. You could come up with your own number system etc that wouldn't seem to make any sense the way we understand things, but as long as you apply the rules for that system consistently it would be valid. This means the way we understand nature scientifically is by finding the set of rules that make the interactions of our reality consistent. The math fits because it needs to, otherwise we would be applying our mathematical operations inconsistently, or nature would not be interacting consistently. This is why I think higher level math gets so confusing, because the interactions of everything in nature become so complex. We just find the set of operations that are valid in relating whatever those things are and the math works because that's what makes reality consistent.</p>
<p>Like I said before though, not a mathematician or physicist, so this might sound really obvious or big stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that Edward Witten is a string theorist who never really goes beyond abstraction at roughly this level. Presumably you can derive everything currently known from these &quot;axioms&quot; (abuse of the word but I don't have a better one for what I mean)if you were an omnipotent being with infinite computational capacity, but you would never arrive at &quot;sodium chloride dissolves when placed in water at 298K&quot; from these &quot;axioms&quot;. Or hell, let's go even more simple. You wouldn't ever arrive at &quot;chemical bonding is a phenomenon that happens&quot; from these &quot;axioms&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a common misconception. See Gödel's incompleteness theorems</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With particle physics and quantum physics, my brain keeps trying again and again and again to force it into an analogous way with how I understand our macroscopic world.  </p>
<p>It is so difficult for me to fully consume and understand concepts without visualization. This makes quantum physics break my freaking brain on a regular basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is important to accept that our intuition about the world is, to a large part, built from our experience. There’s nothing evident about our understanding of macroscopic physics: a baby is amazed by looking at objects fall and then gets used to it. We just get so used to it it seems entirely natural.</p>
<p>You can build intuition about the microscopic world by building intuition about the math it’s built with and doing many math and physics exercises, but it’s a bit vain without because you have no relatable experience of “looking at objects falling” otherwise.  I don’t think there’s an honest way to do it without.</p>
<p>A good analogy is explaining colors and graphic arts to a born-blind person: as much as you can make metaphors based on touch or smell or temperatures, there are aspects of sight that are unique and in the end they won’t really “get” it. </p>
<p>The good news here is that there are ways to learn how to see! It takes time and effort but getting the basics is not that inaccessible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This doesn't really have anything to do with your main point, but I find it cool that babies actually have an innate expectation of gravity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way. Without finding a a visual analogy (imagined or otherwise) I have a real difficulty with retaining and applying knowledge.  </p>
<p>Luckily for me as an engineer, most of the &quot;macroscopic&quot; physics can pretty redily be translated into analogies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One analogy that somewhat helped me understand certain aspects of quantum physics is of video game rendering of graphics. Take a game like skyrim, and if you were to look across the landscape at the mountain in the distance.</p>
<p>You can tell it's a mountain, but dont see any features, and as you get closer you suddenly can make out trees along its side, but only that they are trees. Even closer still and now you can see individual leaves on the trees. However none of these existed in the game until you started observing details up close, the game renders only once it's been scrutinized up close. Quantum particles seem similar to me in the regard that it seems they must 'load' to be observed, and until they do they simply exist stuck between multiple different states at the same time</p></div>		</li>
