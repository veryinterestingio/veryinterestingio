			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't comment on the technical details, but you're absolutely right that lack of 3D rendering hardware was not the issue. Both Quake and Jedi Knight (Dark Forces 2) included software rendering engines that worked perfectly well (though not as pretty as 3D accelerated). Heck, GL Quake didn't even come out until six months after Quake was officially released (with QTest a further four months before that).</p></div>		</li>
