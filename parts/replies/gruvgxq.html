			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a very interesting question. It's like trying to fly a kite on Mars. How large would it have to be, what shape is most efficient? And most importantly, what material is light enough yet strong enough?</p>
<p>Great question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few things that I think need to be added here; </p>
<ol>
<li>Kites can actually be flown, in the same way a sailship can tack into a headwind, the rotational speed difference between the fixed anchor point and the kite's location would provide this &quot;wind&quot;.</li>
<li>The earth and atmosphere are 3 dimensional. Any model will need to incorporate atmospheric circulation. </li>
</ol>
<p>So I think the answer is a relatively short length of weightless string. The height attained is still unknown, but the lower bound is at least 11km, as this height is achieved by the Ruppels Vulture. (and because it reaches this height without flapping we can consider it a biological optimised kite.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The difference in rotational velocity between the surface of the Earth and 100 km altitude is only 1.6% for solid body rotation, which is about a 7 m/s difference at the equator. That's trivial compared to the wind at heights above a few km (or even a few hundred meters typically).</p>
<p>More broadly, even if there were a big velocity gradient, the connection between the kite and the ground would still be mediated by the person holding the string, so the maximum amount of net force they can accommodate is going to be on the order of 1,000 N.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure thousands of km of string would be needed. The troposphere is only 15km tall, and the rest of the stratosphere mere hundreds of km.</p></div>		</li>
