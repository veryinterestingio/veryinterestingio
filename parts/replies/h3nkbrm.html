			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your in-depth explanation. I completely understand why you used women for examples. I’m a woman, but I’ve been turned on by women’s bodies my entire life. I don’t feel emotionally interested in having a same-sex relationship, so I always wondered if my attraction to them was more a result of exposure to sexualized women in media growing up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. This thread is teaching me a lot. I grew up in a very religious environment and never took the time to look into this after leaving it behind. </p>
<p>I’ve only felt sexual attraction for men I’ve had feelings for. Women, it’s the opposite. I’m attracted to them without romantic feelings. Which idk feels sexist of me? I guess it makes more sense being what you described though lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that you're sexually attracted to them, but not romantically. Look up split attraction model: who we want to fuck and who we want to be in a romantic relationship with aren't always the same people.</p>
<p>(For example: as a heteroromantic asexual, I'm not turned on by bodies of any sex, but I fall in love with men sometimes.)</p>
<p>(Also, I've had a lot of exposure to sexualized depictions of women in various media since childhood, and all it made me feel in the end was annoyance. I want interesting female characters with the emphasis on their personality, life story and character arc, not on how squishy their boobs are or whatever. Sorry for the rant, just putting this here to say that exposure definitely isn't everything.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was written to someone who deleted their comment asking about why humans have aberrant sexual desires, like fetishes or attraction to children:</p>
<p>I think a good metaphor with human sexuality might be with the human immune system.</p>
<p>The human immune system has somewhat of a life of its own, independent of what we might want it to do. Most of the time it keeps us alive. But sometimes, it’s the one killing us. (Like arthristis, anaphylactic shock, etc.)</p>
<p>Why? Because human biology is a complex, sometimes runaway train, that ultimately satisfies the parameters of evolution to be ‘good enough’ for long term reproduction of the species.</p>
<p>So to go back to sexuality, humans clearly have some sort of propensity to gain their sexual desires from their community and environment.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, this is good. It means that you’ll get programmed to want to mate with whatever the traits are of the tribe you’re being brought up in. You’ll adapt to find someone around you attractive enough to mate with.</p>
<p>There’s also a little bit of biological randomness to the whole thing (like with hetero / gay orientations or cis / trans gender identities) because it’s a dynamic biological process, not a rote piece of computer programming. (And there’s some evidence to show that queer individuals in a community <em>can</em> provide an evolutionary advantage to the community as a whole.)</p>
<p>So the easy answer is that sometimes, even oftentimes this complex, biological function goes a little haywire. People end up with sexual desires that are benign but a little unexpected (like a balloon fetish), or traits that are downright harmful to society (like pedophilia).</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, people with abnormal sexual desires can still produce just fine, and do.</p>
<p>For example, someone who really enjoys fucking goats can still keep that a secret and fake it during sex long enough to impregnate someone to start a family. And sadly, having kids does not preclude someone from being a pedophile. </p>
<p>So in general, slightly aberrant sexual desires don’t really preclude someone from the largely <em>social</em> process of reproduction, anyway. They can still get it up long enough to make a kid, even if that’s not their <em>favorite</em> way to get off. Therefore, aberrant sexual desires might not even come with selective pressure against them, anyway.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>As a queer person I'm interested to learn what kind of advantages to the community. If the said community is a very accepting one then I'd think the overall mental health of the community would be better and adoption which is of course better, no matter what some might say they are giving a child who would have a hard time in a orphanage a loving home.</p></div>		</li>
