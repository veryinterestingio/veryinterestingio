<p>The question is about the contents of food <em>IN</em> the stomach moving around, not your stomach as an organ moving around inside your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is no. There isn’t much “space” in the stomach. It is comprised predominately of muscles, which contract and relax based on the amount of contents present. If there is little food, the stomach “shrinks” around what is currently in the stomach. Like the comment above stated, digestion is mostly reliant on muscle movement, and not the work of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say so, your first comment is a fascinating explanation that could answer perhaps not the same question as the post is asking, but certainly a very similar one that people reading this post might be curious about the answer to!</p></div>		</li>
