			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe if you scrubbed really hard, but Sharpies also have polymer/resin binders in them that make the ink adhere to surfaces so it won't flake off easily. Soap doesn't really dissolve things, it just acts as a surfactant and allows nonpolar substances to emulsify into polar substances in the form of little droplets called micelles. That resin polymer makes it so the ink won't form those tiny micelles since it's all bound up into a solid mass. A nonpolar solvent actually attacks that mass and dissolves it fully on a molecular level in a way that soap cannot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would depend on the surface, and how well the solvent in permanent marker penetrated / how &quot;deep&quot; underneath the ink dried.</p></div>		</li>
