			<div class="markdown"><p>They often increase wait time artificially so only people who really need support stay on the phone waiting for an agent. Dropped calls due to a customer calling to make a complaint means less work for the company.</p>
<p>The wait time is a buffer, to exclude people who don't need support. A 5 minute wait time will stop most prank calls. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That bit about the five minute wait time is true, unless you're answering the phone for a company that sells lingerie and sex toys.  I've commented about this before, but since it's relevant...  The upshot to working there was the bosses let us shut them down however we wanted, within reason.</p>
<p>I got really good at sounding like a woman on the phone.  This was actually helpful for legitimate callers, most of whom were women more comfortable ordering from a &quot;woman.&quot; For the pervs, though, I'd string them along staying just inside the realm of acceptable until I decided they'd had enough fun.  Then I'd drop the act.</p>
<p>That job taught me that in certain circumstances you can actually hear a boner deflate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Call centers figure out about how long people are willing to wait for someone to come on the line. Then they staff according to that -</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is 100% complete and unadulterated bullshit. I was the call centre specialist for a major PBX maker, and I have worked in the call centre industry for more than 20 years. </p>
<p>Almost every reputable company sets a specific target service level, e.g.. &quot;80% of calls are to be answered within 20 seconds&quot;. I worked with two major banks in Toronto and their call centres, and this was the level they worked to. </p>
<p>However, the fundamental reality of call centres is &quot;You never know when the next call is coming in&quot;. I have seen call centres were as soon an agent hung up on one call, another buzzed in their ear, and I have seen call centres with 20 people sitting around looking at each other, waiting for the phone to ring. </p>
<p>I studied traffic engineering. You can use all the Erlang or Poisson tables you want, but you still don't know how many calls are going to come in. Some times, you'll be overwhelmed, and sometimes, you'll be idle. </p>
<p>Now, these days? In person customer service has gone to zero. So there has been a huge increase in the volume of calls presented to call centres. And depending on the call centre, adding new people can be problematic. You need qualified people (want some high school drop out helping you sort out your banking issues?), you need space on your systems (computer and telephone), and you need physical space. Not all those things can be scaled up rapidly. </p>
<p>And I can see it from a call centre exec's point of view. Spend $50,000 or more to bring on ten new agents, only to have to let them go when the lockdowns are lifted in two weeks.. er, two months.. er, any day now. The uncertainty provided by the government's moving goalposts on Covid keeps many execs from making decisions.</p>
<p>EDIT: let me add this - doing Quality Control on calls, I noticed that if there was a long wait on hold, the poor agent - who has been working his/her butt off for the last two hours - has to listen to a lot of abuse from callers about how long they had to wait. This does three things:</p>
<p>1 - Makes the call longer, meaning all the people behind you have to wait longer<br />
2 - It's completely out of the agent's control<br />
3 - It puts the agent in a less positive frame of mind, impacting the service you'll get</p>
<p>Please don't abuse the agent for the long wait. At the end of the call, ask to speak to their manager if you really need to get something off your chest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I called an internal line that my company has to resolve our issues the other day, because there was an issue that my system didn't have the ability to resolve. The person at the other end got it sorted pretty easily, and when they asked if I needed anything else, I said &quot;No m'am, you were awesome.&quot;</p>
<p>That little positive comment alone left her speechless for a few seconds, like she'd never heard a compliment before. I've never worked in a call center, but I've done enough customer service to have a good idea. I usually try to toss in a positive comment on the phone to brighten their day a little bit, but I didn't expect that reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had moderated your own post, I might have moderated my response. You wrote &quot;Call centres&quot; as in &quot;All call centres&quot;. That's BS. If you had written &quot;Some call centres&quot;, I would have agreed. </p>
<p>I know there are hack places out there. I worked at some of them. But to suggest that all places like that is wrong. </p>
<p>I worked at one of Canada's cell phone companies back when there were only two carriers in the late 80's. We planned our Customer Service staff based on historical records of how many minutes of support a customer would need (10 min first month, 5 min second month, etc.), worked out many agents, phone lines, etc. would be needed with traffic tables, and  built our customer service department to that level. </p>
<p>Complete failure. Our sales team completely underestimated demand, so the network and customer service teams were built to support X customers. When we got 3X customers, and calls started dropping every second, that 10 minutes per customer per month went out the window. We were spending hours on the phone with some subs each month, arguing over where they were charged for dropped calls or not, etc. The service level was atrocious. </p>
<p>Now, what do you do as the cell phone company? Spend more of your limited money putting up more network gear (the iron was expensive and finding locations and permissions to site towers was long and difficult) to provide better phone service, or spend the money on doubling the size of your customer service department to deal with the problems of an undersized network? Presumably, as you do more of the former, you have fewer problems with the latter, so in the long run, I'd invest in the equipment and accept the hit on customer service. What would you do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia if you don't press the button you don't get the green light to go on the crossing. I only found out after I got back from Japan where there are no buttons, forgot to hit the button and wondered why I'd been standing at the crossing for several changes of lights. Happened more than once to my discredit.</p></div>		</li>
