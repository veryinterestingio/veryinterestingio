Rocko came back like a year ago, I watched some of it and it was not enjoyable like it was when I was 10, and in fact even a little hard to watch, but I loved it as a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is funny because nursing assistants at my hospital actually do wear bright red. Likewise, everyone in the ER wears black. I think there's got to be someone whose been brought in while out of it and thought the grim reaper found them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surgical and ER nursing staff wear hospital greens, kind of a teal colour. Gloves, foot coverings and hair bonnets are all blue for all units. Beyond the ER and surgical, nursing staff are free to wear whatever scrub colours they want, or even street clothes, staff in mental units usually wear street clothes instead of scrubs.</p>
<p>Porters like me are also free to choose between scrubs and civvies - I usually go for scrub bottoms and then a plain T shirt. The one thing that's universal is nothing dirty/offensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would point out that this is highly dependent on both your hospital system and the specific office. I think green is pretty universal for surgical but outside that it varies wildly between being allowed to wear whatever to having one specific color you're allowed to wear, even between offices in the same system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Having worked in both acute and long term behavioral health units Iv never seen staff allowed to wear causal clothes. Group home staff or other types of facilities that more or less house and help patients/clients return to society might wear that but in Acute especially, where most of my experience lies, we wear scrubs. We want to be recognizable as our patients aren’t allowed to leave and we wouldn’t want any amount of confusion on if that dude is supposed to have that badge or be certain areas. It’s also generally helpful for the patients that are less aware of where they are. For example with a Geriatric patient they may not quite remember where they are or why I am trying to undress them for a shower, telling them they Are at the hospital and seeing I’m in scrubs helps, Personally I like to show them my badge as it’s taticle and sometime they can read it themselves.</p>
<p>I currently work in an acute adolescent behavioral health unit, and I’ve never heard or seen any similar unit wearing anything but scrubs although the colors do seem to flex outside blue pretty often. I am required to wear blue but not all units are.</p></div>		</li>
