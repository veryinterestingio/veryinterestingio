			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the RNA theory just makes the most sense, and this is because of - not in spite of - RNAs perceived flaws.</p>
<p>protein is good at being a worker and structure (enzymes, structural molecules) and DNA is good at coding.</p>
<p>RNA isn’t good at either, but it’s passable at both.  So you have this idea of the original molecule, RNA, being <em>decent</em> and then evolution strongly favoring more efficient or stable forms (protein/DNA) for the majority, but not all, applications. </p></div>		</li>

<li>RNA is indeed fragile, an important reason being that RNases are freaking everywhere. This wouldn’t be the case if the “protein world” wasn’t formed yet. </li>
<li>The reason most viral particles ‘work” has NOTHING to do with “prone to mutations”. The reason is that many RNA polymerases are evolved to NOT have proofreading activity. But you can easily find RNA polymerase with high proofreading activity. Why is this not important for this thread?  Because you don’t have any polymerase since the “protein world” wasn’t formed yet!</li>

<p>RNA being error prone in copying (which leads to the mutation rate) is because the polymerase(enzyme that assembles RNA) doesn’t have a proof reading function like DNA polymerase does, so the error rate has nothing to do with relative stability of RNA.  While it is true that many virions aren’t active, this is just as true for DNA viruses as it is RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Perhaps.  Another way of looking at error prone replication is that RNA polymerase makes a mistake in about 1 in 10000 base pairs.  Many such mistakes would be silent, but some won’t.  Some of the proteins might even be viable.</p>
<p>Mutations are where new genetic information comes from.  A higher error rate could have been advantageous or at least not deleterious.</p></div>		</li>
