			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this where epileptic seizures came from? There wasn't always the type of technology that could create photosensitive triggers and it really makes me wonder what would cause seizures in people before film editing existed</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, I've never had so many interesting and informative responses to one of my dumb questions on Reddit before. Thanks so much to everyone who replied and explained their answer so clearly, I definitely learned a lot from this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not epileptic but I get migraines from bright lights and flashing at times - sometimes it's enough to have the sun shiny through branches that are waving in the wind to create a flashing effect, or the reflection of sunlight in moving water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was riding in a car when I had been up for 24 hours recently and I started slurring my speech and couldn't finish sentences. Moved the visor over to cover the strobing sun through the trees and was immediately able to refocus and talk again. It was weird</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also not epileptic but do occassionally suffer from optical migraine - no pain, just aura.  Although the migraine is not triggered by flashing light I do feel 'uncomfortable' when sun is strobing through trees or fence posts and have to shade my eyes.   It's a weird feeling.  I get a similar feeling when walking past those bright blue lights they've started to use on stairs and escalators.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I'm chilling inside and a car goes past the window outside and hits me with a direct beam of sunlight just as i look up to see what it is.  Can ruin my week.</p></div>		</li>
