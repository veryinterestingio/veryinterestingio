			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the introduction of flour and sugars into their diet, dental surgeons would travel all the way to Australia to observe the teeth of the Aboriginal people there. The significant drop off in dental health is Australian indigenous folks is well documented and part of textbooks even today. But on a traditional diet, they had some fine lookin teeth.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea the reason so many kids have crooked teeth and need braces these days is we donâ€™t eat as many tough fibrous foods like raw carrots as our ancestors evolved to eat.  Eating these foods properly develops and strengthens the jaw allowing for straight teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for sharing. (Archaic racism aside) I think it illustrates a fairly good point.</p>
<p>I feel that diet is a pretty important thing to identify when talking about dental health. A traditional diet is sparse in sugar so should do less damage to teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That, plus eating without the use of implements like forks and pulling directly from the bone gives you a nice straight healthy smile. Or a $10,000 trip to the dentist I guess!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some recent research is finding that tooth decay was likely common in the past but due to different reasons.</p>
<p>For example, Hadza hunter-gatherer men have high levels of tooth decay because they use their teeth for tool making; when they switched to an agricultural lifestyle, incidences of tooth decay actually went down.</p>
<p>But the pattern for women was the opposite: hunter-gatherer women had the best teeth in the study, while women that switched to an agricultural lifestyle had the poorest.</p>
<p>TL;DR Modern tooth decay is linked to diet, while past tooth decay was linked to abrasion.</p>
