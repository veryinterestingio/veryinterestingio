			<div class="markdown"><p>Much like alcohol promotes certain species to grow, so does fat food (obesity has similar issues and potential treatments), and also so does a healthy diet.</p>
<p>If you &quot;feed&quot; the bacteria that enjoy healthy food (by eating healthy food), you should promote a beneficial gut biome in the same way that unhealthy food promotes an unhealthy biome.</p>
<p>This is obviously the slow way though, and on the way you'll be fighting the unhealthy biome, which is actively trying to get you to feed them their favourite food (which is the alcohol in this case).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an extremely interesting question that deserves its own thread. I could not explain it properly myself.</p>
<p>The very short and probably flawed of it is that your gut is absolutely covered in neurons, to the point that some people call it another brain region. And bacteria can release substances that can influence this &quot;brain&quot;, and in turn your actual brain. This can cause you to crave specific foods.</p>
<p>Bacteria that grow when you eat lots of fatty food will make you crave more fatty food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There are multiple probiotic drinks, like kefir, available at local grocers like Kroger. You can also get live probiotic pills and yogurts (like Activia).  Thosenwill all help to replace the good bacteria in your gut.</p></div>		</li>
