			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but it's because with these kinds of basic organic molecules (particularly amines), the HCl &quot;salt&quot; is the pairing of the conjugate acid cation of that base with the Cl- anion. </p>
<p>Here's a visual example: <a href="http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/H/hydrochloride.html" target="_blank">http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/IGOC/H/hydrochloride.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect image! Thanks.</p>
<p>From memory, nitrogen forms three covalent bonds. Does the H+ from the HCl form a fourth?</p>
<p>i.e. that pyridine ring molecule had a double bond one carbon and a single bond with another. In the HCl salt it's drawn as a fourth bond, then I guess an ionic bond with the chloride?</p></div>		</li>
