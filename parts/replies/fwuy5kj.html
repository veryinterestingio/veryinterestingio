<p>Texas is likely underreporting deaths by as much as 10x. </p>

<p>Under reporting what kinds of deaths?  Their all cause deaths for this year are only slightly elevated.  (choose the texas option here) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</a>  .  MOst, possibly all, of the high death rates are in a few states that have notoriously bad hospital systems.  If you have a system that is in panic mode every flu season, then even a 20% rise in cases is enough for a major disaster, then add on pushing people to sign DNRs and slamming them on vents right away which we now have learned kills a lot of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the increases in suicides, murder, domestic violence, drug use, binge drinking, smoking, sedentary lifestyles exacerbating cancer, heart disease, diabetes? There are a lot of &quot;regular&quot; deaths still happening. Other diseases didn't take the year off because covid. People didn't and still aren't going to the hospital because of covid and so aren't getting necessary life saving treatment for deadly conditions. Just because you're inside doesn't mean you're protected from everything in a safe bubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not agreed on.  A lot of people who have other illnesses have been afraid to go or have been refused at hospitals, people with heart problems, COPD, cancer, etc have all not gotten treatment, many died at home when they could have been treated in the hospital. Hospitals are now reporting a 2 month backlog of incredibly sick people who should have gotten treatment weeks or months ago for noncovid illnesses.  ALso there has been a big uptick of people dying from heart attacks at home because they did not seek treatment.  The majority of deaths each year are older sick people who were cut off from their regular treatments and fearful and isolated from their loved ones.  These people were also probably less likely the type to be working or bopping around at night clubs or beach parties much anyway.   THe lifestyles of my older friends did not change much under covid other than their exercise locations were closed, they did not have many visitors, and many of their hospital appointments were canceled, although they also had to deal with the fear and isolation which is not good for health. THen amongst the younger population, there have been big upticks in suicide, drug use, hunger, domestic violence, etc, that also contributed to higher deaths.</p></div>		</li>
