			<div class="markdown"><p>When you bend, stretch, or compress a material, you're actually putting what's called strain energy into it. You're using some amount of force to make the material &quot;give&quot; a certain distance. </p>
<p>Now if you imagine instead of bending plastic you are squeezing a spring, then all of that energy that you put into squeezing the spring gets released when you let go and the spring returns to the exact shape it was before. The harder you push, the more the spring compresses and the harder it pushes back. In this case, all the energy you put into squeezing the spring is returned. </p>
<p>For some amount of bending, plastic can act the same way, springing back to its original shape after you let go. But if you bend it further still, you'll find it starts to give a little easier and it doesn't take as much effort to keep bending it. If you let go now, it will still spring back somewhat but it will stay bent. It wasn't able to return all the energy you put into bending it, so what happened to that energy?</p>
<p>It became heat. The plastic gets warmer, and the same thing would happen to metal if you were to bend or stretch it past the point it could return. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the physical mechanism by which the heating occurs, though? When you bend something elastically, as I understand it, the actual material stores that bulk strain via an average lengthening/shortening of of chemical bonds in the direction of the strain. For example, if you were to have a steel ruler and you were to bend it elastically, the mechanical energy you put into it is literally stored as lengthened average distances between metal atoms in the top part and shortened distances in the bottom half (areas in tension and compression respectively). You are literally leveraging the bulk strength of the material to stretch or contract the space between atoms.</p>
<p>When you exceed the yield strength of the metal, the atoms have now permanently rearranged from the energy you put into the material. Some of the energy goes to creating this new configuration. In metals this is often exploited in the form of cold-working. Much of the rest of the energy goes to heat...but how is the heat generated? At this scale do we just sort of say that it has sprung into existence? To borrow the classic sequence.</p>
<p>Step 1: Bend material by inputting energy</p>
<p>Step 2: Exceed yield strength</p>
<p>Step 3: ???</p>
<p>Step 4: Heat + increased internal strain energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The material basically rubs against itself. The stresses you inflict cause shear stresses within the material. Those shear stress in turn depend on the viscous and elastic properties on the material. The friction the moving lattice experiences against itself is potential energy converted into heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried to answer your question in another place where you asked it, but I guess my step 3 is still basically just question marks.</p>
<p>But, it would actually be remarkable for there not to be extra heat. If you deform a material plastically and heat isn't generated, then that means your process is thermodynamically reversible (i.e. no entropy is generated).</p>
<p>Thermodynamically reversible processes are definitely in the minority in nature.</p>
<p>This is really just me thinking outloud though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat comes from/is atoms bouncing around, or their average behavior anyway. Some are faster/have more energy than others, so we take an average. When you deform a material you are moving around atoms relative to each other. Some of the energy you use to do this goes into atomic vibrations, instead of just moving atoms past each one another. This increased vibration of many atoms is an increase in temperature.</p>
<p>BTW, even elastic processes are not perfect, and some heat is created. Really small permanent deformations occur, which eventually, after a large number of cycles, will cause springs to break (for most spring materials).</p>
<p>To go a bit further, it is more accurate is to say that, instead of moving around atoms, you are really moving around defects in the material--which is much easier to do. It is like moving a big rug by dragging the whole thing at once, vs trying to send a ripple down it. The defects are the ripple and are much easier to move. The defects are where atoms are not completely bonded as they would ideally like to be, and that allows them to bounce around more easily, and contribute to an increase in temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're referring to plastic deformation heat generation. Whenever you put in work (energy) into bending something irreversibly (meaning when you let go the thing does not spring back to its original shape) that energy has to go somewhere.</p>
<p>In the case of metals and plastics, for the most part, the energy goes to two places; heat and internal stored energy in the bulk material. For many materials, especially under rapid strain, most of the energy goes to heat. The heat is generated by the friction of the atoms and molecules of the bulk material slipping over each other. Just like how when you rub your hands together rapidly it generates heat, when you bend something plastically, the bulk material is cracking and rubbing against itself, generating heat. </p>
<p>Someone below mentioned that it's due to breaking bonds, but I don't believe this is the principal mechanism if its even part of it. Breaking chemical bonds is always endothermic (meaning it takes energy input), it's only from the formation of new chemical bonds that release even more energy that the process of breaking a molecule apart can be exothermic (energy releasing as a whole). Think of it this way, if a chemical released energy by breaking apart with nothing around it, it would tend to do it on its own. A good example of this is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Hydrogen peroxide tends to decompose into water (H2O) and oxygen (O2), and releases energy in the process. However, this is only because the overall reaction is exothermic. The intermediate steps are not. In order to get energy out of a chemical reaction, new bonds must be formed.</p></div>		</li>
