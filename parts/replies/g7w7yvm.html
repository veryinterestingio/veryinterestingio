<p>The problem with every kind of extremist is that they start off with this healthy skepticism and then take it so far in the opposite direction that it always turns into complete nonsense.</p>
<p>Like I get it you don't like vaccines, sure there can be side effects and some might even be serious and permanent but the reward will almost always be worth the risks for you personally and the people around you. </p>
