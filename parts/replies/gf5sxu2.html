			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a form of survivorship bias, the only times you’ve fallen asleep on the couch is when you wanted to.  You don’t sit on the couch, expect to fall asleep, then fail.  When going to bed your expectation is always to fall asleep, so any time you don’t it’s a “failure”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds right because if I am dozing in the driver's seat (I know it isn't safe, it hasn't happened but a small handful of times, and it has happened to all of us at some point) if I stop, use the restroom, walk around a bit, I'll be fine for another hour or so.</p></div>		</li>
