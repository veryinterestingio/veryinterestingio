			<div class="markdown"><p>They estimated as best they could from NHP data/clinical trials for their other vaccine programs most likely. But you only really need a little bit of protein to raise antibodies; to quote from their RSV vaccine trial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A single vaccination of mRNA-1345 at the 50 or 100 μg dose level boosted neutralizing antibody titers against both serotypes of RSV-A and RSV-B with no apparent dose response. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No dose response with 2-fold difference in dose. Pretty similar to the scenario here. My guess is that you could go down to 10ug, or maybe even 1ug, and get more or less the same antibody response; some mRNA companies are already doing this. But if you have safety data for an almost identical vaccine up to 100ug and you're putting together a COVID vaccine that has a chance to become your first clinical product, the only question is efficacy; in this case, you'd want to boost the dose as high as your pre-existing safety data allows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the answer. Moderna tried a few doses and they pushed as high as they could reasonably justify. They didn't seek the minimum efficacious dose, they just went for how much they could dose without unacceptable side effects. It had to have superior efficacy because they didn't want to do a bunch of dose escalation of an ineffective vaccine later. There were dozens of other companies with potentially viable products that would have won approval if moderna had faltered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would we have 10x or 100x the number of doses available if they'd cut the dosage like that? Or are there other limiting factors on dose counts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So Moderna could pump twice the amount of vaccine they have if they would lower the dose to 30mg like Pfizer? Why not doing it or is it too late since everyone else got 100mg?</p></div>		</li>
