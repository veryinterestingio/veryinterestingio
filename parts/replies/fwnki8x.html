			<div class="markdown"><p>Another big part of this is pace. When hearing a native speaker, they're typically talking to you at the speed at which they'd expect another native speaker to understand what they're saying.</p>
<p>It's much easier to read a language you're not familiar with due to all the other syntax and grammatical clues as mentioned, but without the time necessary to decode all those clues, they wouldn't matter nearly as much.</p>
<p>Where I live a good percentage of the population speaks Spanish. When it's spoken more slowly, it's much easier to understand. That said, no one speaks Spanish slowly. </p>
<p>I'd point out that this only applies when the language is written in a character set that you're familiar with. I know a few people who can speak, and understand Mandarin, but they have no idea how to read or write it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The next major piece is the difference between official language and real people. The difference between &quot;understanding every work you have spoken&quot; and &quot;why caintcha unnersand merican when's it's spoke atcha plain's day&quot;. Or the differences between a Newfie, an Aussie, a New Yorker, a Londoner, and a Scot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since this explanation didn't sit well with my formal languages courses, I thought it further. To understand or construct, you need the grammar, there shouldn't be any difference in this. But organic languages are extremely redundant, and you can carry meaning with a fraction of the syntax understood.</p>
<p>So my addition to this would be: yes, it's hard to construct <em>correct</em> sentences, but quite a lot easier to construct incorrect ones that a native speaker will understand nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>
