			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, three different reasons for similar noises. (The current top answer misses one, and incorrectly states that bus drivers use the parking brake at every stop.) I used to drive buses, and once I was familiar with a given model, I could tell the slightly different sound for each of these causes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The kneeling system.</p>
<p>This allows a level entrance with the sidewalk on low floor busses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I thought it was. The bus basically lowers itself on the side with the door, so the passengers have an easy step down to the pavement instead of awkwardly trying to hop down, which can result in injury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why trucks go so slow when they go down steep grades. If you are going too fast and in a higher gear, you end up using your brakes a lot and you can end up with very low air pressure and eventually your parking brakes buttons will pop and get applied but they don‚Äôt do shit when you are flying down a hill so you get that nice smell from your melting brakes. Fuck that is scary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wrong - almost all trucks and trailers use drum brakes which lose braking force when overheated. The drum itself expands and any outward force applied to the pads via the actuation of the s-cam + brake chamber is severely reduced. The use of engine brakes on lower gears and &quot;stab braking&quot; are necessary for going down long grades like descending the &quot;Cabbage Patch&quot; past Deadman Pass on I-84 west in Oregon or I-17 south of Flagstaff in AZ.</p></div>		</li>
