			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it doesn't, but that series is pretty well-executed for what it is doing.  It just doesn't have the same goals as the book and is more about the people and places and agriculture/process than the details of applying the principles she lays out in the book</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likewise I haven't read the book but found the show very informative. I definitely doesn't have the feeling of a cooking show she goes into much more detail about the indredients.</p></div>		</li>
