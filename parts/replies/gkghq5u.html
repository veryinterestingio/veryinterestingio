<p>This question makes me wonder if I’m supposed have the AC on when I have the knob turned to hot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AC evaporator section is usually located upstream of the condensor with respect to the direction of airflow, because:reasons. </p>
<p>The purpose of doing so is to condense water vapor out of the air and dehumidify the internal air, thus getting rid of condensation on the windows. </p>
<p>But otherwise if you do this in conditions where fogging isn't a problem, you're just wasting fuel. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the AC power the heater too or should I just leave it off as heat only comes from motor?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not on most cars. However on a few modern cars the AC system is designed to be able to run in a heat pump mode where it essentially operates in reverse, heating the cabin and cooling the outside air thereby.  This is the exact opposite of what it does in warm weather.</p>
<p>Particularly, all electric cars that have nothing resembling a boiling hot engine block. </p>
<p>The advantage of this is that AC units have a Coefficient of Performance of around 2.5-3.5 which means for every kW of power they consume they can flow throw 2-3 kW of thermal heating or cooling power. This is far more efficient than simple resistance heating. </p>
<p>I'm not aware whether any electric cars attempt to draw heat out of the traction motor oil to warm the cabin. Because electric vehicle motors need to be small but have high power, it's necessary to fill the case with oil to help the stators and rotor avoid overheating. On the other hand electric motors are about 96-98.5% efficient so they're a far cry from the massive quantities of wasted heat that need to be gotten rid of in internal combustion engines. </p>
<p>For example, the 2020 Tesla model 3 has two motors and claims a combined max of 358 kW in the base model. However they use a fraction of that under normal driving conditions (not accelerating hard), I'd estimate 20 kW. At 97% efficiency that works out to about 500 W thermal of rejected heat.  For cabin heating this is ridiculously low. That's barely enough to run a drip coffeemaker. May not be worth the extra weight of pumbing, a circulating pump and an extra heat exchanger aside from the AC system. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I assume it needs to be off because I haven’t been able to find a difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The AC on your car may be pretty good but there's just no way it can compete with the gobs of boiling hot coolant coming off the engine once it's fully warmed up. Nor is it designed to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the details.</p>
<p>I’ve got a 2008 Nissan Titan.  I couldn’t find anything in the manual but hasn’t checked the internet.</p>
<p>Sounds like it’sa waste to have the AC on while trying to get up the cabin.</p>
<p>I will leave it off in the future.</p></div>		</li>

<li>AC is also a dehumidifier which is very helpful in winter as it prevents window fogging</li>
<li>not running the AC for months can actually damage the system because the liquids do not get circulated which can lead to corrosion. For that reason many modern cars periodically switch it on even though you set it to off.</li>
