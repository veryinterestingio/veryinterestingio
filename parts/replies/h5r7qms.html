			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for such an interesting question! I think that there has been some research on &quot;subvocal speech&quot; using EMG (Electromyography). This involves trying to interpret vocal muscle activations using sensors placed on the face and throat. By &quot;activations&quot;, I am referring to electrical activity in these muscles due to the firing of motor neurons; these activations may be present even in &quot;subvocal speech&quot; scenarios where there is no audible speech output. Here is the latest on this research: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02960" target="_blank"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02960" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02960</a></a></p>
<p>In our work, we are trying to tap into the brain activity that would normally control the vocal tract if the person was able to speak naturally. And, as a promising result, we found that speech-related signals were still present in this brain region (referred to as &quot;&quot;speech motor cortex&quot;&quot; or &quot;sensorimotor cortex&quot;). </p>
<p>So your guess was fairly accurate: We think we are picking up the brain activity underlying attempted lip and tongue motions. </p>
<p>I hope that answers your question, and we appreciate your interest! -DAM</p></div>		</li>
