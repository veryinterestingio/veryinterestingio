			<div class="markdown"><p>So hypothetically speaking, if two running cars had slightly different battery voltages (due to discharging or faults maybe), putting them in contact through a wire should result in a continuous current between the slightly different chassis potentials?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. If you connect the two car bodies together then the two cars do share the same &quot;chassis earth&quot; potential so there will be no reason for current to flow between the cars. If you also joined the +ve battery terminals (as in the case of jump starting) then yes current can/will flow from one car to the next. If you just connect the +ve terminals without the car bodies or the -ve terminal in battery as will then there will be no flow as there is no common reference point for the two batteries allowing current to flow.</p>
<p>You can connect the +ve terminals of a 100 v battery to a 1v battery and nothing will happen till you connect a common reference (say the negative end) as until that point the two batteries have no way of knowing one has a higher terminal voltage than the other. Voltage of one point has to be relative to another to have any meaning.</p>
<p>I've just woken up so may have described this really badly!</p>
<p>Edit: corrected some awful autocorrect and punctuation. The rest is how I generally write and spell...</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've seen instructions, when using jumper cables, to connect one of the negative ends to chassis but I can never remember which side: if it's supposed to be on dead battery side or the other so I just use both negative battery terminals. </p>
<p>Why is it recommended to attach cable to chassis instead of battery terminal?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The batteries aren't waiting for a reference, they're waiting for a complete circuit. Batteries are better thought of as electron pumps, not electron sources. </p>
<p>If all it needed was a reference you could connect a thin little wire between the negative terminals and be fine. But there will be equal current flowing in to the negative terminal as out of the positive terminal, so a thin little wire would burn up compared to a jumper cable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you have to connect both sides of the loop in order to get this flow. Connecting just the ground or just the hot side won't cause any current flow. Connect both, and you've got a set of jumper cables, allowing power to flow from the higher voltage to the dead battery. </p></div>		</li>
