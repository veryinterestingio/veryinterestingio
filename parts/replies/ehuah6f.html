<p>It's an environmental disaster though. The brine that remains is pumped back into the ocean where it wreaks havoc to flora and fauna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;You can't use sea-water, as much of it as there is, because frikkin  salt, and lots of microscopic life you probably don't want in your  drinking water.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, while yes, it is also water, it still needs purified, same as your contaminated water. Contaminated differently, sure, but still not fit for most uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not too concerned with the desalination issue. If our well-being depended on the desalination of water, it will be very profitable to innovate the desalination process and make it sustainable. Not to mention, volume and high throughput decreases prices substantially. At the moment, desalination technology is not interesting simply because there are more sensible alternatives.</p>
<p>That said, there are multiple seawater desalination plants already (over 13,000 actually). Here is one example:</p>

<p>it goes through the sewers, to a treatment plant that does a bunch of science stuff to filter out all the bacteria and paint and poo and everything else that ends up in the water. Afterwards, it is sufficiently clean to be re-used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treated waste water is not clean enough to be re-used; it's not a closed system at all. To my knowledge there is no such system in use anywhere in the world (I work in industrial water treatment). Treated waste water is clean enough to be released and mixed with natural surface water without causing an ecological disaster and that's pretty much it. From there the water goes through it's natural cycle of evaporating, raining down and at some point some of it ends up as ground water, which is the clean stuff that we can use. And even that is again treated before pumping into our pipes and fossets.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world tap water does come from surface water, where sufficient ground water is not available, and that requires yet more thorough treatment to be safe. So yes, wasting water is indeed wasteful.</p></div>		</li>
