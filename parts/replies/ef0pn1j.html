			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for your reply. My thinking with regards to using the measles' 'ability' to 'make like new' the immune system was if they could strip out the 'measles' part and just be able to use the 'reset' part. Then I wondered if for example bone marrow recipients could skip  chemo, but another poster informed me that chemo is necessary to kill existing bone marrow as well as trash the immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but it seems like you're making a hard and fast separation where there isn't one.  One of bone marrow's roles is to give rise to immune cells -- you destroy the bone marrow, you largely destroy the immune system.  You don't, it regenerates.  They're not one in the same, per se, but pretty close.</p>
<p>Additionally, measles (hypothesized) ability to 'reset' the immune system results directly from its destructive power.  Anything your immune system remembers, it remembers because it has a population of cells <em>devoted</em> to remembering that single pathogen -- that is their only function, and it is literally written into their DNA (the relevant genes are rearranged to give them their specificity).  They exist to fight that bug, and they <em>cannot</em> forget unless you rewrite their genome -- which is not what measles is doing, it's just on a killing spree, and like the earlier poster stated it's a killing spree that <em>doesn't target memory</em> (memory loss [if it exists] is simply a byproduct of widespread immune genocide).</p>
<p>Interesting thought, but I don't see a lot of clinical potential for measles.  Get your vaccinations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you skip the chemo then the entire bone marrow transplant is pointless. Not just because of rejection by the body but also because if you haven't killed the bone marrow, you haven't killed the cancer, and the new bone marrow will just get infected again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is so refreshing to see an MD  that explains clearly and doesnt just take the opportunity to sound super smart to the point of not knowing what they are talking about. I appreciate it!!:)</p>
<p>For context, im in the process of becoming an RN (hopefully after that a PA) and as soon as a doctor hears that they assume im on a whole other level and start going off with how much they know on every topic!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last line makes me think that if measles were ammo, they'd be rock salt.</p></div>		</li>
