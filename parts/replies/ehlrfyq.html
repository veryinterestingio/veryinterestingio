			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, DOMS can be caused by novel and new stimuli.  For example, if you are doing the classic 5x5 workout and it is you first time doing a squat in a long time (or ever).  You will almost be certain to get DOMS because the stimuli of a squat movement is new.   However, even as you continue your fitness and progressively add weight to your squat, the chance of DOMS diminishes as the stimuli is no longer novel.   But just like the great great taste of soylent Cola, the effect of DOMS varies from person to person.   Not getting DOMS does not mean you haven’t worked hard enough.  Likewise, DOMS does not mean you’re unfit.   Many of the techniques that athletes use to aid “recovery” such as compression, massage, cold exposure and heat exposure and actually just ways to reduce the debilitating effect of pain so they can train again tomorrow.  Reducing pain (DOMS) is NOT “recovery”.  </p>

<p>Additionally: you've also got exercise selection and execution to consider, since it's the eccentric portion of lifts that cause soreness. Doing pause squats with very slow descents, or a high volume of eccentrics, will cause significant DOMS, while squatting heavy off of pins with minimal eccentric control could result in little to none.  You can adapt programming to create more/less soreness.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm very surprised there wasn't stuff written on it or referring to it much earlier.  They must've  had some idea in ancient Greece even considering all those hench statues.  Can't have been that difficult to work out why Mr Discus was aching after having a break.  They must've had some idea of how muscle works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the history of athletics and training is fascinating.  The Spartans knew what they were doing, the Romans knew.  I understand there is even reference to training methodologies in some of the stoic writings (although I may be wrong).   Often exercise suffers from “the new new thing”, most of everything has been done before.   Now it’s often over complicated.  Have a gander at Eugene Sandown, he was a bodybuilder (touted as the worlds first) who rarely lifted heavier than two 5lb dumbbells.   </p>
<p>Edit: important note, Eugene competed in the 1870s.  His physique often brought women to faint.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how they approached the diet side of it in Ancient Greece/Rome.  I suppose they would've been eating plenty of protein naturally and it can't have been that much of a leap to suggest eating more meat to put muscle on.  </p></div>		</li>
