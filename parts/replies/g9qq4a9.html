			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm too tired to do the table maths, but it's a combination of significantly less weight + significantly lower centre of gravity, so they don't fall as far when they trip. This is particularly important for the head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here are some numbers. First I want to say, this are simplified ballpark calculations, but they should give you an idea about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">square–cube law</a>, which plays a big part here.</p>
<p>So lets say a 8 year old child and a 20 year old male fall flat on their face. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/children-s-health-issues/growth-and-development/physical-growth-of-infants-and-children" target="_blank">An 8 year old male is around 50 inches, thats 1.27m in heigth and weighs 58 pounds (26 kg).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">While a grown man is apparently 69.1 inches, 175.4 centimeters big and weights \~200 pounds (\~90kg).</a></p>
<p>So lets assume a person is around 25% as wide as tall. This results in a area of (1.27m x 1.27m x 0.25 =) 0.4m² for the child and 0.77m² for the 20y old. </p>
<p>So we have (90 / 26 Kg) \~3.4 times the weight that only distributes on (0.77 / 0.4 m²) \~2 times of area, which means <strong>that every part of your body has around 1.7 times the force applied to it than the childs.</strong> </p>
<p>This is for the drop with the same speed, but when you fall a longer distance because you're taller than your impact also has a bigger speed which increases the difference even more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to say that I fucking love Bill Bryson. His non travel books are essentially full of ELI5 information. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the best science book I've ever read. He's got a knack of explaining really complicated things in a funny but informative way. If anyone hasn't read him then I'd definitely say it'd be worth your while to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s an accepted quirk of travel literature that places are often best described by outsiders, because they notice the offbeat things about the culture that locals are blind to.</p>
<p>De Tocqueville probably wrote the most famous book about Americans for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>babies have softer more cartilage-y bones (and no kneecaps) so it's a pretty obvious red flag for medical staff if you bring in a baby with broken bones, because it means a decent amount of force has gone into breaking them (or that the child has a bone disease)</p></div>		</li>
