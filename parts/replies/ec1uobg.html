			<div class="markdown"><p>Epigenetics and growth is a fascinating area of research. I personally haven't done much work looking at epigenetic factors although others have started to look at methylation of some genes like IGF-1 and how that affects growth and response to growth hormone. It is interesting that a lot of genes that affect histone methylation have been implicated in growth disorders. Another fun fact is that there are a host of imprinted genes (a means of epigenetic programming where only 1 copy of a gene is expressed depending on which parent it is inherited from) have major effects on growth and puberty. </p></div>		</li>
