			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this right here. You won't tiny yellow ducklings normally unless you're on a farm or something. You've probably been around them in nature and didn't even notice them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On ducklings specifically we see stripy colorations that look like they break up their outline and make it hard to target an individual. This makes sense since they tend to be clumped together.</p>
<p>Zebras are very distinctly patterned for apparently the same reason. Camouflage isn’t always being impossible to discriminate from scenery, it’s often being impossible to discriminate from each other. Having bright yellow parts may not be a disadvantage if it’s hard to grab any given chick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more that if you're a fox, for example, trying to eat a chick, getting your mouth around one as they're all darting around is a lot harder if you can't easily identify their edges. It's extra effective to be striped and running through tall grass or something, because the lines of the foliage and the animal tend to blend together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They finally proved for zebras that the stripes deter flies as well which I am sure decreases the disease pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw that while digging for more information but I didn’t want to ruin the example. Pretty cool studies, using technology to see zebra patterns as predators do. Turns out human visual acuity is something of a specialty of ours.</p>
<p>However big a selection pressure visual selection actually had on the the pattern for zebras, it’s a very good example of disruptive camouflage to the <em>human</em> eye, at least!</p></div>		</li>
