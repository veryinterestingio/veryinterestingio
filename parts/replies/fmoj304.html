			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Fifty thousand years ago there were these three guys spread out across the plain and they each heard something rustling in the grass. The first one thought it was a tiger, and he ran like hell, and it was a tiger but the guy got away. The second one thought the rustling was a tiger and he ran like hell, but it was only the wind and his friends all laughed at him for being such a chickenshit. But the third guy thought it was only the wind, so he shrugged it off and the tiger had him for dinner. And the same thing happened a million times across ten thousand generations - and after a while everyone was seeing tigers in the grass even when there were`t any tigers, because even chickenshits have more kids than corpses do. And from those humble beginnings we learn to see faces in the clouds and portents in the stars, to see agency in randomness, because natural selection favours the paranoid. Even here in the 21st century we can make people more honest just by scribbling a pair of eyes on the wall with a Sharpie. Even now we are wired to believe that unseen things are watching us.&quot; - Peter Watts, <em>Echopraxia</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peter Watts is one of those rare authors who can tell you a good story, teach you things, and offer lessons on the peculiarities of the human condition all at the same time.</p>
<p>William Gibson's Blue Ant series was similar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. My favorite memories of reading Blindsight were the hours I spent on Wikipedia looking up the ideas and concepts presented in his writing. His writing is so dense and full of interesting content. </p>
<p>I love Gibson (obviously), but have never read Blue Ant. I'll have to add it to my list.</p></div>		</li>

<p>His novel Blindsight is available for free from the authors website. This passage is from Echopraxia, the sequel to Blindsight. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. Seeing is more an act than an experience. It is something you actively do, not something that happens to you.  </p>
<p>I once did some cave exploring with friends and we'd always take the time to sit down and turn off the lights. In a few minutes, you'd always begin &quot;seeing things&quot; like perhaps a faint bit of light just around that corner. Turn on the lights and you might find yourself staring at a rock wall an inch from your nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's my tale of visual hallucinations and the power of suggestion:</p>
<p>I took a group tour of the Waverly Hills Sanitarium outside of Louisville, Kentucky about 11 years ago.  The sun had just about set as we began a guided tour of this supposedly haunted place.
We were halted at one end of a long empty corridor.  It had high windows that admitted the last traces of evening light into the building.
&quot;This is the ghost corridor.&quot;  Intoned one tour guide.  &quot;Would someone like to volunteer to walk down the hallway.  The rest of the group will see shadow people hovering and dancing around you.&quot;  I volunteered to be the first.  I walked until they said &quot;stop.&quot;  I stood there, turned around, waved my arms, etc.  Didn't see or feel anything.  Then I was told to rejoin the group.
Several of them said they saw these &quot;shadow people&quot; all over me and were surprised I didn't see them.
I figured that the faint illumination, the spooky atmosphere of the long abandoned building, plus the guides literally telling us what we were supposed to be seeing, probably combined to create these supposed &quot;shadow people.&quot;
I decided that if I ever took that tour again, I would wear an &quot;expendable&quot; shirt, and make an &quot;x&quot; shape of glow-tape on the back, but cover it with a jacket.  I'd volunteer again to walk the corridor, then doff the covering after being guided to where I was supposed to stand.  Would have been interesting to see if anyone in the group reported seeing the glow tape occluded by one of these dark figures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is exactly how the whole &quot;bloody Mary&quot; or &quot;three kings&quot; games work. They put your brain in a suggestive state, then give you a bunch of low level sensory inputs, and let your automatic spooky stuff generating software do the rest.</p></div>		</li>
