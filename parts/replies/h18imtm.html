			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I can tell that a sneeze isn't going to come out I make a quiet &quot;achoo&quot; noise and mimic a small sneeze to get the, for lack of a better word, vibes out of my system. My brain actual falls for this fake sneeze so I don't get that uncomfortable feeling anymore. Apparently I'm good enough at this that my friends thought those were real and figured that I just had a contained and petite sneeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s just how I sneeze, actually. I’ve come to terms with it once I realized that was the way my sneezes always were. Very rarely do I get the full expelled air completed sneeze. It’s pretty nice when it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything else was super physiologically based, and that bit about women sneezing was in there with the rest of it which was rather confusing. Are you saying surpressing a sneeze is something only women can do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that it is rude to sneeze loudly in japan... So even men do it i suppose? Although i have seen women more commonly controlling their sneeze to make it silent.</p></div>		</li>
