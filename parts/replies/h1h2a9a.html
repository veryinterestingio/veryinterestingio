			<div class="markdown"><p>I administer fentanyl all the time as an emergency department nurse. I scan the drugs into the computer where it tells me the exact dose and amount of liquid I should remove from the vial.  I also know the regular doses in case an order is incorrect (‘I thought I’d check with you before I killed a man’ -Scrubs).  I check the patient’s vitals before giving it, along with a vibe check (how are they acting) and then I administer slowly. I also think about the patient’s injuries, condition, their size and if they have any history of opioid use (somebody who has never had an opioid vs a patient with cancer who regular takes boat loads of drugs). I also think about an other drugs they have had and their potential interactions. </p>
<p>After giving it, I’ll keep an eye on their vitals and check on them. For all opioids and pain killers I’ll pay attention to their respirations, oxygen saturation, blood pressure and alertness. If their oxygen drops a little, I’ll put them on some supplemental oxygen. If it drops a lot, I’ll get the Doctor and maybe give narcan. </p>
<p>In short, when somebody gets fentanyl in the hospital, there is a team of highly trained people giving the order, double checking and administering the medication. We know the amounts and potential side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a hernia repair recently and had a double dose of fentanyl and another painkiller that I forgot the name of, right after waking up from surgery (let’s just say I’m a guy and the surgery was in an area of utmost sensitivity). I don’t know if it’s the painkillers, anesthesia, or both, but I kept falling asleep. Only problem is, when I was awake, my lungs weren’t, and I had to manually breathe. Every time I nodded off, it would beep me awake. I was told my oxygen saturation levels would jump from 73% to 97. Yeah... that probably would’ve been a lot more concerning at the time if I didn’t feel absolutely fine (not like I was suffocating) and just wanted to sleep.</p>
<p>Edit: apparently my most popular comment is overdosing on Fentanyl, life’s weird</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 2008, I had an appendectomy, and I also had a thing where I didn’t feel like breathing that much. I was just trying to breathe super slowly, because any sharp breath would really hurt. But apparently I was almost dying multiple times, because it’s really easy to just not worry about breathing when you are on that many drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a good scale and the right  volumetric flasks I'd feel comfortable measuring out something like this. its actually not as hard as you might think. but I  would guess my mileage is a little off from others as I worked quality control at a sterile injectable pharmaceutical company for 4.5 years and am a chemist so...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I always wondered what how exact does a persons weight need to be when dosing? </p>
<p>Whenever a doctor has prescribed me something, they ask me how much I weigh, and I often think in the back of my head “what if my numbers are off?”  If I give a number accidentally too low, I might be in pain. But if I give it too high, maybe it’s dangerous.  I also wondered if people lie about their weight to get more pain relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the drug. Some drugs have a wider range where the weight being off a little doesn't affect it much, others are more important (and these drugs are generally only used in situations where you can be closely monitored). In the latter case, they won't go by what you say but they'll actually measure your weight (and often on a daily basis in case it changes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drugs have different affinities for different tissues. If you have one that tends to accumulate in fat, but you need it to act elsewhere, you need to take the amount of fatty tissue into account. Many drugs have mg/kg body weight dosing instructions, but for most of them a few kg more or less don't matter. But don't give an adult dose of pracetamol/tylenol to a baby, they die from that. </p>
<p>For chemotherapy things get very, very precise. In sometimes weird measurements, like skin surface area f.ex. Drugs that need such exact dosage are relatively rare, so being off by a bit doesn't usually matter, and when it does, you'll be weighed to make sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like someone said, if it’s something where tiny weight differences matter, they’ll weigh you (ER beds often have a built in scale even)</p>
<p>On that note - hit that button on the back of the scale to switch units, and start weighing yourself in kg. Doses are in grams per kilo of body weight (g/kg, mg/kg or mcg(ug)/kg) so if that’s the number you give, it will save the nurse some mental math.</p></div>		</li>
