			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey, the nuke thing is a good point. Some weapon types do this by having an explosive &quot;lens&quot; around the fissile/subcritical material. The traditional explosives produce an exactly shaped blast that compresses the fissile stuff, which then goes critical (ie. boom). Some fusion (iirc) bombs have a &quot;gun&quot; setup that shoots subcritical stuff at other subcritical stuff, which then again goes boom in very spectacular ways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Critical actually just means self-sustaining. Every nuclear reactor goes critical, and is supposed to do so. What a bomb goes is &quot;supercritical&quot;, that is, self-sustaining with excess, causing an increase in reaction. In a bomb, it will specifically be &quot;prompt critical,&quot; which means &quot;supercritical and increasing really stupidly fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, the gun type is definitely still a fission bomb. What makes this harder is the fact that most fusion bombs need a fission detonation to produce the level of temperature and pressure necessary to induce fusion. Fusion itself doesn't involve critical masses, because fusion reactions are more like burning where the reaction happens as long as there's fuel and the conditions are right, whereas in fission the products of one reaction directly cause the next two or three.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the clarifications and corrections. As was probably apparent from my use of technical terms like &quot;boom&quot; and &quot;stuff&quot;, I don't know all that much about the subject</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that nuclear reactors were just below critical (from promp neutrons) so you can modulate the criticality from neutrons of fission products down the line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most nukes use an implosion device because they are much more efficient and the yields are more reliable. Often they use a tritium &quot;trigger&quot; at the center, when the implosion reaches the center the point where all the shockwaves converge has enough pressure to trigger fusion and send a wave of nuetrons out into the core when it is at maximum density. This guarantees a maxium and consistent yeild, as opposed to waiting for a random fission to kick it off which may occur when the core is rebounding outwards at a lower density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are two ways to make a nuclear weapon - with highly-enriched uranium, and with plutonium. plutonium bombs are the ones that need to be compressed, because otherwise the reaction fizzles out. the atoms need to be as close together as possible to absorb enough neutrons to sustain the reaction for long enough for it to explode.</p>
<p>highly-enriched uranium devices are the ones that have a slug of metal that's fired into another slug. it's still fission, and of the two types of device that were developed during the manhattan project, it was the one that didn't need to be tested before being used in war.</p>
<p>The Trinity Device was of roughly the same design as <em>Fat Man</em> which was dropped on Nagasaki. the Hiroshima bomb, <em>Little Boy</em>, was of the other type. basically it was a cannon with 4-inch think walls that fired a slug of U-235 into a plug in the end of the cannon that was also made of U-235. it still needed to be compressed, just not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Little Boy was the first and only gun bomb. Implosion is much safer WRT accidents and is also more efficient, both in yield and weapon physical size. Gun design was impractical for Pu due to high spontaneous fission rate relative to maximum muzzle velocity. They knew the gun design would work, but implosion had to be tested. They didn't have enough U235 even if they had wanted to test it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that even possible? What could possibly produce so much pressure that it compresses a metal that much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they are referring to the implosion method of detonation for nuclear warheads. This is where a set of synchronised explosions around the fissionable material trigger a sort of press called a tamper to implode and squeeze the pit (which is where the fissionable material is). I have no idea how much the volume decreases, but we are dealing with a relatively small amount of mass and it's not like this is a sustained thing, just a momentary implosion enough to trigger detonation of the nuke proper.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure comes from the shockwave of another explosive.  You just keep making the triggering explosion bigger until you find yourself squeezing hard enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, It's usually artificially enriched with an even higher neutron count per cm^3 by the shaped charge also forcing tritium into the fissable core. A &quot;laser beam&quot; device that produces a concentrated stream of neutrons to further/initially (classified iirc) enrich the core is also used in the highest yield thermonuclear weapons.</p></div>		</li>
