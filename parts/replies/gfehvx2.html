			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite physics professors used to work at UCLA when they had their reactor going. He used to keep a small geiger counter on his desk in his office, which was a completely different building. The funny thing is that he would consistently get higher counts in his office because the cinderblock walls were build post atomic testing and were contaminated just like newer steel. The lab around the reactor was completely clean of radiation since they didn't want anything interfering with their measurements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eeehrm... I just ask in the topcomment: </p>
<p>thats all pretty logic.... but: don't you also need massive amounts of oxygen to liquify the recovered steel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you just heat it.</p>
<p>Converting iron to steel is done by blowing air through molten iron.  The chemical reaction gets rid of impurities.  They also deliberately add small amounts of other metals, depending on what type of steel they want.</p>
<p>Once it's steel, you've already got rid of the impurities so you don't need to do that again.  Just ensure the scrap steel is reasonably clean before you melt it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to blast air to <em>create</em> iron alloys (keep in mind steel is an alloy with very specific properties that are assigned at creation and require very precise methods to get the steel you want.). You dont need to blast air just to melt the already created alloy, only to create new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that the trace amount of radioactivity in modern steel is so low, that it would probably require a radiation detector made of pre-WWII steel in order to be sensitive enough to read it.</p></div>		</li>
