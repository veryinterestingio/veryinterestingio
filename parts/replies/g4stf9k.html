			<div class="markdown"><p>Moles aren't <em>always</em> a response to sun damage (there's a genetic component too), and many people develop totally normal moles even in adulthood. But they are certainly at risk of mutating into cancer, and sun damage obviously worsens that. And as a heavily-bemoled person myself, tracking the fuckers to try to see if any have changed is a nightmare, which I find is my main concern RE: cancer. If I had, like, 5 moles, it would be easy to see when one of them has turned.</p></div>		</li>
