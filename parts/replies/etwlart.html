			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, the Earth-Moon system is unique in that the moonâ€™s orbit is dominated by the Sun, not the Earth. If you do the sums, turns out that the Sunâ€™s gravitational influence on the Moon is around twice that of the Earth. Isaac Asimov covered this topic most entertainingly in one of his F&amp;SF articles: â€˜Just mooning aroundâ€™ iirc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. If you look at the orbits of earth and moon from the sun's perspective earth would somewhat look like a circle (ellipse to be precise) and the moon's like a wrapped up sine wave following the earth's orbit. A bit hard to describe without posting pictures, haha.
From the earth's perspective it would look like the moon is circling the earth though. You do have to make some more observations and do a little thinking to look at it from a bigger scale</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Asimov made that point too. From the sunâ€™s reference frame the moonâ€™s orbit is a â€˜wobbly circleâ€™ that doesnâ€™t loop at all w.r.t. the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe OP was imagining a scenario with two similar sized bodies orbiting each other while orbiting their planet or star together.  </p>
<p>Also your English is perfect, I wouldn't have guessed it wasn't your first language till you said so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. But if you compare the ratios of diameters (earth/sun 0.009 to moon/earth 0.27) moon and earth look almost similar sized. But that's just my hobby physicists look at things, haha. </p>
<p>P.S. Thanks to autocorrect most spelling mistakes are taken care of, bit I am still unsure what words to use. Thanks for your kind words ðŸ˜Š</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but look at the distance ratios. the distance between Earth and the moon is huge compared to either. And this has to be ridiculously far from the sun for tidal forces to be minimal and not disrupt the system. And that means the sun has to be enormous (same reason why you'd get ripped apart by a small black hole, but a supermassive one would let you fall in for a good distance before you got torn up. Which is not to say you wouldn't get roasted first, but that's how gravity is.</p>
<p>So this kind of system is really only possible at the scale of stars. You could set it up with planets, but you'd run into several impossibilities like an area of space being so deserted that you could set up a lunar orbit far enough away from its planet that the planet doesn't tidally disrupt it, and those moons not coming into contact with another conflicting gravity well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should scale. So the sun is 333,000 times heavier than the earth. So squish our moon down to that first. The earth is 80 times heavier than the moon, so let's create another moon that is that heavy. Now we can scale down the distances as well and you have yourself a semi stable system. </p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>that's not taking into account the sun. Once you have the sun pulling on your planet and moons then things start to get a bit tougher. </p>
<p>It is likelier I would imagine that there is a starless planet that has been ejected from its star with a moon that orbits another moon than there is in a solar system. Theres just less going on out in deep space pulling things in different directions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Those are just the requirements of a three body problem as far as I know. When you want to look at it relativistic, it gets a lot more complicated too. I just wanted to give OP some keywords and ideas to look into the problem.</p></div>		</li>
