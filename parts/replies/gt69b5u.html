			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re much more designed for this purpose, as escape is something they’re actually capable of. Also, I’m fairly certain but someone might correct me, but a lot of their detection ability comes not from sight but being able to feel fine differences in air pressure. In other words if you’re about to swat them they feel it more than see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t really notice us. They’ll move when you try to hit them, but that’s instinct, not a conscious decision. That’s also the reason why they’ll instantly land on your leg again afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that ants have a complex emotions as mammals or reptiles, but they seem to have fear. Poke them up a little bit with a stick and they get excited. For that matter put a crumb in front of them and they seem excited.  Emotions originate in the limbic system in humans but since insect brains are different than ours it is possible they have emotions-- just a different type. Most creatures have fear, in order to survive. &quot;Reaction, instinct&quot;?  We have those, too, and emotions are attached to them.</p></div>		</li>
