			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be a uneducated question but, what about the hardcore kung-fu trainers that brake their knuckles over and over to train them and make the bones stronger?
Does it perhaps heal slower but in the end make it stronger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the short time I participated in martial arts (only enough to earn my first belt), we engaged in regular &quot;body hardening&quot; which is essentially controlled impacts repeatedly to the spots most likely to be hit (forearms, shins, etc.).  The explanation I got wasn't that it made us stronger, but that it dulls the nerves so the pain response is significantly less, allowing participants to do things that would cause non-participants a lot of pain.  I don't know the physiological mechanism (i.e. does it reduce the number of the number of nerve endings? kill nerves?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes the bones stronger. Bone density is very much affected by mechanical stress. I'm curious about how this wpuld effect the directiinality of the osteons in compact bone. </p>
<p>The compact bone that makes up our long bones (limbs and stuff) is arranged to support weight best in specific directions, like and I beam. That direction is parallel with the legnth of the bone, not pependicular like the impacts in bone hardening. </p>
<p>Interesting. Anyone know so real stuff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In case of knuckles the purpose is just to get the skin thicker ( callus like). And getting used to pain.
And no, bones don't get stronger in that way. There is some correlation between overall muscle mass and bone density - but that is all. And professional athletes sometimes break bones just due to respeated strain in single place - like small bones in foot.</p></div>		</li>
