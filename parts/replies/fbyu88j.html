			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Convection is driven by differences in density. Differences in density can result from differences in temperature, or salinity, or other factors. As previously stated, convective flow is governed by Reynolds number. At the cellular level, temperature differences would not generally be adequate to have much influence on convective flow. But at oceanic scales, even small temperature differences can result in very substantial flow. Further, in oceans, as the temperature and salinity are often affected simultaneously, convection is a very significant force in generating oceanic flow conditions. But the same fluid flow principles apply to convective flow, no matter what scale.</p></div>		</li>
