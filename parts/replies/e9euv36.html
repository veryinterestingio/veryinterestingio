			<div class="markdown"><p>evolution</p>
<p>Imagine ten million years and ten million wasps injecting ten cockroaches every year. Each wasp has a minor genetic variation. It only takes one wasp which has a gene which causes the larva to secret a hormone which affects the behavior of the host (cockroach). The hormone causes some behavior in the host that is either more/less advantageous for the parasite.</p>
<p>If the gene in the parasite causes favorable reaction in the host, that genetics is going to have just the slightest advantage over the rest of the genetics of the wasp population and hence will be spread in the wasp species.</p>
<p>It's back to ten million monkeys banging on ten million typewriters. Eventually the brute force solution writes a story.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Monkeys banging on a typewriter would have a discernible pattern (is mammalian consciousness deterministic?), but a truly random, continuous stream of characters would eventually write a story in enough time (think trillions of years). It's also possible for particle vibrations to perfectly align so much so that you pass your hand through a desk, given enough time of course (basically infinite). </p></div>		</li>
