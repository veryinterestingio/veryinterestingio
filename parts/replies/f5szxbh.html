			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always under the impression it's best to wake up between sleep cycles, so within those 90 minute intervals, and I figured &quot;8 hours&quot; was just because it takes the average person 15-30 mins to fall asleep (vs 7.5 hours for 90 minute intervals)</p>
<p>So what you're telling me... is if I sleep for 45 minutes, waking up smack in the middle of a REM cycle, I should feel more refreshed than 1.5 hours?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That isn't quite what he's saying: it's more that it's more comfortable to wake up from either REM sleep OR between cycles.</p>
<p>So ideally you'd wake up after 90 minutes (assuming your body's sleep works in 90 minute cycles - everyone is a little different). If you can't do that, the next best option would be to wake up during REM sleep (around 45 minutes). Both options are better than waking up in 20 or 70 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>20 minutes is short enough not to feel groggy after. If you are sleep deprived your brain will fast-forward to REM phase. (Why else would you only sleep 20 minutes?)</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no &quot;between&quot; sleep cycles, it's more fluent than that. There's not a window where your body says &quot;alright I'm done with one cycle, now let's do nothing for 10 minutes to give him a chance to wake up&quot; </p>

<p>There is also no REM &quot;cycle&quot;, there's a REM phase. The different phases together make a cycle. Otherwise yes. If you are in a REM phase when you wake up, you will be more awake than when you wake up from deep sleep. </p>
<p>This is just regarding how groggy you feel when you wake up though, it doesn't mean that you will be more &quot;rested&quot;. The groggyness will pass quickly anyway. Sleeping longer means you're more rested for the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, fighting the grogginess is the whole point.  I'm very lucky in that I've been getting 8 consistent hours sleep for the last 5 years with little exception (yes, I made it a habit and yes, it's better than any drug).</p>
<p>Problem is, waking up is fucking HORRIBLE.  I never, ever feel worse than I do right when my alarm clock goes off every morning.  I've tried more sleep, less sleep, sleep apps... there's just nothing worse than those first few moments and therefore I am a chronic snooze button masher (and often running late).</p>
<p>I would <em>almost</em> trade feeling well rested during the day for not feeling absolutely miserable when my alarm goes off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my experience as well, which is why this seems counterintuitive, but hey, I'm convinced.  I've always heard a 20-30 minute nap is the 'best' for awakeness, it just never made sense before</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>> At 8 hours, it's often easier to wake up not groggy because even if you are in the middle of a cycle, you are more likely to be in REM/dreaming sleep which looks a lot like your awake brain leading to less grogginess, generally.</p>
<p>TIL. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
