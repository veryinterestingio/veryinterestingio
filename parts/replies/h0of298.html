			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar thing happened to my uncle who's a surgeon. He has to submit his finger prints ever time he's moves states for a new job. The last time he had to submit them 3 times because his fingerprints were so worn down from washing with steel wool before surgeries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was when my iPad was brand new, I forgot my passcode, but I never needed it since I had my fingerprint. Then I realized I needed it every time I got an update or when the prints wore off my thumb. </p>
<p>I honestly don’t know if it was the granite, or the epoxy that I work with, or the filing, or the polishing pads. The dryness of the dust, combined with all those other things maybe.</p></div>		</li>
