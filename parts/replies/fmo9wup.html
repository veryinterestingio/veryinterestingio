			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen is really a proton promiscuous blob of electrons. Drink some water? Your body is already proton pumping the stuff to turn it into acid. Then those -OH don't care. They will steel from other water or just grab onto  some other molecule. Sure, a sealed glass of water won't change its Hydrogen and Oxygen ratios, but it's a big old square dance changing partners millions of times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know. I'm neither a chemist nor a biologist :) I assumed it would be, since biological reactions do not fuse atoms. So every reaction involving hydrogen should still have hydrogen in the result, or if the hydrogen was a catalyst, it would be returned to its a surrounding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, many biological processes involve the conversion of water with other junk into organic matter. That alone means that the amount of the earth's Hydrogen and Oxygen that's represented as water at any one time changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, because those processes are reversed by other biological processes. Oxidative phosphorylation basically reverses photosynthesis, for example.</p>
<p>At steady state, equal amounts of water are being used and produced by the biosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a steady state, the state will remain steady you say?</p>
<p>I am skeptical that life on earth is or has ever been a steady state. Without life, there would've been no free oxygen in the air. The initial creation of free oxygen killed nearly everything.</p>
<p>Then the invention of tree bark in the Carboniferous era lead to every land mass in the world being hundreds of feet deep with indestructible tree bark, since nothing yet existed that could destroy it besides wild fires. Wild fires circled the globe for centuries. Fun fact: these conditions are how 100% of North American coal was formed.</p>
<p>Right now, we live in a time where, after talking 200,000 years for human population to reach 1 billion around the year 1800, we have reached 8 billion in the last 200 years. And our industrial output has recently become the dominant factor in many biological systems.</p>
<p>I don't think life on earth has ever been what you could call a steady state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It took billions of years for free oxygen to accumulate, and that was coming from a situation without photosynthetic organisms.</p>
<p>The carboniferous was a temporary disruption of the carbon cycle.</p>
<p>We're currently in a pretty steady state, just a little unbalanced because of humans burning fossil fuels. You know when climate deniers say humans are only responsible for 3% of CO2 emissions, they're actually kinda right. It's just that the other 97% of CO2 emissions are balanced by carbon fixation, unlike human emissions. The net change is still much smaller than the total flow in the carbon cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The carbon cycle is normally in a steady state. Currently it's slightly out of balance because of human activities, but most biosynthesis is still matched by biodegradation.</p></div>		</li>
