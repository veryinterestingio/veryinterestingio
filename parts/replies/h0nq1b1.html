			<div class="markdown"><p>Good Answer.  And watch that frame that is ready to go &quot;dry&quot; after a good soaking.  They will let it sit for a good week or so before closing it in.  Getting wet isn't the problem.  Not getting dry, is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Getting out of your house isn't a problem. Forgetting your key and not being able to get back in, is.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just true.  It's also true in backpacking.  I recently went on a trip to the Pacific Northwest, for example, so I knew I was going to get wet.  But I wore materials that dried quickly, so I was able to take them off at the end of the day, hang them up in my tent, and have dry clothes the next morning.  A little uncomfortable at times, but no big deal.  But if my stuff hadn't dried so easily, I'd be wearing wet gear for multiple days -- that would not only be miserable, but could also get dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Come on out to Texas and watch 'em build entry-level tract houses. There's none of this &quot;week or so&quot; going on anywhere.</p>
<p>Now, if you're planning to build a house that will stand for more than 20 years, sure. But that ain't the way it's done here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a wooden deck on the side of my house, The rafters are 2x8's and the planks you walk on are 2x6's. All of the planks have a half-inch gap between them to allow rain and dirt to fall through, but the plank that is up against the house has its edge sitting on a 2x8 beam that is bolted to the wooden &quot;footer&quot; of the first floor (concrete basement wall below, wooden studs above).</p>
<p>Although it was &quot;pressure treated&quot; wood, and painted with outdoor deck paint too...that one &quot;gap&quot; is a place where water collected and just sat there. After 30 years, it began working its way into the wood. A fungus and mold caused rot, and the wood turned spongey.</p>
<p>Even though the rest of the 30-year-old planks only had paint on their tops, with bare wood underneath, they were all fine. The difference is that the planks had drainage and lots of air-circulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had that problem across an entire 104-unit apartment conversion condo complex where I live. The decks are supposed to be built with a 1-2 degree pitch away from the building to encourage the water to roll off. It wasn't done and only 10 years after being built, the footers were rotten. For the 2nd and 3rd floor units, this created a life safety hazard. It cost just about $1M to repair it all and rebuild the decks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easily done right when it was initially built, but...one small defect in design, and years later there is a huge cost to repair that was totally un-necessary...</p>
<p>After replacing the beam that was bolted to the house, and the one plank that was on top of that, I used silicone and deck paint to seal that joint.</p>
<p>I had to build a support structure underneath the deck to support it while I removed the key rotted pieces. The cost of materials was not bad, but the labor was time-consuming. If I had done this for a customer who was trying to sell their house. I would price it 30% below demo-ing, and completely replacing the entire deck with new wood, and...these days wood has gone way up in price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, building materials are rated for exposure - meaning if you get the walls up and covered in house wrap, it will protect the plywood well enough for about 30 days so you can address other openings like windows and doors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had our cottage exterior OSB covered with just housewrap for 5 years and it was perfectly fine. We did eventually get it finished because it’s not ideal.</p>
<p>In our case any water was drying out. So no problems.</p></div>		</li>
