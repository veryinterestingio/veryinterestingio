			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, bankrupt comes from the Italian <em>banca rotta</em> (broken counter). If a merchant was unable to pay his debts and his business was seen as dragging down the business community, the government would come and literally smash his <em>banca</em> (a heavy table where money counting is done) to bits, thereby formally ending his ability to conduct trade.</p>
<p>Back then, trade was often done out of doors, so your banca also doubled as your storefront. And after they smashed your table, your spot on the trading floor would be given to someone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact:
Mortgage comes from the Latin words Mort (death) and gage (Contract)
So a mortgage is a contract you keep until death (at least by the Latin standards)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word mortgage is derived from a Law French term used in Britain in the Middle Ages meaning &quot;death pledge&quot; and refers to the pledge ending (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.[</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a quote from a user comment on <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2010/02/03/folklore-origin-expression-you-are-fired/" target="_blank">this article</a> about the etymology of the term &quot;fired&quot;. The (sourced!) article gives a couple of possible explanations for the phrase, neither of which have anything to do with burning carpenter's tools.</p>
<p>But instead of quoting the article itself, you're quoting a user comment on an article which disagrees with it, despite the fact that the comment provides no actual source or reason to believe it. It also sounds like complete nonsense - destroying someone's tools instead of simply dismissing them would have been illegal in any legal system in history, even thousands of years ago. It's also hard to imagine that there would be so many incompetent carpenters that there needed to be a standard protocol for letting them know just how hilariously unqualified they were, or that people would somehow think that illegally destroying valuable tools was the best way of dealing with this. My own Google searches find no support for this practice having taken place.</p>
<p>But, Reddit being Reddit, of course this unsourced bullshit is the top fucking comment.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Parent poster has altered their comment to be an obvious joke since I called them out, so my post doesn't make much sense anymore. The original comment I replied to read:</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Both terms come from old English naval ship yards from around the time of the Spanish aramarda.</p>
<p>Both were related to the dismissal of carpenters. If a carpenter was rubbish at his job he would be given the sack. In other words he was given his bag of tools and told to go away. If a carpenter was totally useless he was fired. His bag of tools was put on a fire and burnt therefore unable to practice carpentry anywhere.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
