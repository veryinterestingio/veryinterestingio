			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a problem with all electronics, not just battery powered devices! Short circuits are bad, basically it allows &quot;infinite&quot; current to pass which causes heat accumulation which breaks down capacitors/resistors/microprocessors. </p>
<p>Water also can cause corrosion which can ultimately ruin a device even if it seems initially ubscathed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The problem is that water conducts, but it’s not a “good” conductor, largely because it doesn’t have very good fixed structure. Copper, gold, and other conductive metals have a pretty clear path for electricity to pass through because the molecules stay in configuration and the energy hops from one to the next and so on. Electricity always follows the path of least resistance, that’s why tall buildings and trees get struck by lightning instead of you. Unless you happen to be barefoot in a field holding a copper rod in the air. Water is not as conductive when it has a rigid molecular alignment (ice), so and it can’t pass that much energy without melting back into a liquid. Also the energy would spread throughout all the water, and water goes everywhere, so you can’t guarantee the amount of energy you want to go from A to B will get there. </p>
<p>TL:DR, water is not a reliable enough conductor to use for transmitting energy, especially in complex electronics. It’s just conductive enough (in a bad way) that energy can arc through it or diffuse into it rather than go where you want it to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes</p>
<p>you can (and it has been done) use water flow instead of electricity to make computers</p>
<p>They're shit in comparison though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can (but caution long term exposure can be corrosive).</p>
<p>My parents old CRT TV had a lot of dust in it, so one time I opened it up, took out the control board, washed it in the sink, dried it thoroughly and reinstalled it. No problems.</p>
<p>Note: CRT TVs often have physically large capacitors that hold a large amount of charge even when disconnected from the mains. They can severely shock you. Don’t do this if you are not sure what a large capacitor is!</p>
<p>Edit: added CRT to note</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest danger with old CRT TVs aren't actual regular capacitors (I mean the higher voltage ones certainly hurt, but modern TVs have those in the PSU as well), but rather the picture tube itself, which <em>itself</em> is a really good, high voltage, low leakage capacitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes. A lot of devices don't actually turn off, and even if you cut the mains or rip out the battery they might as till hold a charge for a while (capacitors and such).</p></div>		</li>
