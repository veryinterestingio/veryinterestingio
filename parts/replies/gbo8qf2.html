			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, the more times a memory is accessed, the more solid the connections that compose it become. So if you think about an event enough times, it’s more or less there to stay. So if something humiliating happens, and you dwell on it and think about it over and over again, it creates very strong pathways that are unlikely to erode. It has become important enough to you that it’s connections will last much longer than others, even after not being accessed for a long time.</p></div>		</li>
