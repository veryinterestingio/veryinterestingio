			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised this submission wasn't rejected because it's based entirely on opinion and not on science. Worse, it's just not accurate.</p>
<p>It depends on the organ for one thing. Recent studies, based on parabiosis model, unveiled a specific factor in young mice blood – GDF11, which can “rejuvenate” aged muscle and brain tissues.</p>
<p>Liver typically will regenerate and renew but kidney transplants will not do as well. </p>
<p>In general it's multi-factorial and research is still in its early stages (since it's hard to do more than set up animal models for the biochemistry).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upvote for visibility!</p>
<p>That fact that it’s even been given gold is even more frustrating.  The Mods need to get involved here.  Does anyone really think his example of transplanting an alcoholic’s liver is realistic?  And that (if any credible surgeon would even find this organ sustainable enough for transplant, which they wouldn’t) they could extend the life of that organ by owning a dog?? </p>
<p>I love dogs but that’s just NOT HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not quite. I think he was saying that a transplanted organ might do better if it's being transplanted out of someone who wore it down massively year after year, and into someone who actually took care of their body. And the dog thing was about how going on a 2k walk every day is good for your health, not just a passive effect from owning a dog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mods of ELI5 don't judge posts based on correctness.  The TL:DR is that we don't have a rule against it.  That seems strange so i'll try to explain.</p>
<p>Since we are not experts on every topic it would be irresponsible for us to take it upon ourselves to decide if the explanations are correct or not.  </p>
<p>If we were to judge comments on topics that did fall into one of our expertise, that would create a different standard for topics that happen to be familiar to various mods of the sub.</p>
<p>If you want to have this reviewed with other mods you can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fexplainlikeimfive" target="_blank">send a modmail</a>.  If you want to talk about changing ELI5's policies we have a sub for that: /r/IdeasForELI5.</p>

<p>Are not applicable here?  Not trying to be argumentative but it seems like you do have rules that are in place to prevent posts like this.  It’s (at this point) been given gold twice on something that’s frustratingly inaccurate about organ transplants, which seems like a bigger deal to me because it’s healthcare related.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As per Rule 8, guessing is disallowed. How do you distinguish guesswork from legitimate answers? Do you only base that decision on how confident they sound? If so, then I feel that you should reconsider what measures you take to ensure accurate explanations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your example reminded me of a story. I met someone once who had a liver transplant in her 50s. She said after her transplant she suddenly had a strong craving for Dr Pepper soda. Before the transplant she had rarely drank it and hadn’t had it for years. After, she had to have it regularly. After some time she met the family of the donor and asked them about it. Sure enough the donor had drank several Dr Peppers a day. She said she had met other liver transplant recipients who had developed new food cravings after transplant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes more sense than the other things in this thread: allergies are driven by having t-cells that are sensitive to a given protein.  There will undoubtedly be some donor t-cells floating around in a liver, and the thing about them is: when they find what they're looking for, they take it back ... somewhere, I'm not sure where... and whatever manufactures white blood cells makes a bunch of copies of that cell.  If they keep finding their targets, they keep getting multiplied.  </p>
<p>If they're sensitive to a protein on, say, pollen -- wham, allergies.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allergies can pass on through the liver, something that has been empirically studied and has multiple scientifically plausible mechanisms. This is why doctors now often ask organ donors to report allergies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a liver transplant in October of 2004. Five and half months later, through a small sequence of events, I met my organ donor's husband (not thru the transplant clinic, must be fate). We've been together since then. I literally inherited my donor's husband and cat.</p>
<p>Also within the first few years after transplant I had a couple dreams that felt strange and I described the dreams to him. He told me that my donor, the wife, had those exact instances in her life. Cellular memory is what they call it.</p>
<p>He came with me to one of my annual appointments at the transplant clinic and I told the doctor who exactly my guest was. He just looked at us, maybe startled. He had a strange look on his face. He instantly stood up and walked out of the room. He came back a couple minutes later and didn't say a word about it.</p></div>		</li>
