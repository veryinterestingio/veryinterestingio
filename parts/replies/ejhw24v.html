			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is, what if we just injected a working form of photosynthesis into, say, soldiers. Could they passively acquire more energy (leaving everything else the same) than not doing that?
I'm not talking about evolving into it. You'd still eat, drink, sleep the same, but you would also have the bonus of a wee little bit of solar energy absorption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, let's assume we have some impossibly hyperadvanced technology to do just that. We can give people the ability to photosynthesize, which reduces the amount of food they need to consume, and let's assume it works perfectly, has absolutely no negative side effects, and nobody minds having green skin.</p>
<p>How much of your body is normally exposed to the sun? And for how many hours a day?</p>
<p>A soldier is typically covered pretty much head to toe in clothing. It's not unusual for a soldier to have only their face exposed, and even that will be in the shadow cast by their headgear. Unless you make the soldiers spend literally hours a day basking in the sun, mostly unclothed, they're just not going to get any measurable benefit from it. Even with hours a day of basking (and assuming you've also magically made them immune to sunburns and skin cancer), they're going to need to eat maybe one percent less food.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to develop photosynthetic super soldiers, you could put the same effort into getting them a tiny bit of extra food and get a bigger benefit without the headaches.</p>
<p>To be fair, this assumes that human photosynthesis is no more efficient than plant photosynthesis, which is actually very inefficient. If you could somehow make human photosynthesis 100% efficient, you could maybe cut their calorie needs by 5-10% with hours a day of sunbathing. Still doesn't look like a great payoff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you would have <a href="https://www.thetoyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/toysoldiers51.jpg" target="_blank">green soldiers</a> lying stark naked in a field in all weather getting sun burnt all day to <strong><em>maybe</em></strong> accumulate a bit of sugar equal to less than 1% of their daily calorie needs?</p>
<p>Thre HUGE things some people are missing in this thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>How minuscule the energy provided by photosynthesis is.</li>
<li>How little sun-facing surface area humans have.</li>
<li>What taking advantage of photosynthesis handicaps everything else.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
