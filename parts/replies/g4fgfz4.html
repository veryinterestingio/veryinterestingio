			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about things like mercury?  Handling mercury can cause liver damage because it can go thru your skin. Is mercury considered water soluble?  Genuinely asking</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this work for thc? I remember once a buddy I knew would test dirty on piss tests months after he should've been clean. He really needed to test clean so he got that one put on hold until after a doctors visit and it turns out that his fat would absorb the thc, and through breaking down those fats he'd get thc in his system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting, that if the skin allowed water though it would actually dehydrate you. </p>
<p>If major burn victims with large amounts of their skin compromised the first concern isn’t actually infection, it’s dehydration. You skin keeps water in, that’s why the barrier is there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other component of this is that human water balance is somewhat delicate. We're designed to absorb water through the mouth&gt; gut orifice specifically so it can happen slowly enough for you to pee off the excess and utilize the bulk.</p>
<p>Problems with excess water start in the skin/ extremities (peripheral edema) and  can quickly escalate to the delicate blood vessel network in the lungs (pulmonary edema). You generally see these kinds of problems in people with high blood pressure and/or heart disease. But the more relevant example is pulmonary edema from kidney failure. (Kidneys not only excrete waste, they also have a large role in water balance)</p>
<p>So why is this relevant?</p>
<p>My guess as to WHY (because the how has already been explained) humans do not simply absorb water is because of pulmonary edema (and possibly kidney damage from high volume clearance). The problem with having the small units of your lungs fill with water is surface tension. As your lungs contract, the water in each tiny unit is drawn to itself electrically. This is not a problem with a little bit of water, but if there was enough to be attracted to itself on the other side of a contracted (relaxed) alveolus (lung unit), then that unit would close, and require exponentially more effort to re-open.</p>
<p>This is why the trope of doctors spanking newborn babies started. Babies have to overcome extreme forces in order to expand their lungs. The lung is the last organ to fully develop and excretes a chemical similar to soap shortly before 'full term' in order to lower the surface tension in the lungs.</p>
<p>The reason the chemical is similar to soap is because one end is non polar (attracted to lipids/fats) on end is polar (attracted to water) these chemicals align along the lung's surface in order to keep the water naturally in the lungs from collapsing them on every exhalation. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading my theory! Happy Monday!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came to say exactly that; too many ELI5 answers are really ELI Post-Doc answers. I've had to work with clients from a very wide range of high tech environments, and I've found that, if you give experts a chance to talk, and you have really good interactive listening skills, almost anything can be explained to a layman. It's the interactive listening part that is key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately our Keratin links are far weaker than the protection provided from a regular Chainmail vest (Which uses far larger iron links), so we are not arrow proof.  </p>
<p>Whilst it does seem like a biological design flaw, you then realize that a chainmail vest cannot regrow links, whilst our skin can, so it's somewhat of a trade off.</p></div>		</li>
