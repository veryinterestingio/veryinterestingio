			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! It must be the coils as there's no water tank. Still amazes me that it manages to heat so much water so quickly but I guess that's the magical age we're living in.</p>
<p>I rent a flat with a really old gas boiler so whilst the pilot light shouldn't go out, it's not uncommon for me to find I'm getting no hot water and it's always the pilot light that's gone out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have an on demand heater. This is how they work. The coil is a heat exchanger. </p>
<p>Current designs turn off the whole unit when not in use. Typically there is a button in the house to start the flame. When water starts flowing the true flame kicks on and heats the coils. </p>
<p>Many USA houses don’t have this design as it’s relatively new, and it also requires a fairly large gas feed. In this design you use significantly more gas per unit time during hot water consumption, but less total gas as you’re not constantly keeping water warm 24/7. Also many USA houses still use radiators and required a reservoir heating system. </p>
<p>My next house will definitely have the on demand heating. It’s more efficient, and you never run out of hot water.  All members of the family can take showers in the same hour and you all get hot water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and they come in tiny electric packages too.</p>
<p>Absolute bitches on the grid, throwing 30kW of load on every time you turn on a hot tap, but for apartment buildings they save a tonne of space... And due how we price electricity (by energy consumed, rather than capacity), are typically cheaper for the user too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two follow up question to this:</p>
<p>I just bought a house with an on demand water heater than runs on gas and it takes FOREVER to heat up. Like, 2 minutes maybe? But once it’s hot you can have hot water forever. </p>
<p>1) Since it can provide hot water forever, it means the heat output is enough to heat water from cold to hot in the time it takes water to flow through the heat exchanger, and I very much doubt the heat exchanger pipes are “two minutes long”. Why does it take so long to heat up? My guess is that there’s a big thermal mass that it heats up so that the temp of the water is fairly moderated, but a thermal mass so big it takes 2 minutes to heat up with that kind of power seems unreasonable. It’s like I’m dumping the amount of energy it would take to boil a few dozen gallons of water just to get started. </p>
<p>2) Is there any way to fool the hot water heater into fully heating up without dumping 2 minutes worth of water down the drain? It seems like there’s some logic built in to the heater so if I request a blip of hot water and then wait for 2 minutes it doesn’t bother heating all the way. Same as if I leave on a trickle of hot water: it never gets hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Call your landlord. Depending on the situation this can be very dangerous. Also I'm sure it goes against whatever renting codes you have in your local jurisdiction. I can name 2 here where I live. Landlord has to provide a means for heat between the winter months. And landlord has to provide a safe residence. If your basement is randomly allowed to fill with natural gas that's a huge safety issue. I can understand a light going out once in a great while. But if it's happening on a regular occasion it would be wise to have it looked into</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats not how it works at all.  the thermocouple regulates gas, if the pilot is not on, then the thermocouple closes the gas valve so no gas is released.  the pilot provides heat to the thermocouple, which turns that heat into electricity to open the valve and allow gas to flow.  If the pilot is off, there is no heat, so the thermocouple can't create power, and the valve can't be held open, so it closes and then no more gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll never forget the first time I saw a professional in a position to absolutely end somebody, go off.   </p>
<p>Scheduled the Gas company to turn on our gas for the first time, which meant they needed to check the thermostat inside the house and I had to be there, and check pilot which meant my land lord at the time had to be there.</p>
<p>[While he was checking the pilot...I had hoped you'd realize a thermostat would not explode!]<br />
While he was checking the pilot I heard a muffled thud, but I wasn't worried. Gas guy comes out silent and visibly livid. Tells me he'll be by my apartment in a moment. I went inside, but I can still hear him chewing the landlord out, was afraid the guy had gone insane.</p>
<p>He was shouting about what he'd tell me later. I guess cheap landlords can install stuff (illegally) on their gas lines that backup the gas and make it cheaper overall, well our landlord had already done that. The gas guy thought there was still a lot of gas left from the last time it was turned on. It had exploded.He shut the gas off to the entire house, the fire department (guys in fire gear at least, sorry I don't know the difference) checked it out later that day, and my landlord sold the building to somebody else soon after.</p>
<p>Our current landlord was very enthusiastic, apparently he paid next to nothing for the house. Then we got our gas back on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've been thinking about getting one since our tank heater is 13 years old and on its last leg. I've read a ton of good things about them, but no personal experience yet.

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few things to remember with going from a tanked to a tankless water heater. That you may need to get a larger gas meter due to the tankless requiring min 100k more BTUs (more gas) than your tanked. Along with a larger gas line ran to it (1/2” to 1”) from the meter. Depending upon the quality of your water, you may need a water softener. And if the power goes out frequently in your area, you won’t have hot water. Compared to with a tanked water heater, so long as you have gas it’s running. </p>
<p>With a tankless, the water will stay hot so long as the hot water tap is open. Depending upon the model you get, it will come with a circulator pump so that the water is always hot when you open your hot water tap. And if you have a large family, it will help in regards to there always being hot water. If it’s just 2-4 people, getting a larger tanked water heater may help. Say going from 40 gallons to 60 gallons, with a recirculating pimp. </p>
<p>Source: gas utility worker and get asked quite a bit about going tankless.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Bullllllllshit. While in theory this <em>could</em> be true under ideal conditions, in reality most of my customers have had their bill go up. (Unlimited hot water = much longer showers)</p>
<p>Also in my area flushing at least once a year isn't really optional, and if you can't do it yourself you will just be falling further behind every year.</p>
<p>Tankless aren't bad, but IMO they aren't the right call for the majority of residential situations.</p></div>		</li>
