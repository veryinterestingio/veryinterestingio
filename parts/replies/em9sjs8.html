			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is the true answer. The crust/surface is not molten because it is cooling by radiating heat into space.</p>
<p>And while you might wonder about the heat from the sun, all that heat radiates off too.</p>
<p>We are at the temp we are at because of all the insulation and heat generation factors saying equilibrium of heat production/conduction and escape makes the surface that temp. temperature gradients are needed for heat to flow via conduction/convection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arguably out of radiation, convection, or contact, radiation is the most critical heat transfer mode to the stability of the current state of the Earth. <em>You can’t convex into a vacuum</em>, so without radiation, the Earth would be more like the core, blown up to the scale of the Earth, maybe with the liquidus boundary moved to accomodate the actual average temperature (tbh; what would the temperature gradient actually be, I don’t know if there would even be liquid magma on the surface, or how much, given you’d first have to take into account the amount of mass of earth that would need to be heated up to equilibrium, and what that equilibrium would be, I’m unsure if it would produce liquid magma over the entire surface of the earth)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, yea, sorry, without radiation out <em>or in</em>, then the temperature of the system shielded from radiation would be stable. Can’t lose through radiation and can’t gain from any source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has the crust been thinner in the past, say 2 billion years ago? Is there a time period, in which the crust was completely absent?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Hadean, the earliest period of earth's history, everything was too hot for plate tectonics to work properly. No large continents could form, and subduction was many times faster than it is today. Since there was almost no continental crust, and since continental crust is 5-10 times thicker than oceanic crust, the crust as a whole would have been thinner then. That probably has less to do with heat flow, however, than the earth's surface being a bajillion degrees.</p></div>		</li>
