			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, that's very helpful.</p>
<p>I always felt it was very unintuitive. I knew that it had something to do with the speed of sound and propagation; but I've never seen it so laid out.  I knew about flow upstream being affected by the downstream, but I never quite connected the dots that it would break down at the speed of sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your detailed explanation, it helped a lot! The idea that the speed which information travels in a medium really makes choked flow more intuitive.</p>
<p>I have another question: I saw a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/QeyAptR" target="_blank">graph</a> that when the flow achieves &gt;Mach 1 in the throat, the mass flow drops. The reason for this is still related to the speed which information travels threw the medium ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, mass flow rate will always be equal to that which is calculated at the throat (the peak of the graph). Follows from basic continuity constraint. What that plot is showing is <em>normalized</em> mass flow, which is a value adjusted for STP conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I didn’t see anything in the initial explanation that I disagreed with I think that it dives a bit deeper than is really needed. And really isn’t necessary until talking more in depth about shocks, sorta like how one can explain gravity without getting into the full equations. So here’s my shot sorry if it insults your intelligence but i don’t know your background:</p>
<p>Flow accelerates in a converging nozzle when below M=1.
Flow accelerates in a diverging nozzle when above M=1.</p>
<p>That means that if the flow somehow got to M=1 before the nozzle started diverging it would have nothing accelerating it. Logically it can’t just reach M=1 and then stay the same speed until it reaches a diverging portion because thatd break the law of conservation of mass since the nozzle is still converging. Logically then the flow always will be 1 at the choke as this is where it is able to accelerate again (unless it never breaks M=1). It’s often described as “thinking ahead” because it works the same as a full sink draining (the water at the top doesn’t know that there’s a nozzle there but the flow is only able to move so fast downstream which controls its movement upstream).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The design of the nozzle is the biggest reason. The area ratio at the exit of the nozzle vs the throat area along with the exit pressure affect the exit velocity/flow rate. I'd have to look up the exact formula in my gas Dynamics reference book from grad school.</p>
<p>Basically, a converging nozzle (starts wide gets narrow) increases flow rate for subsonic flow, but reduces flow rate above M1. The opposite is true for a diverging nozzle (starts small gets wider)</p>
<p>Basically, the flow you're probably familiar with assumes constant density. The density at Sonic velocities is <em>not</em> constant and has to be treated differently resulting in the effect you're asking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other commentor has it right, I just want to add some points in that he didn't touch on.</p>
<p>At the throat of a converging/diverging nozzle, it's easy to tell if the flow is choked (a function of area ratios and inlet conditions). What happens immediately after the throat in the diverging section can actually go one of two ways, depending on the pressure at the exit of the nozzle. </p>
<p>1) If the pressure is low enough at the nozzle exit, the gas will accelerate from the throat. It does this essentially by trading pressure for velocity in the hopes that the gas pressure at the exit will match the back pressure. However, since its supersonic and can't pass information from the exit to the throat, if the pressure at the exit is below a threshold it will always accelerate in the exact same manner out of the throat, and only vary rarely will this result in the gas pressure at the exit matching the exit pressure. The way nature deals with this is shockwaves. If the gas pressure at the exit will be too high/low, a shock wave will form at the appropriate place to prevent this pressure discontinuity. The higher the back pressure, the further up stream in the nozzle the shock will form. If the back pressure gets high enough, we run into option 2.</p>
<p>2) The gas will decelerate from the choked throat. This happens when a normal shock occurs exactly in the throat, because the back pressure is high enough. Any higher back pressure, and I believe you will no longer have choked flow.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You mean that enough pressure, for example, from the combustion chamber of a rocket engine can decrease or increase the velocity in throat ?</p></div>		</li>
