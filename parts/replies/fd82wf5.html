<p>It is usually a pejorative term used by authoritarians and demagogues to imply that there is an organized unelected group of people who control the government, contrary to “the will of the people”. Some sort of secret shadow government that is working against everyone’s interests.</p>

<p>The term actually originates from turkish politics</p>

<p>This podcast (or article if that's your preferred form) does a good job of analyzing it in american politics and how it emerged</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The journey of the term &quot;deep state&quot; to North America is a remarkable one. It didn't fully arrive here until it was borrowed by an obscure Canadian-born academic, Peter Dale Scott, an English professor at the University of California in Berkeley.</p>
<p>Dale Scott was fascinated with the JFK's assassination, the Vietnam War and 9/11, and became convinced that a so-called &quot;deep state&quot; played a determining role in these events. His books soon began finding an eager audience within elements of the emerging alt-right. Dale Scott was a repeat guest on Infowars, hosted by the far-right gadfly, Alex Jones. </p>

<p>This is pretty much bullshit. I'd not believe a word here.</p>
<p>The guy says, CUP declared Turkish Republic. Atatürk(a former member of Cup) did, and before that he had exiled the leaders of CUP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a month ago we had state department employees complaining in testimony to congress that the president was interfering with US Foreign policy. Two days ago it came out the Andrew McCabe leaked information to the press and lied about it to the agents investigating the leaks. Three years ago James Comey leaked memos to a law professor buddy with instructions to give them to the press. A few weeks ago the IG report identified multiple times that the FBI requested warrants to spy on the trump campaign in which they left out key information about the basis for the warrants. In 2017 Reality Winner leaked classified documents to the press because she didn’t like the way the election turned out. There’s a constant stream of articles with statements contradicting official policy that are attributed to “anonymous officials at the whitehouse/fbi/intelligence/dod”.</p>
<p>Widespread or not there are certainly government employees who used/are using their positions to undermine the policy of the duly elected government. It’s not just excuse making.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is the reaction that career civil servants are having to the extraordinary level of bipartisanship that is playing out in American politics today. Many of these departments are starting to feel the pain of brain drain because of the number of career employees that have left due to the politicization of their job. The ones that are left are doing what they think they need to to keep the ship afloat, whether they are right or wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A civil servant's job is to carry out the policies of the elected representatives. If they disagree with those policies then leaving the job is the exact correct thing to do. If they don't quit then they have to implement the policy given, they don't have the authority to implement their own political positions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To address one point, when you say “interfering with US foreign policy”, are you referring to when the President committed a federal crime(s) and breach of ethics in his dealings with the government of Ukraine? Because foreign policy and federal crimes are two seperate things. Want to make sure we’re talking about the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about the fact that government employees said, under oath, that the President was interfering with US foreign policy. The constitution gives the president near total control of foreign policy, the notable area where congress has a part to play being ratification of treaties. A functionary thinking that their agency sets policy is the very definition of deep state.</p></div>		</li>
