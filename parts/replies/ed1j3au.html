			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I appreciate the response, and found it interesting that they do retransmit when needed. It still astounds, and delights me that all this is even possible!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he described isn’t just for satellites... pretty much all digital transmissions happen this way. A packet is sent with a header that describes what’s inside it, followed by the actual data, and then the receiving end sends a confirmation that everything was received, and if not it’s resent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and more specifically TCP/IP is what you just described, which is how most digital communication works. UDP on the other hand doesn't care if the data was sent properly or if it even arrived at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the Voyagers stream live data and that some is lost due to antenna availability on Earth. The choice to stream rather than store data is a result of the probes being way past their prime mission. Also due to their location the data they are collecting doesn't change rapidly so some loss is acceptable. Think of temperature in a large warehouse vs the door to the warehouse. You don't want to miss a door opening but, but if you don't get a temperature update for an hour its OK since it likely barely changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For Earth SOI spacecraft sure. I don't think you can complete the link with NH because the roundtrip transmission time of 30 hours is longer than a day and you've already lost contact with your antenna. Maybe all 3 DSN stations are linked so they handoff the current link to the next but I think you'd need to ask someone who handles deep space comms because I can think of a lot of different ways to make it happen. </p>
<p>I would think the distances are a bit too far to have the normal SC to groundstation links. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The round trip to New Horizons is twelve hours, I think - six each way, or close to it. Calling it a 'conversation' might be a bit of a stretch at those distances, but it comes down to timing and planning. We could send &quot;OK, transmit X data at Y:00 tomorrow&quot; one day, take data the next, and reply &quot;Yup - got that, send more&quot; the day after that - that sort of thing. I don't know any specifics about how we're going to manage New Horizons, but this is generally how we talk to distant spacecraft. And, yes - we can do Deep Space Network handoffs if we need to to extend coverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume that it's a full duplex transmission.  Given that the baud rate is very, very slow NASA could probably transmit that packets ##### are bad and the retransmission of those packets will (I'm guessing) be fed back into the stream long before the entire transmission is complete.</p></div>		</li>
