<p>If you have the ability to count cards you can reduce that edge as low as 45%, but only in ideal situations that rarely exist in US casinos these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/blackjack-strategy-charts/" target="_blank">loads of simulation data to corroborate the effectiveness of &quot;Basic Strategy&quot;</a> but really you're just minimizing your losses, having fun and getting some free drinks and food.</p>
<p>If you wanna try counting cards there are plenty of things to learn, too many to list here.  The first thing I always remind people is that you have to have a very large bankroll to weather the storm, depending on your average bet.  Even if you have a slight advantage the casino has an unlimited bankroll and you may not be able to afford a statistically-improbable 2 month losing streak.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cut the deck deeper.</p>
<p>Stop you from increasing your bet.</p>
<p>Stop you from playing.</p>
<p>The surveillance cameras and floor managers are trained to spot card counters, and it's not that hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people who attempt to count cards aren’t spreading their bets properly, and just end up losing more because they don’t know how to do it correctly.</p>
<p>We welcome and prefer inexperienced card counters more than a player that plays perfect basic strategy.
However, if they learn to do it correctly, we just don’t deal with them at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your thought process is right, but your wording is wrong.   </p>
<p>If you play GTO Blackjack, the casino has about a .5-1.5% edge, or about half a percent, to a full percent. The advantage goes to the casino 51-49, or 50.5 to 49.5.   </p>
<p>If we had a 51% advantage, it would be 75.5% to 24.5% in favor of the house.  </p>

<p>best odds are actually the odds bet that's placed after the come out roll behind your pass line bet. It's the only bet in the casino that pays the actual odds of the outcome and the only bet the casino doesn't have an edge on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm up, I'll drop some long-shot bets (usually hard ways or a yo on the come out) for the dealer for $1. Maybe a field if it pays a proper triple. They appreciate it, and then I get a little bit of the thrill from the long-shot bets. Occasionally they'll ask me to have them just play the line next to me for the $1. I also usually ask them to leave it up when it hits, which they don't mind, and usually keep them up if I'm doing well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I respect for your patience.  </p>
<p>Ill start out that way, then be like... what am I doing here?  If I play the pass line Im really just methodically losing money with very little volatility.  so I can string it out for an hour or 2 maybe, but almost no chance Ill ever walk away up.</p>
<p>At least if I play some stupid bets 1 of 2 things is sure to happen... </p>
<ul>
<li>most likely Ill have a thrilling 20 minutes and walk away broke.  </li>
<li>Or Ill hit it on a few hardways or press a field bet 10 times and walk away with some winnings and a smile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way... seems better than being somewhat bored for an hour and being all but guaranteed to end up broke anyway.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, should mention, the only place I gamble is on a cruise, so I dont feel the need to prolong the entertainment.  If Im tapped out in 20minutes, Ill go hit the lounge or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Playing optimally is boring because you take out any choice. So it’s no different than someone just taking or handing you money randomly. Go play baccarat if you want to do that.</p>
<p>Playing sub-optimally means what you did mattered. It’s way more fun winning when you played it “wrong” — assuming the people around you are your friends and not people who get pissed if you don’t play optimally.</p></div>		</li>

My only response is &quot;look at this beautiful facility, do you think it was built on winners?&quot;. They usually shut up or just mumble shit. I only gamble once or twice a year and I'm going to enjoy losing however I see fit.</p></div>		</li>
