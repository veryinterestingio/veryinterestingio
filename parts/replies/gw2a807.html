Carmichael Krox  have just gone to bed near the town of Fort Knox  and they, by the way, have the finest of clocks  I'm not at all that sure I quite, quite understand  just how the thing works with that one extra hand  But I do know this clock does one very slick trick  It doesn't tick tock  How it goes it tock tick  So with ticks in its tocker and tocks in its ticker  it saves lots of time and the sleepers sleep quicker</p></div>		</li>
