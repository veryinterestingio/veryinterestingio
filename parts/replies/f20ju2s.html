			<div class="markdown"><p>Not much point to it, though.  I’d rather put more stress on my $40 brake pads than my $X,000 transmission.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes I live in a very flat/temperate region and yes I downshift when I drive in mountainous areas.  Sorry for not universalizing my braking perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive a manual - Sorry but how do you downshift in an automatic?? I thought that the point was that you just put it into &quot;drive&quot; and the shifting is automatic with no control over it</p></div>		</li>

<p>Important to note; stalling is not destroying, it merely stops the engine and you can usually just start it back up again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that a good way to visualize an automatic transmissions torque converter is a powered fan blowing at an unpowered fan. The powered fan <em>will</em> spin the unpowered fan, but you could stop it and hold it stopped w/ little impact on the powered one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>great info and just a side question for ya, ive always wondered why a manual car cant be driven starting out in 5th/6th (whichever gear is the final gear) all the time? Why must everyone start at 1 and move incrementally?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can but you’ll likely stall the engine.<br />
Many work trucks don’t use 1st gear unless they are heavily loaded it’s easier to start in 2nd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you techniqually could if you slip the clutch enough.</p>
<p>Think of riding a bike with gear and starting out in the smallest one. It's super hard to peddle and hard on your legs isn't it?</p>
<p>Edit. Smaller gear not bigger.</p></div>		</li>

<p>smallest one is the highest. the big gear close to the spokes is your low gear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hop on a mountain bike. Start off on a flat plane. Have your bike in its highest gear, biggest up front, smallest in the back and start pedaling. It will be extremely difficult. Compare that to using the smallest sprocket up front and largest in the back, where you will start moving very easily, but will quickly be pedaling extremely fast. Those are gear ratios at work. A transmission changes gear ratios for the same outcome. Your legs or your engine only have so much power. Low gear ratios deliver torque and get you moving. High gear ratios deliver high RPMs and low torque that make you go fast.</p></div>		</li>
