<p>i.e. what would you consider a cathode ray tube</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially an electron gun shooting a one-way stream of electrons onto a phosphor surface, wiggled from side to side by an alternating magnetic field, in order to paint a series of dots across the screen.</p>
<p>&quot;One-way&quot; is the essential thing. The electrons always move from the cathode toward the anode, never the opposite. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;The electrons always move from the cathode toward the anode, never the opposite. &quot; It's always the opposite you mean\^\^ It's sacrificial *anode* as electrons leave the anode and bombard the cathode, keeping it from oxidizing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I don't quite get it, but how can one reverse current without reversing voltage? Our physics teacher would compare voltage with a waterfall, so the current always flows from high potential to low potential yielding voltage and thus electricity as it makes the fall. Reversing current but not the voltage sounds a lot like making the current go up the waterfall, or havjng electrons flow from copper to zinc in a galvanic cell.</p>
<p>At least as far as my understanding of electrodynamics goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real answer is that capacitors and inductors can produce a ripple in the voltage that can swing negative, even if the current is still moving forward. It doesn't work in a steady-state system, but it can happen.</p>
<p>Think like a wave on the ocean, where the water goes uphill briefly, then retreats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine an old sewing machine being driven by a single pedal going up and down. As long as you keep oscillating the pedal, the wheel continues to turn in a single direction. Even though the pedal is going up and down, the work continues in a single direction because of how the pedal is coupled to the wheel.</p>
<p>In AC we measure the RMS (root mean square) voltage which is basically an absolute value because the work is done based on difference in potential --which is constantly going up and down like the pedal -- without regard for whether it is a positive or negative value. Indeed many electronics use DC internally and have a bridge circuit that inverts half of the wave and then &quot;flattens&quot; it from a bunch of hills to a constant voltage. That bridge circuit is just like the sewing machine wheel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does that have to do or say about current changing directions without a voltage changing? Even in AC the electrons (current) are moving back and forth in response to the voltage, even if we measure it with an approximation (RMS).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isnt the current still flowing from + to - voltage in that situation? Isn't the only difference that the capacitance or inductance cause a time lag in when the circuit experiences that voltage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a capacitive load, current and voltage are out of phase as with an inductive load. The difference is that in the case of a capacitive load, the current reaches its maximum value before the voltage does. The current waveform leads the voltage waveform, but in an inductive load, the current waveform lags it.</p>
<p>Huh.</p></div>		</li>
