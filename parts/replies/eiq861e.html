<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><del>Not any more. They have install a sabatier system that  convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen to water and  methane. So today it is  methane  that is vented not hydrogen.</del></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: it looks like the system was problematic and not longer in uses. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can use the methane gas for power. Or more exact you would have a net energy loss because energy is needed to converts carbon dioxide and hydrogen to water and methane.  You also need a oxygen to burn it and on ISS that is made from water in a process that consume energy.   Burning it will produce carbon dioxide and removing that is the main idea of the system.  ISS have a lot of power from the solar panels .</p></div>		</li>

<p>Water is 89% oxygen by mass, and much easier and safer to store and handle than high pressure compressed oxygen. The mass of the tank to store that much oxygen as a high pressure gas or the tank plus cryogenic equipment to store it as a liquid would be a lot more than the extra hydrogen needed to just turn it to safe water.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People keep asking this so here are some questions to consider.</p>
<p>Have you ever taken some water somewhere else? Probably.</p>
<p>Have you ever take some oxygen somewhere else? Probably not.</p>
<p>Why? Oxygen is not dense or viscous, it needs to be compressed to a liquid first. That way you can take a lot of it in a small container. This takes a heavy and expensive tank that gets more expensive with the greater range of temperatures you want it to survive and function in. It's also more prone to failures that would damage other things.</p>
<p>Water, on the other hand is already compressed as a liquid and the tank doesn't have to be as fancy. Also, if the tank fails it probably won't be too spectacular.</p>
<p>Lastly, water is useful for multiple jobs on a space station. Oxygen is (mostly) just there to keep the people running so they can run everything else.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>because it's naturally found on earth? i mean that's fairly obvious. you don't need to take something with you that is actively found literally everywhere above land and below the atmosphere</p>
<p>also plenty of people take oxygen somewhere. underwater diving, hospitals, people with breathing problems carry around oxygen tanks all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add what other people have said, if you're flying into space on a rocket, would you rather carry up a bunch of highly explosive cannisters of oxygen, or a tank of water? The water also serves double duty, you can drink it and turn it into oxygen! Oxygen isn't as useful as water.</p></div>		</li>
