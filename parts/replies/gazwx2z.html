			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was looking for when I popped into this thread. If you eat once a day and have been for a while, you'll get hungry right around when you're usually eating that one big meal a day. Same if you're a three squares kinda guy - you'll get hangry morning, noon, and then at dinner time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking about how ghrelin influences hunger was one of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ep6iy7/eli5_how_come_after_not_eating_for_a_while_you/fei4h7r/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">my first comments</a>, and still to this day my highest upvoted one  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A chemical called <a href="https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/ghrelin/" target="_blank">Ghrelin</a> signals to your body that food time is coming up, and that's what makes you feel hungry.  </p>
<p>If your eating routine is all over the place, then the ghrelin won't know the correct time to signal, so it will make you feel hungry more often than it should.  </p>
<p>When you routinely have large gaps between meals, e.g one meal a day at around 23 hour fasted time, your body will adjust to the new food routine after a continued time on it and you wont feel hungry until your new eating window is near.  </p>
<p>If you eat 3 meals a day (7am,12pm, 6pm) then your body, using ghrelin, will tell you that its time to eat at around 6:45am, 11:45am, 5:45pm. If you decide to start fasting and change your eating to 2 meals at 2pm &amp; 7pm, then your body will still be telling you that the original times are food times, so you'll continue to feel hungry around those times, but as your body gets used to the new routine it will start making you hungry around the new times.  </p>
<p>Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APZCfmgzoS0" target="_blank">What I've Learned</a> has a great video on the science of fasting vs eating less</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an answer for people that look at fasting for the end all be all. Basically, when you fast you’re hacking your system into a different schedule, if you you can do that it’s all good for a while. If you go past a certain point that your body can handle it goes bad very fast. If you take certain vitamins while going through that process, you can fast longer without going into “medical attention” mode.</p></div>		</li>
