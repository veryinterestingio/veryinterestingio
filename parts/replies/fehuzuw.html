			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it’s a feasible options for you guys, but when I get this way, which is fairly often, I’ll just smoke some weed. Even if it’s one small puff, within 5 minutes the gag reflex/body rejection goes away and I’m able to enjoy the food I’m trying to eat. Again, not for everyone, but thought I’d throw it out there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can confirm that the few times I've gotten high I was starving as hell</p>
<p>My brother seems to have the same condition though but can and does smoke as much as he wants, and now he says even weed doesn't work and he rebounds hard if he doesn't smoke</p></div>		</li>
