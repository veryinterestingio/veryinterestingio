			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not technically true. The premise is correct, but to say that a computer can compute a complete decision tree of an entire game is not true. There are an estimated 10\^120? potential outcomes of a chess game and even the fastest computers in the world can't even come close to that.  But your point is still valid, it can compute many many many times more than even the best chess grandmasters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna hop in here with some quick and dirty math. First of all, I want to emphasize that I am making many assumptions here, but I think the math will still show that chess is too complex to be fully solved. So here we go.</p>
<p>First of all, 10^120 is called the Shannon number which is a conservative lower bound of the game-tree complexity of chess. I used this number along with the following assumptions:</p>
<pre><code>- A CPU speed of 5 GHz (makes for easier math)
- Each move is processed in a single clock   
  cycle (0.2 nanoseconds)</code></pre>
<p>Based on these numbers, it would take about 9.77^116 seconds, or 3.1^109 years, to determine every possible outcome. Even if you had MILLIONS of these hypothetical CPUs working in parallel, you would be long dead before the computer has determined every possible outcome. </p>
<p>On mobile so sorry for any gross formatting. Also I just want to reiterate that I know I ignored many details (CPU cores, threading, quantum computing, etc.) but I still think these numbers are meaningful in showing how insane chess really is.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, now I finally get to be <em>that</em> guy. My first Reddit gold is for being a fucking nerd. Thanks kind stranger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The time frame for heat death is about 10^100 years so we are going to need a faster processor and we can forget about storing the results as that would require about 10^120 bits so you better hope you are playing the same game at the same time as the multivac is calculating exactly that game! Otherwise you'd ask the multivac the best possible move and it would be like: I went over that game 49 billion years ago, sorry! Try play one I will calculate tomorrow!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used to have chess on the old Atari 2600 from the 80s. If you selected a high difficulty setting it could take a day or two to calculate its next move as the slow processor was looking further ahead at all possible moves. I never finished a game as it would have taken months to run through. Even at low difficulty settings it still took several minutes to come up with the next move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The computer can't actually look all the way to the end of the game (because the number of possible moves is too large).</p>
<p>For simpler games, this is entirely possible.  Doing this is often called &quot;solving&quot; a game.  Chess has been &quot;solved&quot; only for very simplified board states.</p>
<p>What computers do is play out every possible combination of moves some distance ahead, and then rates each of the possible board states afterward, and assigns effectively a probability of winning from that state based on some formula.  (Like how many pieces of each color is left, how many pieces are threatened, which pieces are left, etc.)</p>
<p>Humans generally can't beat purpose-built computers anymore, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This answer is false. The amount of states of chess is astronomical, meaning that a computer can't within feasible time iterate over all states. It uses heuristics instead. It certainly doesn't check &quot;all&quot; potential moves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't have to.  They can pre-calculate known-winnable and known-unwinnable states.  Then, they can stop iterating when they reach a known state.  They don't have to pre-calculate all <em>possible</em> states, because they can focus any trees that can be forced to lead to a known-win state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

<p>No they can't. The only pre calculate known winnable and known unwinnable states <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endgame_tablebase#Computer_chess" target="_blank">are those of the last 7 pieces on the board.</a>  That database is 17 terabyte big. The one for 8 pieces has not been calculate yet and is estimated to require one petabyte of storage space. That's a 125 8 TB hard drives.  </p>
<p>If you want to pre calculate the entire chess game you are going to need quite a speed up in processing power as the ones we have now would not even be at 80% before the heath dead of the universe occurse.  </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah but that gape in between is absolutely immens. We are starting with 32 pieces, until we are left with only 7 we don't have such database.  </p>
<p>So chess playing computer program's don't use pre calculated databases in the beginning, except for opening books but those are not databases that contain known winnable and known unwinnable states like tablebases. </p>
<p>After a chess program runs out of opening book moves (most opening books are maybe 20 moves or so deep and as soon as somebody deviates from those exact 20 moves the computer is out of the book.  it will start to do calculations. It tries out all possible moves and does an evaluation after every possible move, calculating to see if maybe the computer now has more points, or certain other soft rules (never certainties). In this it's limited to an event horizon. It can not see beyond a certain dept of moves. And so the computer needs to make choice to not calculate any further in certain directions. But it can never be sure, it can never prove it made the absolute best move.  With chess we just can't know. Sure we can know what a losing move is. But we can never prove that this move wins over another move until there is only 7 pieces left.</p></div>		</li>
