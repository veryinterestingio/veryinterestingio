			<div class="markdown"><p>Some satellite simply use a mass on a long rope.</p>
<p>No need to turn fast, just need to be able to change your rotation speed in non-symmetrical way by having your moment of inertia change &quot;out of phase&quot; with your rotation speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is in jest but this is a good point showing why friction has nothing to do with swivelling in the chair. </p>
<p>If you have a satellite that spins up a reaction wheel (gyro), it starts spinning. It can keep spinning as long as the gyro spins (indefinitely). It can also stop spinning by slowing down the gyro. </p>
<p>So, after half a revolution the satellite puts the breaks on its gyros and stops spinning. It has rotated and conserved angular momentum the whole time. This is <strong>exactly</strong> the same effect that happens in the swivel chair. No contact required.</p>
<p>The reason you can't spin indefinitely is that you can't spin your arms around in a 360 degree motion continuously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just wrong... It has nothing to do with friction. You can rotate yourself in place while floating in zero-g, no friction needed.</p></div>		</li>
