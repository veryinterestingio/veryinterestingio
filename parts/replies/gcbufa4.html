			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting side-note is that these 'wandering stars' are the reason we have seven days in a week. Way back in the mists of time, people noticed their odd behaviour compared to the rest of the stars in the firmament and, it seems, took them to be gods, honouring each with their own day. The 'wanderers' visible with the naked eye are the Sun (Sunday), the Moon (Monday), Mars (Tuesday), Mercury (Wednesday), Jupiter (Thursday), Venus (Friday) and Saturn (Saturday).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also interesting to note that &quot;Monday&quot; has been &quot;Monday&quot; every seven days for longer than there have been months, or days of the month, and despite whatever convention of number years, and despite whatever the local language is. </p>
<p>The days of the week might be the oldest continually used system of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fun fact: the reason why only 4 of those days seem to match is because we actually have a germanic localisation which goes like:</p>
<p>sunna's day, munna's day, tyr's day, wodin's day, thor's day, frigg's day, and saturn's day because apparently they couldn't think of an equivalent for saturn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah; they're super bright. At twilight, planets are all you can see. </p>
<p>Once it's fully dark, the planets are the brightest things in the sky (cept the moon, of course). If you go out every night, it's totally obvious that the brightest 'stars' are moving around from week to week, while none of the dim stars do that.</p></div>		</li>
