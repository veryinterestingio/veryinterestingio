			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read that a lot of the jaw development is predetermined (chewing and use does add to it of course) but the human jaw has changed much faster than a humans teeth. We have teeth made for a larger jaw which leads to over crowding. </p>
<p>It’s not something that makes a huge issue in terms of survivability so there hasn’t been enough selective pressure to breed it out of the population. While it may look “worse”, it typically doesn’t make eating harder and, in many cases, mate selection isn’t really effected either in mild cases so we still have issues with overcrowded teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a dentist. Mandiblular growth is genetically  predetermined. Fractures and disease can disrupt the growth, but in healthy individuals, there is determinate growth. Specialized headgear can be used to help assist the maxilla or mandible with accelerated growth, to correct problems of tooth relationship, but the extent of growth achievable is still predetermined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at the gonions of people with bruxism and tell me that use doesn't affect bone growth. Or, to move away from the jaw for a second, how the skeletons of medieval archers have VASTLY bigger and denser bones on the arm they pulled the drawstring with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mandibular growth is genetically predetermined in the same way height it. Just because your supposed to be 6 feet doesn't mean you will if you don't grow correctly. Everyone on Earth has the genetic ability to grow a strong forward jaw from birth but as you know bone growth is difficult after adolescence. An early life or allergies and mouth breathing will cause bone in the jaw to grow down or not grow at all. An early life of proper breathing and correct muscle usage leads to proper growth of the mandible. No one is born to look like Michael Cera, not even him.</p>
<p>Edit: obviously there are other factors like diet, nutrition, posture</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard from dentist friends that mouth breathing during childhood and teenage years can affect the development of the jpper and lower jaw leading to crooked teeth and all kinds of other dental problems.
Edit: constant mouth breathing not just occasional.</p></div>		</li>
