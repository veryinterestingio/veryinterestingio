			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice answer, just to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antigen tests show the presence of viral proteins, antigens, antibodies are proteins from human body which are created because of antigenes</li>
<li>there is crossreference for different coronaviruses, right now Im working with Ag test which could show positive result if somebody is infected by Sars-cov-1 (SARS disease)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I've been wondering is if we should really have just been calling COVID-19, SARS all along on, because its caused by a variant of the same virus.  So how different are the two diseases really?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The virus is called SARS-COV-2, the resulting disease is COVID19. In popular parlance they've become conflated. SARS and SARS2 are related, but sort of in the way wolves and coyotes are related - for broad stroke purposes they're pretty similar but not so similar they're interchangeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc SARS only damages the respiratory system, while COVID is a more systemic disease which can damage almost all organs (albeit, some of those only as a secondary effect due to other organs being damaged).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this similar to how they develop flu shots every year? Or is it completely different?</p>
<p>Can a new coronavirus/sars disease potentially develop that would be detectable, but “breakthrough” the current vaccines and cause other side effects the current covid strains do not have? For example, the black fungus that is attacking people in India for people with compromised immune systems from Covid-19?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually scientists use a weakened virus to inject into people so the immune system can learn from it. However, most COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vaccines. Which means they use this code to inject into you which is pretty much the shell of the virus. Your immune system still learns from it which is also why people still get symptoms similar to the disease though much less severe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the PCR tests for SARS-CoV 2 are looking for nucleocapsid genes, and not spike protein genes. The spike protein is very susceptible to mutations, because it's the most important part for both infecting host cells and being detected by antibodies. The other important part of this is that if you get tested shortly after being vaccinated, the spike protein genes from the vaccine will not cause a positive PCR test result.  </p>
<p><strong>E:</strong> Spike protein genes, not just the spike protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lab I work in uses a multiplex assay that detects the S gene, N gene and the ORF1ab, which encodes many proteins of the replicase-transcriptase complex. A positive result requires two genes to be present and a Ct of less than 35. Furthermore, “S gene dropout” appears to occur less than 30% of the time, as the S gene has highly conserved regions such as the region responsible for the transmembrane domain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the &quot;s gene dropout&quot; was how some of the covid testing labs first noticed the UK (Kent) variant before it was confirmed by sequencing. Furthermore, once the Kent variant became the wild-type (most common) the s gene re-emergence alerted the laboratories that a new strain was bring transmitted, and has since been confirmed as the Indian variant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It's also common to use multiple targets in the N gene or S gene. Target failure is a known risk, so any equivocal result or target failure reflexes to sequencing. In short, yes the virus can run but it can't hide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a spike <em>protein</em> will never cause a positive PCR test result. But of course many (but not all!) of the vaccines rely on expression in your own cells meaning RNA is made, and that's what the PCR test detects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Initially it was shown that IgG and IgM were present during/after an infection. The concern was how quickly IgG tapered off post infection as that’s your long term antibody. This was before variants were even recognized.</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify, it wasn’t all patients that showed weak IgG post infection, but enough to warrant an accelerated production of a titer/booster shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think covid shots will become an annual shot or do you think it could be done with maybe a few boosters? I've been thinking about how quickly viruses mutate which I believe is why the flu shot is an annual thing and I've been thinking that it might apply here. But I don't really know enough about covid to know if my line of thinking is correct.</p></div>		</li>
