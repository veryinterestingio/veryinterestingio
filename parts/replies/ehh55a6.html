			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question!  This is one of the critical questions we need to address to ensure that we can make cell therapy a reality.  In short, there are at least two ways of accomplishing this. 1) Use an encapsulation device to tuck away the stem cell derived cells and thus protect them from the immune system. 2) Modify proteins on the stem cell derived cells so that the immune system does not recognize them anymore. My group is currently working on both of these approaches. With regards to placement, the good thing about the beta cells is that they are hormone-producing cells. Insulin is a hormone and these are small proteins released from cells, in our case beta cells, that travel through the body via the bloodstream.  Thus, we can place them into different spots of the body and they should still work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome! Thanks for the response. How far along are you all with this research? Have you figured out how to allow bloodflow to the beta cells in the capsule without the immune system attacking? If the cells are no longer recognizable would they be treated like a foreign body and attacked by the immune system? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very insightful questions.  Yes, blood flow to the stem cell derived islets is one of the most critical issues that need to be addressed.  Reduction of oxygen levels, known as hypoxia, compromise beta cells and can lead to their demise and we have been working on this issue for years (mostly in mouse models).  We are actively working with bioengineers at UCSF to address these issues, either by trying to connect the encapsulation device with the body’s blood flow (with Dr. Shuvo Roy’s group) or through the use of sophisticated novel membranes in which one can modify the size of pores so that oxygen and nutrients can pass through the barrier while immune modulators cannot (with Dr. Tejal Desai’s group).  For more in depth information, we put together a review on the topic last year (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590918302340?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590918302340?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590918302340?via%3Dihub</a></a>). Other groups are using different approaches, but it is true that this is a hard nut to crack and the problem has not been solved.  </p>
<p>With regards to the foreign body response, if we can fully cloak the cells by making them unrecognizable to the immune system, they should not be recognized as foreign bodies.  We are in the process of developing humanized mouse models in which we can test these ideas with human stem cell derived beta cells and human immune cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now we are really getting into it!  Yes, in their natural habitat in the islets of Langerhans, within the pancreas, beta cells are close to and interact with their close relatives, glucagon-producing alpha and somatostatin-delta cells.  These are intimate relationships in which one cell can affect the activity of the other.  What we showed in our recent publication is that we indeed generate not just the insulin-producing beta, but also alpha and delta cells (although the latter ones were not as fully developed as the former ones under cell culture conditions).  However, both stem cell derived alpha and delta cells appear to mature once we transplant them together with the stem cell derived beta cells into a surrogate mouse model.  In other words, we believe that the cell clusters we generate from stem cells will recapitulate many of the normal interactions between the different hormone-producing cells we have in our body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the linked article, it looked like they were able to produce all three cell types, so the alpha cells will be there right next to the others!</p>
<p>Edit: in mice, at least!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, making cells that can transform into cancer cells invisible to the immune system would indeed be a problem.  Having said this, the danger of having a cancer cell form from transplanted stem cell derived beta cells decreases tremendously the closer we get to the fully matured beta cell we have in our bodies.  We know this because we have been performing transplantation of cadaveric islets for decades now and these cells appear to be safe.  Thus, if we can generate cells that are the exact replicas of our cells we have in our bodies, we should be safe.  The problem, of course, lies in the assumption that we will be able to differentiate all of the stem cells to this mature and safe state.  Also, we need to transplant hundreds of millions of these cells and therefore the differentiation procedure has to be very efficient.  Finally, I should add that we likely will have to add so called ‘suicide’ genes to the stem cell derived beta cells.  What this means is that in the case that they might turn into cancer, we would be able to trigger their demise.  All of these questions and concerns need to be addressed before one could transplant cells without an encapsulating device that prevents them from entering the rest of body.</p></div>		</li>
