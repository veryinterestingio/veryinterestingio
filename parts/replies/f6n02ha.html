			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I wonder about some cold-blooded animals. Crocodiles for example seem perfectly content to stay in place all day and move only to catch prey. </p>
<p>Anyone who owns an aquarium though can probably attest that fish get bored, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My knowledge of lizards is four species.</p>
<p>Iguana - totally get bored.</p>
<p>Bearded Dragons - sometimes  get bored, not so much</p>
<p>Saharan Uromastyx - don't get bored as much as some really want attention and are giant beggers</p>
<p>Colombian Tegu - Get bored</p>
<p>Crocodylinae are ambush predators so they are  probably happy as  a clam waiting and watching</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snakes and crocodiles spend a lot of their time resting compared to mammals, but they do need enrichment to stay healthy and stimulated.  In a boring environment they will grow lethargic and can develop health problems like obesity.</p>
<p>Crocodiles are actually quite intelligent and exhibit play behavior, both with objects in their environment (tossing or moving them around) and other crocodiles.  They will also ride water currents for fun.</p>
<p>Snakes are not known for playing, but they do like to investigate interesting objects (and smells!) and change their position if there are numerous suitable hiding spots in their enclosure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain freshwater aquarium fish (betta splendens, as an example I'm familiar with), will even display negative behaviors if their environment isn't adequate. The most common ones are &quot;glass surfing&quot; (pacing rapidly along one side of the aquarium) and fin biting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most if not all fish can get &quot;depression&quot; of some sort or another. Fish that generally live alone, like bettas, need an enriching environments like a well-planted tank and like to watch people/things. Social fish like goldfish and schooling fish like tetras also need an appropriate environment, and they can very literally die of loneliness if they aren't kept with fishy friends of the same species. (School sizes vary by species.) Keeping totally random fish without considering social needs and schooling behaviours causes behaviour problems like aggression and nipping, stress, and ultimately a shorter lifespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every response I've seen has had to do with animals which are in captivity or domesticated. Does this occur with wild animals? Common sense would seem to suggest that boredom comes with free time and wild animals are too busy surviving to have free time</p></div>		</li>
