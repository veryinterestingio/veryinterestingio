			<div class="markdown"><p>I for one have never been mad enough to bare my teeth and I don't think I've ever seen this happen either.  I keep seeing this in this thread.  Am I the only one who can't relate and can't even imagine a human baring their teeth in anger without laughing hysterically at the mental image?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are imagining something very specific for baring teeth and that’s why it’s not working in your head. </p>
<p>Literally just google “anger expression” or “angry man.” Or, imagine any scene of Hugh Jackman as wolverine where he’s angry about something. There’s a lot of teeth involved. Clenched jaw, or open mouthed shouting.</p>
<p>Edit: googling “hugh jackman wolverine” has some good examples here and there, googling “Incredible Hulk” is basically ALL examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also imagine someone literally screaming in your face. For me drill instructors come to mind, but pick your poison. Compare that to gorilla's screaming in each other's faces, and there you have it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do wonder, though. Both Wolverine and the Hulk are very animalistic characters. Can't be a coincidence they make very... dunno, feral expressions to show anger?  </p>
<p>This is not to say humans don't show anger with teeth, we do. But maybe modern humans show anger differently when we're about to get into a fight than when, dunno, someone stole our sandwich from a fridge?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe you don't, but the jerk that picked on me in high school learned that they hurt when used in such a way against you.</p></div>		</li>
