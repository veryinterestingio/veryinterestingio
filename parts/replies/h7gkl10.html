			<div class="markdown"><p>Complement pathway activation is a major issue with certain types of biomaterials - notably those that interact with blood (vascular grafts, catheters, stents, hemodialysis and bypass equipment). The concern is that complement activation leads to thrombosis which is why we often anticoagulate these patients. There is some research suggesting complement activation occurs to a lesser degree in prosthetics like joint replacements.</p>
