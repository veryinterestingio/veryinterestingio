			<div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered that myself.</p>
<p>A quick google showed me that whereas, chemically, fluorine as an oxidizer with H+ creates more energy, it is not as efficient of a reaction overall and has some major complications. </p>
<p>This guy can explain it 100x better that I can.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_hexafluoride" target="_blank">Platinum hexaflouride</a> is the first thing that comes to mind for me.  It's such a powerful oxidizer that it can oxidize oxygen itself.  It's also powerful enough to oxidize xenon.  We used to think noble gasses like xenon couldn't react with anything, and this compound proved that wrong.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparantly we've known Xenon could react with stuff for nearly 100 years.  Thanks Wikipedia.</p></div>		</li>

<p>John Drury Clark on chlorine trifluoride - “It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that's the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water—with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals—steel, copper, aluminum, etc.—because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride that protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminum keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't fluorine also be much heavier to carry? I mean, aside from the atomic weight of the fluorine itself, wouldn't you need double the number of fluorine atoms compared to oxygen due to the valence electrons to get the same amount of reaction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Derek Lowe wrote about chlorine trifluoride in his blog under the heading of <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/category/things-i-wont-work-with" target="_blank">&quot;Things I Won't Work With&quot;</a> -- all of those posts are fascinating!</p>
<p>The entry for chlorine trifluoride is titled <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/02/26/sand_wont_save_you_this_time" target="_blank">&quot;Sand Won't Save You This Time&quot;</a> and is (to me at least) a fascinating warning about the lengths we were willing to go to while learning to build rockets and racing to beat the Soviet Union. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a report from the early 1950s (in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060318221608/http://www.airproducts.com/nr/rdonlyres/8479ed55-2170-4651-a3d4-223b2957a9f3/0/safetygram39.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF</a>) of a one-ton spill of the stuff. It burned its way through a foot of concrete floor and chewed up another meter of sand and gravel beneath, completing a day that I’m sure no one involved ever forgot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, one of the byproducts of chlorine trifluorite + water is hydrofluoric acid which, while sounding like it's something that'll dissolve people like a scene from Who Framed Roger Rabbit isn't actually <em>that</em> &quot;strong&quot; of an acid... but it's neurotoxic, so if you get it on you there's a good chance it'll destroy your nerves before you feel it burning you!  (Fun!)  And God forbid you get it in your lungs.</p>
<p>Lowe also quotes from <a href="http://www.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pdf" target="_blank">John Clark's book <em>Ignition</em></a> which provides this sobering view. (The book is a rather... <em>dry</em>... read.  Clark earned his living as a chemist, not a writer.)</p>

<p>Based upon your quote, I’m adding this to my reading list. Seems like a great nonfiction for someone with a casual interest in combustion engineering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of Preserverance Mars Rover's most exciting experiments is MOXIE, the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE). ISRU is In Situ Resource Utilization. The experiment will attempt to utilize existing carbon dioxide in the Martian atomsphere and produce pure Oxygen, which can be used for both breathability and as an oxidizer for rocket fuel.</p>
<p>As a proof of concept, if this works, a large scale version could be dropped off on the surface of Mars as part of staging an ascent vehicle, which could liftoff from the surface as part of a human exploration return trip.</p></div>		</li>
