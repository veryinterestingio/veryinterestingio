			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it's an extremely common technique in all advertising. Just watch the Superbowl next week. Most ads are 90% bad joke, 10% product at the end. That build up is just there to grab your attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be that they (rightfully) don't have much confidence in their ability to sell the product based purely on its gameplay. Especially in the case when it's a style of game that is oversaturated with clones.</p>
<p>So instead of showing you pradictable gameplay that you've seen a thousand times before, they show you something else that they hope will actually catch your attention. Then once you click on the ad maybe you'll download it thinking that &quot;surely that bit of gameplay that I played will be part of the game somewhere&quot;.</p>
<p>At that point they've gotten what they wanted. You're playing their game, even if it's not the game you thought it was. Even if only a small fraction of people download the game based on the false gameplay, that's a win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god I’ve downloaded so many games where in the ad it looked cool and then it turned out to be like a “build your own farm/island/mall” type games.
It’s so terrible. I honestly hate it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is why is it so hard to make a game that is fixing stuff?  Because I actually kinda wanna play that game but I tried twice following ads I've given up.</p>
<p>Now I see the puzzle ones where you move gates to free sheep or something.  I think it looks fun but I doubt the game will have the fun parts so I'm not playing.</p></div>		</li>
