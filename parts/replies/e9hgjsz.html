			<div class="markdown"><p>The size of the cut would be larger proportional to the speed. As the comments above say, the blade has a capacitance that changes once it gets in contact with a conductor, like your finger. This capacitance is measured at maybe a 10kHz, or 10,000 times a second, realistically (this sensing equipment can get expensive the faster it samples). Moving your finger at 1m/s will result in a cut size of 1/10000 = 0.1mm vs a cut size of 1mm for a speed of 10m/s. 10m/s is the speed you can expect to be falling if you're falling from standstill for 1 second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that different parts of your skin have more or less electrical resistance than others.</p>
<p>Im not sure that the threshold of these saw-stops are set to, but if the resistance is high enough to avoid accidentally engaging from wood that still might have a little bit of moisture, chances are you might do more damage touching a certain part of your skin to the saw than others.</p>
<p>Im just speculating but I imagine touching a dry part of your hand would do more damage to you, than touching a softer part of skin, say further up the arm. Hot dogs have a lot of moisture in them. I wonder how a dry cured salami might fare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Resistance and skin moisture should have very little if anything to do with it, afaik. I'm no electronic engineer, but you may not even need to be touching, as the capacitance change can be triggered by being very close to the blade (like 0.01mm). The mechanism does not require that a circuit be completed. Your cellphone screen works in exactly the same way to sense touching as these blades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other time factors, like how long does the system take to trigger once the capacitance change is detected? it may measure 10,000 times a second but take a few ms for the mechanism to fire. Also some skin is more delicate than other skin, Thicker skin might hold off long enough to get away without as deep a cut. There is also different forces to calculate, it does bot only boil down to speed. But this is ELI5,  thus your explanation is probably thorough enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I didn't take that into account, thanks. The mechanics that control the switch engaging the stop will add time. I actually wonder how they did it, so that it's so quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It needs to be born in mind falling on a sawblade, even as it stops, is likely to result in a deeper than 1mm cut because you will be chopping yourself on the blade. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone posted a video above of what happened when someone's finger hit one at the speed you'd normally work at, and whilst they had a bad cut it was one that you only need a plaster for.</p>
<p>If you slammed your hand on the blade then you'd be risking tendon damage which might be permanent, but you'd still have your hand (barring long term loss of function).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I set one off once (was finishing a project after not sleeping for a couple days, just lost focus and got too close to the blade). Was a pretty nasty cut but I'm thankful to still have all my fingers. </p></div>		</li>
