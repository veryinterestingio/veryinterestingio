			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Work in banking operations for transaction processing. 95% of transactions go through the automated system without a hitch, but we have to manual check the other 5% that are flagged by the system. About 70% of the time those transactions were flagged in error and we can just check them and push them through. For the other 30%, they may have been set up incorrectly in some way which kicks things out and may result in the customer receiving the wrong amount, wrong currency, be taxed the wrong percentage (or not taxed at all)... A lot more of the banking transactions system is more manual than people think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, batch runs may be frequent, but so are the breaks that occur.
And also, batch runs involve huge amounts of data, which takes time to process even by powerful computers. These all add up to the delay. </p>
<p>On the breaks - It can be for something as simple as a wrong number format, or date format, and some poor soul has to then spend time troubleshooting and investigating what went wrong. But in most cases, it takes just 1 day for ops to clear it. The 3 business days stated is just for buffer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what the &quot;batch&quot; part means: They wait until the end of the day so that all the transactions come in, then they process it all at once.</p>
<p>At work, I've got an automated process that kicks off every night at 7. It looks over a whole bunch of databases and fixes some stuff. Could totally run it all day but that might make things slower during the day.</p>
<p>Now the reason the banks and stuff still do it in batches is: they used to do it that way and haven't changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, also, the clearinghouses essentially pause all bank to bank transactions for 4 hours a day so they can do reconciliation. The entire system is propped up on batches, so even if individually banks do everything in real time, they still need to support processes from third parties that aren’t.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_clearing_house#Existing_systems" target="_blank">pretty much the whole world uses some variety of ACH</a> in order to perform wire transfers. </p>
<p>A lot of time, your financial institutions will make it appear as if the ACH transfer has already gone through even though it hasn't, so that's one possible source of confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The EU now has a scheme allowing instant payments. It's not handled through a traditional ACH but through the systems established to link central banks together when the Euro was introduced - and you can't get anything more full and final than a payment into a reserve account at a central bank.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some do, some don't. It's a bit weird. If my friend sends me money via direct bank transfer, it'll usually appear within minutes. Some things such as payments in shops etc can take up to a few days to process, I believe it's down to when the creditor's system actually requests the money. Cheques still take days to clear for some reason.</p>
<p>No idea whether it's a system level issue or whether it's due to the internal processes of various banks and companies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I pay contact-less under the limit that requires PIN, it takes a couple of hours or days (I think that is because it doesn't actually use the internet, it just pools all the transactions and then process them simultaneously), but if I pay by putting my card in the terminal, or contact-less but over the PIN limit (i.e. in both cases I use my PIN to confirm), it is processed immediately over the internet and appears on my account history right away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Netherlands transfers are instant. I have accounts with 2 different banks, and have both their apps on my phone. When I transfer money from my account at bank A to my account at bank B, I actually get a push notification from bank B letting me know money was deposited into my account while the app for bank A is still loading the ‘transaction complete’ screen. It’s literally instant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>true all over the world. I've seen romanian, japanese, german and, most of all, british banking internals - they are all batch based. Even on newer systems, everything is batched at the end of the day. When you are a data engineer working with current accounts, you are always viewing a snapshot of a day in sql server manager or some SAP stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>British faster payments are often instant, often batched (max 2hr) between and within banks. Standing orders (regular schedules push payments) could be done on the correct day, but are delayed in case the odd bank doesn't want to receive money at the weekend or a bank holiday.</p>
<p>Even international transfers are faster than the American excuse for a banking system.</p></div>		</li>
