			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct answer.</p>
<p>Also i’d like to add that 50x100mm timber product is usually cut to 52x102mm in the sawmills! Kilning shrinks the timber about 4% in total, depends on wood specie. But that doesnt matter for the customer.</p>
<p>Old inch measurements are from 17th or 18th century or prolly older and it has travelled all the way to our present and it is very hard to get rid off that since old habits never die.</p>
<p>Northern europe vendors actually put raw cut first and actual size next. Like 50x100 / 45x95 and what specs it has. Oceania they just put the raw cut size plus specs and dunno how they make it in states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s easier to manufacture plywood to an exact size than using unfinished wood. Sheet materials are usually within 0.25mm at worst. </p>
<p>With timber, you can get different dimensions on the same piece if you measure it at different times especially if its warm and humid one day then the weather goes cold in the same week. Warping is also a huge problem especially for longer lengths.</p></div>		</li>
