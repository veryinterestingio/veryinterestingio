			<div class="markdown"><p>rather than being localised in defined bonding locations, the valence electrons are instead delocalised in a &quot;sea&quot; of valence electrons that surround and traverse the entire lattice structure. The text book picture is a lattice of cations in a sea of valence electrons.</p>
<p>I kinda think of it as grapes (atoms) suspended in jello (the electron sea). It's why metals can conduct electricity - the electrons can just go anywhere they like and charge is free to move.</p>
<p>Though I will say the more accurate explanation is you have a bunch of orbitals all of very very very similar energy making it easy for electrons to &quot;jump&quot; from the valence band to the empty conduction band (an excited state), which traverses effectively the whole lattice</p></div>		</li>
