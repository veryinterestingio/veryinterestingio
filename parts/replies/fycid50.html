<p>Have you tried breathing cold air in hot weather ? Is it a thing ? </p>

<p>You don't have to breathe in hot bath or shower water. The air is still decent.  </p>
<p>But take a hot shower with the fan off and the room sealed up, the weather will get pretty bad in there.  </p>
<p>Conversely, if you stand outside in 95F degree heat, but wear a rebreather with a hose going inside to 65F degree AC, or just stick your f</p>

<p>Don't agree.   Steam-baths are things, and people seem to enjoy them.</p></div>		</li>
