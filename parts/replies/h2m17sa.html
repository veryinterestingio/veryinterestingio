			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think of it as the main baby breathing problems virus you'll have the idea. We mostly dont talk about the virus because the condition it causes (they vary, but viral wheeze, infective exacerbation of asthma, bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia are the main ones) is the more relevant info and those conditions can be caused by other viruses as well. Its the main culprit for these conditions in the under 3s or so, and causes most of the winter surge in admissions to hospitals and ICUs for babies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea definitely by this fall/ winter I predict RSV cases will be spiking again now that a lot of the covid precautions are being lifted. Not to mention I wonder if covid babies have less developed immune systems because of the covid precautions. Many were probably not exposed to the usual germs/bacteria/virus they would have been, if that makes sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Covid has significantly lowered the amount of hospitalized kids. The peds inpatient unit was so empty during covid they combined it with the peds ICU for staffing reasons. On my rotations thete, a majority of kids were in for viral exacerbations of asthma or reactive airway disease.</p></div>		</li>
