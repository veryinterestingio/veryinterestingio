			<div class="markdown"><p>It did at first, and the Apollo One had a fire problem because of it.    </p>
<p>When in space the plan was to lower the pressure so the astronaut's lungs wouldn't be able to accept as much atmosphere (read Oxygen gas), and would be able to pull out just as much as if it were a mix like on earth. Because of the explosion they have changed the system to produce similar amounts of Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide as would be found on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the Apollo missions used pure O2 in space. The redesign after Apollo 1 made it so they were using a mixed gas environment on the launch pad that was vented and replaced with pure O2 at partial pressure in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It did, but at 16.7 psi, which is greater than the pressure found at sea level.  They did this to test the pressure of the capsule on its own (&quot;plugs out&quot;), but at much greater pressure than would ever be experienced in space (I believe it was 5psi).  Because of 100% oxygen combined with the really high pressure. the spark instantly ignited and burned of control. </p>
<p>For all future Apollo flights, they pressurized the cabin with nitrogen and oxygen at sea level, and then bled off the nitrogen as they reached space to 100% pure oxygen at a much lower pressure. This was one of the challenges for the Apollo-Soyuz flight where only one hatch could be open at a time because Soyuz was using mixed gasses while Apollo was still using pure oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was designed to operate at higher than atmospheric pressure for safety reasons. The spacecraft was carrying hydrazine and other stuff you really don't want to be breathing. Running at higher than atmospheric pressure meant that any small leaks in the capsule would lead to oxygen leaking out rather than any of that nasty stuff getting in.</p></div>		</li>
