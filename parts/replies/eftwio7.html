<p>In order to run maximally clean and fuel-efficient, getting maximum thermodynamic efficiency out of your fuel, as well as ensuring complete combustion, you want to burn it lean, and as hot as possible.</p>
<p>... which happens to also be how you turn N2 and O2 from the air into various nasty NOx compounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pff easy, compress air at the intake, separate N2 and O2 by distillation inject pure O2 in the engine, and bam, efficient combustion with no NOx. Wait what do you mean the overall efficiency is shit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha -- that's even more insane than my proposal to run a closed-loop combustion cycle with argon and CO2 extraction on the recirculation.</p>
<p>Honestly, you could probably get passable efficiency with that method though -- if you use a centrifugal turboexpander on the cold end, and a decent counterflow heat exchanger arrangement, you wouldn't have to pay terribly much more than the entropic cost of separating the two components.  Plus, you could run it even hotter off of the pure oxygen.  That might require you to make the engine out of a more esoteric material, like an Inconel, though.</p>
<p>So we might be able to get away with only adding a huge amount of weight, volume, and expense, while retaining a decent amount of our net thermodynamic efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that diesels burn cooler than their gas counterparts because of their larger compression ratios (more cooling from adiabatic process). </p></div>		</li>
