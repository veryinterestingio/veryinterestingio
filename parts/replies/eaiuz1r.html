			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, Old English had a gender system, but after the Norman conquest the language began to mix with Norman, which had its own gender system. Since the two were completely unrelated (you had words that were feminine in one language and masculine in the other), people eventually stopped using a gender system entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bringing into question just how useful a gendered system is anyway.  After years of studying German I still don't really get what it's good for apart from being just one more thing to pay attention to (and probably mess up) in its various cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly the system is just about the flow of sound rather then &quot;gender&quot; having any meaning. A pretty cool English equivalent principle is A vs An. We use An in cases where A alone would sound weird, French has Le and La for masc/fem and using one or the other will sound better or worse depending on the word used in concert, hence why in some cases you will even use l' instead of either le or la. </p>
<p>Gender systems are mostly used in languages with conjugation, because all the variations in words will sound differently with the various other terms. English of course has dropped a lot of it's former conjugation so there are less cases where one thing or the other sounds off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was more so that the gendered case endings were dropped due to being unstressed, leaving gender unmarked on the noun and on any agreeing adjective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But Old Norse is Germanic (just like English), and Norman isn't. So I'd expect the northern dialects to be &quot;more Germanic&quot; and thus more conservative in that sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Languages change and evolve through time. True old English did have gendered nouns and even complex case systems like German. However through the years languages tend to “simplify”. (depending on your perception) Evidence of this can be seen in studying the other Western Germanic languages closely related to English like Dutch and Frisian. In these languages the gendering of nouns are much simpler than in German. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, I haven’t gone deep into that but the idea as I know it is that old outdated case endings at one point even further back may have been their own words wit my independent meanings. I’d love to learn more about it though but I don’t have a good resource right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m surprised there hasn’t been a boycott of other languages because they are “sexist”. I’m sure there are offended people who would like to change all languages to a genderless one. It sounds ridiculous but If Reddit has proved anything to me it’s that these type of people are out there</p></div>		</li>
