<p>the polarization is circular, superposition of two different linear polarizations</p>

<p>This is just a mathematical choice, a linear polarized photon can just as easily be a superposition of two circularly polarized states.</p>
<p>i.e. the circular polarised state can exist without requiring superposition. It can be treated as two superimposed linear waves if you pass it through a linear polariser but it need not be in a superposition before it interacts with the polariser.</p></div>		</li>
