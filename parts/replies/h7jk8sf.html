			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it’s interesting to think about dust from obliterated comets slowly sinking down into the core over millions of years. I don’t think that’s a full fledged theory though. Earth is a small rocky ball but its insides are chaotic enough it makes a magic magnetic radiation shield ball in space. Imagine what the hell happens inside of Jupiter ! It’s not an easy road to the core</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the meteorite is in an area of immense pressure, wouldn't it be compressed? I imagine pressures needed to make liquid and near-solid hydrogen would crush rocky and metallic meteorites, and assuming that's the case, it would still come down to relative densities</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The temperature and pressure of the passage through the atmosphere would be huge. Meteorites burn up in the earths atmosphere, a similar thing would happen on Jupiter only due to the higher gravity they will be hitting a lot faster. And then once the potential energy has been used up and any remaining pieces are effectively stationary/falling at their terminal velocity the temperature and pressure from the atmosphere above would be enough to have some interesting physical and chemical effects on any remaining rock.</p>
<p>Short answer: They would remain rocks for very long.</p></div>		</li>
