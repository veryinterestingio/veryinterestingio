			<div class="markdown"><p><em>The stigma in regard to mental health issues has improved somewhat in recent years but there is still a lot of it out there.  It comes from lack of understanding that these are indeed brain disorders.  If someone develops clinical depression, this is not something they wanted or could snap from magically just because they are “tough” or want to get over it.  No one would choose to suffer from clinical depression.  It involves detectable brain changes and requires treatment so that people can get better.</em>  </p>
<p><em>The fear of talking about it comes from a time when suffering from a mental illness was attached to shame - as if that was a character flaw.  These disorders are very prevalent and affect about 25% of the general population, so they will be present in most families and many of us will have them.  The more awareness there is among the general public, the better this situation becomes.</em>  </p>
<p><em>Organizations that help educate the general public on symptoms, early diagnosis and treatments available for mental illnesses have done a lot to help overcome the stigma - e.g., NAMI, DBSA, MHA, NIMH, etc.  The fact that many individuals have come public with their struggles has also helped a lot.
