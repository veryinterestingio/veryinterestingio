			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, great information.  I've seen a lot of crazing related to the use of cyanoacrylate adhesives with certain plastics.  I always assumed that it was microscopic cracking, so I learned something new today.  Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When certain types of plastics are stretched too much, they will start to pull apart and form numerous planar voids known as crazes. Although crazes look like microscopic cracks, they are in fact partially filled with a network of tiny fibres made of polymer molecules that have been aligned by the pulling forces. Thanks to these fibres, crazes retain mechanical strength, in contrast to cracks.</p>
<p>Since crazes are only partially filled with plastic, the refractive index inside a craze is lower than that of the bulk material. Light hitting the face of a craze will therefore be reflected back. In most situations, bending a piece of plastic will result in the formation of a very large number of microscopic crazes, all of which reflect light slightly differently from each other. This causes the bent part of the plastic to appear white.</p></div>		</li>
