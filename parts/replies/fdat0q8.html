			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.</p>
<p>Water droplets are small, and have travelled through quite a bit of cooler air by the time they reach the floor of the shower.</p>
<p>Certainly enough to drop a degree or two, which is noticeable by the human body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  It’s been in the air a long time, it’s likely very similar in temperature to the air surrounding it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely it was freezing cold actually, then warmed up on the way down, as the suns thermal energy is absorbed and radiated by the earths surface which gets weaker the further up you go, combining with different gas elements with different heat retention and thinner air pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always think about this when in the shower. It makes sense but then I think about how the streams are much more condensed at the head then they are a few feet away. Wouldn't the higher concentration make a difference as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is it. There is physically more water flowing over you closer to the nozzle because the nozzles diverge. You can test this with variable shower head settings. The same temperature setting feels significantly hotter when it is on the jet setting than when it is in sprinkler mode. This is because more of the water is contacting your skin in a more concentrated area, transferring the heat all at once. Of course, once your skin equalizes in temperature, you won't notice the difference.</p></div>		</li>
