			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not that we don't have the technology or means to build a cold vaccine, it's been researched extensively before. The problem is that the common cold mutates and spreads too quickly (resulting in MANY variations), to make vaccines economically viable. </p>
<p>A common cold vaccine probably won't exist without some big breakthroughs in medicine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmmm where have I heard this sentence recently.  Yeah right, the current Covid-coronavirus does the same :P  Depending which source you trust there are already tens even not hundreds of variants of Covid out there.</p>
<p>And we still got a vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is correct. Yet even if it helps against a subset of the viruses causing the regular cold - would be still a gain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please be careful when presenting information like this.</p>
<p>The &quot;common cold&quot; is not a single disease, but rather a set of different viral infections which are lumped together because they generally have pretty similar symptoms and severities. There are a number of different viruses that can cause the &quot;common cold&quot;. The vast majority of common cold infections are caused by <em>Rhinovirus</em>, and it becomes the typifying virus for what a &quot;common cold&quot; is.</p>
<p>A minority of cases are <em>Coronavirus</em> (which tends to be the more severe colds), with a decent number being <em>Influenza</em> (which, technically would be &quot;the flu&quot;, but when mild its hard to tell the difference).</p>
<p>So, you've got some decent information there, but the common cold is primarily Rhinovirus. The fact that people get colds so often means that for any one of us, there's a good chance that one of the colds we had in the last few years was actually Human Coronavirus, and that's where the Cold/COVID interactions occur.</p>
<p>Any impact that COVID vaccines would have would only likely reduce the severity of a small portion of colds (that 15% or so that are <em>Coronavirus</em>), while it would have no effect at all on the colds caused by <em>Rhinovirus</em>, <em>Adenovirus</em>, or <em>Influenza</em>.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just to make sure that I'm clear about my tone here: I'd have made the same request of the authors of the linked articles. Both main stream media and scientific journals have been making references to Coronavirus using phrases like &quot;other Coronavirus infections (common cold)&quot; or &quot;the common cold Coronaviruses&quot;. These are technically accurate, but give the impression that &quot;common cold&quot; == &quot;Coronavirus&quot;, leading to misconceptions in normal people. It's not even the reader's fault. It's so easy to misread the intentions of the author that you'd practically need to already know the information to parse it correctly. This isn't meant to be a rant against a particular person. I'm just fighting my useless battle to try and clarify the situation.</p></div>		</li>
