			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely correct. There are certain tissues which are disproportionate in regulating and maintaining core body temperature, principally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue" target="_blank">brown adipose tissue</a>. This is fat tissue that is brown by virtue of having far more mitochondria. It is so connected to generating body heat that repeated exposure to cold that challenges your body's ability to keep warm <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49936-x" target="_blank">will increase your body's production of this fat</a> in order to keep warm. This fat is the closest candidate we have to an organ that produces body heat. Your other organs incidentally produce heat, but this organ deliberately produces heat as its fundamental function and by its composition. This fat is not used as storage for energy like other fat; its principal function is the production of heat via all of the mitochondria it hosts. No other organ is comparable to brown fat in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Here's some more recent findings on brown fat and metabolism in adults: <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-brown-fat-improves-metabolism" target="_blank">https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-brown-fat-improves-metabolism</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, we have the hypothalmus which regulates our temperature. The hypothalmus has a set point that keeps our temperature relatively constant by initiating shivering if our temperature drops too low and sweating if our temperature goes too high. The hypothalmus also helps shunt blood from the core to the periphery (or vice versa) as needed to facilitate heating or cooling.</p>
<p>The thyroid gland also plays a role in regulating metabolism and heat generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment should be at the top! While all the other organs and muscles create heat, the hypothalamus controls what your body does to create the energy required to maintain a normal temperature required for homeostasis. What your body does and how it reacts to the environment comes from the brain. The brain is the control center, the rest (cells, organs, muscles) are the workers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And isn’t every muscular movement related to kcal and their consumption? Kcal are literally energy and heat, that’s why you have to keep moving in cold temperatures to avoid hypothermia. Same thing with practically every organ and muscle in your body, you will consume kcal and it’s related to the heat you generate internally and externally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought brown fat was pretty much absent (or only a trace remnant) by the time people grow out of infancy? I might be behind the times though, I learned about it a long time ago as something that keeps babies warm (which is necessary since their volume to surface area is so vastly different than it is in adulthood, they're comparatively terrible at holding onto heat)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have more than previously thought as adults, but it's still miniscule compared to skeletal muscle- 1/500th the mass.  And on PET scans for some people it doesn't even show up. That person is overhyping the role of brown fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown fat barely exists at all in adults. They are overstating. That said, there are a few physiological changes that occur in people with prolonged exposure to cold weather. One I'm aware of is new proteins that get inserted into your cell membranes to help harden them against the cold.</p>
<p>But it's mostly sensory. Once your lizard brain knows this weather is no big deal and won't kill you, it stops being so distressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! It is basically a combination of sensory stimuli (the hypothalamus adjusts the temperature when needed), fat based nutrition and brown fat producing more heat. </p>
<p>Epidemiology is interesting when done properly ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all true but there also has to be more to the equation. Lizards would have roughly the same amount of living cells as a similarly sized bird or mammal, but they do not generate nearly as much heat. They also have much slower metabolisms, which make sense since not heating the body means not using nearly as much energy. But what is it about mammals and birds that causes this increased metabolism and heat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation</a></a> has a lot of good info</p>
<p>Endotherms like humans have a very narrow body temperature range we can survive in, so our metabolisms (as well as cooling responses such as sweating) ramp up and down frequently to meet demand. The loosest understanding I have is that we have lots of processes that rely on specific temperatures to work, proteins denature at the wrong temperature, etc.</p>
<p>Cold blooded Ectotherms are more tolerant of a wider range of temperatures, so less evolutionary 'effort' has been put into said regulation.</p>
<p>To answer the 'more to the equation' part... from the wiki linked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One metabolic activity, in terms of generating heat, that endotherms are able to do is that they possess a larger number of mitochondria per cell than ectotherms, enabling them to generate more heat by increasing the rate at which they metabolize fats and sugars</p>

<p>Interesting. Does that also mean warm blooded animals have stronger muscles?</p></div>		</li>
