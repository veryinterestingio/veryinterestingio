			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, speech therapists use similar techniques to help people with vocal disabilities like stuttering. By using a microphone and earpiece, and slightly delaying the sound to the earpiece, it interrupts the normal feedback loop and causes the brain to slow down and concentrate more on what's being said. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is it forces everyone to slow down and say things precisely. But if you don't have an impediment, this just means trying to talk normally will trip you up (because you're not slowing down) but people who do this for therapy are using it to force themselves to speak slowly and precisely. Hope that explains it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used this effect in World War II to catch men who were dodging the draft by pretending to be deaf.  They had to read a sign out loud with their voices played back on a slight delay.  A deaf person can do it.</p></div>		</li>
