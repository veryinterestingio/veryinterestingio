			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a bit more complicated than that.</p>
<p>The reactivity of Oxygen isn't about it's percentage out of what gas is there. It's about it's Partial Pressure. That is the pressure exerted by just the oxygen in a gas mixture. We find this by multiplying the total pressure of the gas by the the percent that is oxygen. So in our atmosphere the partial pressure of oxygen is found by taking 14.7 psi (atmospheric pressure) * 21% (percent of atmosphere that is oxygen) to get 3 psi. </p>
<p>In flight the capsule was designed to contain a pure oxygen atmosphere at 5 psi. Higher than on earth, but not dramaticaly so. This was done because it allowed for the capsule to be lighter since it only had to hold in 5 psi when in space, not 14.7 psi, and there is less mass in the atmosphere and storage tanks of the capsule. 5 psi of pure oxygen does not present a significant fire risk. It is pretty similar to what you get on the ground in our atmosphere.</p>
<p>The danger arose from what you had to do to get a pure oxygen environment in the capsule.</p>
<p>To push the air out of the capsule and make it a pure oxygen environment they pressurized it to greater than ambient pressure. This was done to 16.7 psi. More than 5 times the normal partial pressure of oxygen.</p>
<p>This is incredibly dangerous. All kinds of things that are normally non-flammable normally will basically explode at these levels of oxygen. Most notably in this case, Velcro.</p>
<p>They had not had an incident using these same procedures for the Mercury and Gemini missions. So they believed it to be safe.</p>
<p>The test that was performed for the Apollo 1 that day involved pressurizing the capsule with pure oxygen using the same procedures as on launch.</p>
<p>If they had found a way to transition to pure oxygen at 5 psi in flight that did not require starting at high pressure pure oxygen, there would be no increase in the risk of a fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the Apollo 1 door opened inward so with the added pressure already keeping it closed and combustion gasses further increasing pressure the poor guys never stood a chance of getting out. Later designs had the door opening outward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your insides basically burn, you oxidize to death because it reacts so aggressively with your cells that it starts to permanently damage them.</p>
<p>Imagine rusting from the inside out.</p>
<p>It’s a slow process but extended exposure to pure oxygen can cause permanent tissue and brain damage.  That’s assuming it wasn’t enough to force you to die of oxygen deprivation because your lungs become so damaged they can no longer allow oxygen into your blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Divers worried about it with elevated pressures and reduced oxygen concentrations, for instance, because the partial pressure is higher.</p>
<p>Flammability depends on both partial pressure and concentration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the solution was to lower the pressure of the craft to 5 psi, lowering the partial pressure of oxygen to reasonable levels?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For apollo, the original plan was to use sea level pressure pure oxygen at launch, and then slowly lower the pressure to 5 psi as the rocket ascended. This reduces stress on the spacecraft from pressure. After Apollo 1, NASA switched to using a mix of nitrogen and oxygen on the ground to prevent fires and then transitioning to 5 psi pure oxygen in space.</p>
<p>The ISS uses an oxygen/nitrogen mix at pretty close to sea level pressure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reduced stress on the spacecraft was only part of the issue. Reduced pressure in spacesuits helps a lot with maneuverability in the suit.</p>
<p>Modern spacesuits still run at reduced pressures. Having the space suits and craft operate at the same pressure, with the same gas mix, would simplify operations.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this was the solution NASA used on Skylab. But on the shuttle and ISS they have used Nitrogen/Oxygen at earth sea level concentrations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it was launched with 60/40 O2/N2- which bled out to pure O2 at 5PSI. The astronauts were at 100% O2 in their suits, of course, and could take off their helmets when they got to orbit without issue.</p></div>		</li>
