			<div class="markdown"><p>Also planetary cooling can cause massive valleys as the skin the the planet/moon stress cracks.</p>
<p>For example... the largest cliff in the solar system is on Miranda(moon  of Uranus) at 20km high. It was made because the water in the moon froze, which expands, splitting the crust apart as it froze(because water expands as it freezes).</p>
<p>Rocky planets do the opposite with cooling. Their crusts shrivel up like an orange skin, as the interior cools and shrinks, causing planet scale mountain ranges to form.</p>
<p>Edit to add... some of the gamma ray bursts we see are due to neutron stars cooling, which causes absolutely staggering outputs of power. As a neutron star cools, it causes very slight(like 1 cm) mountains on the crust. When that crust(under insane gravitational stress) equalizes, it unleashes power that would trigger a mass extinction event from 10 light years out. </p>

<p>Voyager 2 is the only probe that we've ever sent to Uranus so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And of course this is all neglecting large mountains forming via tectonic activity before such activity ceases from cooling of some form or another. There are sections of the surface of Mars which are billions of years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 centimeter.... that's astonishingly, stupidly tall considering that a typical neuron star has like half a trillion G gravity.</p>
<p>That's comparable to a mountain on Earth several million kilometers tall. Something falling 1 cm on a Neutron star should hit at like 100+ km/s.</p></div>		</li>
