			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it’s hard at first to just lay there awake, trying to refrain from looking at a screen or anything. After a while, tho, laying awake gets more and more rare. It’s kinda like building muscle memory for your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the person. I masturbate 15-30min before sleep and fall asleep while watching stuff on the phone. The &quot;bed is for sleeping only&quot; doesn't really affect me.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that I sleep when I'm tired, and I usually am when I go to bed. I sleep 6-7h, it can be difficult to wake up (I am able to, just feels bad) but I'm not tired during the day, so it's fine I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is some truth to it, it’s taking it to an extreme. Plenty of people use their bed for sex and masturbation and sleep perfectly fine. The other ones are very good ideas though.</p></div>		</li>
