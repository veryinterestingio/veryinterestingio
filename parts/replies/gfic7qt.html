			<div class="markdown"><p>Dextrocardia situs inversus totalis, if you want to look it up -- all internal organs mirrored. A gf of mine had it. I didn't believe it at first, I put my ear to her left and to her right and it became obvious. All her other organs too -- a stir indeed when she was X-rayed. Good to know, e.g. placement of electrodes for defibrillation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm going to call him and let him know this info, thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time, situs inversus is caused by a mutation that also affects the structure of cilia and flagella because of a deficient protein. Even though it's not the case for every situs inversus (most of them are doing fine), it can cause respiratory problems, or difficulties for sperm cells to &quot;swim&quot; properly, among others. Search for primary ciliary dyskinesia if you're interested</p></div>		</li>
