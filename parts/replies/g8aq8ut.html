			<div class="markdown"><p>If a seed gets eaten, it passes through the animal and gets deposited in droppings elsewhere, away from the parent plant so that they don't compete for nutrients and light.</p>
<p>Some plants don't bother with this stage and drop to the floor, like grasses, and and some have other seed dispersal mechanisms. Burdocks stick to animal fur, dandelion seeds fly on the wind and coconuts float to distant shores.</p>
<p>Chili peppers are an excellent example because they contain capiscum that deters them from being eaten by mammals (who don't travel far) and allows them to be eaten by birds (who fly a long way and don't feel the effects of spiciness).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically &quot;want to be eaten&quot; is a way of saying that plants that don't effectively spread their seeds are less likely to survive as a species. So over time, the ones that remain are ones with tasty &quot;seed carriers&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The PLANT doesn’t want to be eaten. But it wants its fruit to be eaten. </p>
<p>If you think about everything from a selfish gene perspective it makes sense that the plant itself wants to survive as long as possible to propagate its genes, and produces fruit to propagate its genes.</p></div>		</li>
