			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this chatting in a shared lunchroom at a large research university I used to work at. My department (mood disorders research) shared common space with the weight and eating disorders researchers. One day, as I was heating my lunch I was picking the brain of one of the obesity researchers and she explained that one of the things that makes researching obesity so interesting is that every time scientists manipulate one hormone, the body compensates with other hormones and it’s really good at doing so. That blew my mind. Very interesting stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. There are so many ways that the gut both directly and indirectly interact with our brain. I do believe that our gut flora affect us in ways we don't yet understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short chain fatty acids like butyrate are apparently the main chemical messengers to our bodies and minds that our gut flora is doing good.  Butyrate is made by the digestion of soluble fibers by “good flora”.  Butyrate is also the primary component responsible for the odor of vomit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what's the best way, in your opinion, to boost metabolism?  Are there any natural supplements that actually help with weight loss?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supplement wise I cannot tell you but the best way to 'boost your metabolism' is to obtain muscles. They require 3 times more calories to maintain themselves than fat does so by simply having muscles you actively boost your TDEE.</p>
<p>I'm calorie counting and despite sometimes having things such as: lemon water, protein shakes, green tea, fasting (36-40h usually) nothing actually caused a weight loss bigger than the one anticipated by the caloric deficit created. There were very minor discrepancies but I can't in honesty attribute them to more than food/water still in my system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>..and of course, having muscles makes most people more hungry, because they've got a higher TDEE...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the effect is very small and most likely offset by the mass you are (hopefully) losing. I don’t know of any basal metabolic rate calculator which even tries to estimate based on muscle/fat percentages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure that your thyroid is fine and move a lot. NEAT(non exercise activity thermogenesis) is often underrated. You are burning way less calories when you have pretty much zero activity during your working day in an office job than someone working in a retail job as an example. A bit of cardio won't fix that difference  </p>
<p>Besides that there isn't much significant. At least nothing that doesn't have side effects. Like caffeine, ephedrine etc all have the side effect that they pretty much boost your heart</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't really touch on metabolism so much. But I know from my weight training that having an increased muscle mass helps you to burn more calories at rest, just by being there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but then your body naturally increases hunger to compensate.   I have a hard time imagining any scenario where increased metabolism actually leads to weight loss due to this.</p></div>		</li>
