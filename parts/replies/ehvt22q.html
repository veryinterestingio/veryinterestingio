			<div class="markdown"><p>We could, but more likely we'll move in the direction of treating wastewater using solar / wind energy sources. This is basically <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/public-utilities/sustainability/pure-water-sd" target="_blank">San Diego's plan</a> for increasing local supplies of fresh water. That website doesn't really discuss power sources, but California is aiming towards 100% nonpolluting energy by 2045, so the power will have to come from clean sources.</p>
<p>Orange County (among others) already has vast wastewater recycling operations. They require far less energy than ocean desal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could do that <em>now,</em> but you still need to generate a lot of power. It takes carbon emissions out of the equation but it's still going to cost a lot to implement. It really only makes sense to do it if you have insufficient sources of fresh water, since there's no realistic scenario where purifying dirty fresh water is more costly than desalinating salt water.</p>
<p>Desalination makes more sense in first-world countries with consumption that outpaces their freshwater availability (Florida and California in the U.S., as two examples).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but you're better off with nuclear power. Heat exchangers for core cooling probably get your water halfway there. At that point the problem is what do you do with all the salt?</p></div>		</li>
