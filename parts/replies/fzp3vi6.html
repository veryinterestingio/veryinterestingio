			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point. Is this ever considered by vegans, I wonder? It seems like a technicality, but all definitions related to this means that eating bug eggs is against vegan values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Veganism is usually about not supporting exploitative farming practices. But fruit flies aren't farmed in commercial bananas, they have plenty of other fruits to reproduce in. The bugs don't know or care about it any more than we do. They lay <strong>tons</strong> of eggs just in case a monkey eats them or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most vegans follow the below definition of veganism.  The important part being as far as is possible and practicable.   So if there were a realistic way to avoid the consumption of fruit fly eggs we would, but there isn't a practical way to do so.</p>
<p>A philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many vegans won't eat figs because the reproductive cycle of the fig requires a small wasp to enter the flower and die there.  The wasp's body incorporates into the fig.  Yes, figs have wasps in them.</p></div>		</li>
