			<div class="markdown"><p>F1 isn't the best comparison for consumer vehicles, they are built a lot different and can rev twice as high as most daily drivers. But otherwise, your point stands, engines are way more efficient these days, and even regular 4 bangers are on par with the massive v8s of yesteryear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is almost right.. if you want the ELI 15 answer- it’s not the size of the cylinder though, it’s how much air the piston moves, or “displaces”, during one stroke in the cylinder. Contrary to what most people think, the limit to the amount of air you can take in is what affects the power more so than the amount of fuel. So they more air you can suck in, the more power you can make. So a 2.0L 4 cylinder engine would consume/suck in/use/“displace” 0.5L per cylinder each revolution. But the cylinders themselves are probably much larger than that.</p>
<p><em>BONUS INFO</em>
This is why turbo chargers can make more power. They “pressurize” the air before it goes into the cylinders, which allows you to shove more molecules of air into the same space in the cylinder than would normally “fit” under regular air pressure. And more air = more power. So a turbo charger is a way to sort of artificially “increase” the displacement of your engine, without actually making it bigger, but by forcing extra air into it.</p>
<p>So the same 2.0L 4 cylinder engine above, with a turbo charger running at 2x the regular atmospheric pressure, would theoretically suck in as much air as a naturally aspirated (not turbo) 4.0L engine.</p>
<p>Thanks u/nalc for the clarification</p></div>		</li>

<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>I think what you're confused with is that you need a certain number of air molecules for every fuel molecule to undergo a combustion reaction. You need more air than fuel, and fuel is very dense relative to air, so typically it's your ability to induct air that is more of a limiting factor in your power than your ability to inject fuel. And injecting more fuel without giving it enough air to combust doesn't make any more power, it just makes smoke and soot as the extra fuel combusts in the exhaust system. </p>
<p>But engines that suck in more air are burning more fuel. They aren't 'burning air' which is not chemically possible for them to do. They're inducting more air which allows them to inject correspondingly more fuel</p></div>		</li>

<p>TIL. I have always thought there would be 4 x 1,6l cylinders.</p></div>		</li>
