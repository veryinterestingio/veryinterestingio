			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. One of the hosts of This Week in Virology was saying that the full spike protein encoded by the mRNA vaccines contain something like 20 different epitopes. So even if one of those epitopes is no longer useful because the virus has mutated, the other 19 are still good to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are any of those epitopes present in other viruses? It would be very interesting if this wide pool of &quot;targets&quot; ended up providing other immunities as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, probably not many. It’s designed based on the SARS-CoV2 spike protein and so the epitopes are specific to that. It’s possible some are present in the spike protein of other coronavirus since there’s is some overlap in structure a but I wouldn’t expect there would be enough to get good levels of cross immunity. From what I know it’s not unusual for a vaccine to sometimes have a little cross reactivity for another related virus, but it’s usually not very strong and it’s pretty unpredictable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're talking about is &quot;cross-reactivity&quot; - although this is usually stated in terms of antibody's ability to bind to other viruses rather than similar epitopes. This does occur with vaccines and with antibodies formed from actual infections, although often the effects are weak.  There's been speculation that some existing vaccines might be giving protection from SARS-CoV2 due to cross-reactivity although there's no studies that have been done to explore this that I'm aware of and the topic seems to have lost appeal.</p>
<p>Different antibody/epitope pairings have different degrees of effectiveness in preventing infection and propagation.  Antibodies that have a powerful effect on the virus' ability to infect and/or propagate are called neutralizing antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The question is whether the regulatory authorities would continue to accept the already proven effectiveness and safety in this case - otherwise a new study with tens of thousands of test persons would be necessary. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the vaccine is only <em>less</em> effective due to the mutation, it's unethical to do a placebo/vaccine trial. You need to do an old vaccine/new vaccine trial. Since the old vaccine is still somewhat effective, that will increase the length of the trial or the number of needed participants so that enough people get sick. You need something like 100-200 people to get sick to get statistically significant results.</p></div>		</li>
