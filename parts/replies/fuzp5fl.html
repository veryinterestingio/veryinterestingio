			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer I understood the most. Thinking of infinity not as a group of numbers but as something entirely different in the way that zero is entirely different was the metaphor I needed.</p>
<p>People kept using an example where you divide a number by 2 or something and it kept losing me. Like, yes you have one of those numbers in 0-1, but you have both of them in 0-2, meaning you have more, regardless of how you arbitrarily divide it.</p>
<p>But thinking of infinity as a different concept outside of a series of numbers helped tremendously. Thanks for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still think the other example is still important to have for an intuition. Because the way we define if two sets have the same size is if you can pair up their elements exhaustively. So even if one set is a subset of another, as long as there exists some pairing of elements, they are the same size. This just happens to be a useful definition for mathematicians, and doesn't necessarily represent real world phenomena.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also important. Infinite sets are a purely conceptual thing, and there isn't a perfect intuitive meaning of the word &quot;size&quot;. So mathematicians <em>chose</em> a definition that was useful to them. It doesn't perfectly match up with the normal meaning of the word, so some of the results might feel wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the disconnect is because within mathematics the way to show (i.e. prove) that two sets have the same size (called cardinality) one needs to construct a one-to-one map (bijective function) between the two sets. A one to one map means two things; (1) if two elements from the first set map to the same element of the second set these two elements must be the exact same thing (called injectivity), and (2) for every element in the second set there exists an element in the first set such that your function would transform the element from the first set into the element from the second one (called <del>subjectivity</del> surjectivity). </p>
<p>When a function is both injective and surjective then it is said to be bijective. </p>
<p>So the top comment pointing out the map that takes any element from the first set to a UNIQUE element from the second set via doubling, is really just stating that there exists a bijection between the two sets, and since bijective functions are one-to-one we know they have the same size. </p>
<p>As a point of nuance: the top comment is especially nice since it would be a bit much to first show injectivity and surjectivity for a simple Reddit comment (and perhaps since it's simply much easier to do it this way), the commenter showed that this function has an inverse. Any element in the second set is mapped to a unique element of the first set by halfing it. If you show a function has an inverse then you are by consequence also showing that it is bijective.</p>
<hr />
<p>As an aside, the heart of the comment is getting into uncountable infinity. Simpler infinity is countable infinity such as the natural numbers, {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}, of which sometimes 0 is omitted. Another countably infinite set is the set of integers {0, -1, 1, -2, 2, ...}. It may appear that the set of integers has more elements than the set of natural numbers however there exists a bijection between the two sets so therefore they are the same size. </p>
<p>It's important to note that a bijective function need not be specified by a single rule, such as doubling. If we can create an exhaustive list of pairings ad infimum, it is sufficient. Here send 0 to 0, 1 to 1, 2 to -1, 3 to 2, 4 to -2, and so on, sending the odd natural numbers to the positive integers and the even natural numbers to the negative integers.</p>
<p>These pairings go on without end with an unambiguous pairing of one element from the first set going to exactly one unique element of the second. An inverse clearly exists, as well, and I'm sure it's intuitive. For example what might -5 map to in the natural numbers? It turns out that 10 does it, and no other number. </p>
<p>Now if you're clever perhaps you do notice a rule that precisely sends one element from the natural numbers to the integers, but even if we have two simpler, finite sets, like {1, 6, 14} and {-3, 2, 7}, it's enough to create a bijection by saying arbitrarily that 1 maps to -3, 6 maps to 2, and 14 maps to 7, without specifying a way to calculate that (though one provably exists, I digress).</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks /u/EMU_Emus for pointing out that my phone corrected surjectivity to subjectivity lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides explaining the possibility that an infinity was fundamentally different as a mathematical concept, I really didn’t see any demonstration that 0-1 and 0-2 were the same size of infinity from that comment. You can still easily argue that 0-2 is a larger infinity. Common sense will tell you that there’s a greater range of combinations available in the 0-2 set. </p>
<p>Your comment made me think of it in a more relativistic way. Eg with binary we can code an infinite number of things. Adding a third “thing” doesn’t expand the possibilities—we couldn’t actually create something new with a system of 0, 1, 2 because those numbers are representative and 2 already exists. So from your comment, I can see numbers as relative representations and understand why mathematicians would consider these infinities equal in size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretext, im stoned, but my take is that its not so much about the 0 as it is about the 1. Infinity between 0-1 and 0-2 should be equal because neither ever gets past a certain point. </p>
<p>Example we start with 0.99 in either case(0-1 or 0-2). It goes .991-.999, and then because its infinite, instead of going to 1 we go to .9991, then we go to .9991-9999, then to
.99991, etc. In a 0-1 infinite number scenario like this we will never actually reach 1 and therefore infinite numbers from 0-2 is either equal to infinite numbers from 0-1 or is an imaginary number. Thank you for coming to my TED talk</p></div>		</li>

<p>The closer you get to 0 in the denominator, the closer your value will get to infinity. Dividing ANYthing by 0 actually translates to (+/-) infinity.</p>
<p>it doesn't matter what the value of the numerator is as long as the denominator is incredibly small (a value approximating 0 aka &quot;lim -&gt; 0&quot;). your value will just get closer and closer go to +/- infinity the more your denominator gets to just 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OH! I also felt like I was going crazy. This is an issue of ambiguous reference. I read </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I have an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1, then <em>they</em> are separated by 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I have an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1, then <em>0 and 1</em> are separated by 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it should be </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I have an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1, then <em>each adjacent pair of the infinite numbers</em> are separated by 0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the ambiguous “they” referred to the infinite numbers between 0 and 1, and “they” did not refer to 0 and 1 themselves.</p>
<p>So, the commenter meant to say if there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1, then each of those infinite numbers are separated from their adjacent numbers by 0.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>* note also, though, that some people took issue with saying they were separated by 0, but really there is an infinitesimal difference between those numbers. As someone else said, infinitesimal == 1/infinity =/= 0</p>
<p>So if that’s where you got confused, then my comment probably won’t help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're talking about an uncountably infinite set of numbers, though. So if you take any number in [0, 1], how much larger is the &quot;next&quot; number? </p>
<p>It's impossible to answer that question with any non-zero number, because I can just come back with your delta cut in half to form a smaller &quot;next number&quot;. Ad infinitum. </p>
<p>So we're talking about a difference of essentially 0. Or an infinitesimal amount if you prefer that terminology. </p>
<p>Either way, doubling all the real numbers in [0, 1] leaves you with all the real numbers in [0, 2], with the same infinitesimal (or &quot;0&quot;) gap between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a tricky subject, especially if you haven't taken calculus or aren't familiar with limits, but I'll take a stab at explaining this for you.</p>
<p>Let me first propose a non-mathematical answer. Would you agree with me that if we took 6 dice that each had 6 sides, and lined them up next to each other so the faces were in order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, then there'd be no faces missing between 1 and 2, or between 2 and 3, etc.? That is, would you agree there's no result you could roll on a die that would fit in-between 1 and 2?</p>
<p>Of course, but you'd probably point out that the &quot;difference&quot; between 1 and 2 is 1, so the separation isn't 0. But you'd probably agree with me when I say that there are 0 faces we can roll that go between the 1 face, and the 2 face, right? Hang on to that idea for a moment.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about 0 and 1. Let's say I have 2 numbers that are exactly one after the other, and no numbers can exist between them. My 2nd number is the absolute smallest number that comes after the 1st. You'd agree with me again that there are 0 numbers between number 1 and number 2, right?</p>
<p>But how would we calculate their separation? The same way you did for the dice face! You'd have to subtract them! So you'd say number 2, minus number 1, and you have the separation.</p>
<p>Let's say you do that, and the separation isn't 0, it's some amount greater than 0. Well, if I divide that separation by 2, add that new value to number 1, don't I suddenly have a number that's between number 1 and number 2? And didn't we just agree that we can't do that, because we agreed there are 0 numbers between our 1st and 2nd numbers?</p>
<p>Then the only separation that doesn't violate our original assumption is 0, because there's nothing I can multiply or divide 0 by that makes it smaller. Intuitively, saying the &quot;separation is 0&quot; sounds like you're saying all the numbers are the same. But what it's really saying is &quot;you can't possibly find the next number after a given number, because the change is so small between those two individual numbers as to effectively be 0.&quot;</p>
<p>As for a mathematical answer, to calculate the &quot;separation&quot; between two numbers in the set from 0 to 1 we'd have to calculate the difference between our starting number - let's call that x(n) - and the next number in the set - let's call that x(n+1). That would give us this formula:</p>
<p>x(n+1) - x(n) = separation between two numbers in the set of 0 to 1.</p>
<p>If we use 0 as our first number, the x(n) = 0 so our &quot;separation&quot; is given by:</p>
<p>x(n+1) - x(n) = x(n+1) - 0 = x(n+1)</p>
<p>Let's pause for a moment to think about what x(n+1) could be if we're starting with 0. Well, the next number after 0 can't be 0.1, because you could have a smaller number like 0.01. And It can't be 0.01 because you could have 0.001, and on and on.</p>
<p>To calculate this number, we need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)" target="_blank">concept from calculus called a limit</a>. Basically, if we want to find the next smallest number after 0, we could start with a formula like:</p>
<p>1 / y = x(n+1)</p>
<p>If y is 10, we get 0.1, if y is 100 we get 0.01, if y is 1000 we get 0.001. But what happens if we let y go all the way to infinity? Well, intuitively, we can see that each time we make y bigger, the answer gets smaller. If you were to graph this equation, you'd find that the larger y gets, the closer the solution comes to the 0 line (it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote" target="_blank">forms an asymptote</a>, which technically means it never reaches 0, but it keeps getting closer and closer).</p>
<p>In mathematics, we'd say that if you take the limit of this equation as y goes to infinity, the solution would be 0. That is:</p>
<p>lim (y---&gt;positive infinity) of 1/y = 0</p>
<p>So the &quot;next&quot; number after 0 in the set of 0 to 1 would be 0, and the difference between the x(n+1) and x(n) would be:</p>
<p>x(n+1) - x(n) = 0 - 0 = 0</p>
<p>Intuitively, this makes no sense, but mathematically it does because we have no other way to represent an infinitely small change from 0 to the next number after 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the bijection stuff comes into play because there are different kinds of infinities out there.  When it comes to describing the size of infinite sets, we use bijections to determine if two infinite sets are the same &quot;size&quot; (or &quot;cardinality&quot; if you want to use fancy math jargon)</p>
<p>So because a bijection/mapping exists between the interval [0,1] and the interval [0,2], both intervals are &quot;the same size&quot;.  A bijection/mapping also exists between the set of all natural numbers and the set of all rational numbers (via a process called Cantor's Diagonalization) so we say that both sets are the same size there as well.</p>
<p>However, a bijection/mapping does not exist between the set of all natural numbers and the interval [0,1], so we say that these two sets are not the same size.  Furthermore, it is clear that whenever you try to construct a bijection/mapping between the two sets, even after you exhaust all of the natural numbers you would still have an infinite set of left over numbers from the interval [0,1], so we can further say that the size of the set of all natural numbers is smaller than the size of the interval [0,1].  As such we say that the interval [0,1] is &quot;uncountably infinite&quot;, while the set of all natural numbers is &quot;countably infinite&quot;.  This clearly establishes that &quot;countable infinity&quot; is smaller than &quot;uncountable infinity&quot;.</p>
<p>Mind you this just is just one way of looking at and categorizing infinities from the perspective of the sizes of infinite sets.  You could also look at and categorize infinities from the perspective of the limits of divergent functions.  </p>
<p>As an aside/tangent, there is also a perspective where you DO treat infinity like a number by adding it to the set of real or complex numbers (which we would call the &quot;real projective number line&quot; or the &quot;extended complex plane&quot;). However doing this fundamentally changes the behavior of these numbers such that you must be careful how you do algebraic manipulations with them (you have to be aware of the indeterminate forms like infinity - infinity or infinity / infinity).  This is why we tell students &quot;infinity is not a number&quot;, because life is really just easier that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zero is a bit of a slippery character, though.  It looks like a number, and a lot of things that you can do with other numbers you can also do with zero.  The same can be said of infinity.  But there are certain things you can do with other numbers that if you try to do them with zero don't work, like division.  We think of zero as nice and infinity as not nice because zero has a very small, well defined place on the number line between positive and negative real numbers, and it feels like it should fit neatly with the rest.  The reality, though, is that zero is like a little tiny hole in the number line where if you aren't careful things blow up or slip through or do odd and unexpected things.  Taking advantage of this character lets us to all kinds of useful stuff like calculus, but it's the sort of thing that if you try to think too hard about it will give you a headache.  Easiest just to pretend it's just another number like all the others.</p></div>		</li>
