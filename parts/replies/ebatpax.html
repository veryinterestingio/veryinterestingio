			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. It's simply more likley that the ASSOCIATION between sedentary lifestyle and depression is caused  by the fact that people with depression are less likely to be able to exercise and that's why we see the association in studies. To then assume that the link we seen in sedentary behavior and depression is CAUSED by the sedentary behavior is like doing a study on how many people in wheelchairs can't walk and assuming that wheelchair is causing the inability to walk. It's bad science and it's potentially harmful to tell depressed people that exercise can cure them in the same way that taking away wheelchairs for people who can't walk in attempt to cure them would be harmful to those people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the meta-analysis results, the effect is consistent but not statistically significant when looking at the highest quality data. However, the risks and adjunct benefits of exercise are such that current best practices for patients presenting with clinical depression are to advise them to exercise as part of their therapy when not contraindicated. </p>
