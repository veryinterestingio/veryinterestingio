			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the body is a whole bunch of compromises on conflicting priorities from the demands of the environment and survival, and many of those priorities either no longer apply or can be significantly mitigated so that some of the trade-offs are no longer balanced properly. </p>
<p>That’s why a good chunk of modern medicine consists of finding ways to tell the body to calm down, we’ve got the problem covered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can say that again.</p>
<p>I suffer from an Anxiety/Panic Disorder. Whilst that's not exactly normal, I still wonder why my body feels the need to ever panic to such a degree. </p>
<p>My quality of life would be better if I could completely remove the emotion of &quot;anxiety&quot;. If there's ever a truly life-threatening moment where an intense fight or flight response and a fuckton of adrenaline is required, I'd rather take my reduced chances at surviving. </p>
<p>Besides, what's the average amount of genuinely life-threatening events people encounter in life where the primitive panic response is required? I'd wager low enough that it'd be better to ditch it completely in cases like mine with GAD and PD.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember we had about <strong>[EDIT: whoops, wrong number]</strong> 200,000 years of being anatomically and psychologically modern humans before the first cities appeared, and we've only had 10,000 years where we had any form of &quot;civilization.&quot; Let alone anything even close to resembling modern life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You rarely die from an infection like covid. You die from complications from being infected. Those complications are your bodies immune system attacking covid, AKA sending so much blood and fluid to your lungs, they basically close off and you cant breathe. Putting you on a ventilator only does so much, because your lungs depend on the small tiny little pathways to make the surface area much larger to get as much oxygen as possible. If there is fluid or swelling that limit that, that's a very bad thing</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would say arguably the opposite.  Since natural selection isn't relevant in modern times, people with a horrible reaction to an injury/foreign body vs somebody with a minor one are likely to equally survive.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“We don’t need it” isn’t a good enough cause for losing that trait via evolution. People who have it need to have less kids and people who don’t have it need to have more kids</p>
<p>The only possibilities for why this would happen</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Society breaks down and natural selection becomes relevant again (very unlikely)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We fall in love with eugenics again (unlikely)</p>

<li>Gene therapy allows us to get rid of it (likely)</li>
