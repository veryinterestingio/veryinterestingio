			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the #1 problem I encounter when giving advice to people. It ends up being some flavor of, &quot;That thing you care about? Stop caring about it. Then implementing a solution is trivially easy.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, not only is that easier said than done - people usually find it insulting. Turns out when you tell someone that they need to stop overvaluing something, they tend to infer you UNDERVALUE it. And nobody wants to listen to someone who is saying the problem's all in their head.</p>
<p>Even when it is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know of doctors who have hurt patients by not diagnosing serious disease because the doctors thought the patient was just anxious or depressed and was making up symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've known of many innocent people put away as criminals because a jury of their peers bristled at the suggestion that they were biased.</p>
<p>Sometimes the advisor is minimizing real problems. Sometimes the advisee is creating problems that don't exist. I don't know which fallacy has done more harm to society, TBH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, very much thus, in addition to other insightful comments. I try to emulate the best socratic/psychological direction I've intuited, which is to keep the focus on letting THEM work through it, with you as a sounding board or an anchor in case they veer wildly and don't consider alternate viewpoints.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think I should do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do YOU feel is the real issue?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, (x, y)&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds like (x) and (y) might be related. Have you considered that, or is there anything else that bothers you?&quot;</p>
<p>Stay a bit njeutral, but engaged. Don't assume, ask them to clarify. It feels deflective, but it's really not. Its helping THEM engage with the problem, and its core kernel of pain, rather than fixating on a solution, when there are myriad approaches possible, but fewer personal.</p>
<p>Once they circle in on their core problem and the options that might work best, them you can help guide them to ways to address it. But its a process. Once youve built trust, it takes less time. And for some people, they may have come to you at a late stage with a solution in mind. Ask them if it seems logical and feasible to pursue.</p>
<p>People like working things out themselves better than being directed. But the troubled mind begs for easy solutions and quick fixes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is also why self distancing can be a good strategy to solve your own problems. Self distancing is what it sounds like: ask yourself what advice you'd give to solve your problem if it was your friend who had that problem.</p>

<p>I learned this technique in therapy but didn't know it had a name. It has worked wonders for me.</p></div>		</li>
