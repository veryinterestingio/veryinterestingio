<p>Also, in my county, publishing mugshots is not illegal per se but it opens the publisher to law suites on defamation/slander</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also warmer there year round. Say you lived in Chicago. You would be less likely to... I don't know, throw bleach on someone and throw a noose around their neck in the middle of January because that would require you be milling around outside in extreme cold.</p>
<p>Basically, you can still easily leave the house year round in Florida.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think because some governments have a history of persecution and &quot;rounding people up&quot;. So it was probably changed back when it was very much an issue. Especially places with a past of racism. Australia and Canada with aboriginals, US with minorities. Don't forget Big Brother mother Russia. I'm sure there many examples where the government has rounded up and persecuted people.</p>
<p>Edit: not to confuse, I actually am not sure if we do post arrest photos in Australia, I was adding that to the &quot;governments have done some bad shit&quot; point.</p>
<p>Transparency is often a government response to issues, especially public distrust. Unfortunately like most solutions there's drawbacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this debate quite interesting. </p>
<p>In the US it seems the problem is that people don't trust the government. In the UK we don't trust the media. </p>
<p>Consequently we do not release the name / photo of people until they have been found guilty because we are concerned that they will be found &quot;guilty&quot; by the media before they have had a fair trial. In particular we are concerned that a jury may be unduly influenced if there was a media campaign that deliberately showed an arrestee in a negative light.</p>
<p>One of the most frequent reasons for appeal against a guilty verdict is that the courts decision may have been influenced by leaked negative publicity before the trial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that thinking came before the internet and the court of public opinion <em>of the entire world</em>. Publishing their name is not that much of a problem, because people don't often remember names and names aren't unique. It's publishing the mugshots that are the problem. If someone got disappeared by the government, the family would have photos, so there's no reason at all to be publishing mugshots of arrested people not found guilty. Also, the government would still have the mugshots, but they would not be put in the public domain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t there an entire fucked-up business model out there now because of this transparency, where shady sites harvest all the public images, index them by name, and SEO them to the top of search results. Want potential employers/mates/friends not to see your mugshot the moment they google you? Pay $$$ to the shady site to take it down. Until another shady site does the same thing...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is absolutely true. I believe NPR did an episode on this and people would have to pay something like $100 to remove their image from their site. But there are many many sites and anyone could do that and basically extort you.</p></div>		</li>
