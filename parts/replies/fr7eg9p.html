			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only borrow up to the value of the house. And most banks won’t go to the full 100% value. They like having a buffer in case home values go down. </p>
<p>So if house is worth 200k. First mortgage is 150k and 2nd mortgage is 30k. You owe 180k total. You default and the house gets sold for 180k everyone gets their money back.</p>
<p>Now 2nd mortgages are riskier. Because the 1st lien holder always gets their money first. So In previous example if house if foreclosed and all they can get is 150k then the bank that has the 2nd lien is screwed. </p>
<p>That is why rates on home equities are typically a little higher. And why some bank will give a discount on home equity loans that are in first lien positions. </p>
<p>Did I make it worse for you?  Hard to explain typing.</p></div>		</li>
