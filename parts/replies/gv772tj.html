			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Thanks for your question. Bacteriophage therapy is an innovative way to combat AMR, particularly in bacteria with multidrug-resistance. As some background for anyone interested, phage therapy relies on naturally-occurring bacteriophage --these are viruses which have the ability to bind and lyse specific bacteria. Research is ongoing in terms of the scale and potential scope of phage therapy, but it is definitely an option as we move into alternative therapeutic methods. Here is an excellent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5547374/" target="_blank">review</a> of the history and ongoing research in phage therapy. </p>
<p>One of the advantages of phage therapy is that, in many cases, bacteria have yet to develop resistance to their corresponding bacteriophage. Phage, like bacteria, have the ability to evolve in the face of a selective pressure, and so if/when bacteria evolve to combat their attacking phage, these viruses can also adapt. This is called a “co-evolutionary arms race” – through evolutionary phenomena like natural selection, each player continues to apply pressure to the other, leading to an ongoing evolutionary battle. In this way, phage therapy is good – the likelihood of bacteria evolving resistance to their phage is much lower than to a chemical compound. </p>
<p>One of the disadvantages of phage therapy (which can also be an advantage in certain situations) is their specificity. Many phage have a relatively narrow range of efficacy – they are able to bind to receptors on only certain bacteria. Although this is definitely useful in certain situations where you know exactly which pathogen is causing a debilitating infection, it can be limiting if you aren’t sure which bug is responsible. Some phage can target certain groups of bacteria, and so if you’re relatively certain that an infectious agent falls within a certain species or genus you may be able to use their respective phage. Otherwise, this specificity can make finding the right therapeutic agent difficult. </p>
<p>Another current limiting factor is that we definitely haven’t discovered, cultured, or documented the efficacy of even a fraction of all bacteriophage. As research in this area continues, it’s likely we will find more and more therapeutic phage candidates across a range of bacterial pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the chances a bacteriophage goes rogue?</p>
<p>For example, ends evolving to attack human cells instead?</p>
<p>Or perhaps ends up attacking vital gut microbiome? Maybe resulting in opportunistic bacteria taking over?</p>
<p>Are there treatments like antibiotics that work to kill bacteriophages if the treatment must be stopped?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the listed issues here is the specificity of the phages. Would it be viable to use a sort of cocktail containing many phages hoping one sticks, or is it simply more economic to run a culture and get the specific pathogen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can a phage be approved as a treatment in the west? Their specificity means that a given infection may be susceptible to one particular variety of phage.</p>
<p>A conventional anti bacterial pharmaceutical drug may typically be deployed against a whole family of bacteria so it is easy to test through regular trials.</p></div>		</li>

Strathdee, is a great example of the role phages can play in patient therapy.</p></div>		</li>
