Shouldn't it just evaporate as in the first case without having any effects after?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More water lets the heat conduct away before it can evaporate.  Rather than instantly raising a drop of water to 400F steam that immediately dissipates, you raise a lot of water to 180F and get scalded by it.</p>
<p>Liquid is a much more powerful heat conductor than gas, so you don't want the water to remain liquid.  Counterintuitively, hot steam is a better thermal insulator than cooler-but-still-scalding water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So let me reiterate to see if I got this right, because English isn't my first language.
Essentially, for water to evaporate, it must be heated, but because of its volume it will need take longer to evaporate, during which time it will be heating up more and more, consequently burning your hand.
Did I miss anything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My physics teacher said steam (unpressurized, like a pan on the stove) is actually quite cool, because most of the heat that was in each molecule is &quot;used&quot; converting from liquid to gas. </p>
<p>My attempts to experiment with this over a stove at home have been inconclusive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the reason an oven mitt works is because there's a lot of empty space (full of puffy fabric or multiple layers of woven materials with lots of room for air).  Materials conduct heat better than empty space-- so by 'wetting' the mitt you're filling all that empty space with water which will heat up and transfer heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same reason that you can boil a kettle.  If you took a kettle and stuck your hand in shortly before it boiled, you would get severe burns.   Water is a very good thermal conductor so, if you have a mass of it (a kettle or a soaked glove), it will heat pretty evenly.  As a result, <em>all</em> the water will be close to boiling before a significant amount of it will vaporize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On Mythbusters they tested if you could wet your hand then put it it molten metal. Surprisingly they deemed you should be safe. This makes me think it has more to do with the volume of water and less to do with the size and heat of the pan?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is due to the &quot;Leidenfrost effect&quot; - the molten metal is so hot that the water instantly evaporates, creating a protective layer of steam.  Steam is a poor heat conductor and briefly prevents the metal from burning you.</p>
<p>The same effect helps you with the candle, the flame is quite a bit hotter than an oven and the huge temperature disparity actually helps you by generating insulating steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why you can quickly dunk your hand in liquid nitrogen and be fine. The nitrogen vaporizes, and while it's still very cold, nitrogen gas conducts heat slowly enough that you're fine as long as you don't keep your hand in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't definitively quantify the extent to which the Leidenfrost effect helps protect your fingers (if at all), but I do know you can also do the candle trick with dry fingers which makes me think that trick is mostly in the speed and the relatively poor heat transfer of the wick to your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They very quickly dunked and removed the sausage. It's more about time. Heat transfer, like any other process, takes time. You can quickly slap a 300F (150C) pan bare handed and be basically okay. You can't pull it out of the oven and be okay. Add on to that the steam layer the other person talked about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the pan is not hot enough. On mythbusters just molten lead wasn't enough, they had to heat it even more for the effect to work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m completely blind and I use this trick when I’m cooking sometimes. I’ll run my fingers under the sink for a second, and then I can gently touch stuff on the stove without burning myself. It’s useful to check how brown meat is, flip things that are tricky, etc.</p></div>		</li>
