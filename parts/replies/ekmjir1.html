			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few sources of light that come from around the event horizon. Matter falling into the black hole has a really bad day and starts glowing as it's torn apart.</p>
<p>There are also sources of light behind the black hole and because gravity bends light a black hole acts as a lense for stars and nebulae behind it.</p>
<p>Finally there is Hawking radiation. Matter and corresponding anti matter constantly pop into existence. Almost all the time the pair immediately annihilate each other. At the event horizon however one of the pair's particle takes a trip into the unknown and the other particle manages to exit the pull and travels millions of light years to go splat on our telescopes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;coffee stain&quot; of light we see in the picture is the light being warped around the black hole. The gravity is so immense that some of the is actually from in front if the black hole being warped at a crazy angle.</p></div>		</li>
