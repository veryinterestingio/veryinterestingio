			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer ! Just to clarify one point though: while biologics (mAbs and the like) are now well-established in the pharmaceutical world, I wouldn't say small-molecule drugs are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Surely I'm biased (med chemist here), but small molecules still represent the majority of approved drugs on the market and until we find a replacement for those (and why would we ?), batch synthesis of small organic molecules isn't going anywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, but just a small point. When bacteria take up foreign DNA it's transformation, while transfection refers to the uptake of DNA by eukaryotic cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have a more general question about using bacteria to produce dna:</p>
<p>I understand that with plasmids, the target sequence is often introduced together with an antibiotic resistance gene, which is used to select for successfully transfected bacteria by using a growth medium with said antibiotic.</p>
<p>However, wouldn't the production of the target sequence (even just copying the dna) be an extra &quot;cost&quot; to the cell? Hence, any cell that loses the target sequence (but retains the antibiotic resistance) be fitter and reproduce faster? Hence, how can companies continue to ensure the target gene is being produced in growth vats?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Correct. In the absence of antibiotic selection, non-transfected cells will rapidly out-compete transfected cells.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Also correct, but this is unlikely. You put everything on the same plasmid so the odds of some mutation or replication anomaly causing you to lose your gene of interest (GOI) while keeping the antibiotic resistance cassette is minimal.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is going to be dependent on the application, but we can make some guesses. The classical way is to do RFLP analysis with restriction digests, where your GOI will generate known fragment lengths. This is usually accompanied by sequencing since it's so rapid and cheap nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/spanj said you start from a frozen stock every time, ensuring your starting material is good every time. In practice, there's few enough generations and little enough stress that you're not likely to see a loss of your target gene. But 'probably' isn't good enough, so you would normally add some antibiotic and purify it out later. </p>
<p>The regulatory agencies don't like that anymore though and over the past few years have been pushing back more on any use of antibiotics, so a different method is needed. A current popular method is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxotrophy" target="_blank">auxotrophs</a> and use the knocked out gene as the stabilizer on the plasmid instead of an antibiotic resistance gene. i.e. instead of making it resistant to being killed off and then trying to kill everything, you make it so that it can't grow without the plasmid and you don't have to do any extra work.</p></div>		</li>
