			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV is a totally different animal - it is a DNA retrovirus, and mutates massively every time it reproduces basically. DNA reverse transcriptase is super error prone - like one in 15,000 base pairs (HIV has about ten thousand base pairs, for reference).  So it has a LOT of mutations. Obviously some are not successful, but it’s enough that it makes it very hard to get a successful antibody response. It’s so mutation prone that HIV will mutate in your body -  a person will have many different ‘strains’.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses do mutate but much slower. They are not retroviruses- they don’t modify your DNA.  They just take over the cell machinery (ribosomes etc.) to make copies of themselves. Much less error prone, and it seems like the errors are less likely to cause successful variants - maybe the viral structure is more likely to just get a failed virus. That means the target for the vaccine is much more stable. </p>
<p>That said, though, we’ve never made a good coronavirus vaccine. It is harder than some other kinds of virus for various reasons, and it’s not guaranteed we ever manage to get it right.</p>
<p>It’s also less likely that COVID-19 mutates away because the target is the spike, which is how it connects to the cell and infects it. If that mutates in a significant difference at it’s likely to stop working at infecting cells.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First of all, HIV is an RNA retrovirus (it stores RNA in the virus particle, which the reverse transcriptase processes back into DNA after it has infected the cell). You're correct on the error rate of HIV, but RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (what non-retro RNA viruses like influenza use), has a similar error rate. It's not particularly different. The thing of Coronaviruses is actually that they are different from most RNA viruses as they encode a proofreading enzyme which corrects mistakes after the RNA polymerase does its work, reducing their error rate. This is likely necessary due to their large genome of ~28 thousand base pairs.</p>
<p>To reframe why Influenza changes so often: It has another trick up its sleeve. Its mutation rate is just ballpark RNA viruses (~1/10k basepairs, basically just slow enough so it die out from overmutation instantly), but it is extremely good at recombining its genome when two different influenza viruses infect the same cell. Why? Because where an average RNA virus stores its genome as a single strand of RNA, Influenza's genome is actually built up out of 8 strands of RNA, each carrying a part of the virus genome so all are necessary to actually create an infectuous particle. The virus has some kind of trick to ensure that the average virus particle created actually has the 8 relevant strands in there.</p>
<p>This means that when two different strains of influenza infect the same organism (remember, Influenza is mostly a bird virus), it is possible for virus particles to be created that contain several strands from one strain, and several strands from the other strain, resulting in hybrid genomes that, if effective, could instantly cause a new strain. While recombination does also happen with other virus genomes due to possible RNA transcription mistakes, this is rare compared to the ease at which Influenza does it.</p>
<p>HIV's mutagenicity in comparison is easier to attribute to that it has a looong time to mutate in the same host. Due to the inability of the immune system to get rid of the persistent HIV infection that over the time that it infects the host, it continuously keeps present a small population of virus that reinfect and mutate further. As the virus has been with humans for about century now, as well as being active in the same hosts for years, it has over all HIV genomes present in the world built up a giantic library of genetic diversity. The genetic diversity of HIV in a single person can in fact be larger than the genetic diversity of SARS-COVID-2 over the entire world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've been working on HIV vaccines for a long time, and we aren't there yet.</p>
<p>The problem is, while we can make a vaccine that has our body produce antibodies fairly easily, the antibodies it makes has to be effective at neutralizing the virus, preventing it from creating the infection on the first place. So far, we been able to get broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV.</p>
<p>There are some candidate vaccines that seem to do it now though, and they are being trailed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re asking about Covid19 vaccines being ineffective, I think the ones now are going to work. So far the spike protein is the defining characteristic of the virus (unlikely to mutate) and that’s what those vaccines are targeting. It’s just a matter now of evaluating the delivery mechanism—mRNA vs. Chaddox vs. Ad5 vs. traditional egg-grown cells. And then measuring how long it provides protection for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to chime in that depending on the vaccine design, we may or may not need yearly boosters for coronavirus. Some of the vaccine technologies may provide longer lasting immunity than a viral infection itself, especially those vaccines adjuvanted with an adenoviral carrier. That’s probably my biggest concern with the mRNA and DNA vaccines... they can certainly provoke an antibody response, but the responses may not be durable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You think the adenovirus ones will work better? Obviously you’re more qualified, but it was my understanding that the Oxford vaccine (Adenovirus) was not super effective but the Moderna and Pfizer ones (mRNA) have fared better. But I want to hear from you though, why the adenovirus ones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only data I’ve seen read out is antibody titer. The virus has only been around ~7 months, so we don’t even know how long natural immunity lasts. Coronavirus does not really mutate, so if we can trick the body into remembering to make antibodies, it should be protective. </p>
<p>I’m not sure we have even seen robust human data on antibody levels corresponding to protection, and we don’t know whether it’s an antibody response or a T cell response that provides protection. </p>
<p>It’s my understanding that you want a robust B and T cell response, and that the T cell response will be stronger from the adenoviral response. </p>
<p>It’s entirely possible that people who survived covid will still need to get the vaccine, because the vaccine will provide longer lasting immunity than viral infection.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a lot more that goes into a vaccine—dosing, schedule, and such. So it’s hard to say at this point, but it’s a difference I do want to flag. </p>
<p>The technology used by Janssen in their Ebolavirus vaccine is also being used in their covid vaccine.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: the virus is well under a year old, so most of this is guessing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it shouldn’t prevent a vaccine to other coronaviruses. </p>
<p>If anything it may provide limited “cross protection” given the similarity between CoV-SARS1 and CoV-SARS2. </p>
<p>It could also be a good use of the technology to make a vaccine for MERS, which still circulates. The same vaccine technology would likely work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Influenza is pretty unique among vaccine-treatable viruses in that it frequently mutates the protein that our immune system uses to identify i</p>

<p>Recombination is the word youre looking for, NOT mutate. H1n1, H5N7 etc these are different combinations of the two viral proteins- Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase. </p>
<p>Multiple strains of influenza infect 1 cell (often in non-primate hosts) and they recombine genes, and pop out new mixed up versions. Swine flu, H1N1, was just another combination that happened to be extra virulent (also transmissible among swine and humans increasing transmission rates)</p>
<p>Mutation means changing the code due to replication error, similar but different</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mutations definitely do occur tho. But yea influenza contains multiple segments of genetic code which if two different strains infect the same host those segments can get packaged in a virus in different combinations and or recombine (imagine like cutting and pasting similar segments to make something that's a combination of both of the different segments) to make totally new shit on top of the newly packaged combinations of their genetic segments. Just to clarify for anyone.</p></div>		</li>
