<p>So in Italian you have:</p>
<p>Presente</p>
<p>Passato semplice, imperfetto, remoto</p>
<p>Futuro semplice, remoto</p>
<p>Condizionale </p>
<p>Congiuntivo</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remembering how to conjugate or decline isn’t the hard part — once you’ve studied a language for a while, that becomes natural. It just “seems wrong” to use the wrong conjugation or declension, so that doesn’t really jump into your head. At least for me, it doesn’t really require effort to conjugate or decline like you’re supposed to (especially for tenses and cases that are used frequently). </p>
<p>The much harder part, at least for me, is word recall. I’ve studied both Russian and Spanish, and in both, it’s much, much, much easier for me to associate a word I see or hear with it’s meaning than it is for me to go the other way. Associating a word with it’s meaning becomes even easier when you’re listening or reading as there’s context. Even though I’m a native English speaker, that’s true to an extent for me in English as well. I don’t flub on word production nearly as much as in Spanish and Russian (as it’s my native language), but it’s still harder to come up with words when I’m writing or speaking than it is to associate heard or read ones with their meanings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A part of this that is less of a factor in English than in some other languages, is that you might not know which form of a word to use.</p>
<p>If someone says &quot;My feet are cold&quot;, you can boil it down to &quot;me&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;, and &quot;cold&quot;, and understand the meaning. But if you were to do it the other way around, you might not know for sure if it's &quot;me&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;my&quot;, for example. Same with &quot;foot&quot; or &quot;feet&quot;, or maybe &quot;foots&quot;? </p>
<p>You might understand the word &quot;armchair&quot; because you know &quot;arm&quot; and &quot;chair&quot;, even if you never heard it before, or forgot it. But coming up with the right word from a concept in your head might be impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough, this is what leads me to understand the context of Spanish sentence better than their actual content. My brain never really took to Spanish vocabulary, but I'll identify the different tenses of Spanish almost without trying. I don't know what they're talking about, but I know one of them is talking about a time when they did a thing, and the other person is talking about a time when they were doing that thing and then another thing happened. And now they're commanding that person to do something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how is that any harder in Spanish? </p>
<p>Understanding that the English sentence has &quot;eat&quot; in it is easy enough. But then remembering which helping verb forms the past perfect tense, the past participle of &quot;to eat&quot;  is much harder. OR even the future perfect conjugations along with what to do with a confusing adverb like &quot;already&quot; is a whole different story.</p>
<p>You sure you aren't mistaking those things for easy just because they are your native language?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just brushing the surface, because even if you have  memorized the correct translations and grammatical usage of feet, foot, cold, and me/I.  Will you understand what someone means when they used an idiom like &quot;I'm getting cold feet&quot; in the context of making a commitment?</p>
<p>Language is really complex, and it's normal form native speakers of a language to learn quirks of that language well into adulthood.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That’s probably not the best example. I’m not a native English speaker, so I can’t “boil it down” to “me” and “foot” because “I” vs “me”, “foot” vs “feet” are completely different words. With enough practice I can pretty much translate them on the fly, but it’s not as straight forward as you might think. Other than that, there are even more steps in understanding speech. For example, one of the more complicated steps is to infer <em>what</em> words the other person is saying. Did you say “feet” or “fit”? Did you mean “feet” as in the unit or the body part? Is the word used as a common phrase that gives a  completely different meaning to the sentence? You have to infer all those from the meaning of the sentence, but the word is also part of the sentence! So it goes into an infinite loop and you have a giant puzzle in front of you to solve. As a bilingual person I would say listening and speaking are equally difficult.</p></div>		</li>
