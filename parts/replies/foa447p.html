			<div class="markdown"><p>So where did the space craft get the energy from, since it can't be created or destroyed? Did the moon slow down a little bit?</p>
<p>Edited to Add: Downvoted for pointing out one of the more interesting things about gravitational assist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the moon did slow down a little.  </p>
<p>A gravitational assist is like throwing a tennis ball against a speeding truck. When the ball bounces on the windshield, the truck slows down a negligible amount but the ball is launched at a high speed. The kinetic energy lost by one is the same as the energy gained by the other, but because of the difference in mass, the ball gains much more speed than the truck loses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's not entirely true. Space isnt a perfect vacuum so you might be slowed down if you ran into clouds of gas or got near a large object with gravity</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wafting along at 500kph, you're unlikely to encounter anything in hundreds of years unless you already started out near them, so I count that as &quot;effectively forever&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
