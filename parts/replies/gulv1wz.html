<ol>
<li>The Cyrene(tm) can be separated from the products by standard techniques such as aqueous extraction, chromatography, distillation etc.</li>
<li>Cyrene(tm) isn't stable in the presence of strong acids or bases as it can undergo an aldol reaction or aldol condensation to give dimers and oligomers. That being said, there are approximately 40 papers on its use as a solvent in a variety of applications. For a recent overview, see: <a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cssc.201801420" target="_blank"><a href="https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cssc.201801420" target="_blank">https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cssc.201801420</a></a></li>
<li>I think that the biggest breakthrough will be realising the economy of scale in the production of solvents to allow for their use across a wide variety of applications.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regard to the future....we definitely need a &quot;toolkit&quot; of biorenewable solvents to replace the very diverse range of traditional solvents we have have got used to using over many years of petroleum chemistry.  Cyrene is a great start but we need more like this and with lots of different properties from non polar to polar and with a range of physical properties. So more  inventions please!</p></div>		</li>
