<p>So they know that there is a rabbit the but their depth perception sucks so they might need to dive bomb the rabbit many times before finally snapping them up?</p>
<p>From all the wildlife videos I've seen they appear to be very precise with their rabbit grabbing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But even without 'real' 3d from overlapping fields of vision: Just close one eye and you'll find that you still don't suddenly walk into a door, cause your brain knows how high a door is supposed to be, so it'll still be able to tell approximate distances.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about the graphics card though? AFAIK a disproportionately large part of our brain is dedicated to processing visual information, a massive evolutionary investment. How does the comparatively tiny brain of eagles process x times the amount of the visual information that the human eye picks up?</p></div>		</li>

In the same way that the wrinkly part of our brain is huge compared to other animals, their visual part has grown giant due to evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering if my assumption is correct. Comparing raw numbers, do eagles actually process all the visual information they pick up (which is multiple times what we sense) using a much smaller amount of neurons [1] than us[2]? It still appears to be the case to me. And if it is, I still don't get my head around how they manage to do that. </p>
<p>Is it that our structures for processing visual information is massively inefficient compared to what's possible? That's the only explanation I can come up with, but I find it unlikely to be the case.</p>
<p>[1] - or neural connections, maybe that matters more, not sure, use whichever makes sense</p>
<p>[2] - only talking about areas dedicated to processing visual information, not our entire brain</p>
<p>edit: maybe they just process less? After all they just need to know if what they are looking at is something they can kill or something that can kill them, otherwise it's mostly irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a metaphor to demonstrate the quality of image. Eagles do have tiny brains and smaller eyes but focused on doing just one thing very well as compared to so many other things our brain needs to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, let's forget screens and graphics cards. My understanding of the answers here including yours is that it comes down to - as you say - the number of sensory cells, i.e. they have more of them and therefore they pick up more visual information. I'm still curious how all that data is processed given their tiny brains, considering how large a part of our brain we dedicate to process just a fraction of that.</p></div>		</li>
