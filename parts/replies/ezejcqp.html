			<div class="markdown"><p>not an ELI5, but this answers what <em>I</em> wanted to know. I'm not super well versed in biology so I was thinking &quot;yeah, it makes sense when the proteins are detecting other proteins/molecules, but how in the world do they detect temperature?&quot;</p>
<p>edit: also... I thought capsaicin bound to receptors that detect burn damage (from molecules cells release when they die from burning). am I totally off base on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are sort of right. Capsaicin binds TRPV1, which detects dangerous heat. But TRPV1 also binds many endogenous molecules. Some of these are produced when tissue is damaged or burned and signal inflammation. Plus, TRPV1 is regulated by many inflammation pathways and will release inflammatory signals as well. So basically, when these inflammatory molecules are produced, they sensitize and/or activate TRPV1 to produce pain, allowing you to know something is wrong, as well and amplifying the inflammation signal. Fun fact: many endocannabinoids also bind TRPV1 and regulate its activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the extra juicy info! Good that someone cleared up my wild receptor &amp; ligand/receptor &amp; no ligand claims which weren't quite true - I just didn't have the words to explain it properly without bracketing out a conflicting point every 3 words.</p>
<p>I'm an immunologist and so this actually falls out of my jurisdiction but I saw my chance and went for it! I bloody loved learning about thermosensitive nerves when I was younger though because all of the additional complexities were still linked to something so real and tangible like feeling heat. And pain, man, pain people always sound next level smart when they talk about it. It's so fascinating that all of these hyper-complex hyper-plastic processes are determined by very specific very small and very physical events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. The question was HOW do we feel temperature differences and the thermodynamic answers just explain how heat is transferred. I can’t actually say what OP meant to ask, but it seems like the biology of it is the best answer. Also, I think that at least trying to introduce concepts like this to a 5yo is good, and you made a good effort to make it understandable. My son is 1 and I explain things using science jargon all the time. He probably doesn’t get 99% of it but he will one day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having once been 5 and having most things explained in clear, adult-like terminology to me and not in dumbed-down “child talk”, you’re doing the right thing.  It’ll help him understand things better at a <em>much</em> earlier age than his compatriots and will be a great benefit to him when he is older.</p>
<p>Also, thus sub isn’t meant at all for 5 year olds (as per the sidebar), so the explanation is exactly suitable for this sub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am much older than 1 and people explain stuff in science jargon to me all the time and I don't get it either. But I hope you'll be teaching him all about the biology of thermosensitive neurons soon!</p></div>		</li>
