By protecting one person we protect many many others around him or her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the ama but honestly, it is their right. As much as the situation being very unsettling, exercising one's rights potentially damages so much of a community, all things have associated risk. Walking is a risk, eating is a risk. We can only give individuals with capacity the choice and full information available beyond that no clinician has any real right to enforce anything. As shame as it is, this is the down side of a free, democratic society. Freedom isnt cheap, but it is worth protecting not only when it is easy, but also when it is exceptionally frustrating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, not from the AMA team but I've been following antivaxx issues for way too long. I dont know if this is the situation for your friend but many parents have been misinformed about the safety and necessity of vaccines. If this is the case let me tell you that fact sheets and data are only going to make her more entrenched. There is a difference between true &quot;antivaxx&quot; and &quot;vaccine hesitant&quot;. If she falls into the latter category time and respectful conversation can help to change her mind.</p>
<p>She likely has fears about vaccines themselves and needs to be listened to and talked with (not at) over time. It is super frustrating to have to do this but our brains are dumb at processing data like things with minuscule risks versus unseen benefits.  We fixate on &quot;but what if it happens to me???&quot; In situations where it is so unlikely to happen we literally can't directly process the minuscule chance. </p>
<p>An example of what I mean: 1 in 10 is easy to visualize. 1 in 25 isn't too bad. 1 in 50 gets a little tricky but can be doable. 1 in 100 is where things start getting messy. 1 in 100,000 is something our brains usually can't accurately conceptualize (charts and infographics are great tools). </p>
<p>It sucks and takes effort but heres a really good article I found helped me talk to vaccine hesitant people. Some of the tools they provide you with can work for climate change denial too.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no cure for some diseases that we have vaccines for. For example, if you get chicken pox without vaccine, you could simply die from it or get horrible scars all over your body after. You can still contract chickenpox with vaccine but chances are it will be much much less severe. Also rabies and tetanus shots are both vaccines, does your friend dare not get them if bitten by a wild animal or steps on a rusty nail?</p></div>		</li>
