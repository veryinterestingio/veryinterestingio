			<div class="markdown"><p>tooth paste does almost nothing... brushing does everything. Use toothbrush without brushing and you'll have zero results. Brush without toothpaste and you will remove both the tartar and the bacteria that produce it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of those bacteria, <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis</em>, can secrete chemicals that make your mouth more hospitable for the other bacteria that do damage to your teeth. It is als suspected in a variety of non-oral issues including arterial plaque buildup, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s. It’s a bastard of a bacterium, hiding from the immune system using various chemical means to suppress immune response, but also able to hide <em>inside</em> the cells of your gums to avoid detection.</p>

<p>Do you know what kind of mouth environment and/or diet are more hostile to P. ginginvalis? I eat an extremely low-carb diet, so you can guess what I'm hoping the answer might be!</p></div>		</li>
