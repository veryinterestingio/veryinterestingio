			<div class="markdown"><p>I <em>love</em> loud music/concerts and barely ever drink.  BUT, it would still make sense that changing our intoxication level alters our brains ability to interpret input and we enjoy different things when drunk/high that sober us wouldn't, and vice versa.  Good point.  </p></div>		</li>
