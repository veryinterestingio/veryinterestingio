			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. So, when you play a video game, a part of your computer/phone/console called the grapgics card or GPU is responsible for making the image that appears on your screen. Thats the only job of a graphics card, making images. A PC also has a component called a Processor or CPU that is normally responsible for doing basic stuff like keeping windows running, getting files you need and giving commands to the graphics card. But some programms for making high quality 3d scenes like Blender or CineBench actually use the Processor and not the Graphics Card to make these images, which seems pretty stupid to me. Second part: Cinebench starts drawing the image in the center and then slowly makes its way to the outside of the image <a href="https://youtu.be/8uJ666Rnbnc" target="_blank">Example</a>. Other programs such as vRay make a very bad looking version of the entire image first and then make it more and more detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/T9xGFiv_s1c?t=321" target="_blank">Here is an example render of vRay</a></p></div>		</li>
