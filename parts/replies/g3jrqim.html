			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey just wanted to let you now that you're not alone. I have a few &quot;rogue&quot; eyebrow hairs that feel like they need to grow to about 3 inches. I usually pull the whole hair out when I catch those buggers, but it always seems like there have to be more in there somewhere, waiting. 3in hairs don't grow overnight. Well I sure hope they don't anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think having to trim your eyebrows in the first place is all that common tbf. My dad's grown his out a few times now, they curl back in and around on themselves almost like they're in curlers. Idk, most people probably cut their before it gets to that stage..</p></div>		</li>
