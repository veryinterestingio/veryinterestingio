			<div class="markdown"><p>That last point is great. A lot of people get it the wrong way around, e.g. &quot;How do we know it's called an electron?&quot; kinda stuff. Fascinating how a person's brain can take such a vastly different logic path to the next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and as long as all things we call electrons behave in the same way there is no significant importance for whether they are identical or just similar if the similarities are effectively identical. </p>
<p>Atoms being made up of smaller parts only mattered once we were able to observe the smaller parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the same thing with Dark Matter.  </p>
<p>We noticed something was missing, we dont know what it actually is,so we just call &quot;the thing that has the same gravitational properties as matter, but we cant detect it&quot; Dark matter.  As a place holder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you know it's &quot;an electron&quot; the same way you know a chair is &quot;a chair&quot;. Because the words are defined to mean that thing (except that electron is defined much more precisely than chair, really). Chairs are just a lot easier to see, so you learn the word for that when you're really young.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it like knowing that there’s salt in salty stew? While we can’t see the salt (anymore), we know that it’s there because we have quantified its characteristics (salty) and we can observe that characteristics in the stew</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine I tell you to close your eyes and put a cup in front of you. You are allowed to touch the cup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why limit yourself to cup. Just take magnets and try to put them close together. There is nothing to see yet we know it's magnetic field force.</p>
<p>I agree with your points. Just wanted to give example of something more abstract which every one of us experienced.</p></div>		</li>
