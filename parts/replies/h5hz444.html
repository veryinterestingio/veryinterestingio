			<div class="markdown"><p>There are diminishing returns to more power when attaining speed because people often forget that the faster you go the more wind resistance you have to contend with as well. So unless youre running in a vacuum, running faster requires you to burn a MORE than proportional amount of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually researched this a bit recently for a video, although my friend did more since it's kind of his wheelhouse (PhD student in rheology).  Anyway, we were trying to figure out what prevents you from running faster past a certain point and kinda settled on viscous damping being a likely culprit which makes sense bc it scales with force.  But it was still just a theory.</p>
<p>Wind resistance won't do much at human velocities (we also used CFD to calculate coefficient of drag and stuff for different running styles).  I don't remember off the top of my head, but I don't think drag was the main limiting factor until you got to the hundreds of mph.</p></div>		</li>
