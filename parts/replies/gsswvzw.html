			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I don’t get that though, because avocados are expensive here too, but when I traveled to Melbourne like 4 years ago I could get 3 good hand sushi rolls (like a California roll) for $5 AUD, which was basically $3.50 USD after conversion. For comparison, one sushi roll, at least a California roll, in the states is $5 USD <em>minimum</em>. I don’t understand the economics of sushi because I would assume the avocado prices would be higher than here in the US, but yet the price is still waaaaay cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my part of CA it’s anywhere from 5 for $1, to a dollar each on the high end, depending on the store/season. Everyone thinks they’d be dirt cheap here because it’s where they’re all grown, but the cost of living makes everything expensive, even produce.</p></div>		</li>
