<p>Let's say you're cooking and have the cognitive loads of stovetop cooking, baking, and cleanup at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should point out that scientists now believe that humans can only focus on one thing at a time. So you can't actually be focusing on cooking, baking, and cleaning at the same time. Rather, your brain switches between the tasks rapidly to keep them all in mind. So, (this is just an example) for 5 seconds you think about cooking, 5 secs you think about baking, 5 seconds you think about cleaning. You are not thinking about cooking, baking, and cleaning all at once for 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Now, there's a problem with switching between tasks: When your brain switches focus, it takes a little bit of time to remember what it was thinking about the last time you focused on it.</p>
<p>So, in our example, you would think about cooking for 4 seconds, spend 1 second switching to thinking about baking, spend 4 seconds thinking about baking, then spend 1 second switching to thinking about cleaning, then spend 4 seconds thinking about cleaning, then spend 1 second switching back to cooking.</p>
<p>So, over those 15 seconds, you have only spent 12 seconds actually thinking about tasks you need to do. Compare this to just focusing on baking, where you spend 1 second switching to baking, then 14 seconds focusing on baking.</p>
<p>It's generally better to spend your time focusing on one task, as you don't waste brain time switching between tasks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to comment this but you did it much better. This is exactly what I do at work when I have a repetitive job with multiple steps. I will do all the 'like' procedures together, followed by the next group of similiar procedures, instead of switching back and forth between 3 different steps. I am far quicker and more efficient this way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an interesting analog, check out <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch" target="_blank">context switching</a> in computing terms.  Conceptually it is the same process, but I've huge difference is the computer can &quot;remember&quot; exactly what information is switched out when the task comes around again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good googly-moogly I know the pain of troubleshooting with a meter that's giving you bogus readings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it’s quite the same scenario. Hal is surprised to find these things in need of fixing and they pile up suddenly. The <em>mental</em> part of the mental load kinda means you already knew these things needed fixing. As described in the comic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you can see his mental &quot;stack&quot; filling up with prerequisite things that need done, one by one, culminating in a collapse of the mental load when he's under the car and Lois asks him to change the lightbulb and he snaps back &quot;What does it look like I'm doing!?&quot;</p>
<p>How is that not a good example?  In fact, the comic literally illustrates the same thing.</p>
<p>Edit: I get what you mean by the first part of the comic, but starting about half-way down with &quot;I start by picking something up to put it away&quot;  in the comic, I think it looks pretty much the same</p></div>		</li>
