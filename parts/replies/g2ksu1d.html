			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the one I saw previously and I agree with the most. It’s also why you have diarrhea in these instances - over time your stools solidify in your intestine and absorb water. If the process is sped up due to an emergency evacuation by your body, obviously this absorption cannot take place and produces very watery stool. </p>
<p>Contrary to another response in this thread, you CAN immediately have “instashits” or a particular food or meal upset your entire digestive tract directly after consumption. I experienced it for years. I would venture to say this probably doesn’t happen to most people regularly unless they’ve got a bowel condition, but it can happen and it’s exhausting and awful. </p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only time I ever got food poisoning was from a Subway. It was projectile liquids out both ends for hours. </p>
<p>This was almost ten years ago. The smell of Subway (all of their stores have a certain scent) makes me extremely ill and I still can’t stomach ANY kind of deli meat sandwich due to my experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As in, the train conductor sees a scratch on an otherwise perfectly fine cart, put freaks tf out and pulls the emergency lever multiple times</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone likes to dunk on Taco Bell but I’ve never once had an issue with food there. It’s all the same 5 or so simple ingredients combined different ways. Subway however is the DangerZone, fuck trusting a chain with deli meats that stuff spoils so fast.</p></div>		</li>
