			<div class="markdown"><p>One important thing to note is that for different infectious agents different parts of the hugely complex immune system are much more effective than others. So while antibodiy levels are easy to measure they don't necessarily paint the full picture. Loads of diseases mainly use t-celk mediated response with antibodies just being a slight aid, whereas others can be nearly fully stopped just by the antibodies.</p>
<p>And then there's the topic of b-cells as you mentioned: How long they remember to produce X antibody when required doesn't only depend on the type of vaccine used as you described but also on the actual shape of the antigens of the infectious agents.</p>
<p>So even without any vaccines but the straight up original virus or bacterium some infections will convey very long lasting to basically permanent immunity while some will only last a few years.</p>
<p>As to why I don't think that's determined this far.</p></div>		</li>
