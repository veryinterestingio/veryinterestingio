			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the empty vacuum of space releases energy and that energy causes the universe to expand and create more empty vacuum, doesn't that mean the Universe perpetually produces energy from nothing? I don't know much but doesn't that violate the first law of thermodynamics? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not violate the first law of thermodynamics. You probably meant does it violate conservation of energy. Yes it does, energy isn't conserve in this situation. </p>
<p>Conservation of energy is not the same thing as the first law of thermodynamics which is a statement about the ways in which the internal energy of a thermodynamic system can change (work and.. heat). (particularly the laws of thermodynamics also apply to the evolution of the universe, where energy isn't conserved.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radiation pressure of the light from the stars does play a part in the expansion of the universe. However, it is a small factor at the moment. Also, we would expect its influence to decrease as the universe expands (stars become farther apart); however, the expansion we attribute to dark energy is accelerating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the energy density of photons is very very small at the current time, <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/94181/where-is-radiation-density-in-the-planck-2013-results" target="_blank">clocking in around 0.009%</a> of the energy in the universe.</p>
<p>In the early universe, however, it is thought that photons were the dominant cosmological driver.</p></div>		</li>
