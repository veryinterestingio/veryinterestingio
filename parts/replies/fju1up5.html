			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It was so deadly that the virus died out. It's similar to ebola in terms of mortality. Ebola kills a huge proportion of the infected but this burns out its hosts so quickly that it can't effectively spread across a larger segment of the population.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ebola is also not nearly as easily transmitted as flu. Ebola requires very specific routes of entry (so is a much easier disease cycle to interrupt)</p>
<p>EDIT: Ebola requires <em>direct</em> contact  with blood/feces/saliva of an infected person AND those substances must come in contact with eyes/mucosa/open wounds. Ebola is not airborne. Perhaps most importantly, people infected with Ebila are only contagious when they are symptomatic. Consequently, avoiding infection is much easier than with flu.  </p>
<p>The reason Ebola never seems to go away is because it has multiple reservoir species including bats and apes. Whenever a human butchers an ape (often called &quot;bush meat&quot;) they risk contracting Ebola.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Spanish Flu had a high mortality rate, but even the high estimates (\~20%) tend to put it below the typical range for Ebola (25-90%). Though neither number is easy to specify as there were multiple strains that could vary wildly in mortality rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spanish flu’s estimated case fatality  rate by the WHO was 2-3%. Much much lower than you are letting on. Keep in mind, they’re currently estimating coronavirus to be 2-3%. Furthermore, it is well understood that the massive infrastructure and socioeconomic disruption most European countries were dealing with due to WWI  resulted in a much higher case fatality rate. Coronavirus has the same estimated case fatality ratio as the Spanish flu with the aid of modern medicine.</p></div>		</li>
