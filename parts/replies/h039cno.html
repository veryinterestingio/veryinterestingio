			<div class="markdown"><p>The corona virus vaccines are somewhat resistant to mutations because they target the protein used to enter the cells (the spike protein).     If that mutates enough to not be recognized by body's defenses, there's a good chance it won't be able to perform its function of binding to the ACE2 receptors and entering the cell structure, thus making it non-infectious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do all coronaviruses have the same spike protein? Id assume that there are different ones and they can bind to different places. So couldn't it evolve to use a different protein to enter?</p>
<p>Kind of like &quot;oh that entrance has guards. Il use another entrance&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd be kinda like invading a castle using ladders to climb the walls. The castle develops defenses against ladders, but one crazy guy comes up with using yarn balls. Although that might work to invade a kitten castle, that's not what they're up against, so the approach dies out pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its speciffically the ace2 receptor that makes covid such a monster. If it mutated to the point it couldn't interact with thst receptor it would be a vastly different situation. Hard to say if it would be better or worse. But the ace2 receptor is what gives Corona the secondary effects that are often the lethal effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't.</p>
<p>MERS-CoV (the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) doesn't use the ACE2 receptor to infect a cell, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 does, it uses the DPP4 receptor.</p>
<p>MERS-CoV is a coronavirus, but it isn't in the same family as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;design space&quot; of proteins is high dimensional and thus extremely vast, and natural selection is good at finding new designs that work around problems. Sure, the vaccines are amazing, and such with fast rollouts they decisively solve pandemics, natural selection has nothing on sufficiently advanced human technology ... but it's constant, relentless, present everywhere where there's even one host/carrier, always working... and humans have short attention spans and our resource allocation is scarce and focused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this... Viruses do not want their hosts to die (well... They dont <em>want</em> anything) and typically, eventually, mutate into less deadly strains so that the host lives longer.</p>
<p>For some viruses this will never happen (and bacterial infections) but, considering how many bacteria are symbiotic with us now, and viruses that have absolutely no effect on humans.. it is possible this will just be another one, eventually. Sooner than natural with vaccines, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya but one of the earliest variants of the Spanish Flu is believed to be what  caused the second deadly wave. Given enough time sure they will become less deadly doesn't mean a variant is automatically less deadly then orignal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed it did, and took less than a century. And the millions of mutations that came in such a short time is why there is no vaccine or immunity to the &quot;common cold&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but this process could take hundreds or thousands of years or could be quick. Saying it as a matter of fact seems a bit...misleading. Eventually we will stop testing and tracking variants in the virus. We may never actually see what you describe as happening with this virus.</p></div>		</li>
