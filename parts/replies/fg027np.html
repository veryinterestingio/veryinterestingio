			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I raise my arm to scratch my nose, not every muscle fiber in my arm is activating? This makes sense because muscles can either fully contract or fully relax, correct? A muscle fiber cannot contract with half force?</p>
<p>Is a motor unit made up of specific set of muscle fibers, or is it just a &quot;random&quot; collection of muscle fibers that meets a certain &quot;number requirement?&quot;</p>
<p>For a light weight task such as raising my unladen arm to scratch my nose, does the same set of muscle fibers get activated each time I do that, or is it a &quot;random&quot; set of muscle fibers recruited to a motor unit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, not every fiber is activating. A muscle fiber can contract with half force, but it does this through a duty cycle. If you’re familiar with PWM, it’s the same concept. The alpha motor neuron which innervates a muscle will transmit twitch responses, very short all or nothing action potentials, which can fuse into a constant activation signal if frequent enough. This fusion is known as tetanic contraction. </p>
<p>A motor unit consists of an alpha motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates. Motor unit size distribution is determined by genetics, but within the confines of distribution, it can be seen as random. It’s not like the 5th largest motor unit in the biceps is similarly located and the same size between any two people. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, the same action is never truly the same. A similar group of motor units may be recruited each time you repeat, but it won’t be the exact same group with the exact same activation pattern. Human motor control is very interesting. We really only care about the task we’re trying to do and don’t really care about how it’s done. A skilled roofer knows how to hit the nail from any hammer starting position, and in fact their hammer trajectories will vary much more than an unskilled roofer who must reset their hammer to the few positions they know they can start from. </p>
<p>Great questions. I can tell you’re thinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have 1000 muscle cells, your brain is really good at using them in small groups, say 5, to do small tasks like raising your arm or grabbing a ball. But if you need to do something more forceful, your brain can only do them in larger groups, say 50 cells. This is less precise but will give you a stronger force. If you over shoot, your brain turns off some larger group of cells. If you undershoot your brain turns on some larger group of cells. That basically keeps going back and forth and you get &quot;shuddering&quot;.</p>
