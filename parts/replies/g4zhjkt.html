			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just speculating but couldn't this also mean people would be less likely to present to ER/Urgent Care over minor injuries like sprains and such?  Just ice and wrap it at home?</p>
<p>Granted it was very obvious that fewer people were driving and there was less skilled trades work happening so that was clearly a part.</p>
<p>I'm really curious how much drug seeking behavior occured at ERs in in the early days though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure! Especially early on when there was more of a panic, this was very concerning. (There's also been a lot of concern about kids not going to well-child visits and getting behind on vaccines.) But there's good reason to believe that this issue wouldn't account for such a large drop in infectious disease rates. </p>
<p>This is my reply to a similar comment: </p>
<p>That's definitely an issue all surveillance programs have been struggling with, but it doesn't explain the entire drop.</p>
<p>In the example of Norovirus outbreaks, more than half of outbreaks normally occur in long-term care facilities like nursing homes where residents are always plugged into the health care system, and many more get reported by schools, daycares, and camps (where they're going to notice if a kid is sick whether they go to the doctor or not), so those would still get picked up in the system if they were happening. </p>
<p>And people don't just spontaneously develop infectious diseases; you have to catch it from someone. If everyone has fewer daily interpersonal contacts and if sick people are able to stay home thanks to improved work/school policies, your likelihood of being exposed to disease is just much, much lower than normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hope they find it soon! </p>
<p>I have been wondering if there's more food poisoning going on from people cooking at home who don't know proper food handling. Obviously that would be less likely to get reported to health departments (compared to food poisoning from a restaurant or event) so only more serious cases would get picked up in our surveillance systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, here schools and daycares remain open while everything else has stayed closed. Adults are also not allowed into these facilities to pick up kids and need to wait outside. Id love to see actual data, but in casual observations the kids have been less sick this year. So theyâ€™re not really spreading anything to each other. </p>
<p>So, I do wonder whether kids are not the spreaders people assume they are? And whether adults are the ones who spread most viruses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kids are definitely the main spreaders of a lot of major diseases, but there are of course many factors at play. The thing is, kids tend to spread their germs around more--they're bad at basic skills like sneezing into an elbow or vomiting into a toilet--so one sick kid will infect more other people than one sick adult. BUT, kids don't just spontaneously develop and spread diseases; one kid has to catch an infection from somewhere else and introduce it to the school or daycare. So less circulating disease throughout the community will also lead to less circulating disease among kids. </p>
<p>Also, where schools and daycares remain open, they're still enforcing more infection control measures than usual. In a typical year, children would still be sent to school if they had some mild symptoms like a runny nose, minor cough, or stomach ache, but now parents are much more likely to keep the kids home and schools are more likely to send kids home at the very first sign of illness. Similarly, surfaces are being disinfected more often and children are being taught better hand hygiene to keep things as clean as possible.</p></div>		</li>
