<ul>
<li>Your memories are not like computer files they are more like a series of &quot;clues&quot;: your five senses and emotions factor into memories</li>
<li>A theory about sleep and dreams is that (among other things) it's memory consolidation.  Your brain organizes memories while you sleep - one correlation is that people who learn new things in a classroom or formal training report lots of dreams when they sleep.</li>
<li>Some memories fade or become disjointed because they are not used.  That person from your teen years that interacted with -a lot - is now &quot;the dude with the shirt&quot; because the memories weren't used, or weren't used that much.  </li>
<li>You can recover some of that, so when the &quot;the dude with the shirt&quot; send you a FB request, your brain will try to get as much as it can - but will fill in the blanks with new information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key takeaway is that memory isn't like a DVD or a photograph - it's a living thing that can be replenished or &quot;die&quot; based on how it's used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why in criminal justice, witnesses can be so unreliable.  Innocent people have gone to jail because multiple witnesses all honestly believe they saw that person commit a crime they were completely innocent of all because that person fit the clues as you call them that their memories stored about the event, so their brains assumed that person was who they saw and made them remember it that way, even though that isn't what happened.  </p>
<p>Memories are not as reliable as we like to think they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, but leaves out another even darker truth: peoples' memories are malleable and suggestible. Many 'witnesses' who honestly believe they saw or heard or experienced something only believe that because a police officer or other person suggested to them (deliberately or not) that they really did see, hear or experience that something.</p>
<p>This is why, for example, certain jurisdictions don't even allow the 'lineups' you see on crime shows. Or if they do, the officer in charge of the lineup cannot be an officer who knows anything about the case and who they think did the deed (because even the smallest suggestion of &quot;Number THREE step forward&quot; can be a subtle cue that a witness, being  a highly suggestible social monkey just wanting to please its fellow monkeys, can pick up on, without even realising they're doing it...). And if those jurisdictions DO allow line-ups (or just a list of photographs) they require all possible perpetrators to have roughly the same race, height, and general appearance: because if the witness said it was a tall black guy and only 2 of the 5 in the line-up are tall black guys then you're already kinda telling them who to finger...and then once they HAVE decided who they think did it, they begin to unconsciously change their own memories and convince themselves that they KNOW that Number Three did the deed.</p>
<p>And if a jurisdiction doesn't have these kinds of protections, it's undoubtedly putting innocent people in jail.</p>
<p>None of this even requires the witness and the police officer or third party to WANT to frame someone. Though some know that they're doing it, many don't. We're all just social monkeys without even half a clue how much we're influencing others and being influenced BY others. It just happens.</p>
<p>Tldr: eyewitnesses are the least trustworthy kind of evidence that juries really really really trust.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Its better that 10 guilty people go free than one innocent is found guilty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently read that memories aren’t actually “retrieved,” but more akin to “reconstructed.” Your brain builds the memory from scratch each time, that’s why you insert people who weren’t actually there, omit people who were, fuck up key details, etc. Not sure of the validity of this, but interesting to consider.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is such an underappreciated ability. Human ability to fill in the blanks is really incredible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For better or worse. Nothing we think as true is technically true. It's all just interpretation based on external stimuli being shunted to different parts of the brain and reassembled into a working hypothesis of what actually happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some pretty severe insomnia and I've noticed my short and long-term memories decline over the years. If sleep is memory consolidation, then my brain is a tall stack of unorganized files that got violently swept off a desk.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience with TM or meditation in general, not thinking of anything is also a trigger for your mind to bring back memories you didn't even know you still had, and that can be good or bad of course, for me it was very positive. Anyway, my point is, you CAN make your mind bring back memories. They are there somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that sleep, especially REM, is intrinsic to forming and retaining memory. It is thought that babies and small children don’t retain memories well or at all because they don’t have the language to create the thoughts/dreams to create and solidify memories. Also, it’s important for processing events as well as problem solving. </p>
<p>Which is why staying up all night to cram for an exam might be fine in the short term, but you won’t retain those hours of studying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, under certain point staying up all night to study does more harm than good. I'm curious though as to whether people who grew up without any sort of language really cannot maintain memories. I would think that they would have some sort of sense Impressions and stuff like that, like that they would recall being hungry or mad or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A recent study on dogs suggest that dogs have the mental capacity of a 5 year old child. We don’t know the nuances of memories within dogs, but we know that they can feel and remember pain and trauma. They can feel depression and mourning. But, they don’t understand larger concepts like the permanence of death for example. So, I assume that would be pretty close to what is described there. They could possibly feel and remember strong emotions, but the memories associated to it would probably not be very strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been some research done on people who grew up without language, however it’s obviously unethical to do so purposefully, raising children in conditions of such neglect and permanently impacting their ability to acquire language. To my knowledge memory has not been studied in these individuals, but the conditions associated with language deprivation result in profound developmental trauma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can somewhat confirm the last part based on personal experiences.</p>
<p>When I was younger and slept like a log every day, my memory was pretty remarkable, but as my ability to sleep degraded, so did my ability to recall things. I never connected those two factors together, but if that theory is even partly correct, then it makes lots of sense.</p></div>		</li>
