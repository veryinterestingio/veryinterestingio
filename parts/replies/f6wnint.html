			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try my best to find the original samples, but they may be lost to time...</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry, tried to find the original sample. It was taken from the Macaulay Library by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The species was Hypsiboas Boans (or the Rusty Tree Frog).</p>
<p>It was filed under LNS number 198364, but that entry doesn't appear to exist in their catalog anymore. I checked the library for the guy who recorded it (Reginald B. Cocroft), but found only other similar recordings from around that time (circa 1986).</p>
<p>None of the recordings remaining on the site are distress calls, just general ribbiting...</p>
<p>If anyone can find something based on that info, I would love to hear it again, though!</p>
<p>EDIT 2:</p>
<p>I found the old recordings I backed up from my study!</p>
<p>Don't expect anything crazy scary, I was only including a set of natural and foley sounds in my study, so nothing horror-movie worthy, but here's the two samples that got the most negative reactions:</p>

<p>Leptodactylus Pentadactylus, Distress calls: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_br2b2ghLwDTHVqdGMyTFRscmM" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_br2b2ghLwDTHVqdGMyTFRscmM</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that sound even real tho? I really don’t understand how recording a planet with nothing on it could cause there to be “wub-wub-wub” noises, cheesy 80’s horror movie sounds, and anything besides just silence or wind (except for maybe the sun and our Earth).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the fluctuations in saturn’s magnetic field, so it’s not really a sound as we think of it, but it is a real signal. It’s played as a sound cause it would be really boring to just look at a long graph of wiggles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fluctuations in electro-magnetic fields, with the wavelengths altered to be audible.</p>
<p>This is done by either slowing down the data playback so it lowers the frequency of the waves, or by some form of frequency mapping?</p>
<p>Either way, it's not a real sound. It's more like a graph that you can hear, instead of one that you can see.</p></div>		</li>
