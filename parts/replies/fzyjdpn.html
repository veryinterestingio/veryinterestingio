			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I think i know why it happened though.</p>
<p>I was on holiday in Sardinia and we had booked a rental car online. When we went to pick it up at the airport they needed to put an additional small charge on my credit card. The problem was that they could only do it over the terminal which needed my PIN. As i only ever used my CC for online purchases i had no idea what my PIN is, so this isn't what i'm getting at.
After a few very stressful hours at the airport looking for another way to get a rental car we were finally on our way.</p>
<p>BUT the first time i wanted to use my debit card (for which i use my PIN daily) i just completely blanked out. I kind of remembered the numbers but no chance to get them into the right order.</p>
<p>I guess i was so stressed out that my brain just lost all confidence in otherwise familiar number sequences for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me recently! I have used this debit card for a year and I live in a (mostly) cash-free city... I use my PIN all the time.</p>
<p>It was so weird. Was about to pay, stared at the numbers and didn't know where to press. Never happened before. I panicked and left the store.</p>
<p>Some 10 minutes later familiar numbers felt familiar and I worked on them and I finally had a shot on at least TRYING if those numbers were correct and they were :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to restore my computer from a backup and it asked me for a login key.  I went through about 12 different iterations of the passwords I was using at that time and when I finally got it I remember saying to myself “goddamnit that was the most obvious one.”  About a week later I was prompted for the password again and I’ve tried at least 100+ passwords (including variations) with no luck.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can really use it once you learn to trust it and work with it.</p>
<p>Hard problem you can't figure out?  Think through it carefully, explore all the deadends, and...I can't really explain this...let it go.  I know I'm sending a file off to the background brain.</p>
<p>Then hours to days later &quot;YOU'VE GOT MAIL!&quot; and the answer comes up.  Or if not the answer, a new angle to noodle, and repeat.  Often morning shower time works out as a deeper &quot;conversation&quot; of ideas for some reason.</p>
<p>The tricky part with some of us productive procrastinators, is that the back burner can become tuned to work even better under pressure, and let us always deliver in crunch time.  &quot;Sure, I could do it now...but I'll think of a better way to do this in a tiny fraction of the time in the last hour.&quot;  And we do.  Usually.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I use this idea as a teacher to encourage my students to at least read through practice job interview questions, just get them in your brain and your brain will work on answers subconsciously for you and you'll have better answers than if you'd never heard the question. </p>

<p>I recommend to students that they flit through exam papers once before they start answering questions for this reason (when I have students, that is) ^someone ^hire ^me ^pls</p></div>		</li>
