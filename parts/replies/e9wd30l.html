			<div class="markdown"><p>We use to spank. We have a boy and a girl, the boy is 2 years older than the girl. One day my son came in, he was around 5, and told on his sister for hitting him. I called my 3 year old in the room and gave her a couple pops on the bottom. We never hit out of anger, always told them why they were about to get a spanking, spanked them, and then told them why we have them a spanking. This particular session ended spankings, when I was done with the spanking I looked her square in the eye and said, “we do not hit people in this family” and the look of confusion and betrayal I saw in her eyes made me rethink our whole punishment system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's real statements like this that show the danger in it. I know spanking isn't necessarily violent, but it definitely puts off a this is how I stop something I don't like or this is how I get things done. Just not a good sentiment to instill in future adults </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted this as a reply to another post, but if it's worth posting once why not twice?</p>
<p>I see this in myself and my dog, actually. I was spanked fairly often as a kid - to be clear, I wasn't beaten or anything, but definitely raised to fear the punishment. It made it a lot harder for me to process failing at something (since I was afraid of punishment), and it made me default to scolding/yelling as a way to communicate that someone made a mistake. It's taken years to unpack how I react to negative results and stress, and I'm a fairly successful and fulfilled adult. Imagine someone trying to work that out while working two minimum wage jobs and raising their own kid and you can imagine how that propagates.</p>
<p>Anyway, this relates to my dog since I adopted him as a puppy. Unfortunately, even with time off between school and starting my first job, it took a long time for me to get fully on the &quot;positive reinforcement only&quot; train. I spanked him as a puppy, and even seven years later he's a bit skittish if I go to pet him too quickly.</p>
<p>At this point, I know my parents regret some of the more negative behaviors they had while my brother and I were growing up. I definitely regret spanking my dog when he was a puppy. But when it happens during critical formative years, there's little to no chance of taking that back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom was given really stupid advice to smack my dog on the nose as training. Even as a kid I knew that advice was suspect and my father and I never did. My mom stopped doing this fairly quickly, but even a decade later only my father and I could pet my dog's head without him pulling away.</p>
<p>He loved to jump on her to beg for vegetable ends though. RIP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is really important. If you, say, sat down with the child and explained why what they did was wrong and shouldn't be done, and they take it to heart, then they won't do it because of their own morals, no matter who is watching. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't do that with a toddler though because they don't have that cognitive ability to understand and their language isn't that far developed yet. All you can do is train them. That is what we are basically doing by giving them immediate consequences when we catch them doing something wrong because they live in the moment. But they do not understand long term consequences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That goes more along with not teaching <em>why</em> something is wrong, but instead to be afraid.  But yeah, totally can happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. You're thinking of it too much as a punishment and not enough as a discipline. A good parent wouldn't just bust in and whoop with no words. My parents would always explain what I did wrong and then I had the whole night to think about it. </p></div>		</li>
