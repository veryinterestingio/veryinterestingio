			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a similar dealership near me, but it shifts between various cars. Like, one time it was all Toyota Corrolas, another time it was all some kind of pickup truck [don't remember the make/model, but it was all the same one]. Hell, I even remember they once had an entire lot of nothing but cars of the same <em>color</em> rather than model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This tends to happen with large companies that have fleets of company cars on a 2-3 year lease. They'll have 50 of the same car that all expire at once. The colour thing could be similar - a variety of cars but all in <brand colour></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I got my Toyota from a Honda dealer. It wasn't a used car dealership, it was a &quot;Springfield Honda&quot; lot and they also happened to have a few used non-honda cars for sale. If I remember correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably was a trade in and it hasn’t been moved to a different dealership.</p>
<p>I got my Pontiac vibe (GM emblem, Toyota everything else and no complaints) at Ford dealership because it was a recent trade in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a lot of new dealerships with a section off to the side of used cars. In fact almost every dealership I've been to. Probably because of trade ins.</p></div>		</li>
