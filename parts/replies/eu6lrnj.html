			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Asia is the Orient. In late Roman times, Greece and anything further east was the pars oritenalis, and jerusalem was in the diocesis orientis. Over time the term was applied to further and further east as our horizons broadened.</p>
<p>It's also where the word oriental comes from. People from the Orient are oriental. The west is the Occident, and people from the west are Occidental. Some people think oriental is a pejorative, which I don't really understand. It just means easterner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oriens is also the Latin for &quot;East&quot; for the same reason, so that doesn't tell you much of anything useful. All the English words and concepts using orien- ultimately derive from this usage, but it wouldn't be correct to say that the name of Orienteering derives directly from the sun rising, there are many etymological steps in between.</p></div>		</li>
