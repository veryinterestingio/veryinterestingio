			<div class="markdown"><p>When it's night and I'm incredibly sleepy, like fall asleep instantly if I let myself close my eyes sleepy, if I push through it for 30 or so mins I end up being completely awake and unable to sleep.</p>
<p>Is the inability to sleep thing because of a process like what you just described or is it more a circadian rhythm thing? I don't think circadian would have that effect in such a short amount of time, though?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I can't quite ELI5 but what you're describing is usually referred to as a second wind - here's the wiki article on it:<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_wind_(sleep)" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second\_wind\_(sleep" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second\_wind\_(sleep</a>)</a>  </p>
<p>As far as I can tell it's similar to when kids are &quot;over-tired&quot; and are acting hyper/high energy but in fact missed their cue to sleep - they will have a few hours where it's hard to fall asleep, but parents quickly notice how the kids' mood/psychological strength will crumble during this time. Giving in to the second wind and staying up is usually not good for you and it's been reported that your decision making skills are about on par with a person who is somewhat inebriated (why you shouldn't drive sleepy, for instance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ADHD and that ‘second wind’ are very closely tied.  I have had sleep issues my entire life related to the ADHD and my mind refusing to slow down enough to sleep and if anything stimulates me while I’m spending that hour or more trying to fall asleep the ‘second wind’ is almost instant and long lasting.  Add in mild anxiety and anytime I know I have something important the next morning results in me being wired all night long.</p>
<p>I’m also a really light sleeper and wake up easily and will be completely unrested but still too energetic to go to sleep.  The only time this has been useful was after each of my kids were born. It enabled me to wake up and care for them while I let my wife sleep, the whole stress of giving birth and having the life literally drained from you to feed to babies seemed to be significantly lessened when she can get a full 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.</p>
<p>I can absolutely feel the adrenaline surge and it interacting heavily with my underutilized dopamine receptors. I do take a beta blocker(metoprolol er) at night to help reduce the effects of the epinephrine surges along with pupropion er to keep dopamine levels normal through the night. Then an Adderall xr in the morning. That’s about the only way I can get normal sleep am function normally throughout the day.  Seriously, these three are like to holy grail of adult ADHD treatments as far as I can tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely not healthy, I was just hoping for a straightforward scientific explanation... Seems like there's a couple different possible causes though according to the wikipedia page. Thanks for the link!</p>
<p>Edit: I also notice that the wikipedia page doesn't explain the one around 10:30 PM very well other than &quot;resisting the melatonin peak causes a second wind&quot; like... okay, but how exactly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading this made me think of a recent experience, so adding it here. I recently had a case of insomnia and basically couldn't sleep at all for two nights in a row. The first night was ok, I just gave up trying to sleep at some point and played video games instead, got over the morning hump and got my second wind. The day passed without problem, almost as if I had actually slept. The second night, I actually felt more awake and alert than I did during the day (or indeed, during the first day prior to not sleeping). I was completely awake, clear headed and could focus. I considered just staying up and doing work, but I noticed that while my mind was completely alert, the effects of sleep deprivation were there, for example, the edge of my vision was.. wavy. Like I kepts noticing things moving when nothing was moving. So I ended up just lying in bed listening to music and not sleeping. Eventually late into the morning of the third day I fell asleep and after that the following nights were more or less ok.  </p>
<p>I just thought it was interesting that on the second sleepless night, I felt more awake and alert than I do on many normal days, but that other effects of sleep deprivation were definitely active. I don't think driving in that state would have been particularly safe, despite how alert I felt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, if I even get up to pee and then come back and lay down, all of a sudden I’m WIDE AWAKE. I don’t get it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's because my heart rate goes up when I get up (I have low blood pressure) so the adrenaline or whatever stimulates my heart rate to increase makes it harder for me to go to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that i’m asking pretty personal question but why do i, as an example, instead of passing that feeling of hungrines, get dizzy, wanna pass out and get really nervous? Does my body just works the other way or is it because i don’t have those internal stores? I am healthy 22year old, but rather skinny and short</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if I have hypoglycemia as I’ve never been tested or anything, but when I don’t eat I get shaky like I have Parkinson’s. It’s uncontrollable. It’s especially bad if I’ve not had any sugar all day. I get dizzy and terrible headaches. I tend to always have mints and stuff on me for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone giving you specific advice is talking out of their ass. You haven’t provided enough information here to give any specific recommendations. </p>
<p>A lot of hunger is mental. Generally when people go through hunger and then get past it and are fine it’s because they didn’t really need to eat. </p>
<p>Reasons you might feel weak/dizzy/etc could include low blood sugar, but if you still eat fairly regularly I don’t that’s the case. It could be a lack of electrolytes. Your body needs basic electrolytes to function (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium). I have plenty of experience with fasting and drinking mineral water is the difference between being hungry and feeling sick. </p>
<p>If you consume a lot of caffeine that alone could cause what you’re describing. </p>
<p>This thread is full of people spouting  complete nonsense. If you want more specific help you need to provide more specific information (regular diet, sleep, activity, supplements, conditions when the feeling occurs, etc) and only then will any of the advice be relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the reasons, but I recommend keeping a protein bar or something to prevent that! My wife is similar. Well, if she is in the least bit hungry she switches into angry mode. Nobody wants that. Me on the other hand, I'll forget to eat lunch if I'm doing something that catches my attention and I can be hungry, and feel hungry and just carry on without it (I think) affecting my mode. I mean, it does make me reach for junk food when it's within reach, but it doesn't make me yell at people.</p></div>		</li>
