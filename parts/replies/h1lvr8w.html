			<div class="markdown"><p>The book, Asleep by Molly Crosby, which covers the sleeping sickness in detail, makes a similar suggestion that it could be linked to the Spanish Flu because it’s appearance a disappearance (of new cases) happened during the same overall timeline. It did not show up as a side effect of the flu, however, as many of those who got it did not have any flu symptoms or had ever had the flu (that they could tell).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said “(that they could tell)” but Encephalitis in general can be caused by plenty of other diseases, like herpes, rabies and the measles (per Mayo Clinic’s description) which that were around at the same time as the Spanish flu and correlation is not causation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In Western Samoa, the 1918 influenza hit the island in November 1918 and cases of EL appeared over the next few years and disappeared. However, American Samoa had a quarantine and developed no cases of influenza or EL. </p>

<p>Interesting. You would think that maybe the quarantine prevented both influenza and whatever causes Encephalitis Lethargica from reaching American Samoa, but EL wasn't contagious (at least not by the time people were experiencing symptoms).</p></div>		</li>
