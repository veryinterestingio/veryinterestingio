			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, great question. We are definitely briefed on what we can discuss. Most of this can be found online, AstraZeneca's website among other places. <a href="https://Clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank">Clinicaltrials.gov</a> may have some info as well. All of what I said previously is given out in our informed consent.</p></div>		</li>
