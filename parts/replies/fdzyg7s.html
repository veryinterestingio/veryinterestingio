<p>sitting or laying for long periods decrease energy levels and reduce proper blood flow, stretching helps to increase blood flow and also relieves a lot of tension in your muscles from the rest. taking a break to stand and stretch helps in the long term and can even prevent things like high blood pressure, pulmonary embolisms etc. If i remember correctly. As for why you’re tired after, likely because your energy returns to lower levels after the circulation and muscles stiffen after stretching. All in all it’s still healthy to do stretch and not rest for extended periods. But this is from reading medical journals and abstracts for fun, only retained some of the key points, the mechanism is unknown to me</p></div>		</li>
