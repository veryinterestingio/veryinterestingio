			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  Humidity is a much bigger factor than the couple of degree difference in how thermostats work differently for heating vs cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how does humidity have an effect on the heater/ac in a car or split-cycle. Does the heater/ac have a humidity control that conditions the air with a certain level of humidity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AC removes humidity (or at least tried to) to avoid condensing water. That water will in turn damage parts and may provide a developing ground for bacterias and nasty stuff.</p>
<p>I worked on air conditioning systems on planes, and what we do there is bring the air under 0 celcius to get rid of all of the moisture, then heat it back to an OK temperature before sending it in the cabin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using an air conditioner, the air coming out of it will be less humid (have less water vapour per unit volume) than the air already in the room. This decreases the rooms relative humidity, decreasing how &quot;hot&quot; it feels. Since water is a better conductor of heat than air, and since humid air has more water in it per unit of volume than non-humid air, the humid air feels warmer than the drier air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water carries heat better than air. You can put your hand without danger in a hot oven (200°C), but I wouldn't dare you to plunge your hand in boiling water (100°C).
Thus moist air feels hotter when hot and colder when cold.
Furthermore, sweating doesn't work as well with high air humidity, which makes warm air feel even warmer.</p></div>		</li>
