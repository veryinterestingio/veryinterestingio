			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a book--and I forget the name or would link it-- that outlined how directed throwing skills may have significantly contributed to the enlargement of hominid brains and spurred the evolution into modern humans.  I have no idea how reliable it is but made a good case for it and was very interesting.  It's not necessarily a trivial matter to gauge distance, direction, weight and shape of the object, etc factor those into the motor responses required to target a desires point.  The notion was that the complex mathematical processing routines (subconscious, obviously) that increasing this skill took may have later been co-opted for more complex logic and analytical power generally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s still kinda impressive. Spider can do it on day two of being alive. I remember being five and still having trouble holding a pencil, much less throwing a ball accurate enough to kill prey.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It may sound pedestrian to us, but it's remarkably sophisticated for such a simple nervous system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stopped to think about how that might work out the simplest and wouldn't it be sufficient that they were &quot;just&quot; wired to instead of keeping the prey centered in their vision (whatever is center for their weird eyes), but to keep it stationary regardless where it is in the whole field of view? Then you will automatically intercept it assuming you aren't flying away of course. Doesn't sound too complex, but then again, I have no clue about what is complex in this context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a jumping spider on a picket fence who, from the top of one picket noticed a fly at the top of a picket four pickets away. The spider went down 8&quot;  to the cross brace, moved over four pickets, went cautiously up the picket, waited just out of sight near the top of the picket, then charged onto the top of the picket and caught the fly. The spider couldn't see the fly from the time in left the first picket until it charged over the top to catch the fly. At a minimum, the spider could count to four and keep track as it moved past the pickets!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think ants would be up there, but to total number of neurons implies the whole nervous system. So, insects that have a large number of sensory organs (bees, cockroaches, etc) will have a ton of neurons simply to move the information around. There are also some arthropods that get quite large (American Lobster, Robber Crab) that will have high neuron counts due to size alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hang on a second... I think you’re referring to the fact that some jumping spiders will do that defensive dance thing when they see themselves in a mirror. </p>
<p>That doesn’t actually indicate that they are able to recognize themselves, they simply see another spider in their territory and start to freak out because of their instincts.</p></div>		</li>
