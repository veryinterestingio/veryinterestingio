<p>If you've never exercised before, how about going for a half our walk? Or bike ride?</p>
<p>Take it slow so that it's still enjoyable, youre more likely to want to do it again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so not true! If you don't enjoy you'll stop doing it, it's that simple. Exercise just requires you to move around more. </p>
<p>The great thing about exercise is that the more you do it, the fitter you get, and the more able you are to get out of breath without feeling like you're dying.</p>
<p>Here are some more types of exercise that many people find enjoyable:</p>
<ul>
<li>gardening</li>
<li>salsa dancing</li>
<li>yoga</li>
<li>hiking</li>
<li>Pilates</li>
<li>couch to 5k</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many types, which will work wonders for your physical and mental health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently started exercising after an almost decade-long break, started with simple 2.5 km 30 minute daily walks in april, I'm up to 2 hours of walking and 1 hour of biking (10km walk, 20km ride) for 3 days out of every 4 (3 training days, 1 rest). </p>
<p>For someone who has been obese for almost two decades, I was surprised by how quickly it piles up.</p>

<p>This isn't true. Your body is a machine, and by moving it in any way whatsoever, you spend more fuel. It's that simple. My caloric deficit on training days is 1500kcal from just exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend you try brazilian jiu jitsu or kickboxing. Both would be fun and a surprisingly fast way for you to lose weight if you train frequently. Lots of stories of people losing lots of weight that way</p></div>		</li>
