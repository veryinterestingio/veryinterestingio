<p>As far as what it means for science, I honestly have no idea and hope someone can respond to this to shed more light on that.</p>

<p>Memory storage within quantum systems. I'm not sure if it would be more accurate to say the quantum equivalent of RAM or a HDD/SSD, or neither, but most talk for practical applications (that I'm aware of) is centered around quantum computers.</p>
<p>Or, more likely, one step closer to the Singularity.</p></div>		</li>

What, 100 years? And then two years later, our robot overlords will decide we're obsolete and destroy us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, once a fully functional and practical time crystal is synthesized, in theory, we'll send Adam Drake to 1916 Greece, 1941 Java, 1966 America, and 1991 Siberia to defeat the invading hordes of Aliens that have been harvesting biological materials to create Mutant Superweapons. Once he has defeated Leviathan, Cerberus, Moloch, and Beelzebub, respectively, he'll return to his own time, the near-future year of 2016, to take the fight to the artificially created comet the Aliens call home, and defeat his alien clone, the dreaded Tomegatherion.</p>
<p>This is all theory though. We won't know for sure until the year 2016.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm super fucking happy at how many people knew I was talking about Body Harvest for the N64 without my having to state what it was a reference to. Growing up I didn't know a lot of people who played the game, it was like a little secret treasure I knew about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Destroy us? Naw, that's a shortsighted, wasteful, human thing to do. </p>
<p>They will analyze us, find out our greatest weaknesses and fears, and find a way to make us transfer our energy to them indefinitely, probably via some currently unfathomable form of slavery. The way the Matrix had it figured, it could already be happening and we'd have no clue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vacuum tubes to &quot;modern&quot; PC's took about 40 years, give or take.
2020 would mark another 40 (give or take) years. Computing power growth is not additive nor multiplicative, it is exponential. Geometric, even.</p>
<p>In 2060, every human will have the equivalent of the global computing power of 2018 in their hands, and we'll still mostly use it to argue with 12 year olds over pointless nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhhh nope. Fractals repeat themselves over different scales, as in “they look the same when zoomed in”. </p>
<p>For crystals, they look the same whenever you, the observer, makes a spatial translation by a lattice vector, i.e. at fixed intervals in space. </p></div>		</li>
