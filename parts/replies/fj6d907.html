			<div class="markdown"><p>The latest guideline is still 30:2 compressions to breaths. For bystanders only breaths are not recommended. This was done because the AHA found people wouldn't initiate cpr because they didn't want to do mouth to mouth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>now I know i am smart...so this cannot be a dumb question.  But am I or the person I am performing CPR on supposed to be wearing the compression shorts?  Also if it is them, do I have to put them on correct or is over their normal clothes enough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I thought the last one I looked at recommended compressions only... seems like it keeps changing!</p>
<p>Still, I just go by what the boss says - not AHA recommendations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been in ems for 10 years. The compression rate for us has not changed in that time. But if may be different for bystander cpr vs provider classes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  It's also noteworthy that it kinda depends on what started things on whether bystander compression only for may work.</p>
<p>Sudden arrhythmia?  Sure, great idea.  There is plenty of oxygen in the lungs just start the compressions and find a defibrillator.  Which is most adults who have a chance of survival anyway.</p>
<p>Something go wrong with the lungs?  (Drowning, choking, primary lung problem?). The heart probably didn't stop until much of the oxygen was gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current guidance from the Resuscitation Council in the UK and I think this extends to the AHA is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Compressions and breaths in a 30:2 ratio is preferred with rescue breaths for drowning or infants.</p>
</li>
<li>If you're not willing to do breaths, then doing compressions only is better than not doing anything.</li>
</ol>
<p>This does not mean that compressions only are preferred, just preferred to inaction. It's a subtle but important point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their answer is correct.</p>
<p>To expand on a detail there: air is roughly 21% oxygen, and I was taught that if you breathe in and breathe out immediately, the air you exhale is about 16% oxygen</p></div>		</li>
