			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an entoptic image! You're actually seeing your own white blood cells going through the blood vessels in your retina. Next time you see it you can notice that the little squiggles always follow the same paths, because your vessels don't move.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct! It's the shadow your white blood cells are casting on your retina. </p>
<p>There were some early experiments with people who were sick and had a low or high number of white blood cells. The number of squiggly moving objects in their vision was directly related to their white blood cell count. There's an old illustration out there somewhere.</p>
<p>If you want to see your capillaries, there's a technique that ophthalmologists use where a small light is held next to your eye and shined into the pupil from an angle. You can experiment with a small pen light to get the same effect. I wouldn't recommend doing it with anything brighter, but it's very cool to see a whole network of branching vessels suddenly appear in your vision when you get the angle just right!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Funny fact sometimes I just close my eyes and thank each one of my organs individually. It’s incredible to think what your organs do 24 hours a day to keep you alive.</p></div>		</li>
