In our society, only the federal government possesses the reach and authority to police the accuracy of a consumer product label. It's impossible for consumers at the point of purchase to accurately assess whether what's on the label is in the bottle and that what's in the bottle is on the label. That's been true since before the 1906 Pure Food &amp; Drug Act, and it remains true today. If you want quality products for consumers that are what they say they are and do what they say they do, you need regulation and enforcement. When it comes to consumer goods, industry self-regulation simply is not a thing.</p>
<p>As for your wariness of industry-funded studies, that’s fair! It’s also why it was so important to everyone involved that this study be peer-reviewed and published in an open-access journal. We show our work so you don’t have to believe us. You can look at the methods, data, and analysis and draw your own conclusions. We 100% agree that there should be more research done on cannabinoids by independent researchers. Caliper’s CEO likes to rant that this is the type of study a consumer-focused food regulator should want to do themselves simply because tens of millions of Americans consume CBD daily, and food regulators should care more about food safety than pharmaceutical competition policy. Unfortunately, we can’t make independent researchers do independent research, so we do the best science we can and hopefully it spurs further work by others. This is a novel field and it deserves far more research than it’s gotten to date.</p></div>		</li>
