			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that most bones have redundant blood supply: if one vessel is severed it doesn’t mean the whole bone dies. There are a few exceptions such as the head of the femur or the scaphoid bone of the wrist that don’t have redundancy. Breaks in these areas can result in <em>avascular necrosis</em> whereby part of the bone dies due to blood flow disruptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting, I had never heard of that before. Could that be why often when people fall and suffer a fractured neck of femur they end up having surgery to fix it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially, it changes what type of surgery will be required. The blood supply to the head of femur comes from the Circumflex artery which wraps around the neck of femur. If the break is above that artery then the head of femur will need to be replaced by a prosthesis during a surgery called a hemiathroplasty (hemi - half, artho- joint, plasty- modification). If the break is bellow the artery, also known as an extracapsular fracture, then we can fix it in place with a cool mechanism called a Dynamic Hip Screw. This is a big screw that fixes the two pieces of bone back together for them to heal.
What determines whether a fracture will be managed surgically or conservatively is complicated but it comes down to a simple principle : is the patient more likely to die from the operation or from the immobility caused by the fracture. A fracture that is severely displaced (when the portions of bone move far away from each other) will be very unstable and heal poorly. The patient is likely to lose all function in that hip, no longer be able to walk and will be in a lot of pain. Being immobile is actually quite dangerous because you can get blood clots. So in that case surgery is the best bet. On the other hand if the fracture is impacted, which is where the two bits of bone are forced into each other, that can be quite stable and for older more frail patients you might want to manage them conservatively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Bone is mostly composed of an inorganic mineral that makes it hard and strong and stuff, but there are plenty of cells living within that structure, creating and maintaining it. It's not really that different from any other tissue in the body, in that living, metabolising cells exist within an extracellular structure which is  not exactly &quot;alive&quot; in its own right.</p>
<p>Also, the centre of the bone contains bone marrow, which is essential for maintaining the blood for the whole body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t really need to realign. You form new blood vessels or rely on other blood vessels that also supply blood to the same area as the damaged vessels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>U/yarnspinner19 replied below with this if it answers your question</p>
<p>The bleeding from these vessels being damaged is an essential part of fracture repair. It produces a haematoma which holds the fractured ends together before the healing process begins. The first stage is granulation tissue formation which is the stage where new blood vessels would form (angiogenesis) to revascualrise the area.</p></div>		</li>
