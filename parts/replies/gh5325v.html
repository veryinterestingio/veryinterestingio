			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. And I know there are supplements like St John’s Wort that are purported to increase serotonin. But I believe that OP is asking why they don’t see supplements of neurotransmitters themselves. For instance, why can’t they buy a bottle with pills containing 5mg of serotonin like they can with melatonin. And the answer to that is because neurotransmitters themselves are unable to cross the blood brain barrier, so those supplements wouldn’t do anything</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take your point although just because a supplement wouldn't do anything doesn't explain why it wouldn't be sold. The supplements shelf is full of things that would apply to in equal measure.  I wonder if it's difficult to manufacture or doesn't escape regulation like other supplements. Many ways to slice his question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't &quot;neurotransmitters&quot; already in the brain? </p>
<p>Serotonin's in the gut &amp; rest of the bodyy too, so the bbb just keeps some of the seratonin from getting into the brain where the rest of it already is?  Why is that bad?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before everyone rushes out to buy L-DOPA, be warned that it’s not great to flood the brain and body with random extra dopamine. </p>
<p>Dopamine breaks down to relatively toxic substances in the brain. Under normal conditions your brain can handle it (obviously) but putting extra L-DOPA and therefore dopamine into random spaces in your brain means random toxic dopamine metabolites will also be floating around. </p>
<p>This is one of the theories to explain why Parkinson’s patients go downhill quickly after being prescribed L-DOPA. </p>
<p>The fact that some healthy people willingly take L-DOPA boggles my mind. And no, you do not have a dopamine deficiency unless you have Parkinson’s, regardless of what you may have read online.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldnt be too much of a search for you personally either. Just a quick google search for &quot;supplement - neurotransmitter - ncbi&quot; and you get plenty of sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought my ADHD medication (dexamphetamine) gave me more dopamine or at least made my brain create more dopamine. It's obviously not open for neurotypical people but there are pills to get dopamine. Or is the happy chemical dopamine something different from the neurotransmitter dopamine? I don't know much about it so please correct and inform me where possible or necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So dopamine isn't the &quot;happy chemical&quot;. Although dopamine is related to the reward pathway, the chemical that makes you feel good for a reward is called &quot;endorphins&quot; (endo- for endogenous and -orphine for morphine). Since morphine was discovered before endorphines, they actually named it after the drug. We already know the negative effects of taking too much &quot;morphine&quot; to get extra endorphin stimulation...</p>
<p>Dopamine is actually related to <em>craving</em> things. So one of the things your dextroamphetamine is really good at, is making you desire things, the natural reward you get from completing tasks is largely untouched, but the driving forces that make you want those rewards, are greatly increased. One of the side effects of this medication can become obsession, hyper-fixation, and developing ticks related. It helps adhd symptoms because of the extra motivation.</p>
<p>Mice that didn't have any dopamine receptors in their brain would let themselves starve rather than try to find food because they had no motivation at all, however these same mice would still enjoy food when they actually ate it and receive the natural neural rewards. Mice who had extra dopamine receptors would walk over electrified floors to get food, and allow themselves bodily pain to get their food. <em>interpreted as extra motivation</em></p>
<p>Worth noting dextroamphetamine also stimulates the adrenaline response in the brain. Which provides increased energy, while decreasing appetite. Basically high jacking the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response of the body. The extra energy provided here is also thought to help people suffering from ADHD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, thanks for taking the time to explain this, I didn't know a few of the ADHD things you say here. </p>
<p>Can you elaborate a bit on the ticks? Because I'd like to be aware of them when or if I develope them (I've only been on dexamphetamine for a bit over a year, used methylphenidate before that) </p>
<p>And besides that I'm really interested in the last paragraph. Because I know it doesn't give more energy, I just &quot;tap in your future energy source&quot; because afterwards I can be verryyy tired.</p>
<p>And what do you mean with the fight or flight part? Like I know what it's like to be in constant fight or flight mode (slightly overdosed on methylphenidate once (I had forgotten I had already taken my meds)) and this medication doesn't feel like that at all. </p>
<p>So yeah would love to hear more of your knowledge and where you got it :)</p></div>		</li>
