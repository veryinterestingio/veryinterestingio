This allows seeds for desert annual plants to only germinate after soaking winter rains and not after a summer thunderstorm when it will be dry and 110°F again in a few days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty cool how these different adaptations came to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stratification is the term. Not necessarily frozen, just a specific cold period followed by whatever warmer temps it likes. The cold period(s) counts off a metabolic &quot;clock&quot; during which time the plant can't/doesn't grow. It waits for this clock to run to completion before it will ever germinate, no matter what you do to it (generally speaking).</p>
<p>The purpose is to avoid germination during autumn, where conditions might be &quot;ideal,&quot; but it would be undesirable to grow before it can protect itself during winter. Or perhaps a warm spell during winter, where the plant would then be killed when cold returns. Plants using this system want <em>spring</em>, not just ideal conditions at any given time.</p></div>		</li>
