			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works on software that does DSP (signal processing) on human voice signals, I would also point out that in many cases detecting whether there's a signal worth passing down the chain to the higher CPU-consuming analysis steps is really cheap even for a non-dedicated general purpose CPU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, that's definitely a potential issue, so there's a bit more complexity as far as making the software know how, when, and for how long to pay attention, but those things can be application specific. However, the code running to do that job (or hardware implementation) doesn't have to be nearly as compute heavy as a neutral network or some other downstream stuff.</p></div>		</li>
