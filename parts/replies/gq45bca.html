			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, evolution doesn't optimize.  If it works, it's more likely to be carried on (even that isn't a guarantee, mutations that are beneficial often still get 'weeded out'), and if it doesn't help procreation then it's less likely to be carried on.  Our biological history is full of countless failures to get the imperfect &quot;just good enough&quot; species we have today.  Evolution doesn't optimize these systems, if it's good enough to procreate, it's good enough to carry forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good example of this is human childbirth! Humans have one of the more difficult births of all primates because when we evolved to walk upright, our pelvis became narrower and overtime our brains became bigger, meaning our heads did. Nature doesn't care if childbirth is <em>easy</em>, it just cares that the job still happens so as a result, birth is still a pretty hard process.(*)</p>
<p>(*) : Human childbirth is also complicated in the modern world with medical intervention but even without complicstions from medical intervention, Human childbirth is still hard on the human body</p></div>		</li>

<p>More importantly, there's no intelligence behind evolution.  No one decided what things should do in biology.  They just do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not actually sure of the specific mechanics or the definition of shock, I think you might have meant to reply to someone else? I'm not really a part of the 'shock' conversation.</p>
<p>The basic original question was, why isn't the pain system perfect, more than, what is the specific mechanics of pain. And my answer to the general question is, evolution does not bring biology to perfect solutions. At least not on the time frame we have had time to experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>neurogenic shock is what would happen if you experience too much pain that your body can't handle. its a medical term. i don't think biology or evolution really fall into the levels of stress outside of normal human capabilities. Like if you stress test a person there is a breaking point in where most if not all humans would never be in that situation normally hence shock happens.</p></div>		</li>
