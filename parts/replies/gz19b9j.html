			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa thatâ€™s actually really awesome. Also that salt thing is super scary to think about. Cause like in my mind, Iâ€™m not getting what exactly changed from point A to B. Why the characteristics are different when itâ€™s the same elements in both. The only difference to me is that they are together in one and I donâ€™t get how that makes that much of a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like you're thinking of an atom as a singular building block. Theyre actually made up of other things themselves.</p>
<p>Instead, think of an atom as like a tiny monster surrounded by guards. The monster is the core of the atom, and it's hungry. The guards are the electrons that float around the atom. They want to stay close to the monster to do their job, but not too close - they don't want to get eaten. </p>
<p>When oxygen bonds with a hydrogen, what's happening is the oxygen monster is yanking on hydrogen's guards, trying to eat them. It doesn't manage this because hydrogen is still holding on to them, so they end up in a tug-of-war stalemate.</p>
<p>Oxygen is a lot stronger than hydrogen, so it's able to get a very strong grip on hydrogen's guard. But oxygen is also surrounded by a lot more guards, so it has to work harder to reach past them. Hydrogen is weaker, but it only has one guard. Since there's fewer guards interfering, it manages to grab on to one of oxygen's guards as well. The tug of war means these two poor guards are now stuck in-between the two atoms, and can't go on their normal patrols. </p>
<p>Now, this has an extra effect: hydrogen now has a side that's completely unguarded. It may not be a very strong atom, but it also has nothing stopping it now. This creates a big change in its behavior. It will start reaching for the guards on other molecules - specifically, on guards of other Oxygens nearby. Now hydrogen isn't strong enough to properly latch onto these guards, but it's basically a bit grabby, and tries to keep close to them.</p>
<p>The result is that the water molecules all stick kinda close to each other instead of floating away easily. When stuff sticks kinda close, it's a liquid. When it floats away, it's a gas. And if you cool water significantly, the guards get cold and stop moving so much. This means the hydrogens can hold on strongly enough to stop flowing past each other. And this is ice.</p>
<p><em>note: when water freezes, its actually the jiggling of the whole water molecule that slows down, not just the guards. But that's harder to fit into the analogy lol</em></p>
<p><em>edit 2: to add, for the curious, this effect is why water molecules are shaped the way they are. Oxygen pulls strongly, so it moves Hydrogen's single guard significantly. Hydrogen is weaker, so it just latches on to an available guard that's particularly accessible, though it does restrain its movement. There's two spots in Oxygen's guard formation like this, and they're not opposite each other - they're kinda next to each other. The result is water forms its characteristic v shape</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fundamentally it's because a molecule is *not* just a mixture of the atoms making it up--it has a different structure. It's the structure that determines its characteristics, not the atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is a chemical reaction has happened, itâ€™s not like just a mixture. The characteristics of an element mostly come from its electron structure, when you react chemicals together itâ€™s electrons being exchanged or shared which changes the electron structure and therefore their properties.
Hydrogen and oxygen are gases at room temperatures because their molecules donâ€™t have very strong forces between each other, water on the other hand does have very strong intermolecular forces due to its structure and so is a liquid at room temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, sodium really wants to get rid of an electron. If chloride took it, then sodium doesn't want to get rid of any more so water is safe. That one electron makes it go from borderline explosive, to necessary for life.</p>
<p>If you just put sodium in water it would violently rip OH^- from water in order to give up that electron and form NaOH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, water molecules have a &quot;negative&quot; side and a &quot;positive&quot; side. The negative side will attract the positively charged Na ions while the positive side gets the Cl ones, so you sort of end up with a split sodium chloride molecule stuck on either side of a water molecule. None of this involves elemental chlorine or sodium and so their properties still don't apply.</p></div>		</li>
