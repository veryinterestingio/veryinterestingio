			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been prescribed that because I cough and cough and cough and cough... It lasts for months. They gave me it, worked miracles. I used it during my next 2 rounds of getting sick, then got a refill. Used for a few more, then asked for another refill. I love that crap, it helps me kick the cough in a week or two instead of months.</p></div>		</li>
