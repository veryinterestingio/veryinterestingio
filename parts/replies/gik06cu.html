			<div class="markdown"><p>That is &quot;Tempurature Danger Zone.&quot; If you're working in a proper commercial kitchen, it will be littered with different types of thermometers to check the internal temp of all meats and dishes that go out. At a buffet, the trays are kept above the danger temperature and those that do not have a gauge/thermometer on the side are temp checked every hour to ensure they didnt hit the danger zone.</p>
<p>There is an amount of time set by state-wide food services that deems how long they may stay at unsafe temperatures, how to reheat and store foods, as well as how to safely cater an event. Places serving food (in my state) my have someone staffed (or manager staffed) with a ServeSafe completion (teaches the state rules on food).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some bacteria create toxic chemicals that can still hurt you after the food is cooked.  (Also it might taste awful even if it doesn't kill you.)</p>
<p>If you're thawing and cooking it within, like, an hour, I don't think there's any issue.  But you wouldn't want to let raw meat sit at room temperature all day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What matters is how long it sits out.  In the United States, commercial food safety regulations say there is a four hour window a perishable food item may be in the &quot;temperature danger zone&quot;.  This means when you receive an item from a vendor, it must be outside the TDZ, hotter or colder, then while you are preparing it, it can be in the TDZ for a maximum of 4 hours before it is considered &quot;spoiled&quot;.  If you cook the item, it must reach specific internal temperature, then can be held in the TDZ for an additional 4 hours before it must be discarded.</p></div>		</li>
