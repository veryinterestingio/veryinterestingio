			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue Woad was pretty common. The dye extracted from woad is the same as indigo but in lesser concentrations. You can see a bunch of pictures of the process here: <a href="https://localcolordyes.com/dyeing/" target="_blank">https://localcolordyes.com/dyeing/</a>. In any case you can actually make a pretty vivid blue through multiple rounds of dying. But I imagine chemically it might not be possible to mix the dye with other colors since the blue is the result of oxygenating?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using woad to dye things is so much work, the indigotin content is pretty insignificant unless you have lots of time in your hands ( people did back when!)</p>
<p>It's not that hard to stack dyes with indigo, because indigo has a pretty unique mechanism of bonding to the fabric. That being said, it is a very high PH, usually around 11-13 and that can undo some previous dyes if they can't stand the process. You can do the other way around and dye things after indigo dips, but your mordant might not take if you didn't neutralize the indigo.</p></div>		</li>
