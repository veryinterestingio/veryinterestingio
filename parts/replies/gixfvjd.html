			<div class="markdown"><p>I have found that 8 inch cogs are about the largest one should consider when shopping for cogs. Any cog bigger than 8 inches just becomes cumbersome and difficult to hold. Its also important that the cog have a sufficient thickness, so that its able to perform without becoming bent or otherwise deformed. Cogs should also be of sufficient hardness, which will vary based on how often they are used, and for how long. A cog that is not hard enough for its anticipated use will often experience premature wear.</p>
<p>This is a fun game.</p></div>		</li>
