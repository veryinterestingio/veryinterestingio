			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an awesome explanation, thanks. I wonder, though, if we have such terrible accuracy for location of the star, how do we manage to measure them wiggling a bit to detect planets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What we measure is not the position of the star, but the fluctuations in brightness and color. The patterns of when the brightness changes can tell us about the number of planets and a bit about their orbits, while amount of change in brightness as well as small changes in color of the light can tell us about the size and composition of the planets.</p>
<p>For example, take a planet like mercury. It's quite small, so it doesn't block much light, but it is very close to the sun, so it orbits quickly. That would cause the sun to look ever so slightly dimmer for a short time, and that would happen frequently. On the other end of the scale, something like Jupiter would cause extended periods of significant dimming, but it wouldn't occur very often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the Radial Velocity method, which actually does detect the star's movement directly towards and away from us, by analyzing the frequency shifts of the light due to the Doppler effect.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we're not measuring the star's physical jitter but the light being obscured by planets that align very briefly with the Earth and the star?</p></div>		</li>

<p>But that was a very succinct and appropriate answer, thank you</p></div>		</li>
