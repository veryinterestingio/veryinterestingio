			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah i can tell you for a fact that one summer we had a work conference in vegas, and it was like 115 degrees out.  We had to walk from one conference area to another, and when a gust of wind picked up it did NOT feel colder than the ambient air, it felt almost exactly like opening an oven and looking into it and getting hit with the heat that comes out.  </p>
<p>Fun fact, that's why the thermometers used to take official measurement also have a &quot;wet bulb&quot; vs. &quot;dry bulb&quot; distinction, and they are placed a certain distance away from buildings and tall objects, are in a well ventilated but enclosed space to keep the sunlight off them, and they are built only over dirt or grass and not concrete or other things that can absorb and radiate heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are also describing a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/sling-psychrometer" target="_blank">sling psychrometer</a>, a tool for measuring relative humidity.</p>
<p>&quot;It contains two thermometers, one of which is covered with a wick saturated with ambient temperature liquid water. These two thermometers are called <em>dry bulb</em> and <em>wet bulb</em>. When the sling psychrometer is spun rapidly in the air, the evaporation of the water from the wick causes the wet bulb thermometer to read lower than the dry bulb thermometer. After the psychrometer has been spun long enough for the thermometers to reach <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/equilibrium-temperature" target="_blank">equilibrium temperatures</a>, the unit is stopped and the two thermometers are quickly read. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/psychrometric-chart" target="_blank">psychrometric chart</a> (or table) is then used to convert the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/dry-bulb-temperature" target="_blank">dry bulb temperature</a> <em>TDB</em> and the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/wet-bulb-temperature" target="_blank">wet bulb temperature</a> <em>TWB</em> into humidity information. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fellow above is describing (effect one) the behavior of boundary layers. In stagnant air this layer is thicker and more insulative. Moving air makes this layer thinner and as a result the heat transfer rate increases (and that's what you feel as colder). This also works in hot places, like if you were driving through a hot desert, opened your window, and held your hand outside. The breeze feels like a hair dryer on your hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I certainly could have stated that more clearly: wind reduces the distance over which the temperature gradient occurs. The shorter distance  between two temperatures means the heat will exchange more quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature gradient is degree per unit length. So by shortening the distance with the same temperature difference, the temperature gradient is increased and heat exchange happens more quickly.  (to clarify)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing you're talking about reducing is the laminar boundary layer thickness. The laminar boundary layer is the region close to a surface where the fluid flow is laminar and therefore convective heat transfer cannot occur (picture the fluid &quot;sticking&quot; to a surface). You're limited to conduction which is very slow. Faster bulk fluid velocity (i.e. wind speed) results in a thinner boundary layer, allowing faster heat transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe he misspoke with that statement (since the rest of it is essentially correct).  It increases the temp gradient by more quickly &quot;replenishing&quot; the air closest to your body that is now warm with fresh air that is colder.  Actually I think this is an awkward way of explaining it.  The reason you feel colder in higher winds is because of a basic law of heat transfer and the formula that governs convection, which says that heat loss, or the feeling of being cold, is directly proportional to the velocity of a fluid, in this case air, across a surface.  Essentially air at a colder temp than 98 degree F (your body temp) will always cool your body, but if its stagnant or not moving it will warm up as it takes heat from your body and then the temp gradient will be less which will lessen the heat removal.  So what you want (if your goal was to cool off) would be to replenish this warming air with fresh, still cold air. The faster this happens, the faster you lose heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So air at a warmer temp than you will heat you up faster? In stagnant hotter air, will you create a layer of &quot;cooler&quot; air around you as you absorb it's heat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat moves in 3 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Radiation is heat lost into the environment/ atmosphere via gradient higher to lower.  This is heat (reactionary byproduct) that slowly emits outward  from our body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduction is heat lost through touching something else.  You put your had on ?(an inactive stove, it feels cold, you are passing heat to it.  Touch that same stove when it’s on and it’s hot and it is passing heat to you.  Conduction via gradient.</p>
</li>
<li>Convection is heat that is actively moves away from the body.  Air current is a natural vector for this.  As the wind moves by you, it will pull the heat you are naturally radiating allowing for a larger gradient and more heat to leave more rapidly.</li>
</ol>
<p>The wind will work mostly through convection to take the heat from you, with the resulting sensation of feeling cooler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also the case that rate of heat transfer increases with rate of motion when it comes to convection. Specifically, fast wind is better than slow wind.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, if the ambient temperature is above your skin temperature, high winds will feel warmer low winds, assuming equal evaporation rates.</p></div>		</li>
