			<div class="markdown"><p>You should check out the works of Czech folklorist Karel Jaromír Erben.  Several of his works were adapted into Symphonic poems by Antonin Dvorak.  Noon Witch, Golden Spinning Wheel, Water Goblin, Wild Dove.  There’s murder, dismemberment and reanimating, abduction and impregnation, more murder, torment leading to suicide.  Typical fairy tale stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many came way before the Grimm brothers made their take on them. And they typically do represent the wisdom or world view at the time.</p>
<p>Early versions of the tales often see characters without any virtues becoming blessed or cursed without any implied morality. The story of a girl who family gives them the last of their money to go m]buy food, but who spends it on a pretty doll instead. The doll turns out to be magic and everything turns out great. Their world was random, their outcomes unpredictable.</p>
<p>But during the Age of Reason these stories didn’t make sense to readers. So they rewrote the tales. Those that worked hard were rewarded. Those that cheated or were lazy were punished. Beauty was valuable, but loyalty was worth more. Charles Perrault rewrote many of these stories in the late 1700’s.</p>
<p>In the 19th century the brothers Grimm rewrote many of these stories. And they are cautionary tales.  It the intent isn’t to scare children. It just reflects the world they know. A world where being a good, loyal member of your community and family is what kept you safe. And being selfish, cruel and weak will get you killed.</p>
<p>Then you have the Disney versions of the tale intended to reflect a modern worldview. Early on a world where women are to be sweet and treasured and men are to be brave and true. Disney even changed this in their latest tales, allowing women to save themselves as another reflection (albeit late) of a more modern worldview. But along the way they show the ideal values of good winning in the end, and that even the bad can be saved and redeemed. In grimms Cinderella the wicked stepsisters end up having the crows eat out their eyes. In Disney’s they don’t get the prince, but they come to befriend and accept Cinderella.</p></div>		</li>
