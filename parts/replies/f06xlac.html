			<div class="markdown"><p>That can’t be everything though? I’m only having one eye and things in VR look just as deep as real life, while 3D movies and screens do not. So it has to be more than the two pictures being slightly offset, since I only ever see one.</p>
<p>Not trying to say you are wrong, but this genuinely amazes me. I expected VR not to work for exactly this reason, but it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be because of the head tracking. Because by moving your head you get a difference point of view which your brain can analyze, the same way it does in real life. Also if you only have one eye you don,t see depth as well as others in real life too, so you're comparing two similar things, just not the same as everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, being able to move your head gives you the multiple images that having two eyes normally would. Those multiple images are then stitched together by your brain to form a 3D mental picture of the scene. You also get depth perception from motion parallax- closer objects appear to move more than further ones. It just so happens that for our pirate donut, those images are separated by time... but that's not a problem for the brain.</p>
<p>Whereas in a 3D movie / screen, the perspective is fixed, the depths are usually flattened a little to not give people motion sickness, and you're stationary in the chair.</p>
<p>There's some work on pigeons that suggests their head bobbing contributes to depth perception. I also vaguely remember a study that showed animals which had their heads restrained lost some depth perception ability, but that's a fuzzy memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh haven’t thought about that. That actually explains it, especially since movement and shadows are about the only (or at least main) ways to determine depth with one eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you close one eye, you are just watching a movie. Any 3d effect is your brain. </p>
<p>Try having a friend place two unfamiliar or re - scaled objects in a space without references and you won't be able to tell which one is closer or farther.</p>
<p>If you close one eye on rl you will also think you are perceiving 3d, until you try to catch a ball. Vr is no different in that aspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting! Part of your depth perception could be due to the total immersion of the headset. Not only is your peripheral vision cut off from the outside world, you are also getting the tracking of your real head in virtual space. That constant, subtle movement allows you to see &quot;around&quot; objects, which you can't do with a static camera in 3D cinema. That might be why it feels more real to you. But, it would be interesting to see how you would respond to a 3D cinema <em>inside</em> of VR. Would it be more immersive, or just as flat as reality? Something to ponder. :)</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your perspective!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve wondered about that too. Maybe my brain is even more inclined to believe VR is real because my real world is more flat too. I’d really be interested in research about that, but I understand it’s not a pressing issue for researchers. Maybe one day someone will find out more about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating, thank you so much for writing all of this up! It’s so amazing that you’re getting a masters in that. How can I learn more about it?? Do you have any other resources you can recommend to learn about 3D storytelling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Master's is technically in animation (UCLA), but I did my undergraduate thesis on stereo-3D animation and will be doing my master's thesis in 3D as well. The book I linked, &quot;3D Storytelling&quot; by Bruce Block and Phillip &quot;Captain 3D&quot; McNally is the most succinct book on stereoscopy today. McNally has an older, longer book (whose title I can't find at the moment, the cover is green/white/purple) that is not as compact, but also useful. Surprisingly, most directors and storyboard artists never take a class in stereoscopy, and as a result most stereo work is an afterthought in post-production. Films like Scorcese's <em>Hugo</em> and Cameron's <em>Avatar</em> are the exception to the rule. That being said, there's definitely a need for stereo-aware creators in pre-production, and stereo artists certainly welcome more stereo awareness on set!</p>
<p>The best thing you can do to research stereoscopy is to watch and create 3D films! Go to 3D screenings in the cinema (the AMC subscription pass lets you upgrade to 3D for free!), watch them at home with red/blue glasses, and read up on stereoscopy books (anything by Ray Zone is amazing). Then start creating your own 3D stills and video. I managed to make a jerry-rigged 3D camera out of a box and two appropriately-oriented disposable cameras, but you can also use apps on your smartphone or an old Nintendo 3DS. Try out the exercises in &quot;3D Storytelling&quot;, and then try your hand at 3D filmmaking. You can use two identical smartphones with the lenses 2.5 inches apart to make your own 3D video - or buy/rent an actual camera once you get serious. You can also use a stereo camera inside of 3D animation programs like Maya or Blender, so if you can animate, give that a try, too! :D Feel free to PM me if you have more questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think at that point, you might as well go all the way and hook the computer up directly to your brain/vision processing nerves. An ophthalmologist might be better able to answer that question, though. :)</p></div>		</li>
