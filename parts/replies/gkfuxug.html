<p>Yeah, calculus does enter that explanation somehow, if you want to look for it, but I wanted to keep things simple and didn't mention any big words. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent explanation. A very long time ago I got this question wrong on an AP or IB Physics practice test and what you described are exactly the kind of thought experiments I had to go through to accept the right answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the answer before I opened the comments, but still have a question based on what you said:</p>
<p>Suppose I have a straight piece of wire that I curve into a donut and heat. Since everything is expanding at the same rate, does that mean there's a slight compression on the atoms on the inside of the ring and a little expansion on those outside? </p>
<p>Would the outside ever potentially crack (depending on the substance) because of this (assuming the stressors I'm mentioning do exist)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that the whole solid expands in a uniform fashion (including the hole) is what guarantees there is no internal stress.</p>
<p>All distances between all atoms expand the same - you're just scaling up the whole thing. Any other scheme would produce internal stress. But that guarantees the hole also expands.</p>
<hr />
<p>Start with the distances between atoms, visualize how all those distances grow exactly the same, and that gives you two things automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lack of internal stress</li>
<li>the fact that the hole also expands</li>
</ul>
<p>And yes, there are cases where internal stress becomes manifest in a solid when temperature changes - but that's always because things are not homogeneous. Maybe the solid itself is not homogeneous, or maybe you're just heating up this one corner preferentially.</p></div>		</li>
