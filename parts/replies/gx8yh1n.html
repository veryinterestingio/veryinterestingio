<p>An attacker can also reject/reorder successfully mined blocks from other miners, effectively claiming 100% of the rewards for mining. This is some pretty serious return.</p>
<p>Obviously you'd have to weigh that against the potential devaluation (in real terms) of the currency if an attack causes everyone to lose faith in it. But it's not trivially true that in a traditional POW network 51% attacks are not worth the cost, I don't think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, those are called seed nodes, like the sibling commenter said.</p>
<p>But besides these, there are also &quot;neighbour&quot; or &quot;local peer&quot; discovery mechanisms in p2p protocols, where the software just broadcasts a &quot;somebody, anybody please talk to me&quot; packet over your local network, and other nodes already on that network then connect to <em>it</em>, and tell it the addresses of more peers who <em>aren't</em> on the local network from there.</p>
<p>This doesn't do much if your network is a little isolated pond (like the LAN created by a residential gateway modem), but it's great for bootstrapping nodes in big LANs like offices, universities, cloud hosting providers, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even if 99% of the computers running crypto go poof, there's no issue. Crypto keeps running as long as there is one miner. One computer. Even an old laptop can run the entire blockchain provided there is sufficient hard disk space. It is only computationally hard because the network is big, the complexity of the algorithm adjust itself to the size and complexity of the mining network. But this goes way beyond eli5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That kind of depends on the cryptocurrency though. If 99% of bitcoin miners go poof, it would essentially ruin bitcoin because it would take 1000 minutes to mine each block and the difficulty adjustment would take several years. The chain would be completely crippled for several years.</p>
<p>There are other cryptocurrencies that solved this problem though.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Which ones? </p>
<p>As I see it. The factored growth of computing power needed to calculate Bitcoin transactions is a fundamental problem since the currency will inevitably reach a computational plateau in the future, right?</p>
<p>But isn't this increasing complexity at the core of blockchain technology? How have other currencies solved it?</p>
<p>I'm admittedly a bit of a Noob in crypto.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If somehow 99% of miners did go poof, they would very soon be replaced by other people as the massive profit of mining a block is realized.  We might fall back from all these ASICs to CPU and GPU mining again as I'm assuming what you mean is all the ASICs disappear.</p>
<p>It is very unlikely to happen though.  Unless an asteroid hits the planet it would take months to shut down all these miners in any kind of organized fashion.  Also in such a case an emergency difficulty adjustment would probably be released to the core software.  Something that is like &quot;after block ###### reset difficulty to new value&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, I did not think of that. Difficulty adjustment is roughtly every two weeks, but this is indeed based on block height. And if you would reduce mining power with 99%, you would indeed increase the time between blocks very, very significant.</p>
<p>It would however create a great incentive for 'new' miners to come online, as they would become a significant part of the total mining pool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many newer blockchains that use significantly less power than BTC. BTC is a &quot;first&quot; technology, imagine the first ever television compared to what we have today. The fact that BTC can even hang with banks who have been making digital transactions for many many years it's kind of shocking. As new blockchains come out that less than 1% will turn into a very large number, and hopefully the power usage will be very small.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, solar flares do not destroy computer networks, never have and never will. They might affect power grids with long conductors, high currents and massive distances. The interference of a solar flare is just too small. An EMP would be too small too. </p>
