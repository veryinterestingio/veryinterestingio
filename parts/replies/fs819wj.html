			<div class="markdown"><p>The inertia of bad habits.  A lot of places have things set up so that their business is open 5 days a week, and all of their employees come in for all five of those days.  Managers are worried that switching to a rotating 4-day schedule for the employees would be too complicated, or insist that since they've always done it that way, it's fine.  Or they're worried that if they outright close down for Fridays, they'll lose business or offend some customers.</p>
<p>But now, they're <em>forced</em> to limit their hours, or let people work from home, or whatever.  And they're seeing that it's not actually so bad. Especially some of the crucial businesses; they're letting salespeople or designers work from home, they're restricting their hours instead of being open 24/7, whatever.  And they're realizing that they're not <em>really</em> hurting that much as a result.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are stubborn, and even if there are a thousand positive studies that doing something has positive results, they need to see it in action before they ever believe it.  And even then, they'll probably try to return to &quot;normal&quot; after this whole thing is over.</p></div>		</li>
