			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the mass of the black hole. For a small black hole, you might be dead before you cross the horizon. For a very massive black hole, you might not be ripped apart until you've already passed the horizon. The tidal forces at the horizon are proportional to 1/M^(2) where M is the mass of the black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most importantly to your question, the person falling into the black hole will not experience time differently. They will appear to fall into the horizon very slowly to an <em>outside observer</em>, but from their own perspective they continue to fall toward the horizon at the normal rate for the gravity they are experiencing (which is to say: very fast).</p>
<p>With only purely theoretical models to work from, it's hard to say exactly when the forces of a given black hole would kill you, but if we assume that you are protected enough that the radiation around the black hole, along with the general lethality of space, aren't enough to get you, it's theoretically possible to live long enough to pass through the horizon. Regardless of exactly where it happens, though, at some point you will be ripped apart.</p></div>		</li>
