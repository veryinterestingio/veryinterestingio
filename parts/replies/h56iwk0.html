<li>Easier re-melting in a forge: both in that the distance to the center is reduced (minor) and that it fits in &quot;pot-like&quot; shapes easily.</li>

<p>In America. Maybe some other countries, but definitely not everywhere. For example here in Finland (and many other European countries) <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mGAALnE.jpg" target="_blank">they are bricks</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he means is that you put two ingots side by side. Then you put two more side by side on top of the first two, but at a 90° angle. This is better than just stacking cubes, where you essentially have a bunch of independent towers that might help each other fall over. Think a regular Jenga tower vs just stacking all the pieces one atop the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jenga is a perfect analogy for this. And this is a great chance to understand classical physics a little bit better!</p>
<p>You can science this at home yourself! Without any fancy science tools!</p>
<p>Just make a stack of 3x3 dice and a separate stack of Jenga pieces, and see which one you can stack higher! Then try it with different dice with different numbers of sides!</p>
<p>This principal affects the design of our clothes, our buildings, our roads, our bridges, our space ships, our ship ships, and our land ships! Ever wonder why cardboard sometimes has a honeycomb designs inside of it? This is why!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By interlinking they’re probably referring to how bricks are laid. Every other row is offset by the length of half a brick, which creates a far stronger structure than having each brick directly atop the one under</p></div>		</li>
