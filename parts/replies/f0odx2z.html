<p>Beyond the papers accuracy, I see papers all the time get misquoted, referenced as fact when it's a preliminary study with 20 people, etc. If there was a distilled down front part of each paper that was written by the journal showing a sliding scale of what stage the research is in, how much review it's had, it's applicability being very precise or being large scale, a controversy rating, etc.</p>
<p>Academia/the scientific industry needs to change IMO, the &quot;how many papers can you publish&quot; game is self serving and counter to the purpose of science.i</p>
<p>Little bit of my background: I'm the moderator of /r/whitepapers, and honestly it has pretty low activity, I'm mainly there to keep it's integrity. I also work in academia but avoid everything dealing with publishing, though I do read journals and papers often.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In my opinion, not the right place to start - although they could do a MUCH better job, often. But if you want to do damage to that problem, your target is <em>university press officers</em>.</p>

<p>There's a great deal of discussion about this right now. It's also a very old issue, overpublication and signal/noise ratio. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/142/3590/339.1" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/142/3590/339.1</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're totally unidentifiable. Most people who want to have a discussion about serious research misconduct, especially fraud, do NOT want to be identified. I get lots of emails from people with pseudonyms, and I've met more than one 'John Smith'.</p></div>		</li>
