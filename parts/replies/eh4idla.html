			<div class="markdown"><p>The light slows down because this equation has to stay equal: velocity = wavelength*frequency</p>
<p>This equation tells us that wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency. This equation is for transverse waves but since we're modelling light as a wave here we can use this equation.</p>
<p>That means if the wavelength is a really large number, then the frequency is a really small number. If the wavelength is a really small number, the frequency is a really large number. In both cases, the velocity is the exact same number.</p>
<p>Now here's the kicker. If the light is travelling from lets say air to glass, then the velocity and wavelength would change but not the frequency. The velocity changes because the wavelength changes, whereas the frequency doesn't change. Now I know I just said that frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional, so frequency should increase if wavelength decreases. What's the big deal?</p>
<p>The frequency doesn't change because light has electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other, and &quot;The electric and magnetic fields have to remain continuous at the refractive index boundary. If the frequency changed, the light at each side of the boundary would be continuously changing its relative phase and there would be no way to match the fields.&quot; <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/59469/why-doesnt-the-frequency-of-light-change-during-refraction" target="_blank">Link</a> (this discussion gets very complicated the more you scroll down so I'll leave it at this comment).</p>
<p>Basically, we have 3 variables in this equation. Velocity, wavelength, and frequency. If wavelength decreases, then frequency either has to increase or velocity has to decrease to keep the equation equal. But frequency doesn't change, so then velocity must decrease. But velocity of light is constant, so it just gets absorbed then reemitted to slow it down. Therefore, the light travels slower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>when light moves through a medium, is it only “slowed down” because it has to take a longer path through the medium?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that’s a pop science explanation that isn’t true at all, except that it does interact with the medium, namely with the electric field of the electrons. When a photon interacts like that it is no longer really a photon anymore, which is why it can act differently (gain mass, move slower than c, move at different speed depending on energy).</p></div>		</li>
