<p>Y sperm are more likely to reach the egg faster than X sperm, but they're also more likely to be rejected by the mother's body (miscarry, even if it's unnoticed) because the higher likelihood of genetic defects that XY pairs have compared to XX pairs. This is caused by the fact that, in males, their X chromosome can express recessive, deleterious traits that aren't dominated by the Y chromosome, since the Y chromosome is literally an X chromosome but chopped off a bit. That's why men have colorblindness, among a bunch of other things that women don't typically have.</p>
<p>The child sex ratio is thus influenced by the mother's hormones which can change how likely she is to reject a deleterious male zygote/embryo. All I'm saying is it's not just the X/Y ratio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it is and that's what I was saying. Here is a longer explanation to my following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is caused by the fact that, in males, their X chromosome can express recessive, deleterious traits that aren't dominated by the Y chromosome, since the Y chromosome is literally an X chromosome but chopped off a bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mutation(s?) on the X chromosome that lead to a given type of color blindness (presumably) occur just as much as men as in women (this assumes that men and women have an equal likelihood of being carriers). However, it's recessive. Thus, women have another X chromosome and its dominant alleles get expressed instead. Since color blind X chromosomes aren't exactly common, there are very few women with two of them. Only in the case of a woman with two such X chromosomes can the recessive color blind trait be expressed. Otherwise, the dominant trait on the non-color blind X chromosome is expressed.</p>
<p>With men with a color blind X chromosome, there simply is not corresponding allele on the Y chromosome, so color blindness is expressed. A whole host of other conditions/diseases/traits occur in the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some types of colorblindness can be acquired, others are inherited. </p>
<p>Inheritance works a bit different with different types of colorblindness. Generally people are talking about Red-Green color blindness which does follow x-linked inheritance pattern. </p>
<p>The other two main types (blue-yellow, and Total Colorblindness) affect both males and females equally because they are autosomal dominant meaning if you have the gene you are likely colorblind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is but the result is that there is no other X with a dominant gene to cancel out the recessive on the single X in the male.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll be that guy: it's specifically red-green colorblindness that is on the X and is hence around 16 times as common among men than women. There is also blue-yellow colorblindness which is about equally common among men and women as it's on a non-sex chromosome. I'm still oversimplifying this as there are various manifestations and degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I was referring to red-green since when I think of 'color blind' that's what comes to my mind, but then again a lot of people hear 'color blind' and they think that person sees in grayscale lol.</p></div>		</li>
