			<div class="markdown"><p>Structural biologist here, but not a coronavirus expert.</p>
<p>There are enzymes called exonucleases that can remove the last nucleobase on a DNA/RNA strand. This is a fairly straightforward hydrolysis - binding the DNA/RNA strand in such a way that makes it easy for water to break the phosophodiester bond between two nucleotides.</p>
<p>double stranded DNA/RNA will not fold into the right shape if it has a base in it that is not supposed to be there. </p>
<p>From my limited reading, it looks like coronaviruses have a protein called exonuclease N (ExoN; aka nsp14) that can recognize* double stranded RNA that is not the right shape and remove the last nucleotide by hydrolysis so that the replicating machinery can try again to put the right nucleobase in.</p>
<p>*Edit: lest I over-anthropomorphize a protein, this is not like a conscious decision. It is just that only things that aren't the right shape can bind to this enzyme and be hydrolyzed. The enzyme is like a glove that only fits RNA that has something wrong with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to make sure. Essentially the virus can detect when something isn’t supposed to be there or can it detect whether something that is there either is harmful or won’t bring any benefit. I know I’m over simplifying but I’m curious to know</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure that last sentence is correct. Evolution is random. Evolution simply may not have provided the ability for a recombinant event that created an RNA virus with the exonuclease that was positively selected for. </p>
<p>Plenty of RNA viruses experience deleterious events from high mutation rates. They generate particles called “defective virus genomes”. These genomes are essentially dependent on fully replication competent viruses, or functional helper viruses, to replicate. </p>
<p>These defective genomes have been implicated in pathogenicity of a virus but their full purpose is an active area of investigation. </p>
<p>Evolution is far less sentient (like not at all) than a lot of people think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also these nucleoside analogs that cause the termination of DNA replication, do they cause issues with normal cellular DNA (or mitochondria for that matter) replication and the only saving grace is the relative speed of replication? If so that sort of reminds me of Chemotherapy (especially the earlier drugs)... It is just poison that hopefully your cancer cells take in more rapidly than your healthy cells.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, it only targets virus replication, how does it accomplish this? Does it use a longer chain of nucleiosides to bond to specific genomic sequences based on the virus it is designed to fight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This varies from drug to drug, but one mechanism is some of these analogs have a higher affinity for viral enzymes than for our own enzymes. </p>
<p>Tenofovir is a d-AMP (adenosine) analog that has a much higher affinity for HIV reverse transcriptase than for our own DNA polymerases. As a result, it doesn't get incorporated into our own DNA very readily. Further, we have excellent proofreading mechanisms to fix these errors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe mitochondrial toxicity has been observed with some antivirals, but at least with Gilead's new antiviral for HBV and HIV, Tenofovir alafenamide, they specifically tested for mitochondrial toxicity and didn't find any. There's plenty of controversy (business practice related) surrounding that nucleoside analogue that is interesting reading into if you're curious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drug &quot;Zovirax&quot;, used for cold sores, also uses nucleoside analogs ('chain terminators') to interrupt the life cycle of herpes virus.</p>
<p>I think the active ingredient is &quot;acyclovir&quot;, which the viral DNA polymerase cannot distinguish from a real nucleoside. Your cells' polymerase is able to reject the analog.</p>
<p>Interestingly, nucleoside analogs are also used for DNA sequencing. They are 'salted' into a reaction mix for DNA synthesis in a tube, and randomly stop DNA chain extension at the particular base. So a mix with the analog for a Guanine will end the DNA synthesis at one of the &quot;G&quot; positions.</p></div>		</li>
