			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a question for a proper toxicologist, I only answered what I'm sure of. However, I'd say it's highly unlikely - there's countless drugs, not all of them metabolised by the liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it get better at removing it quickly in the long term, or is it just the drunker I get, the quicker my body will process out the alcohol?</p>
<p>I've always heard &quot;your body can process about 1 drink/hour&quot;, but if I go (very) hard one night and have 6 drinks in an hour, will my body process the alcohol at a faster rate? (so I won't have alcohol in my system 6 hours later?) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol has zero order elimination kinetics, meaning your liver processes the same amount regardless of the amount you have consumed. Therefore, the more you drink the smaller the proportion that is being metabolized at any given time and the longer it will take to reach sobriety. This makes alcohol particularly unusual and tricky among drugs, very difficult to predict when you will sober up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As an aside: the terms positive and negative really shouldnâ€™t have been used for feedback loops. Ot should have been strengthening/weakening</p></div>		</li>
