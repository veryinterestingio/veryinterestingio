			<div class="markdown"><p>It was actually terrifying at the time. I didn't realize it when I was younger, but I had basically nightly anxiety dreams, including one that left me dangling from a white plastic pipe thousands of feet over a city below, always at the end of losing my grip. In the exploding moon one, I dodged I don't know how many pieces, always afraid that I was missing the one that would kill me, and even once in the tank, it was a confusing environment where I felt claustrophobic but couldn't leave because I knew doing so meant I would get hit by a chunk of the moon.</p>
<p>Imagine not being able to separate those dreams from reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those that can remember dreams but occasionally have a hard time separating them from reality. It's really difficult when some dreams are very similar to something that would happen in reality. There have been many times where I've had a conversation in a dream with someone I knew in a place I knew, that would lead to extreme confusion when I'd end up having a similar conversation with the same person in the same place in reality AFTER the dream. It's like a bizarre form of deja Vu. What makes it worse is that although I can remember my dreams, I do not have &quot;lucid dreams&quot; meaning I am not fully aware that I am in fact dreaming. Thus, it makes it easier to confuse dream memories with real memories.</p>
<p>One thing I find interesting about the dreams, though, are the settings. My dream version of my college, for example, has a very specific layout that stays the same for any dream I have that takes place on that campus even though the layout is NOTHING like the layout of the college in reality. This happens for multiple settings that I have consistently in my dreams. Always the same in the dream but very different than reality.</p>
<p>Luckily I haven't had any breakdowns like you mentioned, however, but I can see how it could lead to breakdowns. Particularly with regards to trauma you've experienced in real life playing out again in your dream. Like I've been in car accidents in reality and those were bad enough but having to go through more car accidents in dreams that seem very real, not to mention being able to remember how the crash felt and what you saw, could be very damaging and contribute to things like PTSD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the ones that are clearly events that didn't happen, or are highly unlikely, such as the moon exploding or commanding a team of Jan Michael Vincents in a mission to rescue the President are not filtered as you don't have a problem mistaking reality from dream in such cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can apply logic to some, but what about the conversation with your friend about where to go on vacation? Or where you poured your heart out to someone and they don't remember because it didn't actually happen? Those are the ones most likely to confuse and frustrate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My most vivid dream recently: I was a tourist in a crowded city (Tokyo?) using the underground trains, a crowd surge pushed people forward on to the tracks. </p>
<p>This metro line and because of incidents had deep pits below the tracks where a person could stand and not be hit by the train (suicide prevention pits - do they even exist?). </p>
<p>As a tourist I made the mistake of grabbing the hand of one passenger as they fell forward into the safety of the pit, I tried to lift her back up but  as the train came racing into the station I was left stumbling back holding onto her arm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how did they get out of the pit? Was there a passageway leading to a one way door by the platform? </p>
<p>Possible dream inspiration: that video from a few days ago where the train was so packed that an attendant had to push the last passenger in to allow the door to close.</p></div>		</li>
