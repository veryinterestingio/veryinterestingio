			<div class="markdown"><p>The Huberman Lab podcast has great information for shift workers. Andrew Huberman is a professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology and he has his own podcast that discusses different aspects of the brain. He had a whole month dedicated to sleep. I highly recommend his podcast.</p></div>		</li>
