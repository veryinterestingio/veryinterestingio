			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to go off track but does geezer mean older person here? In british english it has a different meaning. We sometimes use it that way, but always preceded by â€˜oldâ€™.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was a bit like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_problem" target="_blank">Jeep problem</a>, how you explore a vast space with limited fuel resources (only in this case it isn't fuel for the vehicle but fuel for the people). </p>
<p>I read that they could navigate to islands by reading flows/patterns of water, so I always imagine they would set up way points on their journeys (where possible).</p>
<p>Having said that I know nothing about this, or their tech, so this is totally uneducated guesswork :)</p></div>		</li>
