			<div class="markdown"><p>will try to find source, but regardless, ive read once that sensation IS (somehow) really close to an orgasm. they even went further to explain that if you sneeze 8 times in a row, you would actually have an orgasm.</p>
<p>edit:
found a lot of articles by sreaching &quot;sneeze is 1/8th of an orgasm&quot; and pretty much says that &quot;In summary, both sneezes and orgasms are involuntary reflexes that feel good and involve erectile tissue. And that’s about all they have in common.&quot;</p>
