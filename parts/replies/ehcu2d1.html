			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m in property management and can tell you the industry is moving away from heat treatments. It’s very difficult to kill bugs that are in carpet or anywhere they are insulated from the heat. It’s expensive and drives bugs into adjoining units. We have better results with steam and chemicals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically if you’re reactive to the bites (a cruel blessing because they make it easier to catch them early but they also itch like fucking hell nonstop for a week and slowly drive you mad — literally, they can induce deep anxiety and sometimes even paranoia and psychosis) you’ll know as soon as you have even one bug. But the bastards are hard to find and you can’t really confirm from just bites, so you have to go hunting: under your bed, around the edges of your mattress, in your bed frame are usually their favorite hiding spots, but they can also hide in wall sockets, in curtains, in discarded clothes, anywhere dark and quiet. Of course, once you have one bug, you’re likely to have a few dozen more very quickly, because a pregnant female will lay around a half dozen eggs a day or more. </p>
<p>The flip side is if you’re not allergic, you usually won’t find out until you see one of the buggers scuttling across your mattress, or traipsing across your bathroom floor — and that’s when the infestation has gotten <em>really</em> bad, because they are so good at hiding that they’re only out in the open when all the other hiding spots are filled with other bugs. </p>
<p>Yes, I had nightmares after my infestation, why do you ask?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had bedbugs a while back and our apartment complex sent out a guy who fumigated our entire apartment with cedar oil, which I've been told literally causes them to melt. I'm mildly allergic to cedar, and the smell gave me headaches for weeks, but we haven't had problems in the two years we've been here since.</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear, he also put some powder in our outlets and in a few other places to get any who may be hiding in difficult to fumigate locations. We also had to be gone for a few hours, suggesting he may have been in there with some kind of suit spraying the oil in various crevices. Also, in the two years I may have forgotten what causes what to melt. It could've been the powders melting the eggs, or some other combination. All I know is some form of bedbug melted in the process, bringing me immense joy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when our apartment got bedbugs, we'd been trying to weeks to get rid of them with daily steaming, with some success. but suddenly we had to go out of town for a week, so I was worried all our efforts had been for naught. we tried our best to keep them from spreading, even taped up all the electrical outlets (all unplugged bc of the trip), and just prayed for a miracle.</p>
<p>a week later, we came home and at this point we haven't seen one bedbug in nearly a year. turns out the texas summer heat ain't all that bad.</p></div>		</li>
