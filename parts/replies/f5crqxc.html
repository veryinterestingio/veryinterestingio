			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying if an ocean were deep enough that you would eventually hit a layer of phase ice that would float up, melt and then balance out... assuming huge scale, the ocean would become denser as you went until you hit a solid layer of ice?</p>
<p>For added fun, would this require a solid core, or would a planetary size sphere of water also be capable of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>> Down deep enough, the water is absolutely below the freezing point.</p>
<p>This seems unlikely. Water is densest around 4C, which should set up a cycle that prevents any ocean water from actually being sub-0C, no?</p>
<p><em>Edit for clarity: by 'cycle', I mean that if water cools below 4C, it will become less dense than 4C water and start to rise, thus mixing with water that is warmer than 4C.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the bottom of the ocean say the Mariana trench the water is between 1 and 4 C.  The water is salty anyway, sea water doesn't freeze until -2C.</p>
<p>In places like the Artic where the surface water freezes in winter the deep water is generally warmer than the surface.  You do get subzero water here but it's sea water above it's freezing temperature or brine made by the salt shed by sea ice formation which has an even lower freezing temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is densest at 4c, but that is because ast the temp approaches 0C, the molecules start expanding to form ice. Ice is less dense than water.
However, if the cold water is under pressure from surrounding water, couldn’t it be possible to get below freezing without the ability to expand? It will remain a supercooled liquid in this environment. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well no, not  by definition. But it can be well below zero, because the freezing point of ocean water decreases due to salt and pressure. The further down you are, the colder it will get because the pressure decreases the freezing point.</p></div>		</li>
