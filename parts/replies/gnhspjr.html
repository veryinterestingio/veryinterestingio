			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! I would only add that we don't really have good cough suppressants. Even the prescription stuff with codeine only has a marginal effect. Apparently for colds, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/well/live/cold-cough-treatment-codeine-honey-remedy.html" target="_blank">honey is as good as anything</a> -- not super effective, but cheap and safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Codeine is a prodrug and it is metabolized into morphine in the body, which is the active form. Some people have a deficiency of the enzyme that does this conversion, hence codeine does not help them with pain or cough. </p>
<p>To my understanding the only known substances that can suppress the cough reflex are opiates, but they are addictive. The other compounds (e.g dextrometorphane) out there used for suppressing cough are just as good as honey. </p>
<p>It been some years since pharmacy school, so correct me if my knowledge is outdated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These skin cells can slough off the airways and mix with mucus and get coughed out of the lungs. However, when the skin sloughs off, it can expose nerve endings called J-fibers. These J-fibers can stimulate more cough, leading to more skin cells sloughing off and more exposed J-fibers and the process builds on itself in a positive feedback loop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always wondered why coughing seems to lead to more coughing. How long does it take for this skin to heal? Sometimes after I've had a cold I'll find myself continuing to cough for a week or more afterwards, even when I'm completely recovered in all other respects.</p></div>		</li>
