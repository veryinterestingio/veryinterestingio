			<div class="markdown"><p>While I cannot contribute much more information. I feel it is worth noting that rayleigh scattering alone provides a brighter horizon with the sun overhead (e.g. midday hours). Mie scattering also contributes to a brighter horizon (e.g. a hazy day) and the white halo around the sun.  </p>

<p>Another effect that contributes to the lighter horizon is ground albedo. Light reflected from the ground bounces back into the atmosphere and gets scattered all over again. This results in a not-insignificant lighting of the sky near the ground (intuitive, if you imagined the ground being lit like under midday sun but no sun in the sky).

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it the opposite? When you look towards the horizon all of the blue light has been scattered in other directions. You're seeing <em>less</em> scattered light.</p>
<p>When you look up you <em>only</em> see scattered light, and blue light gets scattered the most so it looks blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ther are two types of scattering. </p>
<p>One of it is Reyleigh scattering in air. It scatters blue light more than other. And it is responsible for blue color of the sky (scattered light) and red color of sun at dawn/dusk (sun light with all blue scattered away).</p>
<p>Another one is Mie scattering in haze. It scatters all light equally, including the light that has been already scattered. It is responsible for spreading light near horizon.</p>
<p>There are links in another comment.</p>
<p>The OP asked about &quot;lightness&quot; near horizon. Which is commonly understood as &quot;whiteness&quot;. And that is result of Reyleigh scattering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>But when you look to horizon your look goes through about <strong>5 km</strong> full of the haze   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of  the haze and dust in the atmosphere is troposphere. The top of the troposphere/ bottom of the stratosphere is at about 33k feet  / 10km. So when you look straight up, you're looking through  ~ 10km of haze. When you look at the horizon, you're looking  slantwise through that 10km, far enough that the curvature of the earth comes into equation. Bottomline though, it's in the 100's of km, not 5 km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the horizon is about 5 km away if you're on flat level ground(or ocean); that's probably what they meant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. My bad. The 5km is just a distance to horizon. Which is full of haze anyway.</p>
<p>I've already put sone calculatios of tangent line in another comment.</p>
<p>Troposphere height is from 8 (polar) to 18 (tropics), with average of 13km. But the haze layer doesn't have strict boundary. Density is decreased exponentially with height. So it's hard to define thickness of such layer.</p></div>		</li>
