			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to kind of explain the rules, when most people reference that they are referring to rules 3 and 4.</p>
<p>4 is the simple one, it basically means no going “mommy and daddy said fairies did it”. Explanations need to be not aimed at literal 5 year olds. Its generally pretty easy to enforce the lower bound there, where explanations are simplified to the point of being useless. The bit that makes people angry is that we tend to not make the subjective call as to how complicated is too complicated for OP to learn from, different people learn in different ways and have different knowledge levels going into a question, so we try not to remove correct/complete explanations that may be useful to OP even if complicated, and let the community deal with that via upvotes and follow up questions.</p>
<p>The other one is rule 3, where we don’t allow short answers or anecdotes. Generally explanations have 3 parts: a context, a mechanism, and an impact. Short answers have 1-2 parts and leave the rest to be inferred. Thats the other one where people get angry, because the way they would “communicate with a 5 year old” is very briefly and heavily reliant on a “just trust me as an adult” sort of approach that we don’t allow.</p>
<p>I hope that kinda helps, we do very much enjoy explanations like the above, they are just very very rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like the top responses in this sub are usually way too long and use polysyllabic words that even an adult would have to look up.</p>
<p>But they get up voted for being very informative, even if it's something a five year old wouldn't understand.</p></div>		</li>
