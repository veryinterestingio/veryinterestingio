			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda how it should be though right?</p>
<p>I love fishing and I mostly do catch and release, but an &quot;eater or keeper&quot; sized fish is not going to put the good genes back into the water like a big chonker. Let the chonkers go, they survived so long for a reason, let them breed and repopulate and if you want to eat fish eat the ones that are just like legal limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm wondering what happens the other way and an arthropod shifts from being well fed to not so much. Do they just get &quot;loose&quot; in their exoskeleton? I'm guessing they can't molt smaller - or can they? Or are they just going to be chronically malnourished going forward because they got bigger during a period of more food availability and now they are just too big to be supported by their environment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an insect is undernourished and starts to feel “loose”, they swallow air to keep their gut inflated. Swallowing air is the main way that insects generate enough internal pressure to “bust out” when they are moulting to get bigger, and many larval insects will swallow a lot of air immediately after a moult to make their bodies bigger as their new cuticle hardens so they have lots of space for them to grow before the next moult. Moulting is incredibly dangerous and you can imagine that re-growing your entire skin and skeleton is very exhausting and costly, so insects want to do it as few times as possible.</p>
<p>No, they can’t moult smaller. As you can probably guess from above, the process of moulting relies on the assumption that you are getting bigger to even get their body out of the old skin. It would be like having to “Hulk” out of a shirt to go <em>down</em> a shirt size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think they’ll actually molt smaller, but they do get lighter inside the exoskeleton if they’re underfed.</p>
<p>Their tissue density is a lot more variable than a vertebrate and two seemingly similar-sized animals can be much different weights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this answer for land arthropods, especially insects and spiders. The short answer is yes, they can get fat in a fashion. </p>
<p>Once insects and spiders reach sexual maturity, they stop moulting. This is called the Adult stage, their cuticles are much more rigid during adulthood, but many can still eat. If they overeat, they will get fatty just like us. Even though they have ‘rigid’ exoskeletons, they can still flex and shift quite considerably. Insect’s outer bodies still have a flexible epidermis like us underneath their harder cuticle layers, which allows for flexibility, some hydrostatic movement, and gaining/losing a bit of weight. Check out pictures of a gravid (ie. pregnant) insect for a good example of this. So, getting fat in an insect will cause the epidermis to stretch, and the cuticle plates to separate, but unlike a mammal, adult insects can’t really make more skin, so they will look and feel overinflated. So being overweight is much more dangerous for an insect, because it seriously reduces their ability to move and even breathe, because many species rely on being able to pump air in and out of their bodies by flexing the their abdomens like belly dancers, which is harder to do if their skin is too tight.</p>
<p>For spiders it is much easier, since their bodies are much less sclerotized and more elastic. Their abdomens can stretch a lot more than an insects, and they actually have to keep their body “inflated” with their blood pressure (hemolymph, I know, gaaawd). Getting fat is much less dangerous for a spider because they breathe with book lungs, and they  mostly rely on their abdomens to store vital organs; they serve almost no mobility function. That being said, a fat spider is not a healthy spider, the same as you or me, and just because being overweight won’t literally make them asphyxiate, it will have negative health outcomes for them long term. So if you’re keeping a long-lived spider like a pet tarantula, you can expect to shorten their lifespans by quite a lot by over feeding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to my roommate tarantula owner, overfeeding does make the spiders fatter but the only way this shortens their lives is by making them molt faster, since they have a more-or-less limited number of molts in their lives.</p></div>		</li>
