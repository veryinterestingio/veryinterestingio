			<div class="markdown"><p>In the automotive world, we generally call this a 'hard reset' and accomplish it by touching both the battery terminals together (while <em>not connected to anything</em>, if that wasn't obvious). Generally discharges all the voltage in any control modules you want to reset. It doesn't just clear their memory; sometimes it legitimately resolves an acute software glitch, just like with a PC.</p>
<p>...in this modern, advanced technological age, cars have gotten <em>really fucking stupid</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Devices these days are <em>mostly</em> intelligent enough to recover from such a situation, but it doesn't hurt to follow the 30 second rule for network devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  Also true is capacitors.</p>
<p>But when I worked at Dish Network we had to tell them to do 30 seconds because when you said &quot;unplug it and plug it back in&quot; they would say they already did,  even though they didn't.  They didn't think it would make a difference and lie to you.</p>
<p>Sometimes you would even have to get them to blow in the socket or tap the wire to the back of the TV. I would also suggest I sent a reset code from my side and it needs to be reset again. You could make up any extra step while it was unplugged and they were like OHHH.  Thanks it works now.</p>
<p>Sometimes after it was working again I would ask them if they had really unplugged it or not, and they would be like &quot;yeah you got me&quot;</p></div>		</li>
