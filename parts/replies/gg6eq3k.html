			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. That’s often why your reflexes work faster than your brain can register the pain sensation.</p>
<p>The signal that the stove is hot only has to travel to your spinal cord which immediately sends a signal back to pull your hand away, while then passing the pain signal up to your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upper spinal cord is realistically still brain, it's fast because it doesn't rely on executive function. It has nervous tolerances than when met will trigger a response period, unless directly trained to do otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Like when I touch something that vaguely feels like the initial feeling of something really hot, so my hand automatically gets pulled away. I know it's as natural of a reflex as involuntarily shutting your eyes to protect them, but it still feels weird to have such a large action get overridden and done automatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So theoretically, if someone had damaged pain receptors, they should still reflexively be able to pull away from hot objects, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well pain is the emotional response we have to the “danger signals” being sent to our brain. The too hot, too cold, too much pressure etc..</p>
<p>I do believe their are instances of people with very specific types of nerve damage where that can happen, yes. Don’t hold me to that though haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note, pain is not a signal sent to the brain, it’s a response of the brain to a signal indicating danger, damage, heat etc.  It’s possible to modulate the amount of pain you feel through various psychological tricks, even though the danger signal from the damaged part of your body remains the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>450 mph = 660 fps</p>
<p>Having the brain 1 foot further from a sensory organ would delay reactions by 1.6 ms.</p>
<p>For comparison, visual reaction times are around 200-250 ms. This is for something simple like, see a visual cue, press a button.</p>
<p>So honestly, I'm going to say probably not. But do note that the poster above said that is the <em>fastest</em> that pain can register.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't wire us...but in animals that are not human like flies and mantis shrimp yea that speed limit before input can be assessed and then acted on and sent back... Also pushing a button is a &quot;primed response&quot; the person is ready... Getting surprised by a predator usually is what the brain has to have the speed to handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gamers complain when their screen ain't 1 ms response time. No competitive players use 4 ms screens for instance. 1.6 ms is very slow in terms of nerve senses. It has to be processed too. So the faster the information gets there the better. And 1.6 ms is way slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher up in the upvoted comments someone mentions early neurons would be missing a layer that makes them extra fast.  Apparently it's the same thing that degenerates if you have multiple sclerosis.  Causing people to lose control of their body, essentially because of nerve latency.</p>
<p>So it sounds like when this low level stuff was evolving it would have mattered a ton.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Other have already answered this, but yes. Bear in mind that once the signal is transmitted it still needs to be processed, which can take a surprising amount of time. </p>
<p>On a day to day basis this isn't much of an issue but when you need quick reaction times, such as in sport or computer games, it really becomes noticeable. </p>
<p>I used to train for a competitive speedball (Paintball) team, and our captain gave a memorable lesson about how reaction times are broken down and how to exploit the speed of nerve impulses to your advantage.</p></div>		</li>
