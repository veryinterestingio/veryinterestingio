			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question. A good early attempt was made in 1774 when astronomers were confident that they had good numbers for the relative difference in masses between planets as they move around in the solar system. The principle behind that was essentially taken from Newton’s Law of Gravitation. The trouble with then getting an abosolute number out for the mass of those planets or the Earth is that we need a reference point to compare the relative differences between celestial objects to, something where we know the mass or density fairly well already. A mountain in Scotland was chosen, because it was a fairly isolated mountain and of very regular shape (for a mountain). Vertical deflection due to the gravitational attraction of the mountain was measured on plumb-bob instruments and a figure for the Earth’s mass was obtained. We now know this to be within 20% of the the modern assigned value, you can read more about the historical experiment <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>A much better measurement — within 1% of the value measured today — was made in 1798, by a rather clever chap called Henry Cavendish. In his experiment, Cavendish had two weights and measured the gravitational attraction between them. It involved measuring the minute twist of a wire between the two weights as they are placed close to each other; Cavendish used an instrument he developed himself to do all this. Then he knew the gravitational force for a given pair of masses and a distance. The gravitational force between two objects is proportional to the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. That is:</p>
<p><code>F = G * (M₁ * M₂) / r²</code></p>
<p>where <em>M₁</em> and <em>M₂</em> are the masses, <em>r</em> is the distance and <em>G</em> is a proportionality constant. This applies to any two bodies anywhere (and is thus called the universal law of gravitation) and had been known since Newton published it in 1687 — who used it to explain Kepler's laws and the fact that the downward force exerted by the Earth on an object on Earth is proportional to its mass — though experiments directly measuring gravitational force between two weights in a lab weren't done until Cavendish (because they require immense precision). Knowing <em>G</em>, and the radius of the Earth, and the mass of a weight, and the force with which that weight is attracted to the Earth, you can calculate the mass of the Earth because you know <em>F, M₂, G, r</em>. From the Cavendish experiment you can calculate <em>G</em> because you know <em>F, M₁, M₂, r.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>You can also do this with fewer observations by just looking at the Moon.</p>
<p>If we...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assume that the Moon's mass is negligible compared to the Earth's</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe the Moon takes 27.5 days to make a full orbit (known since ancient times)</p>
</li>
<li>Observe that the Earth-Moon distance is 384,000 km (measured to within 10% by 150 BCE)</li>
</ul>
<p>...then we can use Newton's form of Kepler's Third Law:</p>
<p>T^2 = 4π^(2)r^(3) / GM </p>
<p>...where T = the time to complete one orbit and r = the Earth-Moon distance. If we rearrange to solve for the mass and plug in values...</p>
<p>M = 4π^(2)r^(3) / GT^(2)</p>
<p>M = 4π^(2) (3.84e8 m)^3 / (6.67e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 <em> (27.5 days </em> 86,400 sec/day)^(2))</p>
<p>M = 5.94e24 kg</p>
<p>...which is within less than 1% of the true value, 5.97e24 kg. We got there with just G, r, and T.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. The kinetic energy of meteors (which are travelling at several metres per second relative to the Earth) far outweighs the utterly minuscule strength of Earth’s magnetic field. Earth’s magnetic field strength is around the 60 microtesla mark. Magnets manufactured for everyday use have a field strength of anywhere between 100,000 to 1,000,000 microteslas. You can get a more intuitive sense for how weak the Earth’s magnetic field is by holding a magnet in the air — you don’t have to fight against any force pulling it back down to the Earth do you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have recently seen them mentioned in relation to the giant impact theory for the Moon yea. I think this is (at least in part) because they have been found to be extremely old, almost as old as the Earth itself, rather than a gradual product of plate tectonics as originally thought. The exact nature of them remains enigmatic though. Google LLSVPs (large low shear velocity provinces) if you want to read more about them.</p></div>		</li>
