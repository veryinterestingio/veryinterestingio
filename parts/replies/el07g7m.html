The hamster gets food, shelter and belly rubs with or without running (unless it's the hamster of a mad scientist who hooked up the wheel to a generator)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some hamsters will even choose to not eat in favor of running on a spinning wheel.
However if your hamster does that, it’s probably a copping mechanism for something else like stress caused by an overpopulated cage, tiny cage, to much light, not enough hiding spot in the cage etc.</p></div>		</li>
