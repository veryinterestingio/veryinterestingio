			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to know about this too. I love to fall asleep in complete darkness but sometimes it gets to where I’ll have these massive spinning patterns getting larger and larger, almost like falling into a kaleidoscope. Looks really cool, but makes it difficult to sleep. For some reason, it never happens unless it’s very dark, not even in a dimly lit room.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you just answered your question. If there is a little light in the room, your eyes won't reach the level of sensitivity that allows the noise to be recognized as signal.</p>
<p>you might try a red night light.</p></div>		</li>
