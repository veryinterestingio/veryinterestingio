<p>Firing squads are loud, bloody, and brutal.
In other words, they more fairly reflect what we're doing -- killing someone.
Firing squads have the virtue of not turning killing someone into a grotesque and dishonest parody of a minor outpatient medical procedure. - <a href="https://twitter.com/Popehat/status/1331762591325011970" target="_blank"><em>@Popehat</em></a></p>

<p>Hard to imagine ending the death penalty when even the squeamish could watch the state kill someone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consistency.
As much dignity for the inmate as possible.
Just because it is an end of life procedure doesn't mean the regular safety precautions don't need to be followed.
And yeah, there's an amount of cover your ass in it, but if the procedure has to be done, it <em>should</em> be done correctly.</p></div>		</li>
