It’s not; it’s at best an approximation that changes with season, behavior, temperature, masking, humidity, etc. And that’s before you factor in variants.</p>
<p>Also herd immunity curves aren’t slow gradual declines. The graphs I recall from my student day’s looked more like a slight decline above the threshold, then a sudden drop off a cliff when the threshold was breached.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries. I also saw some evidence and theories in that direction, which is why I asked - my guess is it'll be a while before that can be confirmed though.</p></div>		</li>
