			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, your average estimate might be a tad small, the Wikipedia page for Assassins Creed Unity says that the game shipped with an estimated 15.5 million lines of c++ and c# code
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_Unity" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_Unity</a></p>
<p>Then again, thatâ€™s a AAA game, for smaller games your average would be closer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, I was certainly on the low side of some. One key thing is that Ubisoft uses an internally developed engine, and it's gone through many revisions. The latest version easily blows past my back-of-the-envelope guess of at least double 5 million lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends a lot on what counts. Unreal has a lot of crap that Ubisoft's engine wouldn't have for example blueprints code and exotic platform support. At the same time, both of these use a humongous amount of third party code / libraries and if you include them, it's anyone's guess who ends up having more lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of revisions. I heard most of the Call of Duty games used a highly modified Quake 3 engine.  How modified is it?  How many more lines did they add to it to go from OG Xbox level engine to Xbox 360 level Modern Warfare level engine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia references a Youtube video of a presentation, and the slides to that presentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014/blob/master/Presentations/C%2B%2B%20in%20Huge%20AAA%20Games/C%2B%2B%20in%20Huge%20AAA%20Games%20-%20Nicolas%20Fleury%20-%20CppCon%202014.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It says that there are </p>
<ul>
<li>6.5 million LOC for entire team code</li>
<li>9 million LOC from outside project</li>
<li>5 million C# LOC</li>
</ul>
<p>The C# is used in the editor, which brings up the point of what exactly should be counted as code for a game? The editor is crucial for the game, but the code isn't included in the final shipped binary. Third party libraries contains code that isn't used, but still compiled. Then there's shader code, which might be generated by graphical tools.</p>
<p>I found a <a href="http://www.dice.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sthlm10_ParallelFutures_Final.ppt" target="_blank">presentation</a> by Johan Andersson from DICE about Battlefield Bad Company 2, and that has 1.5 million lines of C++ code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My follow up inquiry is</p>
<p>How much of that was auto-generated and how much if that was actually typed</p>
<p>EDIT: Im a programmer myself - and I have experience with unity to know there's a large part of autogeneration that goes into things like foliage and trees and general environmental things, so even though the engine may have been hand typed I was more asking if there was a breakdown into how much of the art was manually placed versus just proceduarally generated </p>
<p>I know a large part was definitely proceduarally generated, but I was more curious to how much</p>
<p>Judging by the replies - no one has a guess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that AC is not a good representative sample. AAA games I've worked on typically ship with fewer than 5 MLOC. More code does not mean higher quality! :)</p>
<p>Edit for clarity: I think AC is a great franchise and they are great games. Just saying that more code doth not a AAA game make. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely true. Unreal, for example, contains 20 years worth of crap left behind and hacked together, as well as being written in a style that encourages blatant code duplication (instead of proper refactoring). Naughty Dog's engine contains far less than a million lines of engine and game code, and (at least for Uncharted 4) maybe 100k lines of game scripting.</p>
<p>15 MLOC is utterly insane, and leads me to think their engine must be an absolute nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have rewritten games I wrote as I learned C++. Eventually a 200,000 line codebase was scrapped and a 50,000 line codebase replaced it and did everything the 200,000 line codebase did and more. </p>
<p>Experienced programmers definitely do more with less lines of code. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not every line of code is technically human written, as there are formatting, implementation, and refactoring tools that add source lines and some are copy paste and then modified. In essence, however, yes. A person will end up writing a majority of the lines of code.</p>
<p>As a side note, the number of lines a human has typed and compiled will be an order of magnitude larger than the number of lines shipped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>new code would need to be written by hand, yes. but a lot of these engines and libraries are built upon continually, so i would say a large portion of that is probably already stable. i would guess they're only usually writing \~20-40% new code (as a % of the total codebase). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>source: i mainly work on web apps, so this is just a guess, but a slightly educated one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lines of code are not a good measuring system for anything. </p>
<p>Most of the time when working with higher level languages, you're going to use redundant lines of code or a string of references or functions that could theoretically be in the same file. A better measure could be lines of assembly code, but even that is not really meaningful. </p>
<p>Code usually has a variable length that depends more on formatting than on functionality. </p></div>		</li>
