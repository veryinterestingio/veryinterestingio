			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea and no. There is a perceptible difference in morning and evening lighting in most human occupied areas particularly densely urban as the night hours mean way less pollutants and particles in the air. You also get an inverted temperature shift as mornings tend to be cooler.  So you get the look and sensation of crisp, cool light, longer viewing distances in the morning while afternoon/evening lighting is affected by a much busier and dirtier atmosphere creating a dull overhanging haze lifted up by human activity and the warm surface most of the time</p>

<p>The famous classic California sunsets had a <em>lot</em> of green in them.</p>
<p>California traded cleaner air for more modest sunsets. The ones into the early 80s were spectacular.</p></div>		</li>
