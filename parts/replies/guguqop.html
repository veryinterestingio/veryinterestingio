			<div class="markdown"><p>Their is a research grade (not medical) way to measure heart contractility and that's through impedance. Basically, send a tiny electric pulse from an electrode on the back, to an electrode in the front. You can measure the time it takes for the electrode to receive that pulse. When the heart is full of blood, it takes longer for it to travel than when it isn't. It all happens really fast so it's taken at 500 to 1000 samples a second.  </p>
<p>This method was developed as a result of NASA wanting a way to measure heart contractility without needing to use an invasive catheter. What you get is something called the Minnesota. It's a machine they developed to measure heart impedance. It's still the gold standard of impedance measurements. If you develop hardware or software to measure heart impedance, you have to compare it to the Minnesota.</p>
<p>I'm still learning all this stuff myself but I work in the research industry and learning more about it every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contractility is basically how hard the heart pumps. So if a heart is pumping hard, the blood will be ejected faster than if the heart is pumping normally. This is all measured in milliseconds. </p>
<p>We know the general range of impedance values when there is blood and when there isn't. So if we know that X measurement is when the heart has blood, and Y measurement is when it doesn't have blood, the time difference between that indicates how quickly blood vacated the heart. And this can happen without the heart rate increasing. It's also based on each individual so that's why baselines are so important to compare against the stimulus. </p>
<p>It's not the end all be all measurement. It's just another piece of data to measure the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.</p></div>		</li>
