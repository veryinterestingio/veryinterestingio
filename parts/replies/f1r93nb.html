			<div class="markdown"><p>For the different languages in English, they are spelt different than we pronounce them because those letter combinations existed in the original language but not English. For example, in ancient  Greek ph is a valid letter combination so the p and h are both pronounced. Since that letter combination doesn't exist in English, we can't pronounce it easily so we chose a different sound from our language.</p>
<p>Similarly, kn is a valid letter combination in German, but since it isn't in English it is difficult for us to pronounce so we just drop the k sound.</p>
<p>This linguistic behaviour is part of why there are common patterns when foreign people misspeak the same letter combos. For example, there is not th letter combo in French so French people typically pronounce it more like a d sound unless they are well versed in English.</p></div>		</li>

<p>kn used to be a valid letter combination in English.  The 'k' used to be pronounced in middle English.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In Greek, ph is actually a single letter, φ (phi). In ancient Greek it was pronounced as an aspirated p, /p^h / which is how we pronounce the letter p in English all the time when it's at the beginning of a word. So it's actually kind of weird that we pronounce it like an /f/.</p>
<p>Interesting, in modern Greek it's also an /f/ sound, just like in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're not the weird ones for pronouncing it like an &quot;f&quot;. It was an aspirated &quot;p&quot; for most of ancient Greek, but in the late Classical period for them, they switched to the &quot;f&quot; for the letter because it was fashionable at the time. They were the weirdos all along!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i can actually see how it went from an aspirated /pʰ/. /pʰ/ and /p/ weren't allophones, so they were represented by two different letters, φ and π, respectively, so those sounds didn't really merge, rather they became more distinct, so instead of a stop/plosive the sound changed to a fricative (both were still obstruents though). now π still had a voiceless bilabial stop /p/, but φ changed from an aspirated voiceless bilabial stop /pʰ/ to a voiceless bilabial fricative. so they were still similar, but also more distinct obviously. later on that sound shifted again to the voiceless labiodental fricative /f/, and is now the sound the letter φ has in modern greek.</p>
<p>i think these changes were inevitable as the original sounds could just be told apart by their aspirations, which i don't think is very common.</p>
<p>i don't think it's weird how we pronounce ⟨ph⟩ as /f/. i mean, both greek and latin* shifted the /pʰ/ sound to a /f/ sound. then french got that /f/ sound and that sound was passed on to english for the ph letter combination when english started borrowing words from french.</p>
<p>*granted, latin adored greek and borrowed lots of words from that language, so they also borrowed aspirated sounds from greek too, but only used that sound for greek loanwords at first. later, the unaspirated sounds shifted to aspirated sounds especially around /r/ and /l/, probably because greek was highly appreciated and they wanted their words to sound more greek-like (that's how lacrima became lachryma, and triumpus became triumphus). they also started using the aspirated sounds more often to the point of hypercorrecting the unaspirated sounds to their aspirated counterparts in other latin words. a roman author, catullus, even satirised that in one of his works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the subject of French:</p>
<p>I had a History professor that was French. His focus was Caribbean history and the French Revolution. Anyway, one day I asked him if the correct pronunciation of Caribbean was CAHRIB-ian or Care-uh-BEE-yun.  He said it was too subtle for his French ears to tell the difference. He said it sounded like I was saying the same thing. </p>
<p>As an example to explain this to me, he told me of two of his colleagues. One is named Kathy and one is named Cassie. He can never tell which one someone is talking about when they get brought up because of the th.  Thought that was interesting how he couldn't even hear it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>French basically doesn't have lexical stress (iirc there's generally a small stress on the final syllable, but that's all)</p>
<p>So, while English has GOVernment, french has gouvernement - all the syllables have about the same stress. </p>
<p>Might explain why it's a hard thing for him to pick up on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lingthusiasm (which is a <em>fantastic</em> podcast ) had an episode about exactly this:
<a href="https://lingthusiasm.com/post/165591628291/lingthusiasm-episode-12-sounds-you-cant-hear" target="_blank">https://lingthusiasm.com/post/165591628291/lingthusiasm-episode-12-sounds-you-cant-hear</a> </p>
<p>Apparently the ability to distinguish certain sounds depends on whether or not you heard then as a baby, and is lost extremely early on. </p>
<p>Personally that blew my mind slightly! Means that however hard you try, a native speaker will be able to tell. Also explains how hard it can be for actors to get the details of different accents right.</p>
<p>Well worth a listen.</p></div>		</li>
