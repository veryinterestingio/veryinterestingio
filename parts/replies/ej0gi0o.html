<p>Why the numbers are odd and not even is arbitrary and chosen by the FCC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not arbitrary at all.</p>
<p>The whole range is 88 - 108. The width of one station is 0.2. So if a station is at 88.1, it takes frequencies from 88.0 to 88.2, so all is well.</p>
<p>If it was at 88.0, it would take frequencies from 87.9 to 88.1, which is not okay because it dips below 88.0.</p>
<p>If it was at 88.2, it would take space from 88.1 to 88.3 and it would waste frequency from 88.0 to 88.1</p>
<p>Here, straight from the horse's mouth:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And neither the 0.2 is arbitrary, it's the required bandwidth to transmit enough information. I remember learning about Bessel functions which describe the shape of one station in the fm range and while they go theoretically to infinity, it was decided to cut them at some point where the interference was small enough. Now don't quote me on this because it's a long time since high school, so it might not be 100% correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>...in the presence of noise, don't forget that.</p>
<p>Without noise, you could have pretty narrow FM channels. But noise is part of life (as seen in much social media content, lol), so you need to compensate for it. 0.2 was deemed enough for decent quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation#Noise_reduction" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation#Noise_reduction</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>FM provides improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as compared for example with AM. Compared with an optimum AM scheme, FM typically has poorer SNR below a certain signal level called the noise threshold, but above a higher level – the full improvement or full quieting threshold – the SNR is much improved over AM. The improvement depends on modulation level and deviation. For typical voice communications channels, improvements are typically 5–15 dB. FM broadcasting using wider deviation can achieve even greater improvements. Additional techniques, such as pre-emphasis of higher audio frequencies with corresponding de-emphasis in the receiver, are generally used to improve overall SNR in FM circuits. Since FM signals have constant amplitude, FM receivers normally have limiters that remove AM noise, further improving SNR.</p>

<p>It's far from ELI5 or even ELI17 category, but on <a href="http://www.axino-tech.co.nz/documents/Bandwidth%20needed%20for%20FM%20broadcasts.html" target="_blank">this page</a> there is a fine graphic that shows the bandwidth required to carry an FM broadcast stereo radio signal along with RDS and other possible gubbins that might be there, what radio folk call the baseband signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Bessel function is a product of the maximum deviation and the maximum modulated frequency (i.e. the frequency response). In broadcast FM, the max deviation is ±75 kHz where the frequency response is 20 kHz (which is a standard for studio recording as well). The maximum modulated frequency is used to calculate the audio harmonics which will form sidebands and therefore define the bandwidth of the channel (since the Bessel function is a summation of those sidebands). The average bandwidth for FM is then defined as something like 2<em>max._dev+2</em>frequency_response (the actual calculations the FCC uses varies based on the radio service, it's all defined in Part 2 of Title 47 IIRC). Which would give you a bandwidth of something like 190 kHz which allows for ±5 kHz of guard in the channel.</p>
<p>In commercial two way, frequency response is only 3 kHz and deviation is ±2.5 kHz. The actual narrowband FM bandwidth is defined as 11.25 kHz (in a 12.5 kHz channel). Granted, this number doesn't exactly apply for digital modulation schemes but the calculation is a good way to estimate.</p>
<p>Not 100% sure of how AM is calculated (I work with FM mostly) but I believe AM broadcast uses a frequency response of roughly 5 kHz (yes, by definition FM broadcast is much higher fidelity which is why AM is typically used for talk and news these days) in I want to say, 10 kHz wide channels. I know AM's primary bandwidth is just 2*frequency_response but I don't know if there is any extra stuff associated with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But once you pick the range, you need to stick to it. Hence the odd decimal rule.</p>
<p>At least that's the US. In the EU it's chaos, it's pretty crazy how they allocate frequencies over there. It's like they're trying to compensate for the rationality of the metric system with a completely irrational FM allocation scheme - allowing stations to squeeze in at 0.1 or even 0.05 MHz.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rule that a station is 0.2 MHz wide seems arbitrary too, at least on the surface. Is this due to technical limitations in the receiving equipment?

			<div class="markdown"><p>FM is frequency modulation. In simple you can think of it as the audio is encoded in a frequency modulation range of 0.2mhz.(with a good amount of seperation between channels)</p>
<p>The reason it's 0.2mhz range was probably a choice of simply balancing audio quality and efficient use of the allocated FM band. In reality we can fit more bandwidth than just a mono channel in the allocated band though, that's how they could pull off a mono to stereo conversation.</p>
<p>But really the major reason nothing has changed is that it's already an international aggreed standard and it does what it needs to, no need to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a limitation. It's a fundamental, complex, very important topic in communications - the bandwidth needed to send a given amount of information in the presence of noise.</p>
<p>For reasons that would require a full manual of physics and electrical engineering to be properly explained, it was determined that 0.2 MHz is the bandwidth needed in real life to send a signal with decent sound quality over FM.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation#Noise_reduction" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation#Noise_reduction</a></p>
<p>TLDR: Every communication needs some bandwidth to send any amount of information. If bandwidth is zero, the amount of information you can send is zero. Shannon's theorem, etc.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That problem was solved about a century ago, and the answer is - you always need some bandwidth. It's not a matter of technology, it's a matter of the laws of physics and math, and the way this universe works.</p>
<p>This is basically the electrical engineering equivalent of &quot;I find it hard to believe in this day and age we can't figure out how to get infinite energy from zero amount of fuel&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
