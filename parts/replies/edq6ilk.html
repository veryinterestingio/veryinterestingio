<p>Also in crazing the cracks are not always aligned with the stress, it's usually normal to the stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in this, but from memory of old lectures not necessarily and the phenomenon is much more complex than just compression and tension. Some polymers 'prefer' shear banding or crazing even in tension, where as some do both. I once saw a lecture by an expert that had a title essentially 'crazing or shear banding - only the polymer knows.' </p>

<p>From reading, it seems like there are classical cases where a given polymer prefers one mechanism vs. the other at least in tension. Polystyrene crazes like crazy (haha) where as polycarbonate shear bands. What's important  to keep in mind is that this is the material relieving strain energy by creating new surface (because surfaces have higher energy than bulk and this higher energy is paid for with the strain). </p>
<p>I wish I could give a better answer and someone else probably could, but it seems like the answer is one of those annoying 'its complicated and depends'?</p></div>		</li>
