<p>Nor should you wrong long distances with closed fists, btw. Why expend energy needlessly in an endurance exercise?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does clenching your fists really require measurable energy? Now I really want to grab a heart rate monitor and see if my heart rate rises at all when I clench my fists.</p>
<p>It always helped me mentally because the pain of fingernails biting into your flesh distracts from the pain in your legs ;) Though usually it was just the thumbnail against the index finger, not a full fist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heart rate is not the only indicator of energy expenditure and in this case may not be the best measure. I think that blood sugar or blood oxygen would be a closer measure. Closed first are a very small thing and I worry that even over long distances the increase in heart rate would not be statistically significant. </p>
<p>If you asked me to bet. It's probably not worth the time focusing on for any but the most extreme of long distance runners. And I too enjoy the fingernail motivation.</p></div>		</li>
