			<div class="markdown"><p>Lions are the most social big cat species. In fact, I can’t think of another species that even comes close to Lion’s highly social structure.</p>
<p>Increase social structure means male lions engage more in dominance battles for harems and pecking order placement, relative to any other big cats.</p>
<p>Extend that long enough over time, and the males who grew large manes have an advantage over their counterparts who don’t, and thus large manes became a dominant feature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. I was thinking I was replying to the &quot;when other felines just don't&quot; part. I don't know much about lions specifically - I think the other answers are correct in that lions have developed a social structure with one dominant male and so there's pretty clear competition between males to attract mates.</p></div>		</li>
