			<div class="markdown"><p>This is on track, but it's a bit more complicated: RAW format gives you the luminance value at each sensor location rather than the color value for each pixel. Most camera sensors consist of an array of light sensors each covered by a red, green, or blue filter laid out in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter" target="_blank">Bayer Filter</a> mosaic; when you convert from RAW to an actual image, the color values are interpreted from a combination of the sensor output and hardware-specific sensor layout information. Other color-separation technologies exist, as well (e.g. Foveon).</p>
<p>The other complication here is that video data isn't necessarily a rapid-fire series of discrete pictures, but rather a rolling sampling of the sensor data, so luminance data can be accumulating on one part of the chip while being read out on another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Raw also isnt an image. Its the direct readout of the sensor that your computer can convert to an image. Thats why its better for editing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a distinction worth making. Ultimately it's all just a numerical readout from a sensor whether compression was used or not. The difference is in the compression. If raw is &quot;not an image&quot; then neither is compressed. They both require interpretation to render as a visible image. Compression just throws away detail that raw doesn't.</p></div>		</li>
