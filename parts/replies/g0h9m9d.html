			<div class="markdown"><p>I am trying to push it at work.  They are coming around.  Using MFA as an excuse for the &quot;loosening&quot; standards, even though there are not looser.</p>
<p>The other problem I have is that there is very little technology support for it yet.  For example, I would like a system that checks the password hash against known compromised periodically.  It would not be too difficult for an auth system to include it, but nearly impossible to implement without a proper hook into the auth system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep pushing. It's an uphill battle because these archaic rules are ingrained in company policies. Stress that the company needs an set of security policies, not just password policies. These rules were made up (literally) when the concern was that passwords would be cracked through automated brute force attacks.</p>
<p>Now passwords are stolen and 2FA is circumvented with social engineering. That and password re-use. If employees get phished on their Facebook account that tells where they work, the attacker is definitely going to try that same password on company systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My organization actually uses rainbow tables for new passwords. I don't think they check existing passwords, except the first time they implemented the system and made everyone who didn't pass change their password. But yeah, it's a smart idea, and it prevents the use of &quot;password123&quot; and all that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main issue right now is the amount of different services and sites requiring you to have an account. If you reuse passwords between them, a single breach compromises all your accounts. </p>
<p>Using different passwords makes remembering them next to impossible even with simple phrase passwords. You either use a password manager which can be compromised, giving somebody access to everything, or you end up writing the passwords down on paper and then forget that at work.</p></div>		</li>
