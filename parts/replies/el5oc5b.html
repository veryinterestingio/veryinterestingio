			<div class="markdown"><p>It's helped me half my anti depressant dose. I think it's because it helps me sleep (sleep is VERY important to my mental health) and it clears my mind when it's whirring with anxious thoughts. So I take it before bed and it clears my mind so I fall asleep quicker. I feel like I sleep more deeply and if I wake in the night I can go back to sleep very quickly rather than being awake for hours like I did before. I find that the next morning I'm still relaxed and my calm mind seems to last until late afternoon.</p></div>		</li>
