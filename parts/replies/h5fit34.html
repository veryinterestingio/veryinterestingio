			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I came here expecting a bunch of people to say something about this, and you were the only one. Out of the millions of things our bodies <strong>can</strong> digest, they chose an example of one of the few things that absolutely is not a digestive substance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the context, I just think they're extremely confused about what insulin is, and what part it plays in your body. As in, they think it's in the same category as dietary nutrition (such as protein/vitamins/carbohydrates/etc.) instead of being a hormone that regulates a bodily function.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP might have made a typo. I don't think digested was the term he meant. Destroyed or denatured probably.</p>
<p>I think his point was, how come parasites survive the stomach and insulin gets destroyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmmm, probably. Either way I'd rather no one try eating insulin because that shit tastes terrible and doesn't do anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not? It's a protein so it can be digested. That's why there's no oral preparation of insulin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You will just destroy it, rather than apply it. There have been a ton of tries at oral applications. As far as I know, they just kept having issues where it may not get the same uptake every time, which is hell on your organs as an insulin-dependent diabetic. I think the inhaler was getting through the FDA a couple of years ago, but I haven't been to an endocrinologist in over a decade. So, I'm not super up to date on newer treatments.</p></div>		</li>
