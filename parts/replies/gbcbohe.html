<p>I went to donate convalescent (covid) plasma a couple of weeks ago but was told I had the wrong type of veins to donate plasma. I've given blood plenty of times in the past, so how does it differ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the method, Plasma donation can require your blood to be removed, the plasma filtered out (using a plasmapheresis machine), and then the blood returned to your other arm. They need a high and fast flow of blood for this, so good wide veins are preferred.</p>
<p>If you have thin or deep veins, it increases the risks of not actually getting the vein, or the vein clotting mid procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a plasma center! Firstly, we use a much bigger needle than a lot of places (17 gauge where I work). And like other comments noted, we have to make sure that we can give you your blood cells back (and later saline too). It is one thing to take blood out, but another to return your fluids to you, so you need good, strong veins for your safety more than anything else. I did want to correct a comment here, we can use the same vein/arm to return the cells. Most donors are only stuck one time for the whole process and only restuck for flow problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source : 100 donations, with about 40 being plasma/platelets. Am AB+.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking for a little clarification. Obviously don't donate while under the influence, but does this extend to recent drug use? How long should someone be drug free (not under the influence) before their blood is &quot;clean&quot; in terms of donations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s important to be honest and ethical as a donator, because these units are used for critical care and immunocompromised patients.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marijuana does not affect the recipient of your blood. It is not something they will ask of you. Nor is it something that affects the purity or potency of your donation. If you are visibly high you may be deferred for just that. Heavy smoking also will put you, as the donor, at risk of reaction. Beside that, a regular marijuana smoker can donate blood</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many more substances on the red blood cells than just A and B (O is the lack of A and B) or the substance D which makes you Rh positive.  These other blood group substances (called blood group antigens) can also cause someone to make antibodies if they are exposed to them (by transfusion or pregnancy), they lack them on their red blood cells, and their immune system can respond.  When they make antibodies to these antigens, the test to look for them (the antibody screen) will become “positive” and it becomes necessary to find red blood cells lacking these antigens. </p>
<p>When the screen is positive, additional testing is required to identify the antibody (antibody ID) which can take time.  Sometimes it can take a long time depending upon the antigen that the antibody reacts with and how common or rare it it.</p>
<p>There are roughly 700 different blood group antigens that have been found.  Some are very rare and some are very common.  If you have an antibody to common antigens or have antibodies to many antigens, it can be difficult to find blood lacking the antigen(s).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a blood bank as well. There are far more blood groups than ABO and Rh (D, which is the positive or negative in O pos or O neg). In fact, the Rh group has 5 total antigens/antibodies with D being the most significant. </p>
<p>Just like with allergies or any other immune response, a patient can become sensitized to a blood group if they have a transfusion and are exposed to the antigen if they are negative for it hence developing antibodies. These antibodies can cause transfusion reactions if the blood is transfused and the donor and recipient are not compatible.</p>
<p>Each time a type and screen are done (the standard test done in blood banks) the patient is screened for these antibodies. If the screen is positive, we have to identify the antibody as well as find compatible units. Depending on the antibody(ies) found which takes some detective work and additional testing, we can either easily determine what caused the screen to be positive or it can take a very long time. This can be due to frequency of the antigens. For example, the Kell blood group can cause significant reactions. Big K, known as Kell is a low frequency antigen so determining the antibody if it is Kell is relatively simple compared to others. Cellano, or little k is far more common. If someone is negative for Cellano and has an antibody to that group, it will be very very difficult to find compatible units since a vast majority of people have the antigen for it and would not be compatible to the recipient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s really amazing. As a donor can I find out that information after I’ve donated blood? I’m CMV negative (if that’s the right terminology?) so I donate every eight weeks like clock-work. I love that the Red Cross app can tell you to what facility your blood has been sent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we talk about <strong>antibodies</strong>, what we’re taking about is a protein designed to attach to an <strong>antigen</strong>, and mark it for destruction.</p>
<p>We would expect to find the major ABO antibodies in all patients, as they are stimulated naturally during development (anti-A, anti-B, and A,B).</p>
<p>However there are MANY antigens on blood beyond A, B, and D (the +/-), and they vary from person to person (genetics!)  </p>
<p>A positive antibody screen shows that someone had an immune response to an <strong>antigen</strong>, usually from donor blood or maternal/fetal crossover.  The response causes an <strong>antibody</strong> to be formed, which will quickly replicate and attack the <strong>antigen</strong> if it ever shows its ugly face again. </p>
<p>That’s why there’s a delay in blood for those patients.  We need to make sure that the blood they’re getting is <strong>antigen negative</strong> for their specific <strong>antibody</strong>, which requires an extended work up :)</p></div>		</li>
