<p>They don't remove anything, but they break up the large pigments placed under your skin until the chunks are small enough that they don't affect light the same and that your body can finally collect them and flush them out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All colors in print eventually break down when exposed to light from specific parts of the spectrum and become &quot;bleached out&quot;. </p>
<p>Theoretically, when a pigment that is producing the color effect has broken down to other elements, you could detect those elements using specific analysis equipment. The difficulty of determining which residuals originate from which pigments depends on the type of pigments being used (and time). Oil paintings, water colors, home printed documents all use different types of pigments to produce colors and they are mixed to different degrees to produce secondary and tertiary colors.</p>
<p>It's not likely that the particles which a pigment breaks down to will be the same color as the pigment, but is possible I would think. There may be a few remaining undamaged pigment particles which may be imperceptible unless examined under a microscope though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. The loss of color isn't that the color bits (pigments) leave the object, it's that the pigments actually change color. Every pigment is a specific molecule. The color of the pigment depends on the shape and composition of its molecule. If you break the molecule (or add to it), it changes color. And the vast majority of molecules out there are colorless.</p>
<p>Also, these molecules are bound up in other materials. Like latex paint is pigment + latex. So the molecules break up, but they're still held in place by the other ingredients.</p>
<p>If you want to read more, google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightfastness?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">lightfastness</a>. It's basically the science of why colors fade and ways to prevent that.</p></div>		</li>
