			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and Inuit and Tibetans etc. aren't known for being tall.</p>
<p>The premise is ridiculous. There are far too many exceptions for this to be a thing.</p>
<p>As far as the tallest goes, they all seem to be European nations. neither the hottest or coldest climates on earth.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epigenetics (environment triggers genes which might have an effect on your descendants) makes it even more complicated.</p>
<p>Almost all height-related genes have &quot;epigenetic islands&quot;, parts of the gene that is triggered by inheritable conditions. So if your grandfather/grandmother survived starvation you might be a few cm shorter than you would otherwise be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup and the tallest region in the world is the Dinaric Alps which runs through countries like Montenegro and Croatia where I can confirm it’s hella hot. Oddly enough my father comes from a colder region than my mother, although he is only 5’10 he was one of the tallest in his village and he was decently tall compared to those in surrounding towns, meanwhile my mom comes from a very very warm region of Croatia(right along the coast) and everyone in her family is extremely tall, all the women are close to 6ft and everyone else in the nearby towns and villages is also very tall.</p></div>		</li>
