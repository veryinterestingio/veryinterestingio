			<div class="markdown"><p>Cat litter absorbs moisture so this, assuming you replaced it often enough this  would reduce condensation on the inside of your car windows(not frost which is outside, or at least it should be).</p>
<p>Of course when you get into your car and breathe a big old blast of water vapour into your ice cold windscreen you're going to get it right back, but it might make a difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you aren't applying voltage the liquid crystal is randomly arranged in the droplets placed in the pane giving it a milky appearence, when voltage is applied the align and allow light through easily making it clear.</p></div>		</li>
