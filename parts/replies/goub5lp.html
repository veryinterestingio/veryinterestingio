			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons exiting an X-ray tube scatter off of surfaces and even interior patient body structures. An abdomen for example creates a lot of scatter, which is why in the old days one would use a grid which is constructed of lead lines and interspace, sometimes focused and designed to absorb scatter radiation and improve image quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the major tenants of QFT is that particles are indistinguishable from each other. Photons especially (as they are bosons) which tend to intentionally occupy the exact same quantum state. Now, you're still correct that the scattering process is described by both a annhilation and creation operator.</p></div>		</li>
