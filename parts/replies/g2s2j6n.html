The way he approached the conept was enough, and after a while it got tiresome mentally translating everything out of the farming analogy. I think he could have transitioned. Lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP's example only included orchards (indices) that were in the US for US-based apples (companies) </p>
<p>Lots of other countries grow apples too.  </p>
<p>The FTSE 100/250 are for UK orchards.   The DAX 30 is for German orchards.  The CAC 40 is for French vineyards..  so on and so forth.</p></div>		</li>
