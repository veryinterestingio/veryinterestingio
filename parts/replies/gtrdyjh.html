<p>That's a new word for me. My reading stuttered, having read &quot;a diabetic&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(I would write c_p.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>c*_p_* makes a subscript p on Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe mobile formatting is different, I'm also not seeing a subscript like the OP, but an italic <em>p</em> with an asterisk on each side. </p>
<p>Although it's no different on desktop apparently, so not purely a mobile problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never realized the leading edge is that much warmer. Would that lead to ice accumulation even at -30C ? I was told after a certain point you can worry less about ice accumulation in clear air because the water in clear air is frozen and wont stick as easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Icing is most frequent when the static air temperature is between +2°C and -20°C, although ice can accrete outside this range. Basically once you get cold enough the water is already ice and wont stick to the wing. Additionally, you'll usually need visible moisture in order to get ice when flying.</p></div>		</li>
