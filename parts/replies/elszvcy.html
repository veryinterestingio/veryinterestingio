			<div class="markdown"><p>Radioactive decay doesn't just <em>feel</em> like quantum mechanics, it <em>is</em> quantum mechanics. Essentially since the particles are described as probability waves there's a small chance in any given moment that the atom isn't stable and something breaks off, thus resulting in a random decay chance. With stable isotopes that random chance is basically never, while with radioactive isotopes they are very close to breaking apart so that the randomness from quantum has a chance of causing decay. Less stability = higher probability of decay = shorter half-life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no 'buildup' of decay.  At any given instant there is a chance that it will decay <em>spontaneously</em>.  This is because there exists a state of lower potential energy for the system.  All it takes is for the particles to randomly enter a certain configuration for the decay to occur.</p>
<p>It's like a snowfield on a mountain.  Whilst the system is being held up by friction, all it takes is for a particle to move out of place, whether that's from wind or whatnot, for everything to collapse.  There's no buildup, because its not like there's some sort of fuse - it's just when the system reaches a state where decay can occur.</p>
<p>Also important to note, given the sensitivity of the system quantum effects can also trigger decay.</p></div>		</li>
