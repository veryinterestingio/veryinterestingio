			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the detailed explanation and that more so that you explained what other pigments there commonly are.</p>
<p>About metabolizing a small anecdote: my chemistry teacher ( already about 20y) ago, once had a party. He mixed some harmless fluid into his bowle, so that his guests peed some very intense color. Not sure which one...if red, green or blue. But it was shocking to them and as you can imagine, it was the last time most of them visited him again ;-)</p></div>		</li>

<p>What? Dude sounds like my kinda guy! Sadly I wouldn't have noticed as I usually flush while still sitting down.</p>
<p>Re: the stains. I just wet the container and use a tiny bit of dawn. Not watered down at all. Its made to cling on to oils. If it's not too greasy you can use the rinse soap on the next dishes. I never put tomato or curry containers straight in the dishwasher as I feel like the oils redistribute onto other items. Although I just learned that dishwashers do a soak and then a wash cycle. But pods don't dissolve until the dispenser door opens. With liquid or powder is used, apparently most dishwashers have a little indention for soak detergent. Mine has one but I never noticed, and the manual says to use pods, and it comes with free sample pods. That's product placement if I've ever seen it.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED talk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently some complicated chemistry mostly involving the pungent sulfur compounds alliin and isoalliin reacting with amino acids. As far as I can tell from a brief search the exact details aren't known but the resulting bue pigment seems to be a mix of &quot;polyprroles&quot; (related to, but more complicated than, why pickled onion turns pink), possibly with some sulfur-stuff still attached. This basic pigment structure is somewhat similar to what goes on in heme (red) or chlorophyll (green).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought pickled onions turn pink because the pigment runs through the acid. So with garlic it's not directly related to the other pigments we're talking about but a different reaction? It's crazy to me how PH affects color so much, it's also what makes some flowers bloom blue.</p>
<p>I'm learning more than I knew I didn't know about pigments and chemical reactions today. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not related to the acid then? I thought avoidance of plastics with tomato based things was more about the acid leaving horrible potmarks in the plastic, and the red dye happening because of the increased surface area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. I don't know. Berry pies and whatnot are pretty acid and don't seem to stain the same way. Soda too. And polyethylene or polypropylene ought to be quite acid resistant. On the other hand, I don't really know why the texture of plastic containers degrades.</p></div>		</li>
