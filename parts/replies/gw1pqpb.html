			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this. You retain your memory B-cells pretty indefinitely. These maintain the ability to produce antibodies in response to a second infection by the pathogen being vaccinated against. These will allow you to better fight and get a second infection under control.</p>
<p>What mostly falls over time, as you pointed out, is the level of circulating antibody in the blood. This is most important for preventing infection in the first place. If the blood has many antibodies to a pathogen then it is prohibitively inhospitable and an infection can’t get underway at all. If these levels fall then a mild infection could begin but would be more rapidly dealt with than in the case of a primary infection due to the presence of memory B-cells.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you know <strong>measles</strong>? Do you want to know the really scary bit about measles?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles#Pathophysiology" target="_blank">
They are binding and infecting T and B cells of your immune system.</a> </p>
<p>Measles themselves are not only harming you, they are <strong>erasing</strong> your immune systems knowledge about other pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excuse my obvious question, but why don't we just inherit memory B-cells from our mother? Why do multiple generations need vaccination from the same disease? </p>
<p>I'm sure there's a simple answer. I know for some stuff we inherit partial protection.  I've just never quite understood it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunity isn't something you'd normally consider heritable, as they aren't expressly written into genetic code. Instead generated as needed. You can think of this as trying a bunch of keys to see what works (attaches to the pathogen) and them making copies of the key to flood the body. Because each person's body will need to create its own key ring of memory b-cells that can be unregulated if they see the same pathogen. In some cases antibodies can be passed from Mother to offspring in the womb or through breastmilk (materially derived antibodies) but generally wane over time as they may not have plasma cells continuing to produce antibody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ultimate cause is because the immune system is adapted to identifying anything which is non-self. Your mother comes under the umbrella of &quot;non-self,&quot; and from your mother's point of view, you come under the umbrella of &quot;non-self.&quot;</p>
<p>Your immunoglobulin proteins (which are antibodies when soluble, and are B cell receptors when on the surface of a B cell) have an extraordinarily high number of possible configurations so that any given pathogen is &quot;detectable.&quot; When they are being synthesised, they go through a process in which any immunoglobulin that recognises self is eliminated, and doesn't circulate. This is to prevent auto-immunity.</p>
<p>B cells have these immunoglobulins and have the capacity to detect &quot;non-self.&quot; If you were to inherit B cells from your mother, there's a non-zero chance that those B cells will recognise some of your cells as &quot;non-self,&quot; leading to an auto-immune disorder. That's because you inherit half of your DNA from your father.</p>
<p>The partial protection that we &quot;inherit&quot; is just antibodies, and not B cells. These don't last very long post-birth, maybe 3 months or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we are not our mothers. One of the aspects of immunology is understanding self, or recognizing which cells in the body are your own vs what's foreign. You share your patents genetic material and if you only inherited your mothers immune system you would develop an autoimmunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so why are some long lasting like decades but others could only be a year?  Do the cells have a memory capacity that once breached erases some memory or is each memory B Cell specific to a particular infection?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on several things
1) how well the vaccine stimulated an immune response
2) what the characteristics of the vaccine were. For example, protein antigens better stimulate humoral (B-cell) memory than lipid antigens.
3) the mutation rate of the pathogen. If it has mutated a great deal since the original vaccine was given then the original immune memory may be less specific to the second infection. </p>
<p>You have a small population of memory B-cell clones living in your bone marrow for every particular infection you’ve come across</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first question mostly comes down to cell life. Some cells last longer than others, skin cells die very quickly relative to say bone cells. The antibody producing plasma dies away relatively quickly but the memory cells have a longer lifespans, in this specific instant it's mostly due to how they're stored in the body (think the shelf life of fresh peaches vs tinned).</p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand your second question but I think you're asking if the memory cells &quot;add&quot; memory, or if a new one is formed for each new instance of memory needed. My understanding is that a new batch is created for each particular infection. Partially because it's easier for the body to do, partially because it's more efficient when dealing with multiple pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it’s not a problem with some “only lasting a year” and rather that the disease mutates enough in 1 year to require a different vaccine. Each memory cell is specific to a particular infection, but the body can create more memory cells. And on the other hand a vaccine like TDAP (For Tetanus prevention) is able to protect us from 5-10 years roughly, but as the memory cells die off there becomes too few to provide sufficient defenses. Basically there are too few memory cells to recognize Tetanus early enough and so it’s much safer to just update your TDAP every 5 or so years. But, due to this you could theoretically not update your TDAP for longer and be fine depending on your memory cells and how well your immune system functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One more little wrinkle is sometimes it isn't that you've forgotten, but that the pathogen has mutated enough to no longer be recognized by the old memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this can also be the case. It should also be noted that there is no clear distinction. It is possible for the mutated pathogen to be recognised and neutralised by antibodies less effectively but still in a more or less impactful way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. </p>
<p>To put it in human terms, sometimes the pathogen just gets a haircut and you don't recognize them as readily but eventually figure it out. Other times, they get plastic surgery, dye their hair, gain 100lbs and you don't recognize them at all. =p</p></div>		</li>
