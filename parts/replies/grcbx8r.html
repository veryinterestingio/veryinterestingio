			<div class="markdown"><p>My views on carbon capture and direct air capture are summarized in the two excerpts from the book, below, as well as the paper (third link). Basically they are both opportunity costs that always increase air pollution and mining and hardly decrease carbon compared with using the same money to purchase renewables to replace fossil fuels. Taking CO2 out of the air has exactly the same impact as not emitting it. However, taking it out always requires equipment and energy and never reduces air pollution or mining. So, it always has a higher social cost than using that same energy (if renewable) to replace fossils, which simultaneously reduces CO2, mining, and air pollution. There is really no case that carbon capture is more beneficial than not doing carbon capture. As such, its promotion will only delay and make more costly a solution to air pollution, global warming, and energy security.</p>

<p>This isn't true if for every amount of CO2 created more than that amount gets put in the ground, though?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So long as CO2 is being emitted, for the same money, you can always prevent more CO2 from getting into the air than taking CO2 out of the air. When you prevent CO2 from going in, you also reduce air pollution and mining, saving additional money (social cost benefits).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you not take CO2 out of the atmosphere as a byproduct of unused/inefficiently used energy?  Gasification is just the re-burning of excess - which can be used for turbines etc... apply accordingly and store at high volume low pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back on this I would like to ask about reforestation: </p>
<p>Is reforestation a long term solution? My understanding is a tree absorbs carbon but eventually the tree dies and is decayed releasing most if not all the carbon back into the atmosphere. If we convert non-forst land to forest this would help sink some carbon to a maximum limit then stop as the bio mass of the forest levels out. We see this currently with the old growth rain forests. They are touted to be huge carbon sinks but recently it has come to light that they aren't because to do that they would need to increase in bio mass per unit of area which they don't because they are at the threshold. Also raonforests don't sink much carbon into their soils. This is evidenced by their low organic matter soils. </p>
<p>Seems to me this increase in carbon is coming from pumping fossil fuels rich in carbon from under the surface of the ground to the atmosphere and then burning them. So wouldn't carbon capture methods that put the carbon back into the ground be a better long term solution as it is actually removing the carbon from the atmosphere and not just converting it to a solid form in trees that then gets released later when the tree dies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preventing deforestation and encouraging reforestation are both good. Even if a tree stores carbon 80 years then releases it, that is better than storage for 10 years or 1 year.</p></div>		</li>
