			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the Reddit experience for a 71-year-old? I am in my 40’s, and not only have I gotten detached from many of the pop culture jokes that are so prevalent here, but I have also greatly minimized the subs that I frequent, if only to stay away from the more juvenile stuff.</p>
<p>Do you mind sharing your experience? Do you feel the same way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it’s opening a window to a world I have virtually no access to now. All of my younger relatives live a long way away, and I vicariously get to understand what it’s like to be a younger person by reading the stories here. Yes I understand some of them are made up but some of them are so heartfelt. The world has changed so much from when I was young, and this gives me a way to see it anew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly how I feel. I am in my 50's and I love reddit. It keeps me aware. I never liked Facebook. But reddit for all of it's flaws does keep me connected to the younger generations. I live far away from my adult children. I Skype with them, but it's hard. I love the generosity of spirit I see in quite a few subreddits. I have learned some things on reddit too. I love subreddits like 'Ask Reddit'. I get to learn things I never would have the opportunity to without it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>65 years old here. Your answer  exactly reflects why I'm here too.  Never touched Facebook but when younger, I read magazines like crazy...topics such as science, comic books, radio, you name it. With some curating, Reddit provides a lot of that.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your on-point answer to the question. Best wishes.</p></div>		</li>

He was taking steroid blockers like 15 years ago for prostate cancer and got really weak.  It bummed him out and he started working out alot to get in shape. At 85 he still goes on fishing trips, went kayaking with me, living life</p></div>		</li>
