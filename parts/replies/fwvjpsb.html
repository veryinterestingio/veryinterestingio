<p>My eyes don’t water when I cut onions either. I think they might be broken, but broken in all the right ways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even without contacts? Contacts actually block the onion gases that cause your eyes to water.</p>
<p>I once mentioned to my wife's pussy hole doctor that my eyes didn't do this anymore, and she asked if I wore contacts, because that would explain it. Sure enough, she was right - tried cutting an onion later without contacts and my eyes watered a lot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some that are supposed to last like... A week or two? I keep them in 24/7 for up to a few months, unless something gets in my eye or they just get super uncomfortable. When I do take them out I have to wait several days before I can put them back in.  </p>
<p>This habit is from my tragic backstory, I don't like getting rid of any kind of limited prescriptions (even ones I can get OTC like Zantac or Zyrtec). I now have normal insurance for the first time in my life so I'll be able to stop doing this once I can break myself of it.  </p>
<p>Edit for LPT: Never use tap water to clean your contacts, not just because of normal contaminants (lead, chlorine, etc) but also because if the egg of a parasitic entity gets onto it and you then put it against your eye, your eye is the offspring's first meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So two replies,
I don’t mess around with my contacts when they don’t feel right, like if for any reason they are blurry or causing me to blink abnormally I will just straight toss it and put a new one in because I’m already way ahead of the “how many contacts do I have left” curve. But like one comes out, and one goes right back in… no issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>I worked as a tech in a microbiology lab once and the microbiologist that ran the lab previously to the microbiologist I worked with almost lost her eye because of some parasite she got from lake swimming with contacts…</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's terrifying. I'm sure things like that are relatively rare. I'm considering getting dailies since the thought of fresh contacts every day sounds very appealing. I worry about something like that happening due to me showering with contacts in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know. I'm just so used to being broke and not having regular insurance that I developed habits like this. I'm also paranoid that the manufacturer somehow counted wrong and I'll have less than I should, and won't find out until I need whatever it is and can't get more.</p></div>		</li>
