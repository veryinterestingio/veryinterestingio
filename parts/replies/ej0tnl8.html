			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.</p>
<p>If it's clearer, multiply by 10 and you'll get 3 more than a multiple of 8 (e.g. Nova becomes 1011 = 126*8 + 3)</p></div>		</li>

<p>With the exception of low-power stations, they're generally 0.8MHz apart by design.  So for example in Detroit we have 93.1, 93.9, 94.7, 95.5, 96.3 and so on.</p>
<p>Again, there are exceptions for low power stations, I worked at a college radio station that was 94.3 even though you could pick up 93.9 and 94.7 there - but we only had a range of like 4 miles.  <em>Generally</em> it's every 0.8, not sure if the FCC mandates this but every city I've traveled to has used this pattern, the ones in-between are usually just some dude's car transmitter that goes to static after I drive away, lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of the form 0.3 + 0.8 x, where x is a whole number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think I get what you mean.</p>
<p>I'm just surprised people haven't brought up the 0.8 &quot;rule&quot; here, it's not like you have radio stations at every 0.2 on odd numbers, that would be chaos!  You technically can, but I'm not aware of any place that has every 0.2 taken.</p></div>		</li>
