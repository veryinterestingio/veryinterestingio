<p>Obviously progress notes are important, but is it really necessary that they require the doc to copy and paste lists of labs, meds, vitals, scan results, etc, etc into every single progress note, every single day? </p>
<p>Doc orders the scan, reads the scan, pastes the scan into the progress note, and then has to document that the scans were all reviewed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to say they arent needed, then again, I also used to practice law and I totally believe in a papertrail. Do I need to see every bit of a progress note in my medical practice, no. If something ever happens and I want to cover my ass, you better believe youll need every bit of detail addressed otherwise some lawyer will have an opening to attack from--as a general matter, if something isnt in your note, it didnt happen/does exist.</p></div>		</li>
