			<div class="markdown"><p>Fortunately we didn't lose any primate species or subspecies in the 20th century.  This is an enviable record given that every other larger group of mammals lost at least one species or subspecies.  In fact, we don't know of any primate extinctions in the last 300 years and perhaps as long ago as 500 years.  That said, there is one subspecies of red colobus from West Africa that may have now extinct and quite a few species that are Critically Endangered   We have our work cut out for us</p></div>		</li>
