<p>Harlow also put infant monkeys in &quot;the pit of despair,&quot; where they would spend their first years in almost complete isolation. The monkeys who underwent this emerged &quot;disturbed&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes Harlow’s results so interesting to me is the behaviours the maternally-deprived monkeys showed is almost <em>exactly</em> the same as that of maternally-deprived human infants.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/VMWb8rfU-rg" target="_blank">René Spitz</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/fV9k2mJTv7U" target="_blank">others studied</a> maternally deprived infants and found they showed behaviours such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning delays</li>
<li>Rhythmic rocking </li>
<li>Self mutilation - biting, scratching, hair pulling, head banging, etc </li>
<li>Self soothing behaviours eg sucking on thumbs, skin, genitals, hair</li>
<li>Self clasping, hugging oneself, gripping own limbs tightly </li>
<li>Fecal play </li>
<li>“Floating limb” where limbs are held aloft for no reason, or restless, spasmodic movements of the limbs and digits</li>
<li>Fits of seemingly sporadic, inconsolable crying or distress</li>
<li>Inability or unwillingness to form social connections</li>
</ul>
<p>The very same behaviours can be seen in Harlow’s monkeys. And even today, if you watch videos online of “pet” or performing monkeys online, you’ll see many of those behaviours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not against animal testing but Harlow's torture methods where as much an experiment as an inquisition member using the rack.</p>
<p>Let me isolate this gregarious animal during infancy to show you it can hamper his social developement and generate problems of anxiety and self harm. Truly the pinacle of primate behavior studies, where would we be now if not for Harlow's experiments?</p>
<p>Harlow himself told he was just interested in re-creating what he felt when he was depressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regardless of the legitimate ethical issues, it's nonetheless significant that we have hard experimental data on such things. Zoos can use it to determine appropriate living conditions and methods of enrichment, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well.. Some may defend the experiments done on Jews by Nazi doctors in the same way. I know the data may be useful but, where do we cross the lines then? Should we just keep doing cruel experiments for the sake of science or do we look for alternatives that may not give straightforward answers but are considered more ethical? </p></div>		</li>
