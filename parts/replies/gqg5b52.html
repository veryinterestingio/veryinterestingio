			<div class="markdown"><p>Risks are slightly misleading here. These injections weren't designed to be given directly into the bloodstream. A variety of things can happen but most likely it just won't work as well. Neither intramuscular or intravenous injections are better or worse than each other they are just two different routes of administration that each have benefits and drawbacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that doing a vaccine in the blood stream that wasn't designed to be administered that almost always makes it less effective. Part of the benefit of doing it in a muscle is that it creates almost like a training ground where your body can go and slowly create antibodies to neutralize it and build up a significant amount of immunity. If it goes directly to the bloodstream, your body wipes it out much more quickly, which doesn't give it a chance to learn how to efficiently battle it and create the antibodies and T cells needed to fight it again in the future.</p>
<p>I'm sure its different for various vaccines, but that was the way it was explained to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Normally there's no sound in space because there's no gas molecules to carry the sound. However, if you have a rocket engine shooting gas molecules straight at you at several kilometers per second, the gas molecules hitting you can carry the sound just fine. It's the same principle with explosions by the way, if they're big and close enough, they'd be audible even in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to the one on the 'dislocated shoulder'. </p>
<p>Guy comes in with dislocated shoulder from a motorcycle accident.  The orthopedic doc takes about 30 X-rays/CT scans to see if it's broken, it's not,  just dislocated. So now it just needs to be a closed reduction of his shoulder.  The guy was in terrible pain, so he's given multiple large doses of Versaid and Antivan, and he's finally out. The doc ask me, as I'm a large guy to help reduce it.  It takes over an hour of pulling, twisting, jerking, contorsions and finally gets it back in place.  More X-rays to confirm, and it's good. Doc also checks pulses and nerves to ensure nothing was damaged or injured, looks good.</p>
<p>Two hours later, the guy starts to come around, still hurts as bad as you can imagine, but the guy has full mobility and function - but he doesn't want to move it because of the pain, lays there moaning for 3 more hours.  </p>
<p>Now, fight and use it?  Not in this realm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asystole is a type of cardiac arrest. It is the state of total cessation of electrical activity from the heart, which means no tissue contraction from the heart muscle and therefore no blood flow to the rest of the body. Basically your heat stops beating. You donâ€™t us defibrillators (the large shocking paddles) to restart the heart if itâ€™s stopped. </p>
<p>If you feel no pulse or the patientâ€™s breathing has stopped, youâ€™re supposed to do Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If youâ€™re trained, remember CAB (compressions, airway, breathing). If not, just do compressions at 100-120 compressions per minute. </p>
<p>Youâ€™re supposed to use defibrillators to prevent or correct arrhythmia (a slow/fast/uneven heartbeat). It works by sending an electrical shock to the heart and essentially resetting the heartbeat. It <em>can</em> be used to restart a heart that is stopped but only when used in conjunction with chest compressions. </p>
<p>The reason chest compressions are so important is because if your organs, especially your brain, does not receive oxygenated blood, they can die within minutes. Chest compressions keep the blood flowing. </p>
<p>TLDR Stopped hearts donâ€™t usually get shocked, youâ€™re supposed to do CPR, particularly chest compressions. Defibrillators are to correct a heart thatâ€™s out of whack, not restart a stopped heart.</p></div>		</li>
