Am I misreading OP? I thought they were asking about why it feels physically weird, but everyone is answering about sound?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I think they meant that the sound is reminiscent of biting a rock, so your instincts tell you that's a bad sound and cause you to cringe and get that awful physical feeling. I might have misinterpreted it though.</p></div>		</li>
