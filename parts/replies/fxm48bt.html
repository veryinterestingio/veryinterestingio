			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer, but since pretty much all answers to this post seem to be focused on the how rather than the why, worth pointing out that essentially the overarching reason 0 in the above list that drives everything above and more, is that evolution has selected us for a particular useful lifespan, and beyond that there has been insufficient selection pressure to select genes that would keep our lifespans longer or reduce senescence.</p>
<p>In other words, none of the physiology described above is inevitable... if evolutionary pressure had found it important or even particularly useful in total to have 120+ yr old humans around to help their clans reproduce better and prosper, we'd have had genes that kept the immune system regenerating and healthy, maintenance systems that undid the accumulation of decrepitude that we call aging and so forth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree - but when I worked as an RN for a large metro hospital, I encountered many 70+ year old cyclists whom the doctors claimed had the immune systems of 20 year olds. As in they weathered and recovered from infections and viruses like 20 year olds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well that lines up exactly with what was said.. even when those genes for longer lasting, slow aging immune systems etc exist scattered in the population, there is no strong selection pressure for them, nor an effective mechanism to select for those among the reproductive aged descendants of such elderly.. otherwise we'd all already have those genes too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely agree that the answer above is missing the more fundamental element of decay. We are, through time, constantly experiencing genetic damage. (In a sense, we are constantly in the process of dying).</p>
<p>However, it feels like even deeper than evolution is entropy. While some animals show a shocking ability to repair themselves for long lives, it’s not necessarily a “design feature” that we die at a given time. It’s pretty hard to create a perpetual self-replicating machine (to put it mildly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering entropy, our lifetime is capped at 10^100 years (that's the heat death of the universe). Until then, we could, in principle, channel the energy from the environment to keep repairing ourselves.</p>
<p>Aging is evolutionarily caused - there are organisms that don't age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly my answer. </p>
<p>The immune system shuts down as we get older because we're simply not meant to live so long. There's no biological reason to, just sentimental reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^^ this is the correct answer. It may be a bit hefty of an explanation but it goes pretty well with our current understanding of immunology and aging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The following was born from curiosity:</p>
<p>How much can the immune system be boosted with exercise? Do we understand the mechanisms by which our immune systems improve from exercise? Like, is it because our body increases mitochondrial density, RBC count in response to exercise, thus improving our capacity/capability to produce ATP and therefore improve our ability to generate more immune cells for fighting an infection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An active lifestyle and adaption of exercise appear to delay (and even reverse) onset of age-related immune dysfunctions. </p>
<p>I don't know this field of study that well in detail, but from what I gathered, the exact mechanism is not really understood.</p>
<p>I think it has to do with the systemic low grade inflammation with aging (inflamm-aging, which also contributes to age-related tissue dysfunctions and deterioration). Regular exercise seem to reduce this low grade inflammation.</p></div>		</li>
