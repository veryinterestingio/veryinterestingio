<blockquote>
<p>During this era, the Border Reivers were raiders that attacked local residents. There were both English and Scottish clans in these groups, and they would attack regardless of nationality. Local farmers would often need to make payments to the various clans as a form of protection money to ensure they are not attacked. These agreements were called &quot;Black mal&quot;, where mal was an Old Norse word meaning agreement. The word blackmail entered the English language in 1530 as a result.[3]</p>
