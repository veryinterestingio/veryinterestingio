			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I have this curious condition where food I eat, especially junk food, is turned into gasses inside my body and the pressure of this gas builds up and forces its way through my buttocks and as it comes out it is definitely loud, so though unusual it is not unheard of for the inside of your body to be responsible for being loud. Even if you were inside my body you’d still probably hear it, like being inside of a loudspeaker and dealing with all the reverberations.</p></div>		</li>
