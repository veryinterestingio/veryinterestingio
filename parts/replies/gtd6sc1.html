			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens a lot with video games, musical instruments or other complex but repetitive work. I gotta focus for a few seconds at the sequence of movements I am executing but then I have to stop thinking about it so autopilot can take over - then I realize it's working which causes me to think about it and I go back to having to focus -_-</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you're always on autopilot because the patterns you are reading are repetitive and in the instances where novelty appears, that is the pattern has changed up and appears different, and you just conveniently have labeled this as thinking/focusing, but really the whole symphony repeats endlessly in fractal form, there is no free will, only what is and what you have convinced yourself is happening when in reality, your confused on the part that it's you doing the thing, doing the thinking, doing the focusing when really its closer to the truth that the sequence of events is foe cussing you and making you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The pattern is the pattern&quot;, yeah, but the real question is: do I forget everything and give up or do I have a cup of coffee? Coffee wins, and I can't get things done without going through the apparent experience of effort anyway, so I &quot;focus&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the ladder analogy. I’ve literally been there.</p>
<p>I’ve also had the same experience while writing code in a full classroom, and eventually realizing the teacher is speaking, while I’m still coding away. Or while making out on a bench at the beach before realizing there are a hundred people all around us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I freaked out the first time this happened to me in third grade. I felt as if I was on the ceiling looking down at myself. I was able to snap out of it without anyone noticing, I think, but I was drenched in sweat. I'm not sure why I was &quot;climbing&quot; in the first place, haha.</p></div>		</li>
