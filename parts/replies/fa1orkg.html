			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently learned that there's propane-powered devices that produce carbon dioxide to lure and trap mosquitos. Additionally, most mosquitos don't travel very far in their life. Run one of those machines for a couple weeks and you can (apparently) enjoy a mosquito-free summer in your backyard!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked the front desk night shift in a small out of the way motel in the summer during high school. We’d been having a pretty slow couple weeks and out of nowhere got hit with a bunch of reservations leaving us with not enough housekeeping staff scheduled to work. I got pulled off the desk by one of the maintenance guys to help turnover a room. We get in the room and he heads for the bed to start taking the linens. A few bedbugs pop out by the headboard. He grabs the headboard to pull it from the wall to get a better look behind, and barely pulls it another two inches before hundreds of those little shits go skittering across the wall around headboard. I noped out of that room faster than any other setting in my life. On top of it being rather gross and mildly disturbing, my mother would have murdered me if I brought bedbugs home. </p>
<p>I’ll be more than happy to never see another bed bug in my lifetime.</p></div>		</li>
