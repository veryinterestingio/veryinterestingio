			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most thorough answer, but I think OP is focusing particularly on the mechanics of the hydrogen oxidation. </p>
<p>Following adsorption of the hydrogen onto the platinum, why does the applied potential encourage the oxidation reaction? Is it due to a difference in the Volta potential between the two connected electrodes, with electrons essentially being removed from the hydrogen to satisfying the unbalanced charge?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this goes to the heart of what a &quot;potential&quot; does in an electrochemical system. Most of you are probably familiar with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_coordinate" target="_blank">reaction coordinate diagrams</a> that show energy changes as a system shifts from reactant to product. The potential of the electrode can be thought of as corresponding to an energy level. You drive the reaction by selecting a potential that will facilitate electron flow - low potentials to facilitate electron flow from the substrate to the electrode for oxidation and high potentials to inject electrons for reductions. The potential itself is providing the driving force. It's not like a thermal chemical system where you need sufficient heat to overcome reaction barriers.</p>
<p>In practical terms, you would probably actually specify a current or a device potential rather than a potential for a specific electrode, but you <em>could</em> do it as described above and that's the most direct conceptual explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I go into more detail in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ez7mnt/how_do_electrons_get_separated_from_the_hydrogen/fglstzc/?context=3" target="_blank">my response</a>, but basically hydrogen oxidation is a statistical result. Hydrogen is getting oxidized and reduced constantly at the platinum surface, but the overall potential of the cell biases the reaction towards a net oxidation of hydrogen or a net reduction.</p></div>		</li>
