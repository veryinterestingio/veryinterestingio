<p>But this reaction is still a major bottleneck for the entire pp-chain.</p>

<p>This is sort of a random tangent but it's got me wondering: since this so rarely happens in our sun, have we given it any special name or is it just whatever we call step one of the pp-chain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite example has always been a compost heap. Per unit volume, a compost heap generates more energy than the sun's core.</p>
<p>Also the processor in your PC has a power density greater than a nuclear reactor core.</p></div>		</li>
