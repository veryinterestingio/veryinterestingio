			<div class="markdown"><p>Most phones also do a rolling shutter so the image isnâ€™t captured all at once. it refreshes down the sensor, so the image captured at the top is older than the image at the bottom of the picture. So your phone can capture changes is frames as it rolls through the shutter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not actually entirely true, 24fps was chosen by the film industry due to the audio density they required to fit on the film. But it is an ok approximation for eli5 I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and computer generated images are different too, you need more than 24fps for a smooth motion. It works for film because there is something like a natural motion blur effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Cameras used for filming can capture motion blur, but a videogame has to render every single object once per frame. Motion blur in games is more of a fancy effect than something &quot;naturally&quot; occuring.</p></div>		</li>
