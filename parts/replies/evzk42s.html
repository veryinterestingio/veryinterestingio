Same reason why high blood pressure is more prevalent than low. Low blood pressure causes more damage so the body has more protections against it. Low blood pressure and heart cancer will cause death quicker than something less influential. So those genes dont get past along as often in history from a Darwinian point of view.</p></div>		</li>
