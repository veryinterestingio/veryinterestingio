			<div class="markdown"><p>But prominence is limited by higher peaks, right? Mauna Kea's lowest encircling contour would cover a lot of the Pacific, if we follow the sea floor. But most of that is clearly not its base, even if it's part of its prominence. And if we used prominence, allowing a concession for the sea floor instead of surface (Mauna Kea's prominence is officially 4000+m, equal to its height above the geoid), would you not have to keep extending Everest's lowest contour to encircle Eurasia, Africa, and all the way  to the continental shelf, making it nearly 20km tall by the same metric as Mauna Kea?<br />
Do we assume a water depth on Mars to form a geoid? or does it take the average surface height?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last two sentences here interest me as well. We might know where the water would settle on Mars if there was water, but how much volume would the ocean have? If this reference geoid concept works on both planets, how can it relate to sea level, which is associated with the volume of Earth’s ocean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually definitely know where water would settle. We already know the shape of Mars' gravitational field without water, on account of that it doesn't have any. Now we just have to pour water into that until... when? On Earth, we 'pour' water until it lines up with the sea level of the actual ocean. On Mars, there's nothing to line up with. We know where the water would be if we filled Mars' gravitational field with 165 billion cubic km, we know where it would be with 166 billion, and 167. But how much do we use? That's what I don't know</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A reference geoid is really just a mathematical description of where 0 m is. On our world, we made that correspond with average sea level, but it doesn't really align like that on other planets. It's really quite arbitrary but we need it to be able to agree on what a z-coordinate actually means. Height itself is all relative - you have to pick a measurement scale and agree on it before anything makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A geoid is an equipotential surface, not necessarily actual sea level. Geoids are generally built by measuring the planets gravitational fields, which end up very &quot;bumpy&quot; because of the mass of whatever is on the planet (mountains, caverns, oceans). Whether there is water on the planet won't change the ability to create a geoid, in fact there are already gravity maps of mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, that's reasonable. But prominence and parent peaks are more of a technicality at this scale, wouldn't you say? Denali is clearly not a part of Aconcagua, and Aconcagua is clearly not a part of Everest, which is technically the (great...grand) parent of every mountain in the world. Mountain ranges could kind of be considered one long mountain too. But to my knowledge, we don't have any official scientific definition for where a mountain begins. The border may be drawn politically, but that's arbitrary. There's no rule for it. But we do know the exact depth of the base of Mauna Kea (it was like 5500+ m deep IIRC). So how do we know this if there's no definition for the base of a mountain?</p>
<p>But when we're talking below the geoid, what geoid or reference do we use?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, no, it wouldn't. Mauna Kea sits on the oceanic crust. Although we think of rocks as solid, they actually show a degree of elasticity on a large scale. The oceanic crust deforms, bending downwards, where mountains sit on top of it - so the Hawaiian islands are surrounded by a trough or moat. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.mbari.org/flexural-arch/" target="_blank">https://www.mbari.org/flexural-arch/</a></p>
<p>This means the lowest encircling contour would be in the trough, which is slightly deeper then the surrounding Pacific ocean floor. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>I suppose you could do this, but it doesn't really mean the same thing. Mauna Kea sits on oceanic crust, so everything above the lowest contour on the ocean floor is part of the mass of the mountain. Everest sits on the continental crust, so only the rocks which have been pushed up above the normal top level of the continental crust are actually part of the mountain. Of course, defining exactly where is the normal top of the continental crust is not exactly straightforward - it's not like the continental crust has a normal height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The bases lowest encircling contour line of mountain islands are below sea level. Mauna Kea is the world's tallest most prominent mountain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, look at the definition of prominence more closely: &quot;the height difference of the peak and the lowest contour line encircling it, but not containing a higher peak&quot;. Everest is a higher peak than Mauna Kea (actually many mountains are higher), therefore Mauna Kea's contour line is strictly smaller than Everest's. In fact, Everest's contour line is the entire Earth, and therefore Everest is the most prominent mountain in the world.</p>
<p>Height from base is actually different than prominence, and it's an inherently fuzzy definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This finally answered a years long question I had about why Mt. Everest, Aconcagua, and a few others on wikipedia had their height listed as their prominence too. Never knew the technical definitions of wet and dry prominence before, I wish there was a better way to quantify “base” to summit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah prominence usually stops at sea level, but since we're comparing to Mauna Kea it could be extended to the sea floor. But then Mount Everest's prominence would be the difference between Challenger Deep and it's summit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The geoid isn't really sea level. It's kinda sorta sea level on planets with large seas (such as Earth) but the way it's actually defined is a smooth gravitational equipotential. If Earth had uniform density this would be the same as Earth's reference ellipsoid. Since Earth doesn't have a uniform density we call places where the geoid is higher than the ellipsoid a mass excess, and places where it's lower we call mass deficits. It's a little bit of a confusing concept, but you can essentially think of it as &quot;what would sea level be if there was a sea here?&quot; The concept of a geoid generalizes pretty well to other planets, but it's very difficult to actually know the geoid of other planets. Without extensive measurements (done on Earth with many satellites) we can only estimate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Put another way, it's a surface with a constant gravitational potential energy. We know where it is because we've done a gravitational survey of that world with a satellite.</p></div>		</li>
