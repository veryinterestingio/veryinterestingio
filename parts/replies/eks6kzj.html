			<div class="markdown"><p>Many fish try to take in as little sea water as possible. In order to remain alive they have to filter out a Lot of the salt to do this they have really powerful kidneys and they excrete the extra salt. </p>
<p>Knowing that I would imagine that they're not much more salty than we are. They would probably react in a similar way to being salted alive in an open wound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Invertebrates, generally speaking, consist largely of primitive lifeforms that have open systems. This includes sponges who have barely any internal system at all, to jellyfish, to crabs, to worms etc. Because they're primitive, they haven't developed closed systems yet, so the most efficient way to survive in their territories is to conform internally to the environment. Far more complex lifeforms begin with vertebrates down the evolutionary line, and mostly all lifeforms that have closed systems have a spine.</p></div>		</li>
