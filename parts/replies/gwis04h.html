			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth chiming in that if you see a metal worker sprinkle stuff onto metal before/after/during heating, it's flux, and it's designed to melt into a thin layer on the surface of the metal to prevent this oxidizing. It's usually done when planning on forge welding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered what flux did! I thought it strange that they'd add a chemical when they want to keep the metal pure. Does it just burn off cleanly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It melts into a very thin layer and fills in thin gaps via capillary action. It then gets squeezed out when you force those voids closed (ideally hot enough to bond the void shut, otherwise you'll get cold shuts). It will eventually just boil off, and doesn't meaningfully impact the chemical composition of the steel. It will eat the hell out of refractory brick and insulation in a forge though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flux doesn't mix with the metal. Depending on the type of flux used it does different things, but in the case of forging it either mixes with the oxide layer to make removal easier or prevents one from forming in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally, yes, though poor procedure can screw it up. </p>
<p>Ideally it pulls impurities and rises to the surface during solidification. It's used in all forms of metal working, from blast furnace to welding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the flux in copper pipes evaporated at the welding material melting point </p>
<p>The evaporation sucks in the melted metal to seal the &quot;weld&quot;.  You aren't actually melting copper </p>
<p>You are just filling the gap with a different metal that sticks to copper.</p>
<p>Edit: what I was told, anyway, the flux part.</p>
<p>Could be totally wrong though.  Someone will point it out soon enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's basically how MiG/TiG welding works, except instead of vacuum it pumps argon or other inert gas into the area to displace the oxygen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's basically what what happens in a light bulb the vaccum inside stop the filament from burning up</p>
<p>TIG welding is done with argon gas because it doesn't reach with the metal. with stick welding it coating on the rods that melt and protects the metal from oxygen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people don't realize this, but iron actually &quot;burns&quot; at high temps. That's how a cutting torch works. You get it really hot with a oxy/acetylene and then turn off the acetylene and just burn your way through the metal by rapidly oxidizing the metal with direct oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a metallurgist in a cast iron foundry. We actually burned iron in order to do combustion analysis, which allows us to determine the carbon content.</p>
<p>Edit: there are also oxygen lances, which use pure oxygen gas, and burns the lance itself as fuel. You can cut through a foot thick steel with it if you wanted. Temperate estimates are between 2730 C and 4500 C.</p></div>		</li>
