			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome!</p>
<p>Since we're talking about the photosphere, I want to volunteer more information which is just way too neat not to share.  </p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Highest_resolution_photo_of_Sun_%28NSF%29_as_of_January_20%2C_2020.jpg/800px-Highest_resolution_photo_of_Sun_%28NSF%29_as_of_January_20%2C_2020.jpg" target="_blank">The photosphere looks really cool.</a> That pattern is made of 'granules' - those are the tops of convective columns carrying hot plasma like a conveyor belt to the sun's surface. The centers are where the hottest plasma wells up, which then moves outward towards the edges where it is cooler (and thus a little bit darker), where it starts to sink back down again. The picture doesn't give you a sense of scale, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ku3sMAN.jpg" target="_blank">but these granules are about the size of north America</a>.</p>
<p>But that means they're only about 1000 km wide, which is far far smaller than the surface of the sun. Still, these convective cells extend deep into the sun, so the outer layer of the sun is made up of like a hundred thousand giant worm-like conveyor belts of hot gas all carrying heat to the surface.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, but possibly not. It is currently theorized that Uranus and Neptune have diamond cores, due to the presence of Methane and Carbon in their atmospheres.  This is up for some debate. Even more debated is whether these formations exist in Jupiter and Saturn, which have very different gas compositions and may not form diamonds. A more recent theory is that diamonds would actually form in Jupiter's atmosphere and rain down during lightning storms.  However the pressure at the middle of Jupiter might turn the diamonds to a sort of liquid instead of solid.  It's also known that rock and ice exist in Saturn, which would sink to the middle, presumably, and form some sort of core.  But at those pressures, it may not be solid enough for a person to stand on. </p>
<p>The fact is without the destructive power of the Sun, it's harder to theorize about what's inside gas giants. Some sources:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s an explanation but I didnâ€™t feel like he answered your question. The answerâ€™s no. You canâ€™t walk on the sun. What you consider to be a solid are things that have a crystal structure. At temperatures like that in the sun you donâ€™t have these structures anymore, so there will only be fluids, gasses, plasmas.</p>
<p>The hotter stuff gets the more it wants to move around and crystal structures keep it from doing that. Crystal structures (solids) are more like a prison for particles in a sense and temperature and pressure are the keys to breaking out of the prison.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not true. There's plenty of things we consider solid that don't have a crystal structure, e.g. glasses and plastics. Defining solids on a molecular level is surprisingly hard, as what we consider solids in daily life are some quite different classes of material.</p></div>		</li>
