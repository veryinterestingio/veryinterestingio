			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time it happened to me was a trip. I'd never heard of it before and I'm not religious, but I thought I saw a demon hovering over me. Some of those visions you can see during sleep paralysis are nightmarish. Typically happens in that stage between being asleep and somewhat awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the chemical is very short acting and needs to be released constantly to have full effect. </p>
<p>I have some issues with sleep paralysis lasting too long sometimes. I'll wake up and still be slightly paralyzed occasionally. Within a few minutes I can move again. </p>
<p>So injecting it into people doesn't seem worth it. It only paralyzes them for a few minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to say this, but this is completely untrue, just like the other comment.</p>
<p>Sleepwalking doesn't occur during REM-sleep <em>at all</em>. It happens during slow wave sleep <em>before</em> REM. However, the paralysis only happens in REM, so the paralysis explanation is simply not true.</p>
<p>I have to add that serotonin isn't the natural version of melatonin. The natural version of melatonin is melatonin. However, it's true that a different breakdown of serotonin seems to be implicated somehow in sleepwalking, along with a bunch of other factors. The truth remains this: We just don't know the cause.</p>
<p>Edit: To add even more, there are indeed parasomnias where REM paralysis fails to occur. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep_behavior_disorder" target="_blank">REM sleep behavioral disorder</a> and is very different and can often be associated with some neurological condition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I appreciate your correction and don't think you need to apologize. I read the parent comment and had a &quot;That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works&quot; moment.</p></div>		</li>
