			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is more relevant than the higher rated answers about brain functions and what not.</p>
<p>To add to that, personality makes a huge difference. I grew up in a bilingual area, and there are two kinds of people: those who will speak the non-native language with lots of grammatical errors ect but it's no big deal and it doesn't bother anybody; and those who will avoid speaking it because they understand it enuff to know that they speak it very badly and aren't fast enough to put together a sentence and speak it fluently. The latter group will &quot;suddenly&quot; start to speak the language at a (maybe very) high degree of competency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, well <em>thatâ€™s</em> fascinating. Where are you from, and is this something that happens in childhood, that some kids speak early and others late? Do the levels of competency between the two groups even out at some point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same guy. I'm Australian (Thai mother) and I studied the Thai language every Sunday. My sister and I both started speaking at the same time but I was always worse at my pronunciation. I would be kept back in class for saying tongue twisters wrong because I just couldn't grasp the different tones. My sister on the other hand is an amazing musician and singer and it came so naturally to her. She would speak Thai and be understood perfectly. Me, not so much. I'd normally get a laugh in return. This really hit my confidence hard and I stopped trying to speak to family in Thai because they understood English and it was the easiest and safest route for me. My sister speaks a lot more Thai than me currently but I'm getting there I guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes more sense to me. I grew up with parents that spoke Hokkien, so I knew enough to understand them. But since I went to an English speaking school I was only ever practicing English and eventually I just spoke in English only. Because for me, English is easier and I'm less self conscious about the grammatical errors I make</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, later. Just like children who grow up in bilingual families will sometimes start speaking later, they will know two languages in roughly the same time other children learn one language. </p>
<p>And children start speaking quite abruptly as well, after spending over a year learning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this 100%. I could speak a language when I was younger. Then I shipped speaking it for about 10 years. Still could understand it. Had a very hard time getting back in the flow of it. But once I started speaking it the flood gates opened and I was about to get back to my proficiency again. It solidified in my mind that if I don't use it I'll lose it. </p></div>		</li>
