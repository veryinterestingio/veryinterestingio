			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Even if that accident was repaired to 100% factory condition, there is still a stigma that surrounds it.  Nobody in their right mind would pay the same price for a car that has been crashed versus one that hasn't.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't just call it stigma. If a car was in an accident, who guarantees that there's no damage(d part) left that just hasn't been spotted? While also cars that come straight out of the factory can have &quot;their problems&quot;, chances are much lower than if the car was in an accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To get into more technical details, metals suffer from stress damage (&quot;fatigue&quot;) that is only usually visible with x-ray or other microimaging methods.</p>
<p>Small cuts or tears not visible to the human eye, that lower the overall strength of the material.</p>
<p>This is a well-documented and important matter in aviation, and certain aircraft parts are swapped often as they tend to be subject to more stress than others.</p>
<p>In the case of a car crash, at most you will get a visual inspection and a diagonals measurement, but you could be missing hidden weak spots that could lead to catastrophic failure far earlier than a non-crashed car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think to dkf's point, there don't need to be any technical details. Purely from an optics perspective even if the two cars are otherwise identical, buyers are skeptical of buying a vehicle that has been in a crash. </p>
<p>95%+ of buyers don't know anything about &quot;fatigue&quot; or impacts to structural integrity, they just don't want damaged goods. That's what factors into the cost more than the actual condition of the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In steel, there is a lower threshold value of stress required. In aircraft, which generally are not steel, there is no lower threshold value, and with enough cycles, you break shit even at very low stresses. If your part yields, you replace it. If it didn't flex enough to crack the paint, it likely didn't flex enough to affect the fatigue life of the part either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can't restore any object to perfect condition once it's been in a bad enough accident to be written off. </p>
<p>Sure, you can replace that fender, weld out and replace that frame, but ... it's off by a bit, not enough to notice.  That other weld was not quite up to spec in the first place, and it's a little weaker than it was before.  Nobody noticed it, but it's not really that big a deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even just paint at a body shop vs the factory is subpar. We had some panels replaced on our car and the dealership bodyshop painted them. One area we had them repaint because the paint had a couple dozen bubbles and that didn't sit right with me. A year and a half later, rust under the paint on a different area. They repainted and there is rust yet again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's bad job by the shop. A good shop CAN match the factory painting. Factory painting is done by robots. Painting in a shop is done by someone who can actually adjust to match the original vehicle. However, it's done by humans.</p>
<p>Take it to another shop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. My dad is a bodyman and a lot of his job is hiding the imperfections of reconstructed damage. He’s good, but it’s never perfect. I used to work at his shop in the summers as a kid and now I can often spot when a car has had work done. I can see different shades of paint or body work that wasn’t sanded well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its purely hypothetical. Even if in theory it would somehow be possible to restore it into 100% perfect condition, you would still buy the one that didn't have an accident if it had the same price.</p></div>		</li>
