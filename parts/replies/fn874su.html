			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the current flu vaccine a combination of the expected major strains of the coming season? It is not completely effective because the flu has a large variety of strains that quickly change and you need a vaccine for each of them. Since that would be way too much effort the approach is to predict as good as we can which strains will be big this year and vaccinate against those.</p></div>		</li>
