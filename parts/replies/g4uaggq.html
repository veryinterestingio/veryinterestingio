			<div class="markdown"><p>Different chemistries, nickel based batteries in house phones can be trickle charged which means they can be in &quot;constantly ready&quot; state. They actually don't last that long without losing their capacity, but you barely noticed it since you don't use your house phone as much as you do your phone. There is also the fact that most cellphones these days draw far more power than typical house phone, so it's much more demanding to power it.</p>
<p>EDIT: I meant NiMh batteries, i haven't seen NiCd battery in devices for a long time. If you had NiCd cellphone or house phone back in a day (or even cordless tools) everybody would suggest you to fully drain battery and then fully recharge it because they have &quot;memory effect&quot;. If you only used your battery to 50% and then recharge it, battery would rember that and after a while you couldn't discharge it lower than 50%. They were also used in emergency lighting  signs where they were trickle charged whole time so i'm not sure how that goes with whole memory effect thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait isn't this incorrect? AFAIK Li-Ion batteries CAN be trickle charged (your comment felt like it implied it's only Ni-based batteries) and actually do not have the &quot;memory&quot; like for example the Ni-Cad batteries have.  </p>
<p>I remember we were told to do full charge-drain-cycles on the Ni-Cad batteries so they don't develop a &quot;memory&quot; where they actually lose their maximum storage capacity, where as Li-Ion benefit from being &gt;80% all the time, but not 100% all the time? This is where smart charging comes in, and as far as I've understood it measures the battery's voltage. When the battery is drawing power it's voltage is lower, and once it has reached it's near-saturation, it will bump back up to the expected level and with that the charger knows to stop going full-power.  </p>
<p>The &quot;rudimentary&quot; electricity functions required for such mundane thinks is utterly facinating, and my respect goes to every engineer figuring these things out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium ion can't be trickle charged, but the memory effect is absolutely true for NiCad batteries.  Some evidence suggests that LiIon also subject to this effect to a lesser degree though. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23584142/" target="_blank"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23584142/" target="_blank">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23584142/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that's true. From what I know, they like to be 50% (not higher, not lower). That's obviously impossible and defeats the purpose of a battery, but you can keep it between 60% and 40%, or 70-30%, or 80-20%, depending on how much you need between charging. You probably heard the 80-20 thing before.</p>
<p>(And avoid fast chargers; unless that's impractical for you of course. If you simply need those, or only occasionally use them, then sure.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep correct.</p>
<p>There are many factors that go into preserving batteries in phones such as charging speed limiters (which includes throttling when at higher charge percentages) as well as power diversion when fully charged, the type of battery chemistry etc...</p></div>		</li>
