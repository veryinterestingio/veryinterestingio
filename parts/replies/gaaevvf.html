			<div class="markdown"><p>This is, I’m pretty sure, the first correct answer I’ve seen. Ads are much easier to serve because there are much fewer of them, so they’re much more likely to be on an edge node close to you.</p>
<p>All the stuff about file sizes and “different tubes” miss the mark. You don’t need much of a video file in order to start playing it.</p>
<p>To go a little further, your average ad network is much better set up than your average website. If you’re seeing ads load wickedly fast while timsgardentools.com takes an age, that’s because the ad network is probably much more well funded and can afford to optimise their delivery speed. Poor Tim probably can’t, or doesn’t know how.</p></div>		</li>
