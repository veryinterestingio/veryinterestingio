<p>For the first time, novels could be mass printed and read by more people, offering intimate accounts from perspectives they would’ve otherwise never considered  </p>
<p>Specifically, there was a book written from the perspective of a servant girl. Wealthy men wrote that they were reading it and sobbing and couldn’t BELIEVE the plight this servant girl went through. It was the first time they’d been able to step inside someone else’s shoes in such a vivid and visceral way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you remember the name of that book by any chance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean the book about the servant girl? Or the article where the scholar talked about it?</p>
<p>I can try to find both</p>
<p>Edit: The article was by Lynn Hunt. I believe it was an excerpt from her book &quot;Inventing Human Rights.&quot; If you jump to about 25 min in this video, she explains it really well. It's fascinating!</p>

<p>Hunt was referring to several epistolary novels but I believe the one about the servant girl specifically was &quot;Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded&quot; by Samuel Richarson, published in 1740.</p>
<p>You can read it here: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6124/6124-h/6124-h.htm" target="_blank">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6124/6124-h/6124-h.htm</a></p>
<p>Edit: wow!!! Thanks so much for the award, I really appreciate it :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for posting your thoughts.</p>
<p>That story of wealthy men being able to relate and empathize with the servant girl really drives home the importance of reading books.  </p>
<p>Movies can do it too, but I think the fact everyone always says the book was better is because the book is better.  It gives details and direct thoughts of the characters that you can't get in a movie even with narration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has been a long time, and I wont disagree that Enders Game has insight granted from his perspective, but I also distinctly remember a lot of it being in explicit conversations between his trainers.</p>
<p>Things like &quot;We didn't step in because we needed him to feel like he had to solve his own problems&quot; etc, which kind of explained in plain words what his inner dialog was to the reader.</p>
<p>I feel like that kind of exposition doesn't work in a movie because its actually kind of boring hearing two old dudes talk to each other when watching a screen of ender getting beaten up.  (and showing ender getting beaten up is far more &quot;interesting&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally :)</p>
<p>I’ve heard it said that movies excel at action, plays excel at dialogue, and books excel at thought</p>
<p>I try to always be conscious of this when I write a script. There’s only so much you can do in a movie to show someone’s inner life—some stories are just better as books</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to build on this, some people lack the feeling of empathy but they are professionals at displaying it. Psychopaths and narcissists don't feel empathy but after meeting them you'd think you met Mr Rogers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. My father is a psychopath and he’s one of the most charismatic people you’ll ever meet, if he wants to be</p>
<p>He’s also very good at observation, which is almost empathy-adjacent. He can tell how you feel; he just can’t give a shit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn this thread is making wanna look into myself. I feel like I'm the opposite, i feel empathy (i think) but I often don't know how to show it.  I've had friends die and it's like I seem like I genuinely don't care but deep down it sucks and I am upset. It's like I just understand things happen and you just have to move on.</p></div>		</li>
