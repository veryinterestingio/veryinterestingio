			<div class="markdown"><p>In physics you would probably describe it by saying Iron has the most &quot;binding energy&quot; per nucleon. Binding energy is the amount of energy holding the nucleus together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got it. I looked into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula#The_formula" target="_blank">the equation that describes the binding energy</a> but it's not immediately apparent to me how it has a maximum at Z=26. For someone with basically no background in chemistry or physics beyond introductory high school stuff, is it just basically &quot;it does because it does&quot;? It shakes out in the coefficients and exponents somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability" target="_blank">Island of Stability</a> describes. And there is no second island - what you describe as &quot;second hypothetical place&quot; is <strong>the</strong> island of stability. Because the usual elements are... mainland? The are stable but those are never referred to as an island (of stability).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stability is the fight between the electromagnetic force and the nuclear force.  Protons are positively charged and want to repel each other.  What keeps elements together is the nuclear force but the nuclear force has a very short range and the electromagnetic force does not.</p>
<p>Once you have very large elements, say uranium, you will have protons inside of the nucleus that are far enough away to not feel the effects of the nuclear force of each other but feel the effects of the electromagnetic force pushing them apart.  At that point the nucleus is &quot;less bound&quot; and each proton/neutron will weigh more per proton/neutron than a &quot;more bound&quot; element like iron.</p>
<p>The more each proton/neutron is under the effect of the nuclear force, then the more stable it is.  The less each proton/neutron is under the effect of the nuclear force, the less stable it will be.</p>

<p>It's a Goldilocks problem. Hydrogen is too small and Uranium is too big but Iron is juuust right, so doing something that gets you closer to Iron releases energy.</p>

<p>That is as elegant a stating of the answer  as I could possibly imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont really know where to comment so I'm just chiming in here. There are theoretical models that use fission and fusion together with multiple fuels. The idea would be fusion of the large elements into smaller actinides would create the energy needed for fusion of smaller particles, which would then create the neutrons for fission of the larger particles. In short the two nuclear dynamic actions fission and fusion each happen close to one another and create a synergy, one releasing what the other needs to work better. If we had a hybrid reactor system we could potentially get huge amounts of energy from stable fusion sustained by fission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean iron isn't good for either fusion nor fission, since it has the highest binding energy? </p>
<p>Also, supernovas often produce elements much heavier than iron (since they do exist after all). Do these reactions consume more energy than they release?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes.  Fortunately, in a supernova, there is abundant energy to fuse elements together to form those heavier-than-iron elements, and to spew them out into space where they can collect and form planets like Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Type II supernovae ultimately die from this.  Massive stars produce elements by fusion until they reach iron.  But since fusing iron would require more energy than it produces it is the end of the road for the star.  It collapses and the core is crushed into a neutron star or black hole.  If it is a neutron star a massive pulse of neutrinos will fly out first producing heavier than iron elements to be formed in the surrounding mass.  This is followed by a wave of free neutrons that, in about 1 second, produce approx half of the elements heavier than iron in the universe via the rapid neutron capture (r-process).</p></div>		</li>
