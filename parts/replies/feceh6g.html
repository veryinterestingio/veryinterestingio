<p>And that in itself is absolutely mind boggling, considering our lifespans and length of existence. It's easy to type or say numbers, but to <strong>understand</strong> that length of time/distance, is just impossible.</p>
<p>So an &quot;instant&quot; may be correct on your &quot;astrophysical time scale&quot;, but it's completely irrelevant to any reasonable person and/or discussion.</p>
<p>If an insect with a lifespan of 30 days asked me, &quot;What's the temperature going to be in 6 months?&quot;.</p>
<p>I'd probably freak out and offer him a cup of coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my point though. Unless you are dealing with times that are comparable to the age of the universe, the &quot;age of the light&quot;, or the time delay between it being emitted and us seeing it is basically irrelevant. All we care about is the light we can see right now, because we don't have millions of years to stare at the sky and see what changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A related interesting fact:</p>
<p>Even though Andromeda is so far away, it's so big that its apparent width in the sky is 3^o . The full moon is only half a degree, so the Andromeda galaxy is roughly <a href="https://imgur.com/yN0p9np" target="_blank">6 times the width of the moon</a> in the sky.  It's just so faint that you need a telescope to see it.  </p>
<p>2.5 million light years away.  Still huge in the sky.</p>
<p>If you have really dark skies, you can sorta see the core with your naked eye, but it's more like an impression that something is there than anything else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For instance, our neighboring galaxy Andromeda is ~2.5 million light-years away. That sounds far, but 2.5 million years is practically &quot;instant&quot; on astrophysical time scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is this supposed to mean? The universe is 13.8 billion years old. So 2.5 million is about one fifty-five-hundredth. So relative to the age of the Earth that would be 800 thousand years. Relative to an average lifespan in the USA that's over five days. If our total length of time is one day, this 2.5 million years would represent 15 and a half seconds.</p>
<p>Let's bring an instant down to one twelfth of a second, believed by some scientists to be the minimum reaction time of the brain. For 2.5 million years to be proportional to one twelfth of a second, the total time would need to be only about seven and a half minutes.</p>
<p>So it doesn't seem accurate to me to use the term &quot;instant&quot; to describe 2.5 million years, regardless of the scale we're using. The ratio is just too big. A more accurate characterization of 2.5 million years in astrophysics terms would be &quot;not quite as long as it sounds.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its &quot;instant&quot; compared to the lifespans of most stars, the orbital periods of most galaxies, and the evolution of gas clouds, the kinds of processes that govern the universe today. </p>
<p>Your observation could be rephrased then as the universe is actually quite young. We believe that the sun is only a 3rd generation star, for instance. We are near the beginning of the time when, for instance, life is possible. Such a time would likely be limited by the lifespans of the last stars, so ~1 Trillion years, or roughly 100 times the universe's current age.</p></div>		</li>
