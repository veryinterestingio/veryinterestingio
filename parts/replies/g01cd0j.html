			<div class="markdown"><p>The withdrawals that kill you outright tend to be GABA related, alcohol, benzos, barbituates. For other drugs it's more like you die as a side effect of withdrawing, like being too uncomfortable to drink water or something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh? What other drug besides alcohol, benzos, or other GABA affecting drugs cause death from withdrawal symptoms?</p>
<p>the link you posted says that withdrawal symptoms from opiates are not particularly dangerous in the sense that the symptoms do not cause death.</p></div>		</li>
