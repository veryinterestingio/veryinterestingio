			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person with an anxiety disorder, relatable. This actually happens to some people (Urbach-Wiethe syndrome), but I’m definitely not jealous. There is a story about someone who has this who laughs at scary movies, doesn’t mind touching spiders or snakes, and didn’t even run away when she was attacked at knife point while walking in a park. From <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/meet-the-woman-without-fear" target="_blank">this</a> article:</p>
<p>“As she approached, he pulled her down, stuck a knife to her throat and said, ‘I’m going to cut you, bitch!’ SM didn’t panic; she didn’t feel afraid. Hearing a church choir sing in the distance, she confidently said, ‘If you’re going to kill me, you’re gonna have to go through my God’s angels first.’ The man let her go and she walked (not ran) away.” </p>
<p>People with no amygdala can be scary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to remove but you can make it &quot;normal&quot;, as anxiety disorders usually means your amygdala is over active.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point and yeah the effects of meditation on amygdala activity in the context of anxiety/stress are super interesting. It also seems like meditation and SSRIs might have somewhat similar effects on the amygdala (example: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802527/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2802527/</a>), so that’s pretty cool too since meditation and SSRIs might both be calming down the amygdala in similar ways to help reduce stress/anxiety.</p></div>		</li>
