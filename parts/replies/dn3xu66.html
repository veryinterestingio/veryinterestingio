			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to be argumentative, and your statement &quot;Every person who has killed themselves regretted the moment it was too late&quot; is somewhat of a proven normal occurrence. But EVERY person is a bit too specific.</p>
<p>I've tried four times. Twice by cutting, twice by over dose. EVERY time I woke up the next morning (or out of a coma several days later) I felt disappointed in myself for fucking this up too. Not at all did I feel relieved. Even after the pill swallowing or the cutting, I felt like I was able to relax because it would all be over soon. I was never once afraid, or went seeking help or regretted my decision. </p>
<p>Maybe this is why it's still such a huge idea I struggle with. I'm also 27 and am absolutely convinced that I will never live an entire year without having to talk myself out of suicide for my son and finances sake more than once. He (my fianc√©) and I actually have a &quot;code emoji&quot; that I send him when the thoughts get too severe because I know I would never be able to actually SAY what I'm feeling.</p>
<p>I'm glad you've found the strength you need. Don't let it slip away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first attempted od was about 17. Fuck was I dissapointed when I woke up. Especially when I spent a solid 24 hours dry heaving, sweating and drifting in and out of some sort if consciousness. The Simpson on VHS (I'm old) pulled me through it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus i knew I was a depressed but I didn't realize my brain using suicide as my back up ( it's always there) was so serious. When I'm having a bad day my brain says just that &quot;well suicide would be a fix&quot; I'm going to see a doctor in a few weeks to finally address this issue. I have more to talk about than I thought. Thank you for sharing this really brought my issue to the forefront.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been seeing a doctor because I do have severe depression but I get what you mean. It's the same here, things will just be sort of stressful and shit and suicide will always be in the back of my mind like that. Idk, I've never tried or intended to seriously go through it in the short term, it does scare the shit out of me, but it's always been like an 'option' in my mind to deal with lots of stress. Is it not like that for other people? It just always sort of seemed that way to me, like idk, a way to push it off as not mattering because I do <em>have</em> a solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what people don't understand about death.. It's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  It's just rest.  Returning to the universe as you were before you were born.  Something to look forward to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Death is normal, I think is what you meant to say as hundreds of thousands of people die every day. And I'm sure it's not bad. I mean you just turn off as if you would have never been born. I don't think it's something that is to look forward to unless because of external factors or illnesses such as depression that make death seem like the best option for you. Those trick you...because ultimately the goal of our species is survival, right? </p></div>		</li>
