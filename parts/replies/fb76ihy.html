			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really my area, but I'd agree with this. There's a book called The Idiot Brain that basically explains what's going on when your senses are fighting each other (like in motion sickness, where you're still but moving) if you're really interested. It's only a small section of the book, but the rest of it is great too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's ironic because in the modern day a lot of primordial traits that made humans successful are now detrimental to a good life (most notably the HPA stress response because it causes synapse degradation). Anyone reading this who has a stress problem should address it because it can decrease memory availability by hindering the hippocampus weak. Running (sprinting not jogging), while also relieving stress, is the only activity I have heard of that is scientifically proven to significantly increase hippocampal connections and memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so you’re not quite right, but not too far off either. The fluid in the semicircular ducts are what enables our body to track angular momentum (curves and corners). The otolith organ tracks changes in linear acceleration (forward/backward, up/down).</p>
<p>A very ELI5 is that there is a viscous fluid in the otolith organs that when it moves, stimulates tiny hairs in the organ. The hairs being stimulated makes you “feel” the motion. When you’re on a treadmill that fluid starts to slosh in a rhythmic fashion. When you get off the treadmill you’ve stopped moving, but the fluid is still sloshing. Once the waves subside, so does the perception of motion.</p></div>		</li>
