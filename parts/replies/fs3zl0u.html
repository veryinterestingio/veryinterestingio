			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have a problem balancing, just not a big one.</p>
<p>Balancing is not just about the tail, animals that rely on balance have numerous adaptations to help them, not just a tail.  A tailless cat or squirrel might still seem very graceful to us, but it would not be as graceful as its more fortunate friends.</p></div>		</li>
