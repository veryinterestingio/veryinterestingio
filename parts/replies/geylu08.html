			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct; Building services engineer.</p>
<p>The problem is the thermostat/air temperature in a space has a poor correlation to human comfort. A far better indicator is  a black globe thermometer, which takes more account of the heat loss/gain by radiation to other surfaces.</p>
<p>Example; a new heating system fired up in winter. The thermostat said it was 21 degC  (70 degF) and I should be comfortable. I was COLD because all the walls, floors and ceilings were cold and you were losing heat to them by radiation. It took several days for the structure to warm up and for 21 degC to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Winter time; you're losing heat by radiation to cold surfaces and feel cold at 21 degC. Summer time the same 21 degC feels warm, all the surfaces have been warmed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found this out the hard way. </p>
<p>I lived in a condo in Texas with a way oversized air conditioning system. </p>
<p>It would kick on and cool the room down in (not kidding) two minutes.  Like go from “hmmmm, it’s a little warm to OMG I need a heavy blanket.”  Of course, the air temperature is 65 degrees in some places by the time the thermostat registers the change. </p>
<p>Now, it chilled the air to 65, but everything in the room is still 78 degrees.  Suddenly, you feel very warm because of all the radiant heat.  But the air is still 68 degrees because it takes time to warm that air back up.  You’ve been sweating in bed for an hour and then suddenly the a/c is back on again because the air is now 75 degrees again.  </p>
<p>Rinse and repeat all fucking night long.  You could eventually get things to kind of balance out but you had to keep the temp cooler than you wanted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that is it cools the room down faster than it removes the humidity. A smaller AC system will run longer, and remove more humidity, while not lowering the temperature as much.</p>
<p>Your body will prefer dryer air that is warmer, because then it can sweat to cool down further, but what you're getting is cold, damp air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's worse about oversized A/C systems, is that they don't run long enough to dehumidify the air. Most of the comfort effect of A/C is from dehumidification, not lowering the temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, excellent example. It has the opposite effect, in that you're gaining heat by radiation from a large warm surface and you'll probably feel more comfortable with the air-temperature thermostat (or temperature set point)  set a degree or so lower than the more usual 21 degC (70 degF) for conventional heating systems.</p>
<p>I've been in building services for 30 odd years and can only recall seeing one black globe temperature sensor and that was in a 2-storey atrium that had underfloor heating. Thermostats are so obsolete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES i have it and it's so toasty, it's like your whole world is the heated seats in your car. The best part is, because it's the surfaces that are warm, when someone opens the door and lets the cold air in the house, the temp recovers SO much faster. Basically as soon as the door is closed you're warm again.</p>
<p>Downside: when it's REALLY cold out (talking -20F here) there are some really, really hot areas on the floor as the system has to keep the floors very warm to make up for the heat loss. </p>
<p>Upside: it's very cheap, we keep the house warm (like 73) and it runs at most $200/mo for 2000 sq ft and tons of windows in Michigan winters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer here.</p>
<p>I remember reading about heat-efficient building design in Germany.  Airtight construction, and heating/cooling is done exclusively via water pipes in the floors/ceilings.  Heat exchangers between the ducts exhausting inside air and those bringing new outside air in help keep the air temps stable, but otherwise the air temp is only a secondary effect of the radiative heating or cooling from the surfaces (and other heat generators such as the people themselves).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water can probably be circulated underground too depending on local climate), which would increase the efficiency of the system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't it be disastrous for air quality? All the dust particles and odours, circulating endlessly...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ideal is to have the building airtight and then provide ventilation so you’re only bringing in air that passed through some conditioning system.  For example, a he outside air tends to be overly humid in summer and overly dry in winter, if you just allow random air exchange then you’re also affecting the internal humidity.  By sealing and using forced ventilation one can ensure that the air coming in is at the desired humidity level.  That air can also be filtered against allergens and other airborne contaminants, and passed by a heat exchanger so you’re not wasting heated/cooled air to ventilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building codes have minimum air exchanges per hour.  Depending on the source for your odor or dust - is it from indoors or outdoors?  If it comes from outdoors, minimizing air exchanges reduces dust levels, and presumably you have filters for that too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not-uncommon in colder climates in other areas too (I know homes are built that way in the North US and Canada sometimes).  The Germans pioneered it and the term for it is from German: Passive house, or passive haus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity plays a big part in feeling hot or cold, particularly in hotter weather. It's because you forgot one method of heat transfer - evaporation. We sweet to cool ourselves off. Which is much more effective in low humidity than high humidity.</p></div>		</li>
