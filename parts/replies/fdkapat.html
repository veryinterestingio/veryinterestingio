			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.(1) Its thought that the innovation of cooking is what freed up enough calories to have the resources to evolve brains to the size seen in homosapiens as opposed to other primates who have to spend exponentially more time foraging and chewing to obtain much fewer calories.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it uses a bunch of our ATP (energy produced from calories) to go against the concentration gradient and keep sodium outside our cells and potassium in them. It helps with action potential and nerves too I think. Our bodies are so complicated, it’s very interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Voltage gated ion channels are involved in exponential effects of action potentials.  Sodium potassium pumps work to polarize cells of nerves and to maintain the health of all cells by being the main way of increasing polarization.  They use energy to push sodium and potassium against their concentration gradients.  Ion channels do exactly as the name suggests.  When open, ions flow through them.  Voltage gating means that the proteins change shape once an action potential is reached and they allow the action potential to be propagated and increased.  They open and more positive ions flow in depolarizing the cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sodium potassium pump is a lot like what it sounds. It pushes sodium out of the cell, and brings potassium into the cell, both ions moving against their concentration gradient. It’s powered by ATP and for each cycle, it pushes out three sodium ions and brings in two potassium ions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_bPFKDdWlCg" target="_blank">Here’s a simple video for you. </a></p>
<p>A true ELI5: sodium potassium pump is like a door at the cell wall. ATP is the bouncer who opens the door, and each time he does, he allows two potassium ions to come in, and makes three sodium ions leave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your cells needs to transport stuff in and out of the cell. Some stuff like water and carbon dioxide can just pass through the cell membrane freely. This is called passive transport, which means no energy is being used to transport whatever is going through the cell membrane. Other stuff needs a little more assistance to go through the cell membrane, so your cell sends energy to a pump to help with this. This is called active transport, because it actively uses energy. The sodium-potassium pump is one such example of this,and it cycles sodium and potassium ions in and out of the cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple explanation is that the human body uses a chemical form of energy (ATP) in order to power a huge number of tiny pumps that trade sodium from inside a cell for potassium outside of the cell. This is against the normal state of everything being the same amount of chemicals inside the cell as outside of the cell, so more potassium is inside the cell then outside and more sodium is outside the cell then inside</p>
<p>This builds up a chemical charge that can be used for instance in brain cells to transmit information or in heart cells to transmit the electrical wave that causes the heart to beat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just anecdotal evidence, but I have a chronic illness (Addison's Disease) that messes with my sodium-potassium pump. It's basically always in overdrive. Before I was on medication to help, my body essentially dumped sodium and has my pump set to 0% sodium: 100% potassium. Severe weight loss is a symptom. Considering the disease also slows your metabolism and makes it so you can't do much, it never made sense to me why I dropped weight so fast. This could be an explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleeping in a room cooled to 65 degrees promotes the production of &quot;brown fat&quot;, metabolically active fat tissue once thought to only be present in infants. People who live in cold climates have larger stores of brown fat, mostly around our shoulders iirc, which allows them to tolerate colder temperatures comfortably but also increases caloric consumption at rest. Sleeping in colder temperatures is associated with improved health outcomes and healthy body weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not as much as you'd think. One major strategy of our body to conserve heat is by constricting peripheral blood vessels, which would just make you cool to the touch, not burn any more calories. Only shivering and brown adipose tissue burn calories.</p></div>		</li>
