Please dont put your wifi routers on top of your basement fuse panels folks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, WiFi and cellular &quot;bars&quot; are not a standardized unit of measure. If you and a buddy are standing in a room together and you're asking yourself &quot;why am I only getting 2 bars while he has 3?&quot; The answer may likely be that you're getting the exact same wattage, just one phone labels that as 3 bars to make themselves feel better while the other calls it 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iPhones actually factor the quality of the connection via packet loss and other factors in along with dB to determine how many bars to show (I believe just cellular though). Android may or may not do that now, but I know it definitely didnâ€™t a couple years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This principle is true. But probs not the same wattage, as the receivers are probably going to be different in each phone. But yeah what each phone determines what wattage is, is up to the maker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is even bigger than you make it out to be. Back in the days of my iPhone 3G, it would almost always show 5 bars. Unfortunately anything less and it couldn't even make a phone call</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure how related this is, but mine makes my PC speakers make a pulsing noise when it's placed near them, and it stops if I adjust it just 10-50 mm - do you know what's happening to make the noise, and could it be affecting the strength/stability of the wifi?</p></div>		</li>

I haven't heard this as much lately but &quot;<a href="https://www.geek.com/geek-pick/what-causes-gsm-buzz-1538169/" target="_blank">GSM buzz</a>&quot; is totally a thing. Basically your audio cables act as antennas and certain frequencies can be picked up and amplified by speakers and audio circuitry. I don't think I've heard this with wifi though. It operates in a frequency range that is a lot higher than cell phone signals so it would probably be inaudible to the human ear. </p>
<p>I suppose it could just be some electronics inside of your router that are giving off some stray RF signals and not the wifi signal itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything electronic puts out some kind of radio signal.  Sometimes it's intentional (WiFi router), sometimes it's not (most power supplies). Sometimes it can be both.  </p>
<p>Some speakers are shielded and some aren't.  Those that are not can sometimes pick up radio interference like the other person mentioned.</p>
<p>So it's possible that the router's power supply was causing interference which you heard in those pulses.  This happens because it transforms AC power from the wall into DC power that your router can use.  Cheap transformers are noisy (sometimes audibly, sometimes by way of radio noise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, signal strength (called &quot;Received Strength Signal Indicator&quot; or RSSI) is not the only indicator for the quality of the signal.</p>
<p>One must also look at the noise in the Wi-Fi frequency band which is also measured in dBm or Watts. For instance, one might get an acceptable Wi-Fi signal, with an RSSI of say -70dBM, but with a noise level of -60dBm (thus carrying 10 times more power) your signal will be unreadable. </p>
<p>This is why you can have a poor signal even though you're not that far from your router: all the noise caused by the other routers in the same building will interfere and cause poor signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called RSSI (received signal strength intensity) and much like with cell signal is its <em>only one method</em> of calculating bars of signal - there is absolutely no standard whatsoever to suggest what bars of signal mean and they absolutely can and usually do vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from phone to phone</p>
<p>Other examples of what bars could mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available bandwidth</li>
<li>Signal to noise ratio (SNR)</li>
<li>maximum data transfer rate</li>
<li>Any combination of the above 4</li>
<li>A bunch of other crap</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bars never show SINR (Or SNR) Just raw power RSSI. If you can find RSRQ that is similar to SNR. -10 RSRQ is good 1 is perfect,-15 you are having issues. At -17 most receivers are not able to extract a signal from the noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I was wondering that as well.</p>
<p>I feel that SNR would make more sense from an RF point of view, or the available bandwidth from a user perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last I checked, my phone couldn't measure SNR though. It had RSSI, but no way to measure the noise level. I'm assuming that's a hardware limitation, though I haven't checked on my newest phone.</p></div>		</li>
