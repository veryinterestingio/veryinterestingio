<p>I see some problems with the question as currently stated vis-a-vis answering this from a scientific perspective. For one, we cannot measure conscious states or qualia. I know the qualia I am currently experiencing, but there is nothing I could measure which would tell me the qualia you or anyone/anything else is currently experiencing. This makes the question impossible to answer.</p>
<p>However, if you are still looking for an opinion (and I will stress that is an opinion only), I believe one's subjective experience is a mental (i.e. psychological/neural) shorthand based on past experiences to related stimuli, to formulate a context around which to appropriately respond to the stimulus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I think I agree with you on your opinion. I think qualia may just be a conflation of inputs with interpretations. Does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just because we currently lack the means to measure qualia does not mean that we will never possess such means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've just studied animal behavior but my take is that they don't call it the &quot;hard problem&quot; for nothing.</p>
<p>What I'm really interested in is where the boundaries of subjective experience are.  What's it like to be a bat, and all that.  No answers or ideas about how to get them, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand how that would allow for the information processing that underlies conscious processes. But can you elaborate on how that can give rise to conscious experience (qualia) as separate from the information processing that a computer is capable of?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your goal is to separate Turing complete machines from brains, you can point out how computers are digital state machines while brains are more analog. </p>
<p>Things that effect brains (physically) are additional variables like chemical gradients as well as connectivity and local, even sub-cellular states. Nothing really tells us that we can't theoretically represent the full state of a brain with enough accuracy to end up with a perfect simulation, but it really works in a fundamentally different way. Part of why a brain runs on about 20W while a desktop runs on a few hundred, and does a lot less &quot;computation&quot; for that energy.</p>
<p>Qualia are probably some kind of window our conscious mind uses to interpret and effect these states. There's thought to be some governor type processes in our brains to kind of keep things on track. What those qualia are like to me versus you versus a dog or a nematode is probably fundamentally unknowable, but worth a philosophical consideration to be sure</p></div>		</li>
