<p>It is interesting that this is not strictly necessary. As an example, the gravitational force between Sun and Moon is always larger than the gravitational force between Earth and Moon. But the Moon still orbits Earth - because the gravitational attraction from the Sun is quite uniform, so Earth and Moon feel nearly the same acceleration and can orbit each other while orbiting the Sun together.</p>
<p>You need a moon (or a moon of a moon) to be well within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill%20sphere" target="_blank">Hill sphere</a> of the parent body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway, what I pointed out would be true for a smaller moon as well - and even for a spacecraft.</p></div>		</li>

And high level would be referring to the smaller satellites</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter's size makes it harder, not easier here. It may help Jupiter keep its moons versus losing them to the Sun, but it wouldn't assist in the next step, since those moons would need to resist Jupiter. You'd want a planet very distant from the sun, with a moon very distant from it, etc.</p></div>		</li>
