			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is much more like my (and almost every) rural septic system. The water in my toilet (and entire house) comes from my well. When I flush the toilet, the waste and water go into the septic tank. The solids settle out and bacteria start working on them. Every few years I have the solid sludge pumped out; it's taken to a treatment facility. The water flows through the system until (in my case) it's pumped into the leach field in another part of the yard. From there the water is free to be used again for whatever purpose, including eventually re-entering my well and my home's plumbing. (Though the well is on one side of the house and the leach field is on the other. But I suppose it could happen.) My water always tastes wonderful and I just never wonder about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I moved into a house with a well water system a little over a year ago and it's the best tasting tap water I've ever had.  I don't worry about it at all.  In fact, people who come to visit and end up having a glass of water even comment on it tasting really good.  I became such a fan of well water we looked for a house with one when we had to move from that place</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't totally true. Most waste water plants actually use bacteria and gravity to treat the water, no chemicals necessary. Drinking water treatment plants do add a variety of chemicals to kill bacteria, taste, clarity of the water.</p></div>		</li>
