<p>We don’t report deposits to the IRS, we report them to FinCEN. We only report interest earned. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what were to happen if you sold 50k worth of computers that were going to be thrown out at your job and you found an eBay seller that purchased it all by wiring the money over to your bank? (True story- kinda freaking out now). I didn’t buy a Ferrari or anything with it. I just invested it in the stock and crypto market. Say Bitcoin goes “to the moon”. I imagine some eyes will bat as I start taking profits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally, putting high dollar amounts, even $500 on one of those prepaids is super risky. The card issuer will never believe it's not for fraud use and then prob freeze the money with no recourse, as has been reported on personal finance. Really nobody likes to see high dollar amounts, even over $200 on prepaids, speaking as a merchant who has had to take them.</p></div>		</li>
