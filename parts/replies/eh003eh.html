			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto that last point: It wasn’t just the American government that was belittling the flu’s effects. It was EVERY Government involved in WWI. Neutral Spain was one of few places where the press reported it, hence the “<em>spanish</em> plague”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In healthy adults their immune systems basically nuked their lungs</p>

<p>This begs the question of why did this strain of flu elicit such a strong immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 100% sure, but I think this strain actually infected the lungs, while most flu strains only get as far as the throat and upper respiratory tract. I couldn't say if the immune system always reacts that strongly to the flu, or if it's just that the lungs are particularly delicate. <a href="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/61KT7oyskwtxDJC__uq-BJXPmYs=/fit-in/1072x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/63/81/6381c3ad-ff8f-4607-a771-16f8566d404a/nov2017_e01_fluhistory1918.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a picture of a preserved slice of lung from one of the soldiers that died from the flu (via Smithsonian).</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason it was called the Spanish Flu is that it broke out during World War One.  The warring parties, not wanting to acknowledge any issues that might benefit the enemy, suppressed reporting on the flu.  Since Spain wasn't in the war, they didn't censor the news, and so the first reports people heard were from there even though it was raging all across Europe.  So the governments did worse then stick their head in the ground, they actively suppressed information that people/medical institutions could have used to realize how dangerous the situation was.</p></div>		</li>
