			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly cold brewing is super easy and you dont really need a bunch of fancy equpiment for it. Just put the grounds in a jar/container, wait 12 hours and strain them out. if you already have filters for making regular coffee they work great for cold brew as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I brew cold brew in my french press. I use slightly more beans than normal, grind them coarsely as normal, add water, stir, and let it sit overnight. Next morning, press and pour. Delicious every time.</p></div>		</li>
