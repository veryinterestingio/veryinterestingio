<p>Depending on the wavelength, some are absorbed by the air, which would cause re-emission of a photon, often of a different energy level and almost always traveling on a different direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AC power grids convert between high voltage and low voltage for transmission and distribution. The transformers are pretty efficient, but there are still losses in this conversion, and it's all done at 60 Hz (USA).</p>
<p>An optical grid would have to convert between 60 Hz for use and \~300 THz for transmission. This conversion has much more loss than a low-frequency voltage conversion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, one major detail that tends to get lost in this discussion is that the backbone of Tesla's wireless system was supposed to be a network of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US645576A/en" target="_blank">&quot;high&quot; altitude balloons</a>. </p>
<p>Air's conductivity is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen%27s_law" target="_blank"> <em>massively</em> affected by air pressure</a>. As you get closer to a vacuum, the resistance actually approaches zero.
This means it is MUCH easier for an EM field to propagate (or even arc) in a low pressure environment. </p>
<p>Tesla was planning to use that increased conductivity and the atmospheric density changes of the tropopause (~30,000ft or ~9.5Km) to extend the range of his transmitters much like how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOFAR_channel" target="_blank">SOFAR channel</a> can exponentially increase the transmission range of sound. </p>
<p>This doesn't completely negate the transmission losses, but in theory you could maintain an arc that was as (or more) efficient than a wire for the same distance if you could keep the transmitters at the right elevation/pressure...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just the breakdown voltage though... the conductivity is rather unrelated, no? </p>
<p>I'd be more concerned with atmospheric absorption (complex refractive index), especially for higher-frequency EM waves.</p></div>		</li>
