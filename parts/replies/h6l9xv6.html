			<div class="markdown"><p>Rain occurs when a colder air mass causes humid air to drop in temperature, forcing the water vapor to condense into a liquid.</p>
<p>This can happen if a cold air mass pushes south into warmer air, or it can happen if very hot air generates updrafts into the upper atmosphere and cools down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it also accurate to say that it's like peeing only a little bit when your bladder is full? You don't just pee until you aren't full, you pee until empty. Same as rain clouds...right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about relative humidity. The warmer the air, the more water it can hold, so 100% humidity at 30 C is a lot more water than 100% humidity at 5 C. When the air cools, it will still hold that 100% relative humidity but any excess moisture will fall as rain.</p>
<p>Relative humidity drops when the air warms back up, at which point liquid water will start evaporating again. And if it's in an area without much liquid water to evaporate, then it'll stay dry until it gets to an area with water.</p></div>		</li>
