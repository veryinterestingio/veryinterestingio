			<div class="markdown"><p>What hormones does adipose tissue produce?</p>
<p>A number of different hormones are released from adipose tissue and these are responsible for different functions within the body. Examples of these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>aromatase, which is involved in sex hormone metabolism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TNF alpha, IL-6 and leptin, which are collectively termed ‘cytokines’ and are involved in sending messages between cells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which is involved in the clotting of blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>angiotensin, which is involved in blood pressure control</p>
</li>
<li>adiponectin, which improves the body’s sensitivity to insulin and so helps to protect against developing type 2 diabetes</li>
</ul>
<p>lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein E, which are involved in storage and metabolism of fat to release energy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the interesting and distressing facts I recall from The Secret life of Fat is that the production of leptin, which is the hormone that inhibits hunger, is reduced when people lose fat.  So getting really hungry when losing weight is not bc you reduce food intake but bc you there is less leptin in your body</p></div>		</li>
