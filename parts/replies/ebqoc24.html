			<div class="markdown"><p>It took me a while to realize what you were saying. &quot;If brown is just dark orange, then orange is just lighter brown. But when we picture light brown, we picture something other than orange. So what is this light brown?&quot;</p>
<p>The light brown you picture is not just light brown, it's desaturated light brown, meaning it's made lighter by adding light from colors other than orange. If you make it lighter by only adding more light that is orange, you'll get saturated light brown, which is equivalent to orange. </p></div>		</li>
