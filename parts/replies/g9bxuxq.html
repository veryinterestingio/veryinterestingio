			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not the biggest issue.   The biggest issue is cross species proximity, which doesn't typically happen in western factory farms, and indeed <em>most</em> farms in the world.  Pigs are in particular good vectors for virus transmission to humans, as swine immune systems are closer to human immune systems (see <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/pdf/S0966-842X(11)00195-8.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/pdf/S0966-842X(11)00195-8.pdf</a>) vs other livestock animals.  Even &quot;avian flu&quot; typically crosses bird then to pig, in fact one of the bigger issues is that pigs can be infected with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza" target="_blank">pig viruses, human viruses, and <em>bird</em> viruses</a>. </p>
<p>But these kinds of events end up being common enough now, that subsequent infections of avian flu are much less likely to become <em>more</em> deadly than the flu, paradoxically, because of how high the risk of bird-&gt;swine-&gt;human transmission is. We currently have zoonic avian flu sitting in the normal flu cycle today, as well as swine flu, so those specific pathogens are unlikely to catch our immune systems &quot;off guard&quot; even on reservoir re-infection with a new mutation.  </p>
<p>Another example of factory farming not being the biggest issue we face today interms of pandemics is getting rid of factory farming would have done literally nothing to stop COVID.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpoJGYlW54&amp;list=FLNAUAv-8ZaF0HiKrmaPS38Q&amp;index=28" target="_blank">COVID was directly caused by specific economic and now <em>modern</em> cultural elite practices of a certain country</a>. Basically starvation in said country caused the country to want to move towards more efficient economic system for farm ownership, leading to privatization of farming in said country.  But while everyone was starving, people were making a living off of unconventional animals to sell and eat (turtles, bears, pangolins, bats etc...) this was not endemic to the culture at all before this period of time.  This country, after the privatization of farms, decided to continue to allow these practices, and eventually the elites in this country started eating these animals as a delicacy instead of the poor, as conventional food prices started to settle with the new privatization, further entrenching the decision to have these animals available for consumption. </p>
<p>Now what does this have to do with cross species proximity?  Well, these animals are often wild caught, and are simply put in cages on top of each other, where they get wounds, defecate, and ooze on everything.  They are not kept in sanitary environments.  People blame the wet markets, but the fact it was a wet market had much less to do with anything than the fact that you had dozens if not hundreds of disparate species right next to/on top of each other. So you multiply the chances of a virus like COVID being able to become zoonic, not because of an immune system vector like pigs, but because <em>you have so many different species with different pathogens right next to each other</em>. </p>
<p>Now why was the potential of a virus from this kind of setup a potentially much more dangerous virus than conventional livestock cross species flus we've seen in recent times?  Because our <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wmh3.348" target="_blank">immune systems as a whole</a>, haven't seen viruses that evolved along side <em>these</em> exotic species before (though we have had other coronaviruses).</p>
<p>And this isn't the first time this particular country's laws and exotic animal eating caused this problem. SARS, while it wasn't nearly as infectious as covid, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114672/" target="_blank">had a 10% mortality rate</a> and originated from similar circumstances as COVID from the same country. </p>
<p>You can expect the most deadly pandemic diseases to emanate from the places which put the most diverse amounts of animals in this highest density at the closest proximity.  We will likely see a major virus like coronavirus every 10-&gt;20 years (we got H5N1, SARS, other viruses and now Coronavirus from these practices, at <em>rough</em> intervals), though not necessarily with the same rate of infection (see SARS), because of this particular country's policies on these <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112390/" target="_blank">exotic animal wet markets</a>.  If you wanted to stop the next coronavirus like pandemic, you'd stop this particular country's practices and others like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason you hear about bird flu and swine flu so much is that waterfowl are the major reservoir of flu viruses. However, avian flu cannot infect humans directly, because humans don't have the receptor protein that avian flu uses to infect cells. Guess who has that receptor, though? Pigs. So what happens is that a strain of avian flu will jump to pigs and infect them. Then, because pigs also have receptors similar to those of humans, the avian flu will mutate in pigs to use those other receptors and then it can jump to humans. Guess where there are millions upon millions of ducks kept in close proximity to pigs? China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of obvious when you put it like that. Hopefully this pandemic will teach society a lesson about the natural threat of viruses and that keeping large animal populations together is just as dangerous as storing explosives or highly flammable material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it comes from contact element of it. Pigs and chickens are kept in large quantities closely packed together with a constantly rotating population, frequent human contact, and this is replicated in 100's of thousands of farms around the world. Meanwhile dogs and cats are typically not so tightly packed together in such a large rotating population.</p></div>		</li>
