			<p>vinegar is a 5% solution of acetic acid. Pure acetic acid is a liquid, so seasoning chips with it wouldn't work as it would make the chip soggy and disintegrate over time. By removing a hydrogen (the acid part of acetic acid) and replacing it with sodium, you turn it into a solid salt. Salts can be sprinkled on solids. Sodium is usually chosen as the replacement because it's cheap and easy to acquire, and sodium salts are soluble in water (which allows the flavoring to dissolve on your tongue). You could use other metal ions instead of sodium that are also soluble (such as lithium or potassium) but they ALSO taste 'salty' to our tongues (KCl is &quot;salt substitute&quot;). Other metal ions would not necessarily be soluble in water, or taste good. <br><br>So if you're wanting salt and vinegar flavored chips, and you need the vinegar to be solid, it's probably best to kill two birds with one stone. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, if you know it's the hydrogen ion that tastes sour, it's not a huge leap to imagine that <em>any</em> Brønsted-Lowry acid will give a sour taste. Sodium acetate is not going to be the only flavoring agent, and any pH-reducing agent will have this effect. The acetate ion, I presume, stimulates some range of bitter receptors characteristic to vinegar. The combined stimulation from multiple receptor types gives the peception of characteristic tastes.</p>		</li>

			<p>Taste researcher here!<br><br>Sour taste is actually transduced by detection of protons. It's currently believed that sourness is detected both by protons flowing into cells (any positive ion flowing into a cell will excite the cell), and partly by special ion channels that prevent a cell from firing but are shut off by protons. <br><br>But, that's just the taste side of things. The odor of vinegar will play a huge role in its flavor. You've probably heard that food's flavor is largely smell, and it's very true. Try pinching your nose shut and then eating a strawberry, or a bite of apple, then after cheering for a few seconds, let go of your nose. BIG difference. </p>		</li>

			<p>Our brains are better at tasting sodium over potassium because we're more liable to lose our sodium. Our bodies like to have a major extracellular positive ion (Na^+ ) and a major intracellular positive ion (K^+ ) for things like altering membrane potential, paired transport through proteins, and controlling cell volume. Since K^+ stays mostly inside our cells, Na^+ is flushed from the bodily fluids faster, and low sodium (hyponatremia) is the most commonly encountered electrolyte imbalance. So, we have to be able to detect the taste of Na^+ to replace what's lost.<br><br>This spatial difference in distribution is clinically important. Inject a patient with NaCl, and you haven't changed much. But a syringe of KCl into the bloodstream is the killing stroke of the lethal injection procedure. It disrupts the heart's ability to conduct electricity by stopping it from exchanging intracellular K^+ effectively.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, I said that rats can discriminate them.

			<p>The best way to describe the difference between ionic Chlorine and elemental Chlorine (in this specific scenario) is to think of Chlorine as being a spikey ball.  If it runs into anything its going to stab that thing and try to pull away some of the stuff on there.  So if you throw it at something, it will stick to them and hurt (probably a lot).  Elemental chlorine is just that spike ball and nothing else so it grabs on to anything it touches.<br><br>Ionic Chlorine is the same spike ball, but this time it has a bunch of stuff on it (the electron it grabbed up when forming an ion).  Think of that stuff as the spikes being covered in clay.  When you throw the spike ball at someone now it won't stick to them and stab them the same way because it is already covered in clay so the spikes can't get to whatever they hit.  That is the electron the same as the extra electron on the Ionic Chlorine preventing it from bonding.<br><br>Elemental Chlorine wants to bond with (stick to\impale) anything it can.  Ionic Chlorine already has the stuff it wants covering it, so it doesn't bond with things very readily.  The result is that Ionic Chlorine is very stable and safe (doesn't disrupt our bodies much) while Elemental Chlorine is very bad because it replaces and damages a lot of compounds that we really need in order to function.</p>		</li>

The thing about electrons is they generally less 'receive' an electron and more 'steal' it.<br><br>Chlorine is a cat burglar that will steal your shit REALLY hard, and isnt picky. Chlorine will steal electrons off a LOT of different types of atoms, which means chlorine reacts with almost anything with electrons to give.<br><br>A chlorine atom thats received its electron is denoted as Cl-, getting the electron has now negatively charged the chlorine, this is called an Ion. Sodium, chlorines best bud who often is seen hanging out with chlorine and giving him an electron, is denoted as Na+ as it lost an eelctron so its positively charged.<br><br>Normally just like to sit side by side, on benches or whatever, with both their hands on the electron they are sharing.<br><br>But if they get pulled really hard apart by something else, Chlorine will hold on to the electron and drag it away from Sodium.<br><br>This happens in lots of different ways, the two prominent of which are when dissolved in water (now they're washed around and split up, floating about, chlorine holding on to his electron and lonely sodium unsure of where his friend just went)<br><br>Also it happens in air all the time when theres a huge difference in static charge between the two, this is called Plasma. The static difference between the ground and a charged up cloud can get so strong the poor little ionic compounds floating about in the air between the two get briefly torn apart.<br><br>Why? Free floating ions are <em>very</em> good at conducting electricty.

			<p>chlorine is dangerous in the form of a &quot;radical&quot;, usually written &quot;Cl•&quot;. This is a very &quot;electronegative&quot; atom, which means it wants to fulfill the &quot;octet rule&quot; by pulling electrons from other atoms and &quot;reduce&quot; itself to the anion Cl-. This is dangerous as it can destroy less electronegative atoms (which is most atoms). In table salt, chlorine is an anion, having claimed sodiums valence electron, oxydising it from Na to Na+. Chlorine is &quot;full&quot; now and does not long for other atoms electrons, hence its not dangerous like the radical is.. i apologize for gramatical errors as im not an english speaking native :)</p>		</li>

			<p>zeshakag1's post is spot on.  I just wanted to say that Chlorine does the opposite of throwing out electrons:  It steals them.  If you look at the periodic table you will see Chlorine falls in the column one to the left of the noble gases, it wants* desperately to fill it's electron orbitals and be stable, it doesn't care about the needs of other molecules it will rip them apart to get that damn electron.<br><br>The elements that give electrons the most readily are the alkaline medals (like sodium).  They have one extra electron (one electron sits in a lone shell outside the nice and stable 8 underneath) and want just as desperately to give it away as chlorine wants them.  The alkaline medals also don't care about other molecules and will shove that electron off and destroy other molecules the same as chlorine, but for the opposite reason.<br><br>The scientific terms for these reactions are reductive and oxidizing, chlorine is an oxidizer and sodium is a reducer.</p>		</li>

			<p>To my knowledge, the danger of excess ions is not in their chemical reactivity but in the osmotic effects of concentrated ions, effectively dehydrating the body. If you drink seawater (abt 3.5% NaCl) your interstitial fluid can't maintain its 0.9% ideal.</p>		</li>

			<p>Consuming large quantities of salt water is dangerous because cells do things like taking up water and removing waste partly through osmosis. That's a simplistic way of talking about it, but let's just say that a lot of vital cellular processes won't work if the <em>osmotic gradients</em> of different substances are scewed too much. So, if water soluble ions (i.e., something that raises the water's <em>osmolarity</em>) are compounded in our bodies we would die. Now, we can get rid of such ions through our urine, but only up to a certain osmolarity. The problem is that sea water has a higher salt content than the maximum concentration of salt we can make our urine have! So if you drink a glass of sea water, you will need more water than there was in the glass to dilute the salt from the glass if you want to get rid of it. It follows that drinking small amounts of sea water together with some quantities of regular water isn't dangerous, the danger comes from trying to alleviate thirst by drinking sea water. And this is a property of soluble ions and concentrations of them in general, not something unique to chlorine, I hope this answered your question.</p>		</li>

			<p>Do other types of ions change the voltage gradient in ion channels in a similar way that NA+/K+ is effected by drinking salt water? Hopefully that makes sense and I'm using terms correctly. Anatomy and Biology class was a long time again but I LOVE learning about this kind of thing. <br><br>Edit: I remember something about maintaining homeostasis between polarity inside and outside cells.

			<p>Yes. The electrochemical gradient depends both on the difference in electrical charges and the difference in concentrations. For example, in neurons, the inside of the cell is more negatively charged than the outside, about -70 millivolts. However, on the inside is mostly potassium, and the outside is mostly sodium. Both of these are positively charged cations, but when their respective ion channels open, Na^+ rushes in, bring the voltage closer to zero, and K^+ rushes out. K^+ is moving against the direction you'd expect because it's moving down its concentration gradient.<br><br>So both total charge and individual ion concentrations affect things. Does that make sense? Typing on my phone, hard to be coherent. </p>		</li>

			<p>it's a strong oxidizer. and a lot of body processes involve oxidation. <br>Strong oxidizers interfere with these processes by reacting with stuff you need. Similar to how carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin and prevents your blood from transporting oxygen properly.

			<p>Well, what are we corroding? Let's say we're trying to eat some sodium. Sodium is happier to give up its electron to become Na+ (and leave its metallic matrix) than hydrogen is giving up its electron to become H+ (and leave its H2 molecule). <br><br>So when the H+ meets the metal it gets its electron back, finds another H., becomes a molecule and bubbles off, and you get a Na+ ion in solution instead. Repeat this and you have a NaCl solution, some hydrogen gas, and the Cl-'s not done anything.<br><br>It's a bit different if, say, you're talking eating magnesium, because peeling the second electron off is actually quite costly, and what makes up for it here is that the Mg2+ captures some Cl- and makes tiny crystal matrices, which are very stable and the energy released when the ions form the stable configuration make up for the cost of ionising the magnesium twice. But the Cl- starts as Cl- in solution and stays as Cl-, it doesn't change.</p>		</li>

			<p>I may have misinterpreted your question. If so, please let me know and I'll try again.<br><br>Most organic molecules are pretty acid resistant, often what you're seeing is acid-catalysed hydrolysis of ester/amide bonds. These bonds are formed when the OH of an -OH group (usually part of an -COOH acid) and the H of an -OH or a -NH2 group decide to take off on a honeymoon, and the gaps remaining are joined together. <br><br>Wikipedia has a great diagram in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_catalysis" target="_blank">acid catalysis</a> article. For hydrolysis you'll be working from bottom to top. As you can see from the diagram, the amide/ester bond has a double bonded oxygen with a lot of electron density in the region (it's 'kinda negative'), which repels the other bonds. This attracts a H+ ion from solution, this pulls electrons away and creates a slightly positive area, which you can then stick the negative end of a water molecule on. A little dance of rearranging electrons, and you're good.</p>		</li>

			<p>When mixed with ammonia  (among other things) the chlorine breaks away from the oxygen but as a neutral atom that really wants another electron.  This free chlorine then combines with another free chlorine in a covalent bond to form chlorine gas (they each have 8 electrons now-2 are shared) This is highly toxic because the bond there is weak and if you inhale it, the weak bond in chlorine gas separates and wreaks havoc in your body as it steals electrons and binds to all sorts of stuff.</p>		</li>

			<p><em>Elemental</em> chlorine, in the form of chlorine gas (Cl2) is poisonous because of how reactive it is. Basically, each chlorine atom has 7 valence electrons, while it wants 8 to be stable (called an octet), which makes the atom very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity" target="_blank">electronegative</a>, i.e. it has a very strong tendency to remove an electron from another species. This is why adding chlorine gas to elemental sodium, releases so much energy as each chlorine atom pulls an electron from sodium to create an ionic crystal of Na^(+)Cl^(-) as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVonuBjCrNo" target="_blank">this video</a>. However once you generate Cl^(-), the ion is far less reactive than its elemental form (since you took its umph away in the process of creating the salt), which makes it physiologically safe (in low concentrations).</p>		</li>

			<p>You're correct. Fluorine is insanely reactive, but fluorine compounds can be very stable. Teflon for example is carbon and fluorine; and it's pretty stable, not interacting with much of anything. Which is why it's used for nonstick surfaces. </p>		</li>

			<p>Is it toxic or caustic? Is there a difference? I was under the impression that chlorine gas created hydrochloric acid upon contact with the water on your mucous membranes, where it acts as any strong acid would and just corrodes organic tissues. <br><br>It's not like lead, arsenic or potassium cyanide which enter your bloodstream and fuck things up. </p>		</li>

			<p>Non-expert answer: H2o2 breaks down proteins which is why it is an inferior anti-septic to alcohol, because it will break down healthy and infected flesh equally, but it doesn't have the sting of alcohol, and is really good at removing lots of infected tissue quickly.<br><br>That leads me to believe it is not caustic in a pH sense, but I also know if you take a shot of it like it's tequila you will up chuck VERY quickly.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes. Since sodium has 1 valence Electron, by donating it to the Chlorine to make Cl-, it's outermost layer becomes an octet and it becomes relatively stable.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sodium reacts violently with water to become sodium ions (handing off the excess electron). You could say the violent reactivity of sodium illustrates how thermodynamically favorable - &quot;stable&quot; - the sodium ion is.<br><br>To anthropomorphize a little much, sodium wants to become sodium ion so badly that it will &quot;blow up&quot; water. So once it's sodium ion, it's not going to want to change anything.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is the ELI5 version and I hope it's mostly correct:<br><br>An atom consists of a core (nucleus) with a positive charge based on the number of protons in it (Chlorine has 17), and a cloud of electrons surrounding it with negative charges.<br><br>A strong tendency is for atoms to have charges that balance out, with as many negative electrons in the cloud as positive protons in the core.<br><br>However, there is also another strong tendency, for atoms to prefer filled &quot;shells&quot; or &quot;layers&quot; of electrons. The clouds of electrons are like layers on layers, and in the innermost one there's room for 2, then a cloud with room for 8, then another cloud with room for 8. <br><br>Chlorine has 17 protons and an electron cloud of 2-8-7, i.e. missing  one in the outermost shell in its neutral charge state. But as mentioned it is also very favourable to have 8 in the outer shell. The result is that a chlorine atom will basically rip away electrons of surrounding materials to fill its shell with 2-8-8. This also gives it one more electron than proton, so it gets a net negative charge. It's written Cl^- to show that it's Chlorine with one extra electron, hence 1 negative charge. <br><br>Now, Na (Sodium) is kind of the opposite. It has 11 positive protons in the nucleus and 2-8-1 negative electrons in the shells. So it's happy with that, but it's also happy to give away that 1 outermost electron. <br><br>Now, there's various ways for atoms to bond to each other.<br><br>Chlorine gas is when two Cl atoms basically bond together to share an electron, so both of them get 2-8-8 with one shared. But Cl-Cl is also happy to split up, each of the atoms ripping off an electron of a third substance. <br><br>Chlorine as an electron grabber can also form a bond with an electron donator like sodium. In that case Cl simply grabs an electron - but they are still loosely bound together. However if you stick NaCl in water it decouples into Na+ and Cl- surrounded by water. <br><br>But in that state both the Na+ and the Cl- are happy with their electron shells, so they don't want to rip off or give away any more. <br><br>In short, chlorine gas is poisonous because it's two chlorine atoms both looking for an electron to rip off. Chlorine in table salt is harmless because it's already gotten that electron from sodium. <br><br>Now you can maybe understand this chart: <a href="http://images.tutorvista.com/contentimages/science/CBSEXScience/Ch520/images/img146.jpeg" target="_blank">http://images.tutorvista.com/contentimages/science/CBSEXScience/Ch520/images/img146.jpeg</a></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Moreover, in animals such as humans (but not in rodents), other cations, such as those of lithium (Li+), potassium (K+) or even ammonium (NH4+) will also evoke a &quot;salty&quot; taste, albeit one that is not quite as strong as that generated by Na+.<br><br>How do they know the rodents don't taste it as salty?</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't know exactly how they know, but you can do experiments where you train a rodent to behave a certain way if given a salty stimulus.  Say, go left.  So, after the rodent is fully trained, whenever given something salty, they will always go left (you use rewards to train typically.. so every time they went left, you gave them sugar-water or you kept the rodents thirsty all day and you reward them with a tiny drink of water if they went left).<br><br>So that's one way you can perform such experiments.  Or, you can study the chemistry/structure of their taste buds and infer what they may or may not be able to react to.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I love reddit. I don't know pharmacology well at all, but I'd bet some of the 25-I was excreted by your kidneys directly, and some of it was broken down by your liver into another organic chemical with iodine in it. This will get excreted by your kidney as well, because your kidney is really good at excreting acidic things. There is some slim chance that iodine from it is left in your body.... but you need iodine. your thyroid thanks you.<br><br>More importantly, if you don't want to damage your brain, don't do drugs.... <br>or, look at it this way..... <br>you won't need your brain anymore once your dead, so enjoy life while you have it.<br><br>also, tryptamines like psilocybin don't have any scary halides in them to inspire hypochondriasis.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because the ions in solution are separated and stabilized by the water molecules' dipoles. The elemental form, say, sodium metal, is dangerous because it reacts to form those ions so quickly and in such high proportions that the energy release can be explosive.

			<p>I'm skeptical of this answer. <br><br>The way I learned it, the bond between the Sodium ion, and chlorine ion never actually breaks, the whole process of ionization is just a rearranging of polar molecules in a solution around individual molecules of the ionic solute. I could be wrong because I never went that far in chemistry, but as far as I know it takes an ass load of energy to break ionic bonds like NaCl and mixing them in water doesn't do that. </p>		</li>

			<p>Water molecules are very polar. The &quot;hydration enthalpy&quot; released by the interaction of water molecules around the ions that broke off (Na+: 418 kJ / mol, Cl-: 338 kJ / mol) negates the energy required to break the ions from the NaCl crystal (lattice energy, 787 kJ / mol) as well as the energy needed to reorganise the water molecules.<br><br>418 + 338 - 787 = -31 kJ / mol.<br><br>That means this is only slightly endothermic (you need to input an energy of 31 kJ / mol of NaCl dissolving into water). 31 kJ / mol is a small value and easily obtained from thermal energy around.</p>		</li>
