<p>The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. That is because the human eye has receptors for those three colors. You can combine these colors of light to produce (nearly) any color of light that humans can see. </p>

<p>It depends on which exact red, green, and blue you pick-- but &quot;nearly any&quot; means &quot;half or less&quot; for the most commonl-used RGB frequencies, and &quot;about 75%&quot; for the very best wide-gamut RGB primaries possible.  No three-primary system can reproduce more than about 75% of the human visible gamut.</p>
<p>You'd need five or six primaries to get to &quot;nearly any.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
