			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot to tell you how to approximate the age of an injury to the nail matrix --</p>
<p>Fingernails grow \~1mm per month and are fully replaced every 6 months. So an injury that has grown halfway up the nail (\~3 mm) is about 3 months old.</p>
<p>Toenails grow \~0.5mm per month and are fully replaced every year, or half as fast as fingernails. This is why you need to cut your toenails much less frequently than your fingernails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a reddit post not too long ago where someone  damaged their finger nail and did a time-lapse month by month of the nail growing.</p>
<p>Edit: The one I saw was a repost, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/492hpy/an_injured_thumb_growing_out_over_5_months/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share" target="_blank">but this appears to be the original</a>. Supposedly it took them 5 months for the nail to fully grow out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These numbers don't add up. I clip my fingernails about once a week and I'm cutting off ~1mm every time. 1mm a month over 6 months is only 6mm (~half a centimeter) and most adult fingernails (Nintendo thumbs notwithstanding) are longer than 6mm... more like 15mm+.</p>
<p>Is there a chance you mixed up 1mm and 1/8&quot;? 1/8&quot; is about 3.2mm and sounds about right for 6 month regrowth and the sort of growth I see</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be that they reported the average, but each person is different. My nails grow incredibly quickly (and are fabulously beautifully long when I want them to be). I actually use my nails to judge my health, since if they're chipping too easily or are too soft and bend too easily I probably need more iron in my diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, everyone's raving on about how well you answered the question, only thing is you didn't. </p>
<p>While all of what you said is true you didn't answer why it looks differently and why it's in half moon shape.</p>
<p>The answer to that is that it isn't actually white and that it isn't dividing up the fingernail into two different areas, root and nail, but that the fingernail actually goes all the way up to the skin of the finger but the lunula lies beneath the nail and is quite thick, relatively speaking, so that it obscures the blood vessels underneath so when looked at through the nail it looks lighter, almost white, as compared to the rest of the nail.</p>
<p>As for the shape it's just following the shape of your fingertip very roughly and thus comes out in a half moon like shape but it doesn't have to. Although rare it can be rather straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem knowledgeable so I'd like to ask you another thing—why do I not have lunulae? My entire nail is coloured the exact same with no white half-moon at the root. Someone else in this thread mentioned that discoloration could mean poisoning/deficiency, is this related?</p></div>		</li>
