It's extremely difficult to hit between your toes and stuff like that, and the smaller it is, the more likely it is to leak or you poke thru the other side. I'm sure some people have and do, but I used to do it on my legs... basically anywhere where it's a reasonably big enough vein. Knew a chick who is dead now who had a forehead vein she would hit, but obviously when it gets to that point you don't care who sees it because everyone can tell what you are doing.</p>
<p>But the potential scarring and hiding it is such a minor deterrent for someone already willing to inject drugs, at that point you have so few fks left to give, you just wanna feel better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do people trying to hide their usage, not go into webbing of their toes? Or are their large enough veins there to get it into the circulatory system?</p>

<p>Addicts will inject all over. I saw a patient once who required a mastectomy (breast removal) because she was injecting into veins on her chest and created a serious infection.</p>
<p>That said, the veins on your feet are fine even for nurses/MDs to start IVs on in a hospital if they can't use your arms for some reason.</p></div>		</li>
