			<div class="markdown"><p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They are compounds formed from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. They are a very toxic set of compounds, many of which are highly carncinogenic.</p>
<p>The amount of PAHs you ingest from smoked, grilled, and charbroiled meats is pretty low, but it can create a slight cancer risk if you eat a lot of meats prepared in these ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eww. That’s no way to live. I’d rather die early than only eat boiled meat and veggies the rest of my life. Carcinogens are where the flavor is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not <em>highly</em> cancerous, but the cancer risk is there. If I recall correctly, I have a text book somewhere that says the cancer risk from smoking a single cigarette is about the same as eating about 100 charbroiled burgers. So most people are going to have a cancer risk from charbroiled, smoked, and grilled meats in a year that is well below the cancer risk someone gets from smoking a pack of cigarettes. Bear in mind that pack-a-day smokers often take decades to develop cancer.</p></div>		</li>
