			<div class="markdown"><p>The Phoenix neutron generators are being used by SHINE Medical Technologies to produce medical isotopes such as Mo-99.  Our DT neutron generators are producing 5e13 n/s which then drive a subcritical fission assembly.  That results in neutron multiplication and lots of fission reactions.  Those fission reactions are directly creating medical isotopes.  For example, about 6% of the time the uranium fissioning results in the creation of a Mo-99 atom.  SHINE has a nice summary of how this works at <a href="https://shinemed.com/demonstrated-technology/" target="_blank"><a href="https://shinemed.com/demonstrated-technology/" target="_blank">https://shinemed.com/demonstrated-technology/</a></a>.  </p>
<p>A key benefit of this approach is that you don't require a full nuclear reactor to produce reactor-grade medical isotopes.  This results in lower capital costs and reduced licensing time to get to market.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But you're still operating a nuclear reactor in order to achieve the necessary neutron multiplication. </p>
<p>Now instead of simply U238 -&gt; Neutrons -&gt; U235 -&gt; Mo99, you've added another step for DT -&gt; Neutrons -&gt; U238 -&gt; Neutrons -&gt; U235 -&gt; Mo99.</p>
<p>How does this cut costs? The electricity bill for the accelerators wont be cheap compared to just the coolant of the liquid moderator in traditional LWRs used to produce Mo99. Even then, you still have to cool off the entire reactor setup anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neutron generator is an extra component in the process, but since there is no actual reactor that still allows for removing a lot of equipment and a lot of regulatory overhead.  There is still fissile material (in the form of a uranium salt solution).  Given that the &quot;target uranium&quot; is liquid, there are also efficiencies in that the liquid can be quickly processed in hot cells (to harvest the Mo-99) and then recycled to run the next batch.  Conceptually, you can build a liquid core reactor (and it has been done), but the licensing basis - where you prove to NRC that it will be safe - is tougher and would take longer.  Part of SHINE's objective has been to get to market as quickly as possible, including time to build a facility and get a license to operate.    </p>
<p>BTW, SHINE's operating license application was just accepted by NRC (<a href="https://shinemed.com/nrc-begins-review-of-shine-ol-application/" target="_blank"><a href="https://shinemed.com/nrc-begins-review-of-shine-ol-application/" target="_blank">https://shinemed.com/nrc-begins-review-of-shine-ol-application/</a></a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The major expense for nuclear reactors is the initial capitol costs, not the ongoing operational costs.  Sticking to subcritical assemblies removes a significant amount of the licensing and design requirements, which lowers those capitol costs significantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me chime in here - another consideration is how reactors are paid for, in many cases largely via government subsidies, and how they are allowed to operate commercially under the law.</p>
<p>Research reactors like the one at Missouri, or UC-Davis, or NC State (amongst many others), and by definition meant to be used for &quot;research&quot; not commercial activities.  Because of this, they get all sorts of free stuff from the government, like free fuel, free fuel disposal, greatly reduced regulatory fees, etc.</p>
<p>In our view, highly subsidized reactors participating in commercial markets like isotope production has actually been a major inhibitor to private investment in technologies that could perhaps meet these needs better and more economically in the long run but that cannot get private investment because they'll have to compete with government-subsidized reactors.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is changing.  There have been several laws passed aimed at leveling the playing field for commercial entities, including the American Medical Isotope Production Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/99" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/99" target="_blank">https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/99</a></a>) and the Nuclear Energy Modernization Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/512" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/512" target="_blank">https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/512</a></a>).  The second law just passed this year (&quot;NEMA&quot;) actually makes it illegal for research reactors to make money via commercial activities, because it is contrary to their purpose.  We are already seeing a positive impact of this law in terms of the availability of private financing to support nuclear technology development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is certainly possible.  However, one of the challenges in general for industrial neutron users is getting reliable access to neutrons.  TRIGA and other research reactor types are perfect for performing experiments, but when you need a product to be produced all the time, this can be more of a challenge.  One of Phoenix's big objectives is to increase access to neutrons users in all fields.  The opening of our new Phoenix Neutron Imaging Center (PNIC) has been a big step in that direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are, and they do - most notably Missouri for the US.  However, most of the university reactors were not designed for isotope creation at the required scale, and they have other commitments.  They are also shutting down over time, generally without being replaced - universities are becoming less willing to deal with the safety overhead.</p></div>		</li>
