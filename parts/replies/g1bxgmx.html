			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most relevant answer. It's focus is on memory, and it highlights the fact that current CPUs aren't even using the full address space that a 64bit machine can offer. </p>
<p>Whenever this sort of question is brought up there are several posts that immediately jump to &quot;64bit allows larger numbers&quot; as if 32bit architecture can't already use 64bit types. They can, and they have for a very long time. What a 32bit machine <em>can't</em> do is natively address memory beyond 4GB, and some of that memory is going to be dedicated to the kernel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most 32-bit processors could address more than 32 bits worth of memory, it just required some extra tricks to do so. A CPU feature called PAE (Physical Address Extension) allowed the use of up to 36 bits of physical memory address space by OSes that supported it, making the memory limit 64GB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to fit a number into one segment. There's a performance hit, but it's incredibly rare* you need more than 64 bit precision. If for some reason you do, you can spread it over multiple sets of 32/64 bits for a performance overhead.</p>
<p>*Encryption is one area where you do need more than that. Chips tend to have special support built in for that to make it quicker, since your computer does a lot of encryption/decryption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Final Fantasy VII came out for the PlayStation, it didn't fit on a single disc. So they chunked the game into three pieces and put it on three discs. It creates a small hassle to have to deal with several discs just to play one game, but it's doable.</p>
<p>When you have a number that doesn't fit into a 32 bit register, you do the same thing. Chunk it up into pieces and put the pieces in multiple registers. It creates a small hassle to have to deal with several registers just to use one value, but it's doable.</p></div>		</li>
