			<div class="markdown"><p>You think that's crazy, check out cicadas. Populations come out every X years (1, 3, 7, 13, etc), always the same number of years for each population. When it's their year to hatch, they all come out and spend the summer being loud as fuck before laying the next generation (which will hatch in X years) and dying. </p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently other than annual cicadas, they're only either 13 or 17 years <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicadas" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicadas</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Any truth to this or can I call him a crazy old conspiracy theorist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's incorrect to apply the human concepts of awareness and / or fear of mortality to bees, a species which readily kills itself to defend its hive and only lives a few weeks to a few months. If they are more likely to sting during a certain season there's likely an evolutionary reason for it - perhaps they become more territorial to protect the honey stores they've built up, or something along those lines.</p>
<p>At least for the species I'm aware of anyway, a lot of the workers survive the winter (plenty still die - but there are a <em>lot</em> of bees). Massive piles of dead bees after winter is a very bad sign for beekeepers. This is of course assuming the hive survives - hive die offs aren't an uncommon occurrence if they starve or their hive is breached or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the late fall, new yellow jacket queens will depart the hive to find a place to overwinter.  She's the only one that will survive until next year and the remaining workers become increasingly aggressive to make sure next year's queen will survive.  If she dies or is underfed, the hive won't continue next year.</p>
<p>So it's sort of true, for that specific species.  When the new queen departs to find a warm place to winter, the surviving workers wil zealously defend her until the cold or starvation kills them.</p>
<p>Honey bees and bumble bees overwinter more complete hives and don't get so jumpy in the fall.</p></div>		</li>
