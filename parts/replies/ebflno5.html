			<div class="markdown"><p>I always find it funny when I drive in America. Signs are so freaking verbose. Up here in Canada, we have an arrow point right with a forbidden sign on it, a symbol of a red traffic light next to it and sometimes a time like &quot;7h - 22h&quot; under (<a href="https://i.imgur.com/FDG6iun.png" target="_blank">Example</a>).</p>
<p>In America the same sign is plain text that says &quot;NO TURN ON RED 7 AM TO 10 PM&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>@NY and testifies &quot;No turn during peak hours on weekdays&quot; signs. God. Damn. It.</p>
<p>7AM-11AM</p>
<p>4PM-7PM</p>
<p>NO TURN</p>
<p>[No Turn Symbol]</p>
<p>From Mondays Thru Fridays. (Tiny Text)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's like that for 3-4 intersections, so if you aren't familiar with the street, you'll just have to turn at the end after reading the sign one line at a time over 3 intersections, and checking your clock to make sure it's between 11AM-4PM. Worse is that the weekday clause is all the way at then end in tiny text, so you read all that for nothing on a sunday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usage note from the New Oxford American Dictionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is considerable overlap between the meaning and use of <strong>insure</strong> and <strong>ensure</strong>. In both US and British English, the primary meaning of <strong>insure</strong> is the commercial sense of providing financial compensation in the event of damage to property; <strong>ensure</strong> is not used at all in this sense. For the more general senses, <strong>ensure</strong> is more likely to be used, but <strong>insure</strong> and <strong>ensure</strong> are often interchangeable, particularly in US English: <em>bail is posted to <strong>insure</strong> that the defendant appears for trial | the system is run to <strong>ensure</strong> that a good quality of service is maintained.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A near-identical version of this usage note appears in its British counterpart as well, the Oxford Dictionary of English. I'm an editor myself, and while I don't personally use these words with any overlap, it's worth noting that many people do consider overlapping usage correct.</p></div>		</li>
