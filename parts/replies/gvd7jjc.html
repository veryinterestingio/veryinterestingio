			<div class="markdown"><p>No.... we're more like a bunch of balloons... like how they get statically charged and stick to things? Or buckyballs....</p>
<p>If we were balloon animals, we'd be a single balloons, tied in knots to create form and structure. The reality of it all is far more magical. Even just the way heart cells beat like a beehive synchronizes.. multicellular organisms are the shizniz</p>
<p>Edit: but beyond atoms there are cells, which is what we're talking about... from atoms to cells..... it's a big leap.. on an atoms level we're like balloons, but we're like balloons, made of balloons.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The balloons are mostly empty because the protons are really heavy and the electrons (which are buzzing around making the “skin”) are moving too fast to collide with the nucleus. But they REALLY want to collide! I always vaguely remember some comparison saying if a proton was the size of a basketball (or marble?idk), the electron would be in an orbit that could wrap around a baseball stadium. That electron is also 1800x smaller and equally as “magnetic”. </p>
<p>The electron and proton are equally strong <em>electric</em> monopoles. Electric charges act similarly to magnetic charges (we won’t go into specifics...), but you can think of a proton and electron as small, but VERY STRONG magnets! </p>
<p>Through a much stronger force (literally just the “strong force”), you can build up multiple protons in the middle of the atom even though protons want to fly apart. This also allows for more electrons to buzz around the outside “skin” of the atom. The number of protons actually classifies each atomic element. Each element has its own unique balloon. Even it’s own unique “buzz”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally we say the size of a nucleus is around 10^-15m while the size of an atom is around 10^-10m. Electrons don’t really have a size, they are about 1800 times less massive than a proton rather than smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Size with respect to mass rather than volume, I suppose. If we wanted to go on a tangent about densities, that could be useful as well. This could explain “size” in relation to mass and give examples like “a teaspoon of compacted nuclei material would weigh a billion(?) pounds!” Or something. </p>
<p>I think this is a fundamental difference that is not understood in general, that the interactions we are used to seeing at our macroscopic level dominated largely by gravity (or even macroscopic EM forces) are EXTREMELY weak. That the forces holding atoms together have truly unfathomable energy holding them together in a delicate balance and this is why matter can be stable, yet still 99% nothing.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Is this not something that just occurs when you place protons in proximity, with free electrons available (and maybe some energy? Or something that gives off energy? I guess what I'm asking is, do the electrons hold the atom together? If you had to start stripping away the electrons from a material what would happen? Would the material become an isotope? Apologies for limited knowledge but am genuinely curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, instabilities in the atom as a whole can be solved a number of ways. I’m definitely no chemist, so take this with a grain of salt...</p>
<p>Yes, I believe ionization is essentially the imbalance of charge between the nucleus and the electrons they “support”. This usually leads to easier chemical reactions, as it solves the imbalance through binding with another atom that can make it more stable. But this new binding, to ultimately reach some local stability, may take a little more outside energy to make happen. It’s kind of the basis for chemistry in my understanding. Atoms/molecules liking other atoms/molecules to achieve stability through reactions under different temperatures, pressures, light sources, It gets really complicated due to so many possibilities and the “strength” of each one, but it’s the reactions <em>between</em> atoms. </p>
<p>Now, if we are talking about instabilities within the <em>nucleus</em> of an individual atom, this is where nuclear physics comes in (and I’m a little more familiar with, tbh). </p>
<p>The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons that are “glued” together by the strong force. The strong force ONLY works when a proton or neutron are very, very close together. Otherwise two protons will be repelled away from each other  (as if you had two repelling magnets held very close together, then released. But if they almost touch they are “glued”). Neutrons are basically just filler to help “supply more strong force” while not holding a charge to make the whole nucleus want to fly apart. This balance of protons and “filler” neutrons is quite important too. Imbalances in this lead to radioactive decay in 3 main forms. </p>
<p>Alpha decay, where a helium nuclei (2 protons, 2 neutrons) is ejected from the main nuclei to make a smaller, more stable nuclei. This usually throws off some extra neutrons too, which provides the initial energy for the chain reactions used in nuclear power plants...</p>
<p>Beta decay, which itself has a couple forms and tons of intricate interactions, but is basically the switching of a proton to a neutron, and vice versa. Interestingly, this can sometimes create a positron (anti-electron/antimatter) that instantly gets destroyed with our regular matter and produces 2 pure energy gamma rays in opposite directions. Which is a great segue to...</p>
<p>Gamma decay, where again, it gets extremely complicated, but can kind of be reduced to “the nucleus fired off some pure energy for some reason”. Gamma rays are an extremely broad class of high frequency electromagnetic energy. Visible light is the same exact type of energy, just a much lower frequency. So infrared is low frequency and non-visible to our eyes, then visible reds up through to violet, then non-visible ultra-violet, and then waaaay higher up the spectrum is gamma rays. The frequency (how fast it oscillates) combined with the amplitude (how <em>far</em> it oscillates) will give you the total energy. Gamma rays are thus relatively always potentially destructive, regardless of amplitude.  </p>
<p>I’ve now realized I didn’t really answer your question... I believe there is quite a bit of structure that the electrons provide to the nucleus and if you severely disrupted that through ionization, you would make a more unstable atom as a whole which would cause the atom to further seek higher stability somehow. I believe this could prompt a beta decay where it creates an electron instead of a positron (as I previously mentioned). I would guess this is the case where a proton switches to a neutron, releasing its charge and flipping a quark(???). Anyways... it would be a case where the nucleus could create an electron to provide that outer structure for itself, but this would likely instantly lead to more instability in the nucleus once it received electrons again, which are very easy to steal through chemical reactions. So a very highly ionized atom never really exists since it can easily correct that imbalance through chemical reactions with its ever abundant neighbors. You can also have too many electrons giving structure and it kinda collapses in on itself and the neutron goes through “electron capture”, which is a form of beta decay. </p>
<p>I just have a bachelors degree in physics and this was 95% off the top of my head in a basic context, so again, take it all with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>
