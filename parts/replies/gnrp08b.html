<p>Right, because Russia's infrastructure is winterized.  Texas has been warned repeatedly since the 1990s that they needed to do the same, yet they didn't act.  Now they're reaping the consequences of that inaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a huge myth that Texas never experiences winter storms. That's a lie. The northern half of this state freezes on a regular basis. This weather itself wasn't really a shock to North Texas. It was certainly colder than a normal winter storm, but we experienced cold snaps similar to this before (10 days under freezing back in 2011). We've seen ice storms and snow (over 14 inches in 2011) a bunch of times over the past 10 years. We've even experienced rolling blackouts. The difference was this storm impacted ALL of Texas (even Northern Mexico) and the lack of winterization of gas/coal plants and the enormous demand from the whole state overwhelmed the grid, not just the Panhandle or North Texas. This event was foreseeable and preventable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the lack of low temp pipe spools and LT fitting and flanges have something to do with this? When my company built NG refineries in N Dakota LT was spec'd in as well as heat tracing. In our Baytown, TX plants I don't remember heat tracing being a requirement and LT fittings and flanges were only spec'd for specific areas of the train. Just wondering if design differences based on geography played a part in this.</p></div>		</li>
