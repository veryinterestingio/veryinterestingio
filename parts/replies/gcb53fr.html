<p>Iâ€™ve seen stuff about some animals being trained to sniff out patients who have Parkinsonâ€™s (and even covid i think I saw?). You think itâ€™s possible itâ€™s more than a cancer look?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, there was even a human woman who could sniff out Parkinson's.  As I remember it, they did a trial with her where she'd smell t-shirts that a few people with Parkinson's wore, mixed in with t-shirts worn by people without Parkinson's.  She picked out all the Parkinson's patients, but she also hit on one of the control group.  Turns out that person was in the very early stages of the disease, before there were noticeable symptoms.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-woman-can-smell-parkinson-s-and-could-be-the-key-to-an-early-detection-test" target="_blank">Here is an article about a Scottish woman who can smell Parkinson's</a>.  I'm not sure if this is the exact same woman I heard about, but at least we know there's one example of a human that can literally &quot;sniff out&quot; disease. :)</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to mention, the Scottish woman I linked to above claims to be able to smell cancer, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your hard work! My mom was a vet and so I was basically raised in her practices and in high school worked for her. It's a tough profession, from being abused by negligent owners or losing a beloved patient but I remember getting to help her deliver Afghan hound puppies (the smell of the after birth made me extremely averse to Burger King since it's what my dad brought us for dinner) and the truly wonder owners that just adored her. Lots of good memories. She passed several years ago from lung cancer but I always feel to privileged to have been raised by such a smart, caring, hard working lady. Veterinarians need more love, so thank you for all you do for a little and not so little ones!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for your story and your appreciation. You are very lucky indeed to have grown up in vet clinics working alongside your mother, I feel like it makes kids see the world differently (in a good way)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The abuse from pet owners can be just terrible... verbal abuse over prices, unwillingness to pay for diagnosis then anger that the vet being unable to identify the problem, the lack of needed follow-through on care at home that leads to an animal's condition getting worse...</p>
<p>My whole life I dreamed of being a vet, right until I spent two years working for one before college. </p>
<p>I saw people absolutely blow up at her when she told them their morbidly obese pets were overweight.</p>
<p>Clients who waited until their pets were in agony at death's door before bringing them in, and then balk at the price of euthanasia and instead opt to take their pet home to finish dying an awful death.</p>
<p>Doodles and other long haired breeds  with mats so bad the dog had maggot infested sores... brought in by well dressed people driving nice cars, who apparently just couldn't be bothered with grooming their dogs or taking them to the groomer.</p>
<p>SO MANY PEOPLE who waited way, way, way past when their old pet deserved a kind release before finally agreeing to euthanize. (For folks reading this thread - if you find yourself in the difficult position of trying to figure out when &quot;it's time,&quot; <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/1dEVa3QEHtphEr9D9" target="_blank">this scale</a> is really useful).</p>
<p>Vets come out of vet school with mountains of debt. They don't make much money at all, yet are constantly accused of price gouging.</p>
<p>It's not hard at all to see why it's a profession with one of the highest suicide rates. People choose to become vets because they love animals, but the people who own those animals can be so cruel (to their vets and their animals)</p>
<p>I'm glad I spent the time I did working there before making the choice to go to vet school. After the experience, I chose an unrelated field for my career and instead spend my free time doing animal stuff.</p>
<p>And damn it, I'm very kind to my vet, and never ever complain about prices or sometimes difficult diagnostic processes. Our pets can't talk, so sometimes that's just how it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg my previous boss always complained that dental cleaning was just another way for vets to make money. She even worked for an equine vet for several years and would rant about people who wouldn't float their horse's teeth. Then lo and behold, when she took her dog to the vet for horrible breath and multiple bladder infections, the poor thing had to get 10 teeth pulled because they were rotting in his jaw. Then me on the other hand, had a full on sobbing episode because my dog refused to eat and I thought it was her teeth. Turned out she was just being picky and the vet told me to stop giving in to her ðŸ˜‚</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Believe me, I love my vet!  I love my vet's office, too.  All the techs there know my dog and pet her when they see her.  And, everybody there knows to keep her with me in the exam room, rather than taking her to a procedure room is a good idea, if at all possible, because she gets scared when I'm not there.  Every vet and vet tech I've ever taken her to has been wonderful with her, and I appreciate that so much!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love it when vets know their patients so well! My big dog loves going to the vet and they love when I drop him off for the day for his check ups because they can just hang out with him haha My terrier is very shy so they do everything in the exam room with me and they are so good with her.  I'm very much a over protective pet parent and bring them in when there's even a hair out of place and my clinic is so accommodating and never make me feel bad for worrying. A good vet is worth everything!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. They say dogs can smell cancer, we're very visual brings, I wonder if human doctors have an intuitive sense for human cancers.</p></div>		</li>
