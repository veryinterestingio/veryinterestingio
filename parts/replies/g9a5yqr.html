<p>Even if you reject the author's larger theory, the opening section of the book where he dives deep into how complicated defining consciousness is and the examples that don't require it (like learning) is pretty fascinating.  Even though there's not great academic support for his theory, it has a compelling quality that is worth it merely as a philosophical discussion.</p></div>		</li>
