			<div class="markdown"><p>That happens with lots of exposure and repetition. Context from one or two uses can give you a good clue without a precise definition (sometimes they can give an almost exact definition in specific circumstances). We learn new words because we hear them in tons of different contexts that helps shape the definition from different angles and perspectives. Some words that Shakespeare came up with might be quite easy to ascertain from one use but certainly not all. I don’t know all the words Shakespeare invented, and I can’t imagine that they were all easy to define with one use, and I also don’t imagine he was using them so frequently in one play that it was obvious. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you haven't read A Clockwork Orange. It's almost in a new language. It takes a little while to get used to but you get used to it pretty quick. Here's the opening:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'What's it going to be then, eh?'</p>
<p>There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening, a flip dark chill winter bastard though dry. The Korova Milkbar was a milk-plus mesto, and you may, O my brothers, have forgotten what these mestos were like, things changing so skorry these days and everybody very quick to forget, newspapers not being read much neither. Well, what they sold there was milk plus something else. They had no licence for selling liquor, but there was no law yet against prodding some of the new veshches which they used to put into the old moloko, so you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches which would give you a nice quiet horrorshow fifteen minutes admiring Bog And All His Holy Angels And Saints in your left shoe with lights bursting all over your mozg. Or you could peet milk with knives in it, as we used to say, and this would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of dirty twenty-to-one, and that was what we were peeting this evening I'm starting off the story with.</p>
