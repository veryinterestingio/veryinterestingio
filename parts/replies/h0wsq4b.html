			<div class="markdown"><p>Few years ago was listening to a podcast series where some youngsters spent a few episodes reviewing Back to the Future movies. For some reason, they got fixated on how ridiculous it was that Marty could hook his 80s camcorder up to a 1950s TV and they kept on referencing it over several episodes.</p>
<p>Wanted to tell them that actually, it would have been trivial since in the 80s that's how we plugged things into TVs - like a virtual TV station signal - that would have had no problem &quot;transmitting&quot; to a 50s TV.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I could have done it with wire and chewing gum. May well have done that myself in trying to get something connected to an old TV when a cable broke</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The crazy part is how that 100% wouldn't be guaranteed now. I'm 32, so about the same time difference they traveled, and since I was a kid we've gone through coaxial, composite, component, s video, and hdmi. Sometimes also optical. </p>
<p>Granted, TVs still have coax, but the signal is digital now, so going back in time most contemporary devices wouldn't work...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every HDTV I've seen still supports analog tuning just as a legacy thing.</p>
<p>But if you're talking about a camcorder (first of all, if someone was doing the same thing today they'd just be using their cellphone, not a camcorder), then it probably wouldn't have any sort of tuner output on it at all.</p>
<p>Not everybody used all of those connectors, I went from using composite on a CRT to HDMI on an HDTV.  S-Video was technically something my dad's Sony Handycam supported but you didn't <em>need</em> to use it, same with component, I'm not aware of any devices that <em>only</em> output component and couldn't do composite as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, for bonus points (and causing us weird issues to this day), NTSC color TV is both forwards- and backwards-compatible with black and white TV.</p>
<p>So you can plug your color camcorder output into a black and white TV, and that would still work.  And vice versa; a black&amp;white signal could would be rendered just fine by a color TV.</p>
<p>That's part of why we have Y-Cr-Cb.  Y corresponds to black&amp;white, and if one side or the other doesn't understand color, those just don't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with the NTSC audio channel, we have a L+R channel that was jammed into the mono part of the spectrum as well as a L-R channel. If you have a mono TV, that only decodes the mono spectrum, you get both the left and right audio combined in the one speaker and you don't miss anything.</p>
<p>If you have a stereo TV, it decodes the L+R and L-R and using addition it gives you L [(L+R)+(L-R) = 2L] and using subtraction it gives you R. [(L+R)-(L-R) = 2R]</p>
<p>I really enjoy these ingenious things they did to preserve backwards compatibility at a time when technology was basically wires and glass and crossed fingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this backwards compatibility is why Timecode in the U.S. and other NTSC countries runs at 29.97 frames per second instead of 30 frames per second. </p>
<p>An engineering compromise in the 50's that is still a huge pain in the ass all these years later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used these extensively when young. You had an adapter: Plug your TV antenna and game console into it, and plug it into the TV. The console added its signal to the antenna's. There was a switch on the adapter to choose whether it added it on channels 3 or 4.</p>
<p>Edit: Long time ago, so thanks all for reminders. The channel switch was often on the console, and the adapter had the input switch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The NES had both an RF out with an auto switching adapter to switch between antenna/cable and the console.     The NES also had video/audio out jacks as well.   Very few televisions of that era had baseband video inputs.  As others have noted the only input was usually an antenna input connected to the tuner.   The RF adapter is really just a kludge to get the signal to your TV.  Internally The gaming device produced baseband video, then it went to an RF modulator to turn it into  channel 3 (or 4), then it went into your TV where you tuned to channel 3 (or 4) , finally the signal was then turned back into baseband video to be displayed on your tv.  In the 90s TVs eventually started shipping with discrete video input jacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was younger, consoles came with the adapter, and it was pretty simple. If anything, you needed a matching transformer adapter that would screw onto the TV.</p>
<p>When I got older, I bought an RF modulator. I think consoles eventually stopped coming with the adapters, so it became far simpler to use the modulator with an A/V switch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I got my N64 as a kid back in 2000, we still didn't have a TV with RCA inputs, so we had to get an RF modulator for it. Later, when I got my GameCube, we just hooked it up through the RCA ports on the front of our VCR. </p>
<p>It didn't occur to me or my parents at the time that the N64 used the same AV-out plug as the Gamecube, and could accommodate the same RF modulator.</p>
<p>I remember thinking it was awesome when we finally got a TV with a proper set of RCA inputs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't a beam of light, it is a beam of electrons. And they have to hit the red, green and/or blue spot to light it up correctly. So it needs to know what color to make <em>and</em> brightness.</p></div>		</li>
