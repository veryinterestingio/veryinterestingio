<p>When anything (in this case a virus) enters directly into your blood stream (usually through a break in the skin or an injection) you're almost guaranteed to get it.</p>

<p>Even still, the actual risk of HIV is relatively low even in unprotected receptive anal sex with an HIV+ person. </p>
<p>Receptive anal sex has a risk of 138 per 10,000 exposures. It's the highest risk factor for actions the person can make. </p>
<p>The risk for a blood transfusion is almost guaranteed, at 9,250 per 10,000 exposures. </p>
<p>Needle sharing is 63 per 10,000, needle stick is 23, Insertive anal sex is 11, receptive penile-vaginal is 8, and insertive penile-vaginal is 4. Oral, either receptive or insertive, is low risk. Biting, spitting, throwing bodily fluids, and sharing sex toys are all negligible risk. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good information. It is true that an HIV-infected transfusion is very likely to produce infection.</p>
<p>But I just wanted to clarify for the readers that the overall risk of getting HIV from any modern blood transfusion is less than one in several million due to modern screening and testing techniques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, modern blood transfusions are pretty much a negligible risk because of that. </p>
<p>The risk factors are specifically from an infected source though. So if you have a known infected source of blood, a transfusion from it would infect the recipient 9,250 times out of 10,000. It's a near certainty, but still not a guarantee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. In the US, male on male sexual contact alone accounts for 66% or new cases, and heterosexual contact accounts for 24%. </p>
<p>That's 90% that comes solely from sexual contact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually quite high though if you consider that it's not uncommon to have dozens of sexual partners in your life, and someone may have multiple encounters with the same infected individual. It's similar to how there may only be a 0.001% chance of drying when you choose to drive, but apply that to a whole population that drives every day and you get millions of deaths.</p>
<p>If you have a random unprotected hookup once, your chance of getting HIV is astronomically low. If you're doing it every weekend, your chance is very high.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait... So, if I understand correctly, there's 7.5% chance someone could be injected a significant volume of HIV infected blood and not get HIV ?  </p>
<p>Seriously, how do you kill this guy ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you are in a high risk group for catching HIV, talk to your healthcare provider about PrEP or Pre Exposure Prophlaxis, which can reduce the chance of catching HIV to effectively zero when used properly. The company that makes PrEP, Gilead Sciences, offers a rebate that brings the cost of the medication down to zero.</p></div>		</li>
