			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many wonderful bacterial shelters that even the way surgeons wash before operating won’t get them all. That’s a full 2 minutes of scrubbing with a brush and antibacterial soap. If they take their gloves off for whatever reason during the procedure, they scrub again because sweat from the hands will float deeper bacteria up to the surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yea, and under that layer is a layer of living cells.  i'm thinking those living cells along with the bacteria and dead cells and all being squeezed between your bones.  All feeling the same pressure.</p>
<p>The dead ones are probably better at not being crushed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had bacteria on a hammer and I slammed the hammer against 'flat' steel surface, would that kill bacteria? I'm assuming the impact and the energy (heat) generated from the impact would kill most? I understand that the hammer and steel surface may have a porous or rough surface at a microscopic level. </p></div>		</li>
