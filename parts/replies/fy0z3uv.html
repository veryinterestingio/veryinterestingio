			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real challenge of our time. How to you correct mistaken beliefs that aren't just a part of one's knowledge base, but are also a key part of one's identity?  To be frank, I don't have a great answer yet. Most of my research focuses on simply general knowledge facts that are not connected to people's key beliefs about themselves. For example, when I tell you that Canberra, not Sydney, is the capital of Australia, that doesn't threaten your identity (even if you were certain it was Sydney). However, if I tell you that there is no evidence that vaccines cause Autism, and you've started to describe and think of yourself as an anti-vaxxer, that will be much more difficult for you to believe. </p>
<p>One solution is to help prevent belief in misinformation before it becomes tied up in people's identities. A lot of recent research supports the idea of innoculation (e.g.  <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799</a></a> ) as a way of combating false beliefs. The idea is to innoculate people to false or misleading information by presenting them with a weakened version of the argument that is easy to refute. For example the Bad News Game,  <a href="https://www.getbadnews.com/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.getbadnews.com/" target="_blank">https://www.getbadnews.com/</a></a>, helps teach people how false information spreads on social media and what cues the should look out for by having the player act in the role of a bad actor who is trying to spread false information. In their words &quot;By letting you experience how fake news works we increase your resistance to it.&quot; Another good example is summarized by Stephan Lewandowsky &amp; John Hunter in a piece for The Conversation, <a href="https://theconversation.com/we-have-the-vaccine-for-climate-disinformation-lets-use-it-130008" target="_blank"><a href="https://theconversation.com/we-have-the-vaccine-for-climate-disinformation-lets-use-it-130008" target="_blank">https://theconversation.com/we-have-the-vaccine-for-climate-disinformation-lets-use-it-130008</a></a> . &quot; For example, research has shown that if people were told how the tobacco industry used fake experts to mislead the public about the health risks of smoking, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175799" target="_blank">they were less likely to be misled by similar strategies used to deny climate change</a>.&quot; Innoculation can be really powerful, but to be effective you have to be innoculated before you're exposed to the false information.</p>
<p>What about times when you've already seen the false information and already believe it?Here one of the key is to replace the false information and incorrect story with the true information. That is, it's not just enough to say X is false. You need to also present what is true. For example when dealing with the conspiracy theory linking 5G and COVID-19, it's not enough to simply say &quot;There is no link between 5G and COVID-19&quot;. Instead, you need to provide more information about how COVID-19 actually evolved and it's true origins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love the irony of the homeopathic remedy to disinformation. Although it is great that there is digital tools becoming available I assume they can be uncomfortable when challenging long held belief. Our real challenge is in changing the status quo to have the conversational tools to challenge and develop critical thinking. Poor engagement by both camps really only serves to self reinforce and develop stronger identity and ill informed ideas. Talking down to an anti-vax is easy to do and only serves to build up their defence. </p>
<p>Is there strategies being developed to skill up everyone or only to correct what we see as wrong?</p></div>		</li>

<p>With regard to this, something called the &quot;knowledge deficit model&quot; has been scientifically discredited, so I take this with a grain of salt. The target audience also will perceive this as you telling them what's true, whereas they &quot;want to think for themselves&quot;, a normally sensible attitude. But read: &quot;stay with ideas from their upbringing/in-group&quot;. On top, they employ the normally sensible heuristic &quot;beware those who tell you they possess the truth&quot;. The whole arena of facts is secondary to tribalism and group-think. Your opinion on this as a root problem more worthy of attention?</p></div>		</li>
