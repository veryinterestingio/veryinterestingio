			<div class="markdown"><p>These two paragraphs helped me understand why the normal force is a force. The way my underqualified physics teacher taught me it years ago was essentially &quot;it's not really a force, we just needed something to make Newton's equations work.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its worth noting that the normal force isn't a fundamental force, its just a fancy name we give other forces (mostly or entirely electromagnetic repulsion) that happen to counteract gravity.</p>
<p>Like, when you are sitting in your chair, that chair does exert a real force on you that balances against gravity. Its just that the source of this force is just the chair's atom repelling your atoms that have got too close because gravity is pushing them together</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, counteracting gravity has nothing to do with what the normal force actually <strong>is</strong> (since, as you pointed out, it comes from electromagnetic repulsion).  Rather, the normal force is often introduced to students via an example in which the normal force <strong>happens</strong> to be pointing in the direction opposite that of the gravitational force.</p>
<p>If I lean against a wall, there's a normal force pushing back (so I don't go through the wall), but we wouldn't say it's counteracting gravity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say here but it's almost certainly misguided. Normal force is indeed a mechanical force, and anything other than saying this (see the other guy who talked about his teacher claiming normal force isn't a true force) is wrong. </p>
<p>Perhaps you were trying to say it's not one of the fundamental force classifications in physics, but either way I'm fairly certain normal force is just one of the paired gravitational forces, and thus gravity.</p>
<p>Edit: I might be mistaken on second reading, but I think it's more important that people approach this skeptically frankly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck that noise. The normal force is just atomic Electromagnetic repulsion caused by atoms being pushed together until the forces equal out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's good to see people as worked up about his teaching as I became. I'm one of those learners where if you give me the fundamentals, I can generalize out from that; misunderstanding the fundamentals of <em>physics</em> then was a problem. And don't get me started on how he taught circuitry. It wasn't until more than fifteen years later and I wanted to mess with Arduino that I actually internalized the difference between current and voltage.</p>
<p>I will say, however, he was a first year teacher. I've talked to friends about their first year teaching, and unless they had a master's in a program that paired educator skills with subject matter expertise, they said it was like they'd never learned the subject themselves at all. This teacher had a physics degree, so it's not like he himself didn't understand the normal force...he'd just never had to communicate it to people for whom it wasn't intuitive. I looked him up online recently, and he's seemed to have settled into a respectable teaching career (he moved away from our city the year I graduated), so hopefully that's a sign he learned his lessons quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is partially correct. Your muscles are not perfect machines so there will be very small movements. Those small movements multiplied by the force is where the work is occurring. That said the above is correct in that your bulk body isn't moving when pushing against the wall so the energy eventually becomes heat.</p>
<p>Side note science project, take a hammer and pound on a thick nail/screw/bolt that doesn't give, then put your hand close to it (don't touch) to feel the heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small quibble. Most of the energy is potential energy in the form of chemical bonds and gradients. Most of the energy does not go to heat, but to relieving this potential energy and applying a force with out work. The &quot;mechanical&quot;  energy is applied, there just is no work done because its applied in opposite directions.</p></div>		</li>
