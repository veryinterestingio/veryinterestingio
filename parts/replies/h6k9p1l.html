			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll very likely have a catheter in your bladder after your OP.</p>
<p>You probably wont have to even think about needing &quot;Go&quot; as it's a direct line to a bag to collect your urine. You very likely will not need to do number 2s after surgery too. As general anaesthesia basically stops your digestive system until it's out of your system. Usually about a week. But some people vary on that.</p>
<p>When the catheter is pulled out you'll pee less for a day or 2 but after that everything should be normal. </p>
<p>Unless your surgery is on your plumbing of course. In which case. still don't worry. </p>
<p>Just do as your told and take your time healing.</p>
<p>Good luck to you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on your surgery, do you know for a fact you'll be getting a catheter? I've had 4 surgeries and I have never had a catheter. But my longest surgery was only about 90 minutes or so and have all been outpatient. One of the conditions of being released has always been the ability to pee though. When I had my tonsils removed as a teenager that took hours for me to be able to pee. The other times it didn't take nearly as long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After my second c-section I had the unable to urinate problem but didn't know it. I didn't get the urge for like a day after and I thought I just didn't need to go and there were other pressing matters going on. My bladder was overfilled and when I finally went I peed out like 600 ml of fluid. It hurt so bad to do it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also had this with my c-section -- it took almost 2 weeks to go away, but I also couldn't sense when my bladder was full. I had the same thing happen and after that, I took care to visit the restroom more often heh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to put myself on a pee schedule. Every 2 or 3 hours I went whether I felt I needed to or not. It took a few days for the sensations to come back. This was not an issue with my first csection. I was so swollen after my first that you couldn't see my knee caps. So I was given a water pill and then stayed in the bathroom for a day or two. Just a constant stream of pee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once couldn't stand up for three days because of sciatica, so I hold my pee for three days. Finally I asked for an empty bottle, and when I saw that 1'5 l bottle I asked for another one because it looked so small to me, in the end I urinated more than 2 litres :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's bad care and shouldn't have gone that way!</p>
<p>When I had my c section, as soon as I was able to move around again the first thing they did was remove my catheter, and give me a few hours to try to pee. I had to pee in a container that attached to the toilet seat so they could see that I did and that it was above a certain amount of ml. If I had not been able to produce X ml of urine within Y hours, they would have put a catheter back in to prevent what could be some very serious complications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they were monitoring output but just not well I guess. They had me on a saline drip the entire time I was there and I was suuuuuper hydrated. I had to put myself on a pee timer because it took a few days to get the urges back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, these two mechanisms bicker like an old married couple when you're putting off going.</p>
<p>Urge nags Control.  Control is pretty good at ignoring Urge for a good long while and can get Urge to shut up.</p>
<p>Urge escalates the situation, increasing the frequency and intensity of the nagging, but Control is still not whipped.</p>
<p>However, eventually Urge <strong>will</strong> dominate Control and have it throw it's hands up in exasperation, and Urge proceeds to do a little victory dance.</p></div>		</li>
