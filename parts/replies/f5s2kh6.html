			<div class="markdown"><p>They're likely referring the structure of atoms. </p>
<p>We typically think of our mass as the quantity that gives us &quot;substance&quot;. Atoms compress 99.9% of their mass into a tiny dot (the nucleus) in the center of the atom that is 1/10,000th the width of the total atom. When atoms line up in a tight row, the vast majority of the resulting structure is empty space. In this sense, it's much like a solar system, with nearly all the mass compressed into the center (the sun) with just a few free floating bits in a mostly empty void.</p></div>		</li>
