			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the kind of person that runs regularly is more likely to lead a healthy lifestyle overall. So it's not JUST the exercise, but it's more like it selects for a certain kind of person.</p>
<p>Beyond that though, drug use has side effects that basically destroy your organs... which is bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s my point, if you’re up all night binging drugs, you’re also likely to have poor diet and hydration, poor sleep and generally bad hygiene, which wears you out horribly, not to mention the side effects of whatever drugs you’re using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I took up exercising to increase my stamina on parties and to deal with side-effects / comedowns better. I generally lead a healthy lifestyle, and when I do take stimulants once in few weeks, I don’t suffer as much afterwards. (Not disregarding the damage they might be doing, just explaining my harm-reduction method)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m more referring to the likes of marijuana, THC can nearly double your heart rate due to the drop in blood pressure. Is this increase more stressful than exercising?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I got it, I just re-iterated what you said and added that side effects of those sorts of drugs are pretty devastating.</p></div>		</li>
