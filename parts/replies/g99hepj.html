He's a behavioral scientist who won the noble prize in economics and really championed some cool things about the human mind.  Alternatively just look for podcasts or interviews with him.  It'll blow your mind (no pun intended).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if some of the same mechanisms of consciousness are involved in this as in alcohol blackouts and anesthesia. Transference to long term memory seems to be a key thing. Which then brings up what kind of consciousness they people with impaired memory have. They're clearly aware, but is it like we are, like us in blackouts, or something different? How would we know and could it even be different for each individual?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you drink enough alcohol your brain is basically like ' either we pass out (which is dangerous) or we can stop creating new memories'. So if you ever wanna test if someone is truly back it just ask them the same question five to ten minutes apart and see if they notice. If they are blacked out they'll just keep answering you because their brain didn't file away the memory of that time you.asked the same thing moments ago. The brain is so fascinating lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remembering learning something about this in my intro psych class, though it’s definitely not the full explanation (somebody mentioned the neurological mechanisms at play, which is definitely a big part).</p>
<p>Basically, given whatever state of mind we’re in, memories that were created in that same state of mind are much easier to retrieve, and memories from opposing/altered states of mind are harder to retrieve. When we’re sad, it’s much easier to remember times we were sad, when we’re happy, it’s much easier to remember experiences from when we were happy. The same can be said for when we’re under the influence of substances. Because we’re operating in a drastically different state of mind, those memories aren’t as easily retrievable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's... I think called state memory. Emotions do that, and muscle memory does too. Location, which is why retracing your steps can help. That's not the same thing as blackouts and op's autopilot. Blacking out again won't retrieve those memories, nor will being drunk. What doesn't exist can't be found no matter what you try.</p></div>		</li>
