			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I know those graphics are vastly improved from the originals, but they look exactly the way I remember those games looking when they first come out. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if it is because of 20 years of faded memory, or if they really seemed that good back then because they were cutting edge at the time, but either way it's crazy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was going to say Nintendo seems to be making it work. </p>
<p>Important to look at 2 different things. </p>
<p>Nintendo seems to port games up relatively easily. No real changes to the game, just a port. I &quot;think&quot; it's just emulating the environment, just professionals making and testing it. </p>
<p>The games Nintendo do upgrade to HD/3D seem to be fan favourites and yes they make a lot of quality of life changes and sometimes new content. Note that both the 3ds Zelda upgrades were outsourced and apprantly was just an emulator with different textures. </p>
<p>EDIT: in fact i think Wind Waker was basically the exact same engine but with better textures and such. There are some moments in the game it can slow way down and speed runners can crash during certain stages because of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are differences in how Nintendo does things</p>
<p>For one Nintendo's games are usually first party. This makes the job of porting so much easier, because both the console creator and the game developer is in one team. To understand how important console creator is in making a game, Bethesda had to call in SONY's emergency engineers to deal with Dragonborn on PS3, and they STILL couldn't make it work we enough</p>
<p>Okay, so what about first party games that SONY has? Well unlike Nintendo, neither SONY nor Microsoft had any reason to remaster. They had a lot of developers working for them churning out quality, console-selling games. Meanwhile Nintendo had to milk their first party franchise for whatever it's worth. Thus remasters like for Nintendo 64</p>
<p>Sure, but what about millions worth of games like Final Fantasy? Well here's the problem: back then nobody knew that consoles will be replaced so quickly and digital distribution will be a thing. SONY PlayStation lasted about 10 years (including its numbered days after PlayStation 2 came out). For the most part, after you're done with a game, there's no way to patch it unless you're re-releasing it. Therefore, game data usually goes to trash bin once you're done with it for a year or two, and I mean really, really done: no other regions to release, no localization planned, done.</p>
<p>Remasters generally only have 1 target market: old gamers who bought the original and still see them through rose-tinted glasses. Final Fantasy VII was my first Final Fantasy and holds a special place to me, but to kids these days who grow up with twitch shooters and 3D worlds to explore, that game is heinously outdated. The graphics don't hold up, the animation is incredibly so-so, the textures bland, and the story seriously slow-paced</p>
<p>With that small market, the cost of marketing a game is just too much to handle. Digital distribution got rid of that</p>
<p>Even for Nintendo, actual remaster is rare. Most games simply use the same characters</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say that like neither Sony nor Microsoft has remastered plenty of their IP's.</p>
<p>From Microsoft; Halo 1, twice, Halo Master Chief Collection which includes all Halo titles from XBOX and XBOX 360. Phantom Dust (2017), Gears of War 1. (Also soon to be the entire Gears trilogy) (Not a full list)</p>
<p>From Sony; Crash Bandicoot Remastered is coming out. They remastered The Last of Us. All God of War games (And then God of War 3 specifically from PS3 to PS4). The Uncharted Games. Gravity Rush. Jak and Daxter Trilogy. (Not a full list)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do know they are making NeoGeo games for the switch right? </p>
<p>The &quot;mainly port there own games&quot; is extremely misleading. You don't need to remake the whole game to emulate it. </p>
<p>Again, Zelda code was outsourced and Nintendo didn't exactly help. Hence the weird bugs. </p>
<p>This is why I split up into 2 categories. Games like Wind Waker HD barely touched the general game code behind it. While games like Pokemon Gen 1 were completely remade. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nintendo is very weird. They're also very Japanese, which may be the essence of it. I was never a fanboy so I don't really understand them, though I do appreciate them. They seem to have cultivated a culture in their unique market that tolerate, let alone desire constant remakes.</p></div>		</li>
