			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good answer, but hedge funds aren't limited to publicly traded investments. THey are setup however the managers want them to be. If the managers are good at trading silver or oil, they setup a fund to do just that. They are generally unregulated as the investors are accredited and they are private funds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! I work in private equity and these companies are mostly set up as limited partnership funds and they will invest in each other which is called fund of fund investing. There are many strategies for PE investments. You were talking about corporate finance/buyout. There’s also real estate, growth equity, secondaries, plus a lot more.</p>
<p>Some of these funds are actually pretty shady. Roark capital is a notorious one. John Oliver does a great piece on Roark capital because they are buying up trailer park land where tenants own their trailers but pay lot fees. Roark then begins raising rent so that no one can pay. They’re allowed to love they’re trailers but can’t because it’s a lot of money and those trailers aren’t made to be moved after they settle for 20+ years. This forces tenants to walk away from their trailer home. Roark then sells the trailer to the next person and will eventually raise rates again when people are locked into living at the trailer. They have also been involved in buying up sonic restaurants in states where you can pay less than minimum wage to servers based on tips they make. They’re trying to force the workers into accepting extremely low pay to work..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, most PEs do not do FoF investing. You're thinking of LP investors who can be PEs, Pension funds, or even banks.</p>
<p>PE funds can be set up to do real assets as you mentioned, or engage in VC, Growth or Buyout strategies.</p>
<p>PE secondaries mostly serve a liquidity function as do placement agents. </p>
<p>I've been in the industry a while and Private Debt is the fastest growing segment (lending to PE portcos and unsponsored SMEs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.  I would just change purchasing companies with investing in companies.
VC vs PE was spot on, but both can buy a whole company, as well as buy a small stake and everything in between.</p></div>		</li>
