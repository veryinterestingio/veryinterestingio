			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean specifically of videos, or more generally?</p>
<p>For videos: have more static scenes / static parts of the scene.</p>
<p>In general: really depends on the file type. A lot of software-specific file types e.g. .docx and .xlsx are actually ZIP files with a collection of XML files that the applications know how to read (you can change an Excel file's extension to &quot;.zip&quot;, then unzip it and see the contained files). So compressing them will be a different task compared to compressing a plain TXT file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Largely for videos since I have more of those than I would probably ever watch but I also refuse to give the files up, so they just kind of start stacking up. But general files as well since sometimes to last few KB can make a difference on my laptop. </p>
<p>I also just finished my bachelors so I want to compress everything that Iâ€™m probably not going to use for a long time including the recordings of my classes that switched to zoom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to lossy video compression, most software will let you pick a bit rate. It will look worse and worse the more you compress.</p>
<p>And wether to compress together or separate depends on how different, size and overhead for the compression technique.</p>
<p>Like if you had a gigabyte of English and Japanese legal documents, you'd likely get better result splitting by language. But a sentence of each and probably not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For videos specifically the compression all happens in the file container, and that's limited by software/hardware playback since whichever video player you use has to read the instructions in real time so that it doesn't buffer or stagger or skip as you watch it - so any compression you do outside of it like putting it in a zip folder - would need to be undone before you watched it</p>
<p>There's only so much compressing you can do before it becomes lossy though, as once you compress it too far you can't get the original quality back, so this limits how small the file can be. If you wanted to reduce it below and accept some loss then for videos it's probably best that you play with the compression settings in the video editor yourself so you can see what is acceptable as far as quality - if you wanted to reduce the size of your collection and you were ok with saving them in (the equivalent of) 480p instead of 1080p and then zipping them that would take up less space but they'd never be 1080p quality again</p></div>		</li>
