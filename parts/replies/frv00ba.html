			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to say yes, of course. But the fact is that we place high hopes on the Large Hadron Collider finding results suggested by string theory such as supersymmetric particles, or missing energy signatures, or even micro black holes. These hopes have not been realized. They were all long shots. And we all knew that. But still, would have been wonderful for these hopes to be realized.</p></div>		</li>
