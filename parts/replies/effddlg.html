<p>What nominal depth does it get to? preferably assuming OP's conditions, or range across US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Minnesotan, I kind of wonder how good that frost line concept really is when it gets this cold.  In Minneapolis, my kitchen tap at full flow I measured 40.2 F this morning.</p>
<p>I kind of wonder how well the water distribution system would hold up to 7+ days of -20 F weather.  My guess is the mains in the street are both deep enough and see enough flow to resist freezing, but I'd kind of worry about the supply lines to individual houses.</p>
<p>I can definitely see where limited flow (daytime at work, no use overnight), relatively small pipe diameter, a loose definition of &quot;nominal 42 inch depth&quot; at construction and sustained sub-zero temperatures freezing individual house water pipes.</p>
<p>I also wonder about fire hydrants -- aren't they pressurized with water to begin with?  Or are they designed thick enough to sustain the water inside they hydrant freezing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of my job involves analyzing existing foundations. If the geotech report we have for a site doesn't give us a neglect depth (how much of the soil we should neglect because it's functionally useless), we neglect to the frost line because we know that <em>that</em> depth at least is functionally useless within the weather parameters we design/analyze for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I live in Casa Grande, which is usually a few degrees colder than the valley in the winter, and I've got livestock watering lines that are only two inches under ground in spots.  They've never even come close to freezing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ground density can be a factor, with solid bedrock conducting heat (or in this case cold) better than sand for example. While there’s a way to calculate it using geographic position and weather history, it’s mostly based on an unofficial standard depending where you are. It can even be different across small distance. In Montréal, we use 1.8 m as guideline, while Laval (city right across the river) it’s 2.0 m. Further north (30 mins drive north), it’s 2.3 m, etc. </p>
<p>Under that line, for water main, insulation can be installed to prevent pipes from freezing. </p></div>		</li>
