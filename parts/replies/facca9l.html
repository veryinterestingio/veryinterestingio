			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading that article, one thing stuck out to me: &quot;Poor hydrogen bonding&quot;.</p>
<p>The physical behavior of ambient temperature water is almost completely determined by the very intense hydrogen bonding intermolecular forces that water molecules experience. While OH bonds are indeed polar, it is the H-bonding that allows water to even be liquid. (For comparison, see ammonia [NH3] and hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. Ammonia has less H-Bonding, as there is only one lone pair of electrons to interact with acidic hydrogens, while H2S has similar chemistry to water [same column, 1 period down], but does not experience H-bonding. Both of these are gaseous at ambient conditions.) </p>
<p>Per the article scapo9688 listed, it is the suppression of this hydrogen bonding that occurs under elevated temperature and pressure that reduces the vast majority of the polar effects of water.</p>
<p>The article further lists formation &quot;liquid-like hydrogen-bonded clusters dispersed within a gas-like phase&quot;, which would behave as a sort of supermolecule that is non-polar in bulk despite being composed of polar molecules.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Continued to read that source, and I think the fact that supercritical water undergoes much more rapid dissociation partially gives you an idea. There's not going to be a really simple answer for something like this, I expect. It makes sense to me though. If water keeps rapidly trading protons and can barely hydrogen bond, why would we expect it to behave that a solution of polar molecules?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that makes sense about the weakening of hydrogen bonds. But doesn't that just kick the question down the line: why does the hydrogen bonding weaken?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it has something to do with geometry.</p>
<p>&quot;No fully-tetrahedral states were found in supercritical water.&quot;</p>
<p>If the lone pairs are no longer asymmetrical (on average) then the dipole moment of water would be greatly reduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tetrahedral in the context of water refers to a water molecule donating two hydrogen bonds and accepting two hydrogen bonds from a total of four other water molecules. As you heat water up, fewer and fewer water molecules have four hydrogen bonds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does supercritical mean high-pressure, high-temperature? Can you ELI5?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically water is bent at an angle (the H--O--H angle) which is the reason it's so highly polar. This just means it has an uneven charge distribution and can interact with other things that are polar. </p>
<p>When you say water is 'nonpolar' in its supercritical state, what you really mean to say is that it has strong interactions with nonpolar molecules (like a nonpolar molecule would), but this doesn't mean water has changed in its bond angle or anything like that - still has a bent structure and is still water. The reason for this is because in a supercritical state, water cannot hydrogen bond with itself to create a wide network of polar interactions - instead, it's rather great at dissolving nonpolar molecules in this state (just remember that LIKE-dissolves-LIKE when we talk about polar and nonpolar molecules)</p></div>		</li>
