			<div class="markdown"><p>The giant isopod is a great example of deep sea gigantism, but I donâ€™t think it has anything to do with the concentrations of oxygen. There are many examples of deep sea gigantism such as the giant tube worm and giant squid and as you mentioned the giant isopod, but the possible theories for deep sea gigantism now include the low temperature, food scarcity, and lack of predatory pressure rather than oxygen concentrations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course their size wouldn't be on par with that of some kinds of insects during the Carboniferous period. They're different species. Insects during the Carboniferous period evolved to be massive in response to high levels of oxygen over very long periods of time, they weren't just normal-sized insects that kept on growing. The fact that today's insects can grow slightly larger in highly oxygenated conditions is a good indicator that given hundreds or thousands of generations they might evolve to be significantly bigger (if there's selective pressure for it), but it's not going to happen within a single generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you took an animal that naturally grows large and put them in a low-oxygen environment, would you expect them to have stunted growth? And if it mated and had children, and you put those kids in a high oxygen environment, what would be expected to happen? Would the offspring have instantly lost the ability to grow large, or would it take hundreds of thousands of years for the selective pressures to result in a permanent change?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if we purposely selectively breed (or genetically modify) an insect let's say dragonflies to be as big as posible with our current oxygen levels, what will be the defining factor on it's max size? still oxygen, or there will be other environmental factors that will kick in before that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine one big consideration would be body temperature regulation. There would be a maximum surface area:volume ratio, such that the insect's body was so big, that the middle of it's body would overheat because heat couldn't be expelled quickly enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that would be a limit. After all, there are massive muscular fish living in tropical freshwater that can reach 90, even 100 degrees F. A massive cold blooded invertebrate would just have to rest more in hot conditions, or live in cooler regions.</p></div>		</li>
