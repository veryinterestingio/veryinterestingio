			<div class="markdown"><p>The patients: </p>
<p>most are okay. There is a trend of entitlement and noncompliance with many of our patients. It turns into a cycle where they exhaust the health care system; there's no improvement of condition, each time they are admitted, it becomes more and more denial by them (or their families) of the seriousness of the situation.  </p>
<p>Many also either fear death, or don't want to die. There are some people who are guilted into staying alive to keep their pension or disability check coming in for their family.  They would (or their family would) rather them live laying in a bed or on the couch, not having a significant quality of life (no sunshine, no exercise, no hobbies, no outdoors, no interaction with other humans-only the TV which they insist on leaving on all day and night to keep them company) to collect the extra income. This extra income isn't necessarily for greed, sometimes it's a necessity.</p>
<p>You can tell these people because they have pressure injuries (bedsores), foot drop, no muscle strength, yeast infections in their skin folds, matted hair. The family members have very poor health literacy, a very poor understanding of how to care for the patient at home. As a bedside nurse, you can do everything possible to educate the patient and the family about hygiene and medications, but it has to be followed at home. Sometimes the responsibility of getting medications refilled is not something these people can handle. Other times, the medications cost too much out of pocket. Social services is involved for neglect cases, but the public social services system is overworked and barely able to keep up. Home health nurses and aides try their best to help, but there are families that set up home health care and then don't answer the door during their scheduled appointment, or cancel the appointments.</p>
<p>The administration/health care system: </p>
<p>that's what makes it hard to go to work. The staff is pushed to limits of safe staffing. You don't have a consistent level of quality in caregivers. I work with people (administrators/leadership, managers, staff educators, bedside nurses, case managers, physical/occupational/speech therapy, phlebotomists, transporters, respiratory therapists, nursing assistants) who are there to do their job, and nothing more. They fly under the radar and keep the patients safe, they chart what they're supposed to, but no sitting down to teach the patient about how to make things more efficient at home, how to take their medications, etc.  I also work with people who go above and beyond, they see the big picture, they plan for the next three steps and beyond.</p>
<p>It's hard work. Lifting, pulling, pushing, standing for long periods at a time on concrete/hard surfaces, loud noises from alarms and the squawking of the communication system/walkie talkie that you have to keep in your ear to communicate with your team members, emotional drain from families and patients that don't know how to say goodbye.</p>
<p>I need the time off to keep myself healthy, mentally and physically. Why do I go back? Because when you have <em>that one patient</em> experience that makes all the difference, the inner joy fuels your hope that it will happen again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So her chemo drugs with an already on-its-way-to-shot liver gave up processing ammonia.</p>
<p>She was lucky to survive.   Blames the doctors and nurses for trying to kill her.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my mother is a nurse and has begged management to give her longer shifts so she can work less days there a week. I don't know what it is, but a lot of people in the medical profession like to work long hours for a few days. Unfortunately hasn't gone anywhere for her yet.</p></div>		</li>
