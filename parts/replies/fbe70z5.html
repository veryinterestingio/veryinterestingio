			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda if I’m understanding your thinking correctly. The freezing point is depressed with salts due to ion-dipole interactions. As lithium is in the same group but a smaller ion it’s charge density is much greater and can constrain water. In other words it is less likely for the water to be in-solvated rather than interact with the ion as it is more favorable potential energy wise to interact.</p>
<p>Now I know that sounds like entropy is decreasing but if we consider the initial phases of solid ice and solid salt -&gt; liquid water and salt in solution the entropy should increase. </p>
<p>I would say the entropy and potential energy drops are driving the depression partly due to the size of ion. Even though bromide is a bigger ion the chloride</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt (or any other thing) also increases the boiling temperature of the solution. When boiling water, add salt or sugar and you will see that the boiling stops until the higher temperature is reached</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst theoretically true, the amount of salt you would need to add to make a difference is more than anyone would use for cooking. If you're adding salt to your water to cook pasta or spuds.etc - you're doing it to impart some extra flavour to the food item, not to increase the boiling temperature </p>
<p>From an ABC article on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So yes, salt increases the boiling temperature, but not by very much. If you add 20 grams of salt to five litres of water, instead of boiling at 100° C, it’ll boil at 100.04° C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: If my math is correct, you need to add about 2.5kg of salt to 5L of water to increase the boiling temperature to 105C</p>
<p>Edit2: What you're describing is probably just the result of adding in some 'room temperature' mass to a solution that is already at (or around) 100C. The solution drops in temperature since you've dropped something substantially colder into it, then it standardizes and comes back to boiling point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my understanding the biggest factor with salt stopping the boiling is the fact that salt dissolving in water is a endothermic reaction, so it's taking energy to dissolve in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he’s describing also doesn’t happen. If you add salt or sugar to boiling water you see a very rapid increase in boiling as you introduce nucleation sites into the water for bubbles to form on. By the time those bubbles normalize you’re back at a boil again.</p></div>		</li>
