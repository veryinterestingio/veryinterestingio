			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other end of this, itâ€™s actually possible to have such a strong emotional response to something that you cause such a physiological response (via the pathways laid out by other commenters, with adrenaline and other hormones, as well as your neurological pathways) to snap the tiny tendons that control your heart valves.   These tendons hold your heart valves open between each beat, and without them your heart cannot function.   </p>
<p>So it is possible - although vanishingly rare - to literally die of a broken heart.</p></div>		</li>
