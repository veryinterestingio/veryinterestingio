			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as someone else pointed out, kids have no reservations about joining in conversations, babbling, mimicking others and making mistakes while unconsciously learning.</p>
<p>Adults (even teenagers) can become self-conscious, and learn to avoid/resist things and other people, unfortunately. This is my greatest barrier to becoming better at Japanese - I'm not keen to join real-life classes where I have to talk to others, even though that's my best shot at immersion and proficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You really get the book thrown at you in terms of the sheer amount of vocab you need to understand and use as an adult.</p>
<p>I think a pretty common phenomenon for some kids who grew up speaking a different language at home is the bizarre subset of the language you actually know. I grew up speaking Vietnamese at home with my parents and can speak it pretty fluently with them - rarely been at a loss for words on something when talking conversationally. But I can't keep up or understand what's going on if I try to watch the news or read an article or even participate in a subreddit or something in Vietnamese because there's all of this vocab about politics or economics or cultural things that I just have literally never heard or said before. So I can talk all day about family and cooking and whatnot without hesitation or ease - but even meeting a Vietnamese kid in college I was like, I don't know half of what you're saying because I don't talk to my parents about bars and clubs and the words for pre-gaming or hook-ups or cover charges. And to that guy's side, he kept saying I talk super formally or like an old person, because also there's a dynamic of the fact that my parents and everyone else that know who they speak with in Vietnamese regularly left Vietnam in the 60s / 70s basically - and with it, they are still speaking the way people did in the 70s.</p></div>		</li>

Most of the first-generation immigrants still speak very little English because they've been able to get my within their community. There are plenty of small businesses in the local area run by fellow Russian speakers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the next generation are pretty much all bilingual and serve as unofficial translators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a great friend in the 90's that was Cuban. His parents had been in the US for 30 years and didn't speak any English because they didn't need to in Miami. My friend spoke English with no accent at all. I actually asked him after we met if he spoke Spanish because he didn't sound like he did. I do agree that the need and/or a strong desire are necessary to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my kids when I moved to Germany - and alone during the week with two little ones, I couldn’t take a course and didn’t have the energy to learn on my own, so for the most part I learned as they did, from mimicking neighbors, teachers, other kids etc. </p>
<p>It was a cool experiment but it really did only get me so far.  Luckily I was ready to learn more just as they were learning grammar in school. </p>
<p>What was missing was how to speak contextually depending on the audience. A lot of nuances were missing, and some of them were HUGE (ie knowing when to you informal “you” vs formal “you).  Also, it turned out that my neighbors were speaking a lower level of language ans were often themselves grammatically incorrect. </p>
<p>When I first took my first german course 15 years later, my teacher was in awe at how I spoke. Very fluid but totally incorrect grammar, lots of colloquialisms that made me sound impressive to other learners, but completely wrong.  It was actually pretty funny - my teacher said “I can tell you learned german immersively”.  In reality, it’s actually a pretty academic language that when spoken properly sets a person yards apart from those who speak it improperly, even locals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In German there are three forms of the language: </p>
<p>High German (Hochdeutsch)
Colloquial (umgang)
Dialect </p>
<p>A letter from the school will be written in completely different German than you will ever see on tv or heard even in “correct” German. In colloquial shortcuts can be made and will be accepted, but if you used it in some
select places or contexts, people would look down on you.  Similarly if you used high professional German at a party where everyone drunk, they would think you’re a knob. </p>
<p>And some things aren’t grammatically wrong, but contextually. People from my area rarely use the Formal form of “you”, which causes some Butthurt when an older person from the north interacts with them.
There’s similar things in English but the lines are drawn so strictly which such extreme differences between the two. </p>
<p>And dialect - yes - the grammar is often wrong or none existent and people from different areas can’t understand each other. A guy from my village went to Berlin and said the taxi driver automatically switched to English because he couldn’t understand that he was actually speaking German.  He thought he was from the Netherlands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few examples but I can’t even translate them because I’m not even sure what they mean, I only know when to say it.  And I’m also not sure what is a typical German colloquialism, compared to actual dialect.  Or what bad german is compared to incorrect German compared to “something a foreigner speaker normally doesn’t say”. </p>
<p>One of them is “sage mol” which when translated properly means “say once” which is sort of like saying “say” as in “say, what is the weather forecast anyways?” </p>
<p>Another one off the top of my head is using dative instead of genitive, so instead of saying “the brother of Werner” I’ll say “Werner, his brother” (Werner’s seenie Bruder)</p>
<p>Or “ich habe kein Bock” which loosely translates to “I can’t be arsed”.  They don’t teach you that in German class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Netherlands (and Germany) a famous example of this is Rudi Carrell. He was a Dutch TV entertainer who started to work for German television and became a huge success. Unfortunately, his German was terrible even though he spoke it fluently. It was a big gimmick for him and the Germans loved it that he was trying and failing at the same time.</p>
<p>It also applies for many others. Being fluent in a language and speaking without hesitation, even if it  is grammatically incorrect, will get you much farther than painstakingly trying to get the exact correct sentence.</p>
<p>I remember going on holiday as a kid with the family to Italy and not speaking a word of Italian. After 2 days, my parents send me to do the grocery shopping, cause I already picked up enough Italian to go to supermarkets, while they were still learning from a travelers book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I met a guy in his 20's in the US that had grown up in South America, his father was an ambassador. He was fluent in terms of knowledge, but his accent was hilariously bad. Even as someone that had learned Spanish in school for 4 years it bothered me.  It always amazed me that he could know all of the vocab and be immersed as a child and still sound that bad. Maybe some people can't hear the differences in intonation. I am working to become fluent in Spanish and correct mispronunciations. It does take effort and attention to detail.</p></div>		</li>
