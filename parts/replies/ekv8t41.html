			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you missed another very important factor, though it's related to the others.  But it's probably the biggest one when it comes to the US.  And that is, do you need other currencies to get the stuff your country needs to run?</p>
<p>For the US, the dollar being an international reserve currency is a huge deal.  Along with high investor confidence, this generally means you can buy anything you want in the world with US dollars.  So Americans, and the US government, are never forced to exchange dollars for some other currency in order to import stuff we really need.  Be it wheat or oil or medicine or cars or whatever it is we want from some other place, they'll let us pay US dollars for it.</p>
<p>Having the dollar as an international reserve currency has another very special advantage: when the Federal Reserve brings the dollar up or down (through interest rates or quantitative easing or any other method), they're adjusting interest rates and currency values for the entire world to some extent.  Which means that the US government can effectively borrow in part on the credit of the entire world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't explain specifically the difference between Greece and Japan, but it's very important for answering this question more generally.  Quite a few countries got into debt crisis in the past few decades, and one common factor is that they either didn't control their currency, or they couldn't get what they needed using their currency so they needed to depend on currencies they didn't control.  Venezuela controls its currency, for example, but it doesn't help to devalue that when it depends on dollars for its needs, and it doesn't control the dollar.  So these are two paths to the same problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, that's the downside. Nevermind the constant pushing down of paycheck-to-paycheck poor people by making the cash in their pockets lose value year after year.</p></div>		</li>
