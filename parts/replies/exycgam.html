<p>Hold the butter! Do people not unfold their popcorn bags prior to putting them in the microwave?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to my research, not unfolding the bag results in fewer unpopped kernels, so better popcorn. I suspect the reason is that if you don't unfold it, more kernels are above the magical metallic plate that make them go pop, but this is just a working hypothesis. Experiments are currently on hold for lack of funding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm on it. My microwave has popcorn times, so I'll do 1 folded and 1 unfolded for the same amount of time and report my results. Brb.</p>
<p>Edit 1: I'm already a little iffy about this due to <a href="https://i.imgur.com/fWMpwGX.jpg" target="_blank">this photo.</a> You can see the flap says &quot;this side down&quot; which would only be possible unfolding prior to microwaving.</p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0gUwDM2.jpg" target="_blank">First bag</a> popped as a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7ZwhVjB.jpg" target="_blank">3.0 oz bag</a>. Resulting in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KaufSHk.jpg" target="_blank">this many unpopped kernels.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/mCUXVlH.jpg" target="_blank">Bag 2, unfolded, popped as a 3.0 oz bag</a> resulted in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AvtWzMK.jpg" target="_blank">this many unpopped kernels.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/adsQaaE.jpg" target="_blank">Side by side</a> we can see that the <del>unfolded</del> <strong>folded</strong> bag yielded better results in the form of more popped kernels.</p></div>		</li>
