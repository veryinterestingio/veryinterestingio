<p>... well, google's autocorrect seems to think so.</p>
<p>stochastic: randomly determined; having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realized I didn't fully answer your question. </p>
<p>To get a picture of the electrons wave, you just send them one by one until you get enough hits to work out the probability function.</p>
<p>Similar to the machine gun example, one shot tells you little about the probability of hitting a spot on the target, but with enough shots you can graph the probability of hitting a given spot on the target. </p>
<p>In the case of an electron, that probably distribution will show you the shape of the electron's wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close, </p>
<p>Took it from a professor's lectures for a pchem class I TAed. Though I wouldn't be surprised if the origin of the professor's notes was first lecture on QM in Feynman.</p></div>		</li>
