			<div class="markdown"><p>this “goosebumps” full body sensation usually happens during music and most people actually don’t experience this, they think “getting chills” during music or a very emotional experience is just an expression and not a literal statement, probably why the commenter above you immediately went to think of “hairs on back of neck” as the closest physical response, they probably aren’t one of the people who experience this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this the same with getting teary eyes? I always have teary eyes when listening to some music. Not overly emotional otherwise. Some media even comics can give me goosebumps or even a  lump in my throat. Is this not universal either?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this. When I'm under alot of stress or had a busy week I can sometimes cause this response to work on command. My mom and uncle can do it too so I'm sure it is somehow related to the neuromuscular system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i can do this too at will! you mention neuromuscular system, do you have any health conditions this could relate to? i find the whole asmr thing very interesting, i've had these since pre-school, i got them when singing a specific song in group. was happy to finally find a name for that when it became more popular</p></div>		</li>
