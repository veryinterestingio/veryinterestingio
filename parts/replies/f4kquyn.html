			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in a second story apartment that's attached behind a single story apartment. There's a car that parks on the street in just the right position such that the reflection of the sun off the windshield shines past the corner of the single story apartment roof, through my kitchen window, and onto the wall. Since the car is pretty far away, the reflected light is pretty coherent and it creates awesome Schlieren images of the hot air dancing around over the shadow that the roof shingles cast. I've spent more than a few minutes just staring at it when it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to observe this with a little more visual cues is to use a heater by a window on a sunny day or something similar.  If you place the heater below the window, the light will pass through the heated air and hopefully cast a &quot;shadow&quot; iof the blur on the floor/wall.  You'll be able to see it a little better and discern trends in these convective fluid dynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. I remember this being one of those 'attention to detail' things from &quot;Independence Day.&quot; As the fighter squadron makes its first attack on the spaceship over L.A., you see the images of the planes distorted by the exhaust of the fighters passing  in front. That made the scene feel real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was around -50F where I live last year, very very cold with the wind, and I could see the blur when I opened my door and all the air came into my house, is it also because of your reason?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, what's causing it is just the difference in temperature compared to the surrounding air. Normally we see this with a great source and ambient air temperature, but in your case it was reverse. I think it's not noticed as often with the cold because you get weird condensation effects at the same time and they can mask it.</p></div>		</li>
