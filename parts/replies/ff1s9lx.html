			<div class="markdown"><p>They did make one that was odor free a while back, one for allergies, and one that is antibacterial.</p>
<p>Edit: The scent free is called free nature. The one for allergies is called Allergen Reducer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta- It worked so well that people didn't use it a 2nd time. They added the smell, which wears off faster than the fabreeze's effectiveness. The idea is that people will re use it when the fragrance wears off </p>
<p>Fun fact- It took the a really long time to find a smell that wouldn't be neutralized</p></div>		</li>
