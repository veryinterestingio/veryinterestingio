			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the last part isn't true. It has to do with our skin actually not beeing able to feel heat, but to feel heat conductivity. A blanket will feel warmer than a stone even though both have the exact same temperature. u/JeansAndAPolo describes it corretly somewhere in this post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;When something feels hot or cold what you are actually feeling is the heat entering or leaving your body. So two objects at the same temperature might <em>feel</em> different against your skin depending on how easy it is for heat to flow between your body and the object. </p>
<p>It's very difficult for heat to flow between solids and gases. Heat moves from one object to another mostly when the hot atoms hit the cold atoms and pass some energy over. (for the science nerds: yes I'm excluding radiative transfer since it's not the differentiating mechanism between OPs examples). Since atoms are further apart in gases, there's not a lot of gas atoms colliding against the solid object's atoms. However, heat flows better between solid-to-liquids, and solids-to-solids. That's because the atoms in solids and liquids are packed together, so they hit each other and pass around energy really well. </p>
<p>Things like blankets, coats, and the insulation builders put in your house's walls, are filled with tiny air bubbles. That means for heat to flow through them, the heat has to pass from solid to gas to solid to gas to solid... Which is really hard to do. So not much heat leaves your body through the blanket, which makes them <em>feel</em> warm. Additionally, since your body continuously generates more heat, you can actually build up too much heat between you and the blanket since so little heat is leaving (this is why you might start sweating while wearing a winter coat even if it's freezing outside).</p>
<p>However, if you touch a solid or liquid, such as a rock or water, which are at the same temperature as the blanket, they will <em>feel</em> colder because more heat will leave your body because heat flows better from solid-to-solid and solid-to-liquid. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the rock, water, and blanket are hotter than your skin, the rock and water will feel very hot compared to a blanket because more heat <em>enters</em> your body through the solids and liquids.</p>
<p>This is why it's easier to burn yourself on hot water or metal than with hot air. This is also why you can freeze your tongue to a metal pole when it's cold outside. Sticking your tongue out into freezing air doesn't freeze your tongue right away because the heat flows too slowly (your body's heat generation can keep up). But, when your tongue touches the metal, so much heat leaves the tongue that it quickly freezes tight against the pole.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that the air pockets are only part of the reason.  Some materials push heat onto or draw heat out of you faster than other materials. A block of stone will feel either hotter or colder to the touch than a block of solid plastic. </p>
<p>This is because the temperature you experience is tied to the way the object changes temperature in your hand that’s touching it.  You are not actually feeling the objects temperature, but how quickly it changes your hand’s temperature. A material that moves heat more quickly will feel much hotter or colder, depending on whether it is moving heat into or out of your hand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the friction between your skin and the fibers generates heat quickly and heats up the air pockets, making the blanket feel warm much more quickly than the rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What.</p>
<p>You do realize that your body creates heat by respiration, right? It has nothing to do with friction.</p>
<p>Please don't tell me you think our bodies are warm because of friction.</p></div>		</li>
