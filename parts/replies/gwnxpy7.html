			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This concept brought on the important question of how huge mammals like elephants and whales don’t always die young from cancer since their chances are 20x even. Studying their systems we found out that they have cancer fighting genomes in their dna and special immune systems to keep cancer levels down to a minimum. We’re now hoping to map those genes so we can by a miracle one day apply it to fetuses and maybe adult humans with techniques like CRISPR-Cas9</p></div>		</li>

There's also the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/47/2/317/719209" target="_blank">hypothesis</a> that part of the reason why large animals don't die of cancer as much as you might expect is that they are <em>so</em> large that a tumour big enough to threaten them is likely to be destroyed by meta-tumours. If the hypothesis is true, whales are so big that their cancers die of cancer before they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, plus in addition certain large critters have multiple copies of particular genes that are suppressed in cancer-afflicted individuals, such as TP53.  This counterbalances their larger size to some degree.  Think if we both had a potential rat problem and you lived in a larger house, but we've both set up traps yet I have more rats.  &quot;Why do I get more rats when your house has so much more space and access for rats?,&quot; I'd say.  You'd respond with &quot;well, I set up fifty traps in my place and you only bought one.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The upside is that in average your salary scales with your height if you are male (for women it is good looks that is the best predictor for salary).  Of your kind of job, education and age matter more. But height is more important than eg university grades. :-(</p>
<p>Compare engineers from the same year, lawyers from the same year etc, and height is the one thing that correlates most strongly with salary for males</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean just having a higher risk doesn't mean you're going to randomly drop dead. There are several cofactors associated and the increased risk could be insignificant. </p>
<p>For example the average life span of a 6'4'' person could be 75 and that of a 5'4'' individual could be 72, but the difference could be labelled as &quot;a higher risk&quot; because the covariance makes it significant. </p>
<p>Data can be very misleading, especially with general variables such as mortality, there are soooo many other variables to consider and control for. It's all about setting a narrative. Don't let it get to you too much, just live life mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do studies like this adjust for maladies that cause extreme height, like Marfan syndrome, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_the_Giant" target="_blank">Acromegaly</a>, pituitary tumors, etc? These types of problems cause you to be extremely tall but also to die very young. Not excluding these from the data seem like they would skew results, but also I'm not sure if they're common enough to have a big impact.</p>
<p>I've read elsewhere that greater height is correlated with <em>reduced</em> risk of heart disease as well as other markers of increased general health, but I don't know how that would gel with height reducing life span.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any good study would include factors like that in the paper. </p>
<p>Aside from the study quoted above, there have been peer reviewed studies that link certain genes with stature and longevity. The FOXO3 gene comes to mind if you're curious. Weirdly enough, certain alleles of that led to greater longevity and were inversely associated with height. </p>
<p>That combined with greater likelihood for cancer and higher fasting insulin levels seem to point to height being inversely related to longevity. Strange stuff!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That one's more complicated.  The larger person doesn't necessarily have more cells, their adipose tissue just gets larger.</p>
<p>However the way that people tend to get that much larger usually involves exposure to products and substances that are carcinogens.  This would give them a higher cancer rate.</p>
<p>But, the same people are also at much higher risk for hypertension, heart disease and numerous other health hazards that are quite likely to kill them before they get cancer.  So their overall cancer rate over the whole population may actually be lower than the smaller people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They have more bone mass to support the weight, more skin cells to cover the fat, etc. etc. So yes they do have more cells. Without a doubt. The fact that they don't necessarily have more fat cells is quite interesting, but doesn't really complicate things as much as you'd think.</p></div>		</li>
