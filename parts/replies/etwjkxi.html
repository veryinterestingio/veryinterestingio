<p>That might be kind of true <em>now</em>, but if you're taking a historical view of the subject, this is pretty far from true. Operating systems existed to abstract hardware access for a long time before thread management and multitasking came along. OSes true function is to handle hardware-level access so that software doesn't have to. If you're writing a spreadsheet application, you don't want to spend time handling interrupts for input or writing the code to format a disk and save a file to it. The OS says &quot;just let me know when you need to make the speaker beep, and I'll take care of it&quot; instead of having to know which CPU instruction to call in order to make that happen. That way, every single program isn't having to write tons of extra code just to make the computer <em>work</em> in addition to doing the thing the program is supposed to do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not really true. Time sharing operating systems came along quite quickly, with the first one (CTSS) being demonstrated in 1961, and the first really popular one (Multics) being delivered in 1967.</p></div>		</li>
