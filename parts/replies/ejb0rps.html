			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s really interesting. </p>
<p>One question: if the magnetic field is created by the spinning of the earths core, then how does it switch polarity every now and then (magnetic north becoming magnetic south and vice versa)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a book on Earth’s magnetism and the history of our understanding of it so I feel qualified to say this: There is no way to describe this to a five year old, it’s all based on stuff based on complex science and mathematics. You can explain in broad terms <em>why</em> it works but <em>how</em> it works is just too complex to simplify without being downright wrong. </p>
<p>I wish I could explain in an easy to understand way but let me put it to you this way, my geology professor who works at a lab for the government researching volcanoes doesn’t understand <em>how</em> Earth’s magnetism works. It’s just that hard to grasp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has it got anything to do with how <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1n-HMSCDYtM" target="_blank">this t-shaped bar thing spins in zero-gravity</a>, just on a far greater scale? i.e. quite stably in one orientation before abruptly switching to the other from time to time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta like this where the handles are the molten metal and the third axis is say magnetic north. Just on a much slower time scale as the molten metal takes a long time to switch orientation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, nobody knows. There's been a ton of computer simulations ran, and scientists haven't isolated one trigger. Most scientists believe that it's a spontaneous occurrence and relies on specific favorable conditions being met, but others hypothesize that they're caused by external events, such as impact events or tectonic plate movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’ve made (very) complex models that will periodically flip around the timescale that Earth’s polarity flips. But it’s tough to say if the models actually represent the system accurately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>@jstewart0131 mentions that the core might not be spinning the same speed as the outer layers. I suppose if it’s spinning faster than the outer layer the field would be generated one way, and if it was spinning slower, then the field would be generated in reverse. It might explain it, but I think I’ll stick with the “we don’t really know” answer for now.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clear something up briefly: the Earth's core as a *whole* isn't spinning, but parts of the liquid core spin due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force" target="_blank">Coriolis effect</a> and make something resembling a coil. That coil, because it's liquid hot iron (and has tons of energy), is akin to running an electrical current through a coil and creates a magnetic field like <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/magnetic/imgmag/sol3.gif" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, the core and all of its liquids are super complicated, so not all of the coils end up making magnetic fields in the exact same direction. If you look at the <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/84266/measuring-earths-magnetism" target="_blank">Earth's magnetic field</a>, you'll see that it's much more complicated than the poles being one charge and everywhere else being another. It's just that so many fields go in roughly the same direction that it can be generalized as the north/south poles--AKA the dipolar approximation. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The Earth's magnetic field actually shifts all the time and the poles change slightly every year. This is due to the core being liquid and so the aforementioned &quot;coils&quot; don't act the exact same way all the time. As for when it flips entirely, we don't know why it happens. It's theorized that large impact events such as earthquakes, meteor strikes, etc can trigger it by interrupting the flow of the iron core. Think of shaking a bottle of water up: whatever the liquid was doing beforehand gets interrupted. Then, when the iron core starts flowing again (because of the Earth's rotation), there's a chance it'll be in the opposite direction. But again, we don't really know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dynamo effect would stop. And we’d lose our magnetic  field.   That would be bad because the magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, which keeps it from stripping our atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>
