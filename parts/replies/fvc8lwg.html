			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's what he or she was saying. But I may be misreading it. Selecting for larger fish in throwing small ones back may lead to smaller fish overall. Just as, for those who hunt in North America, looking for bigger bucks have selected for bucks with smaller racks.</p>
<p>The monsters, the giant fish, are largely gone. And even game fishing is finding smaller samples. This is true not just for deep ocean fishing, but for common lake fishing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting note on this. That you really need to know the species. For instance there's alot of steam to change the summer flounder (fluke) around here to a slot.  </p>
<p>Right now it's something like 3 fish at 18.5. but research has shown (citation needed check Rutgers maybe) that 90+% of fluke over 18 inches are female.  What's more is that they don't begin reproducing until 16-18 inches large.</p>
<p>Currently we are almost exclusively keeping the females and likewise further restricting the rate limiting factor.</p>
<p>The idea is by protecting the &quot;breeders&quot; the stock will do better. I'm not sure about fluke's reproduction numbers but with many species (stripers come to mind) 2 inches of fish can be billions of eggs.</p>
<p>Addition: another benefit is the boost to recreational fishing, because it's more likely that &quot;everyone goes home with a fish&quot; . And can help turn a child to like fishing.  Rod and reel fishing is by a large margin less impactful than commercial nets or long line. Plus a fish you caught always tastes better than one you bought</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there are also &quot;slot limits&quot; where a fish must be within a range of sizes notably that too large a fish must be put back. This again applies to /u/foodfishsci's comment where the concern is that if the largest fish are always kept that the population naturally grows smaller in size.</p></div>		</li>
