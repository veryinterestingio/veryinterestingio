			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting because I've heard the opposite re: skin elastin composition of men compared to women, namely that part of the &quot;supple&quot; nature of women's skin is due to estrogen-mediated increases in elastin synthesis within the skin tissue. Do you have any sources off the top of your head showing men have higher elastin levels? because all that I've heard has been the exact opposite. I agree with everything else you said but part of my intuitive has been part of the tactile differences in male and female skin is due to hormonally mediated differential elastin synthesis and typically it has said that women have more elastin than men. Part of the same reason cardiovascular risk increases in female populations along with the reduction of estrogen that accompanies menopause, elastin synthesis and a host of other processes are downregulated in a lower estrogen environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been ages since I've read about skin elastin specifically so you very well could be correct. I'll look further into it and get back to this comment. I know that since women tend to use more 'beauty' products (read make-up, lotions, etc.) their skin tends to be more heavily impacted by things like sun exposure and smoking. I'm sure you could also equate the number of children a woman has to doing short term damage to a woman's body over the long term and varying levels of hormonal changes that would only add to damage to skin elastin, amongst other things.</p></div>		</li>
