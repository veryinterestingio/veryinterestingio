			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.deepseanews.com/" target="_blank">Deep sea news</a> is a great avenue for exploring certain topics with respect to current events and research, often laced with humour. Dr Kim Martini's contributions on physical oceanography are pretty good.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of online communities and resources for climate dynamics and oceanography, but you're right that there isn't much for physical oceanography specifically. It's a pretty small field. Your best bet is probably the websites for a few of the top Physical Oceanography departments, government labs, and scientific journals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biological oceanographer here.  Doesn't Ekman transport only affect the upper(ish) parts of the ocean?  It's been a while since I took phys oce but I do seem to recall that the deep ocean currents were almost entirely density driven. I'm not trying to argue with you since this clearly isn't my area of expertise but I am curious how deep Eckman transport goes.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Greetings. The Ekman spiral and transport occurs in the upper ocean. The convergence of the divergence of the Ekman transport, due to spatially varying winds, sets up high/low pressure systems that drive a deep geostrophic flow.  An interesting fact is that this geostrophic transport is ~ four times larger than the direct Ekman transport using typical mid-latitude values. </p></div>		</li>
