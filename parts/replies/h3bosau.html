			<div class="markdown"><p>I would beg to differ with you that air conditioning is not a requirement. Visit the Deep South in the summer with 98% humidity. People die. But an inexpensive way to cool of if you lack an air conditioner is putting a fan behind a bucket of ice. The bigger the blocks of ice the better. Then place a fan behind it. You have to stay in the vicinity for it to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the heart of the BC heat wave and I found an old DIY hack from the internet is probably literally saving my life</p>
<p>Buy a cheap styrofoam picnic cooler, cut two holes in the top, fill it with ice and a bit of water, pin some cloth scraps to the inside of the lid so they dangle into the water, and point a fan in one of the holes. They say it won't work well in high humidity, but we're well past 80% here and it's still better than nothing lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I live in Florida. The humidity can get well over 90%. It may not work great but it feels like heaven when you are about to die from heat stroke. Ha ha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works better than nothing. I’ve used this after many hurricanes to cool down when the generator can’t run the a/c. I use the frozen liter bottles I keep in my freezer during hurricanes. Once the generator is hooked up to the fridge I can take them out and use them to cool down a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Put a Ziploc or other sealable bag in a tall sock  </li>
<li>Fill the bag with ice and seal it  </li>
<li>Leave some room at both ends of the sock. </li>
<li>Wrap the sock around your neck and tie the ends together. </li>
</ol>
<p>That, combined with an ice pack under a hat, really makes a difference. Practically cools the blood directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Unless you have a window unit the compressor is likely outside for noise reasons, in which case the waste heat created by these is not/only to a margimal degree actually beneficial to heating</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AC always generates more heat than cooling. It just separates out where that heat gets dumped. It's a fundamental outcome of the laws of thermodynamics - it's not physically possible to have 100% efficient cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say it generates more heat than cooling is that “extra heat” from friction and electrical resistance in the moving parts? I was getting at the fact those hose units have less efficiency than window units, since any cooled air that isn’t staying in your house represents a loss.</p></div>		</li>

<p>AC units that use a hose</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can get two kinds of portable A/C: single-hose, which is indeed awful for the very reasons you stated; and dual-hose, that pulls outside air into the condenser instead of precious inside air. In my opinion, single-hose units should be illegal.</p>
<p>Dual-hose is still a bit less efficient than a through-the-window unit though, because they have to work harder to move a lot of air though a restrictive hose whereas the window unit gets plenty of ventilation with relatively little effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main benefit of a portable unit is that it uses less window space. Requiring a second hose (especially with enough spacing between them so the intake hose isn't just sucking up the exhaust air) means you need a big enough window that's still too small for a  window unit.</p></div>		</li>
