			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there's a cool offshoot of this called 'gamification' which attempts to harness this mechanism for daily tasks.</p>
<p>For instance my digital watch vibrates and displays fireworks when I reach my step goal for the day. It's a collectable digital achievement. The phone app displays achievements based on how far I've walked in last month year etc. I just earned a' great barrier reef' badge for lifetime walking the distance of the great barrier reef.</p>
<p>Duolingo is actually a perfect example of using gamification for educational benefit too. </p>
<p>However, most gamification models end up being about how to exploit workers and consumers for profit. Thank capitalism for playing with our neural chemistries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I was overweight with bad eating habits.  I eventually became curious to see just how many calories I was eating each day, so I started writing down what I ate and making estimates on the calorie intake.</p>
<p>Almost immediately I inadvertently gamified the process: every day was a question of whether I could beat yesterday’s calorie count.  I started having salads, giving up the junk food runs, even skipping meals.  Anything to give me that edge.  I ended up losing a ton of weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should not!</p>
<p>Just think of Maslow’s pyramid - if you have a simple way of regularly getting dopamine, you can focus more on more high-level goals and achieve them more easily.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have that. Or, do i not? If what you say is true, i should be doing more and more. But im not. I feel missing things, those things keep me from achieving things. But also, I need those things to achieve them missing things. Oh, great!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key here is not just frequent rewards, but <em>random</em> rewards.  </p>
<p>We have some brain chemistry that specifically rewards us when we get a bonus we were not expecting - this is a signal that there is a positive outcome <em>that we were not previously aware of</em>, so the brain seeks to reinforce the behaviour that lead to that point, with the dopamine release.</p>
<p>Games seek to exploit this to keep us compelled to play, the brain is effectively rewarding us with playing the game, because we get these unexpected rewards from it.</p>
