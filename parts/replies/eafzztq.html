<p>In the same way if one could climb into a F-16 and one had the technical background, then there is nothing stopping one from flying it away.  What is stopping me from stealing an F-16?  All those pesky MPs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That depends. To do it properly, yes, there are many steps, and it takes more or less 45 minutes. But none of the are, in the strictest possible sense, necessary. I could pull all the pins, and crank the engine and go.</p>
<p>Of course, if there was anything wrong with the aircraft that the startup checklist would have discovered, I'll be kind of fucked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The satellite doesn’t have a password, but it speaks a language that only the creators of the satellite know. So for anyone to talk to it they need to know how to speak the language. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also it's worth noting that proprietary, non-peer-reviewed, custom encryption schemes are typically far less secure than proper encryption developed by people who understand encryption, and reviewed and stress-tested by people who understand encryption.</p></div>		</li>
