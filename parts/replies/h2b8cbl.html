			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the cartilage that covers the surfaces of all joints. Which is also why once it’s damaged, there’s no possibility of it growing back. It heals as fibrocartilage, while all articular surfaces are hyaline cartilage. Hence why everyone eventually gets degenerative joint disease aka arthritis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s basically blood plasma, and functions as lubrication, nourishment, and shock absorber to the articular cartilage. Fun fact it kinda acts like a sponge and when you weight bear, it gets squeezed out. Then it sucks up more synovial fluid when you take weight off. Which is why it’s good for your joints to move often as it is squeezing out old fluid and sucking up new fluid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less blood supply?</p>
<p>Zero blood supply.  Synovial fluid is how it is nourished.  That's why OA is inevitable.  So much harder to nourish cartilage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes inevitable, it’s just a matter of how much/little you use your joints. I replied to a previous comment about the process of arthritis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think saying OA is inevitable is a bit obtuse. While some joint degeneration over your life is inevitable, OA itself, or at least the painful symptoms associated with OA, don’t have to be. Having strong supporting muscles can really protect the joints from unnecessary wear and tear. For example, strong quadriceps muscles have been shown to be one of the best ways to prevent or slow the onset/progression of OA in the knees.</p>
<p>There is also some research coming out that suggests that running itself does not cause OA, although I am inclined to believe that running form has something to do with it (I.e. running on your heels seems <em>much</em> harder on your knees than running on the balls of your feet would be).</p>
<p>If I were you I would be less concerned with limiting your running/physical activity than I would be with protecting your knees from injury. THAT is a huge risk factor in developing OA. And if you do injure your knees, seek out medical intervention. There are progressive treatments being developed that promise to “rebuild” the damaged cartilage in your joints. PRP injections are a promising example of this.</p>
<p>In fact, it is starting to become apparent within the literature that being too sedentary, overweight, and weak/imbalanced in the joint muscles is the biggest factor is predicting the development of OA. So don’t be afraid to use your body, just do it intelligently.</p></div>		</li>
