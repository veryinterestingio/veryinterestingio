			<div class="markdown"><p>To put a finer point on the Cascadia example, one of the longest records for the occurrence of major events on the Cascadia subduction zone comes from records of turbidites offshore (basically underwater landslides). If you want to read (a lot) about this, this <a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1661F" target="_blank">USGS report</a> lays out the details (though some of this has been refined in later work). The key bit comes near the end in table 12, where they list the time between events as interpreted from the timing of turbidites (assuming that the turbidites they're using are generated by major earthquakes, that's a whole other thread though) and are as follows: 227, 369, 290, 486, 617, 472, 487, 593, 810, 899, 449, 705, 465, 560, 675, 614, 454, and 130 years. From that, we get an average recurrence interval around 500 years (and there is nuance here, the recurrence interval interpreted from these actually is different in different places along the margin) but its easy to see that there is a lot of variability in there. So from the moment after any of these earthquakes occurring, assuming the next one would occur in 500 years gets you in the right ballpark (as opposed to assuming the next one would occur in 50 or 5000 years), but most of the time, you'd still be off by a few hundred years.</p></div>		</li>
