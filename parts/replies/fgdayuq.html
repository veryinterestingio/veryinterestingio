			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that's no longer ELI-5.</p>
<p>Besides encryption could pretty much function as hashing if you generated a public/private key pair and then just threw away the private key.</p>
<p>Seems like a bit of an inefficient way of doing things but hey, I ain't judging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first point is misleading. It would be better to say “A short password is fine for a <em>perfectly</em> designed and run login system”. Everything has flaws, and a longer password protects you of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>A short password is fine for a well designed and run login system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still no. The reason why has to do with the cat/mouse game of attack and defense. The defender has to secure every hole, even those not known yet, to make this true. An attacker needs to find only a single entry to make it false.</p>
<p>Because there's always lag time between announcement of an exploit and patching it, plus there's usually unknown &quot;zero-day&quot; bugs in a system that only elite hackers and government agencies know of, short passwords are no good even in well run systems.</p>
<p>The point of longer passwords is to increase the time to exploit, from discovery of a hack to mitigating it (e.g. forced password changes), to hopefully limit the damage. Longer passwords are like a thicker safe, which takes more time to break into, allowing the owner to notice someone is breaking in and secure the contents before it's stolen. If the encrypted passwords are somehow stolen, they will have a lot more time to force password changes if they are strong passwords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect answer. And this is also why I can't recommend it enough for people to use an offline password generator for <em>everything</em>. The combinations produced are random and allow for levels of complexity that are absurdly difficult for even the best of the best password crackers to break through.</p>
<p><a href="https://keepassxc.org/" target="_blank">KeePassXC</a> is one I've been using for years and it's flawless. I don't even know what most of the passwords I use are, and if ever there's a data breach or anything else that compromises my accounts, generating a new one is just as easy as me spending less than a second clicking a button.</p>
<p>Edit: Quick pointers on some things. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The service I linked to is completely offline, so if you want to use it across multiple devices then you can either transfer your save files physically or you can throw them in Dropbox or any other cloud of your choice. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It isn't restricted to &quot;random&quot; characters. You can also use it to generate strings of words/phrases of specified length and include whatever special symbols you want afterward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has varying levels of password encryption you can set, ranging from a scale of 1 to 5. Setting it at the highest level will result in slower decryption times everytime you open the app.</p>
</li>
<li>It generates additional levels of encryption entropy using the movement of your mouse and key entries of your keyboard.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah for straight coming up with passwords, you don't need to have them generated for you. It's really simple to come up with a strong password.</p>
<p>Really the advantage of password managers is that it actually allows you to realistically use a different password for every site (which is honestly way more important than having secure passwords in the first place), if you use more than a few websites. </p>
<p>In the past I'll admit I basically had 5-6 different passwords, sort of tiered, one was for accounts I don't care at all about, one was for ones that I don't want someone guessing but aren't a big deal if they get hacked, one was for most regular accounts, etc all the way up to my email and bank which had their own separate passwords. I only actually started using unique passwords on every single site after adopting a password manager, since I'm on too many sites for it to be feasible otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Complexity means basically nothing when it comes to a computer brute forcing. Simply having a longer password is going to be a lot more difficult to crack than a more complex one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And length isn't an issue for it. You specify how many characters you want your passwords to be and you can put whatever kind of special characters in them if you so desire. You can also specify if you want it to make random strings of words instead of crazy long nonsense gibberish and it'll do that too.</p>
<p>Basically, any degree of complexity and length you want can be created with it, and that's not including the fact that all passwords created with it are encrypted.</p></div>		</li>
