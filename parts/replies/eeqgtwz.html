			<div class="markdown"><p>More precisely, though, certain parts of the head, including the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord, can be quite sensitive.</p>
<p>The brain itself does not have pain receptors, which is why most intracerebral lesions that do not cause increased pressure (including most strokes) do not cause headaches or pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>headaches occur because of various reasons, it can be sinus related where you get the &quot;full&quot; feeling in your face and mainly anterior pain/discomfort which is from pressure. or a tension headache which is typically stress or trauma causing muscles around the beck and base of the head to tension. that is the headache you get typically after a long day at work or so. dehydration can causw this too as murdo noted and can cause the same kind of symptoms as tension headaches.  usually just drinking water or light stretching/massage of the neck/traps can get rid of a headache. there is also migraines which are their own kinda thing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Headaches are complex and can come from a variety of sources. It can be due to sinuses, vestibular issues, visual/audio stimulus, minor brain trauma,  originate from cervical issues etc. It’s like saying “why does my knee hurt” in a sense. However, what I can tell you is for cervical headaches (originating from the neck) the nerve pathway goes to various muscles, skin, ligaments etc in the area. Since the brain cannot differentiate the exact location it is often referred to the head. Certain types of headaches will have somewhat distinct pattern of pain. For example some feel it behind the eyes, some feel in the temporal region, and some in the back of the head. </p>
