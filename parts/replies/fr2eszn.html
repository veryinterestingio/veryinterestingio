<p>Removing oxygen helps stops things going stale (i.e. oxidising), but that's not the only kind of spoilage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long-life milk is one of the best things in the world. I live in the UK where having no milk for tea is an urgent crisis and the UHT milk is just slightly more expensive than regular milk, but it's always there for you in your cupboard. Relied on it heavily when I first moved into my apartment and had no refrigerator. Science is amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, it's not really that much harder to &quot;can&quot; food in a pouch (Just a thick sealed bag with oxygen barrier layers). Overpressure is applied during the process to prevent the bags from bursting. Whatever the format though, the temperatures need to exceed the boiling point of water, and therefore processed in a pressure vessel (called a retort).  The only exception is if the food is acidic enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important thing to make it work is you need to get it to an internal temperature of 257°F (125°C), this can only be achieved with a pressure cooker and it will unseal a vacuum bag (you need a high temp plastic).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that temperature is for when you’re flashing it right? You can do lower but extend the length of the exposure (lets say 1 hour) to also kill it right?</p>
<p>And what about UV treated in addition to heat to kill instead of just heat</p></div>		</li>
