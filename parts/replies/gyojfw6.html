			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once rear-ended by a drunk driver, pretty decent hit. We pulled over and the guy seeemd totally fine. I called the police and we were waiting for a while (we were kinda far out of town) as we waited, the guy seemed to get more and more drunk as we all calmed down and by the time the police showed up he was obviously drunk and stumbling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading about an interesting court case where a driver was pulled over, stepped out of the car and proceeded to guzzle alcohol in front of the officers. He tried to argue that they couldn't be sure if the alcohol in his blood was already in his system while he was driving but it obviously didn't work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember this guy at a party telling me about the placebo effect. He had a bottle of Excedrin ( back in those days they were round white pills with a big capital E on the front) that he shook into a sandwich bag. He started selling them for $20 a pill as E ( everyone assumed it was ecstasy.) And then we just kind of observed as almost everyone started acting like they were rolling. It was fascinating, honestly. I heard about it on and off for years as the 'craziest' party ever, and it just made me laugh. Brains are such a trip!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know adrenaline is used medically, such as epipens. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m mostly guessing, but for one itâ€™s metabolized fast and itâ€™s effects doesnâ€™t last long, I think itâ€™s effects can last up to an hour. To be fair though, cocaine and crack effects last similar amounts of time. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s also probably in large part that it isnâ€™t euphoric, although this is an assumption on my part. This is the case for a HUGE number of lesser known drugs though. Thereâ€™s a reason the mainstream drugs got mainstream and not the thousands of others, they tend not to feel very good, or have other undesirable aspects. Iâ€™m curious how adrenaline compares to other stimulants when it comes to its strain on the body. It feels like it would take its toll on you, or maybe consistent adrenaline rushes cause increases in cortisol?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amphetamines will.</p>
<p>But yeah there's no pure adrenaline rush drug. You could just inject it directly though.</p>
<p>But also you could just go bungee jumping or something else that terrifies you and is safe and fun and you get the euphoria from doing something new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only does consuming raw adrenaline (norepinephrine) provide no euphoria, it also hurts like hell. Go to the drugstore and pick up Primatine Mist. This is aerosolized epinephrine. You don't need a prescription. Use it as instructed. You'll regret it unless you're using it to save your life.</p>
<p>As you noted, epipens are a way to inject it but I have no experience with them. I have however received an epinephrine injection for tenosynovitis. This also hurt so bad I was driven to tears for about an hour. The needle itself was relatively painless. The real pain started about 15 minutes after the injection and grew from there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, SNRIs are pills that prevent the reuptake of naturally occurring norepinephrine. You do need a prescription for these but they're not controlled and doctors have no problem prescribing them for all manner of life's daily annoyances. They don't hurt but they take a couple of weeks to have an effect and you won't even consciously know when they start working.</p>
<p>Epinephrine itself is a hormone, not a stimulant. The desirable aspects we associate with a natural adrenaline rush are not caused by the adrenaline itself but rather the other chemicals that flood the body along with adrenaline, e.g., dopamine. Stimulants increase both epinephrine and dopamine in the system, which is why they're addictive. </p>
<p>As you suspect, yes, it does take a toll on you. Anxiety is the first you'll notice, then high blood pressure and heart problems. It goes downhill from there. I don't know much about it's relationship with cortisol.</p></div>		</li>
