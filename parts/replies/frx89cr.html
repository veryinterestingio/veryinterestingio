			<div class="markdown"><p>The carbs measured on the label can not have water &quot;in them&quot;. If I took 10g of sucrose and put it in 90g of water and called it high-sucrose-syrup (HSS), it would still only have 10g of carbs despite being 100g of HSS. </p>
<p>The fact is that different carbohydrates have different available energies. The general rule of thumb of 4 kcal per gram is just a rough rule of thumb.</p>
<p>High fructose corn syrup is generally 42% fructose and 58% glucose. By weight excluding water.</p>
<p>Fructose is a monosaccharide that contains 3.68 kcal/g.</p>
<p>Glucose is a monosaccharide that contains 3.91 kcal/g.</p>
<p>43[g] x (3.68[kcal/g] x .42 + 3.91[kcal/g] x .58)</p>
<p>43[g] x (3.81[kcal/g]) = 164 kcal</p>
<p>164 kcal can be rounded down to 160 Calories, and thats it. HFCS42 has about 3.8 kcal/g (anhydrous), not 4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, yeah. A friend of mine works for a company that does food testing, and she said calorie counts can be off by 30% either way and still meet US requirements. I vaguely recall that restaurants are really bad for this, but you don’t often see that much variance with prepackaged foods just because it’s easier to weigh and portion out the ingredients in each package when you make it in a factory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caloric testing is very crude. One of the basic measurements is to basically put the food item in a sealed container with oxygen, ignite the food, and measure how much energy (i.e. heat) comes off of it. </p>
<p>It makes sense in theory, but it ignores a huge number of finer points. For example, the test might be burning compounds that your body is incapable of digesting. This is exactly what happened with nuts. For several decades the caloric values of nuts were labeled as being 30% higher than what they actually are, because in the human body only 70% of the energy content in nuts is actually absorbed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although this technically true, in most places, <a href="https://zomgcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tic_tacs_nutrition_facts.png" target="_blank">the zero has an asterisk</a> explaining &quot;less than 0.5 g&quot;. It's still not the clearest (a serving size is intentionally 0.49g so the sugar is by necessity less than 0.5g.</p>
<p>It doesn't technically say &quot;around 0.48g of sugar&quot;, but if you actually care about those kind of things, hopefully you can figure this out from the info given, and the fact that this 'fun fact' is well known.</p>
<p>All that said, it's kind of bullshit that there is no separate guideline for labelling retirements/rounding where a serving size is  less than, say, 5g - let alone less than 0.5g.</p>
<p>How can you have a rule that says anything less than 0.5g can be labeled as 0g when the entire serving is less than 0.5g?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the FDA has deemed it to be essentially irrelevant, because it really is. You're not supposed to eat fistfuls of tictacs, and having 1 or 2 adds so little in the way of anything, it's going to be completely and overwhelmingly overshadowed by natural variation in manufacturing or preparation of anything else you eat in the day. </p>
<p>The rounding rules they have in place are based on realistically how much something matters. Nothing on any of the nutrition labels in the US have to go down past 0.5g and calories can be rounded to either a multiple of 5 or 10 depending on how many calories a serving is. Once a serving is over 50 calories, you can round to the nearest 10 because the serving is getting big enough that manufacturing tolerances will have a greater error than a few calories anyway.</p></div>		</li>
