			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, as much as I dislike WeWork's  CEO, he's read today's environment correctly. The past decade has been growth-centric with a tech focus. He essentially created a real estate company and then marketed it with tech's growth assumptions to get his bonkers valuation and got $$$paid$$$. It's only fair that SoftBank eat that fat L as they've been one of the biggest players in driving tech VC valuations through the roof with their exorbitant funding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They bought his shares it's not like it was just a payout for him to leave. At the end of the day SoftBank propped up WeWork's valuation in the first place, there isn't much of a parallel to fraud here unless Neuman hid/trafficked aspects of the business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, I know. I am not talking about startups. I am talking about established companies that used to show profit and were growing at some point but are no longer growing and haven't been for years and are even shrinking. They operate at a loss and only exist because they can get loans as their name still means enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it won't be just tech companies or startups, there are plenty of old companies that have stopped growing and exist on the endless cycle of loans. They are usually asset and people rich but cash poor.</p></div>		</li>
