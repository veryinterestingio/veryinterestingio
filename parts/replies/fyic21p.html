			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, it's pretty useless to compare titers from nasal swabs / qPCR results. There will be some much variation from sample to sample because of differences in testing. For example one nurse may get high titers by shoving that swam to the back of your sinuses and the next nurse might not be so medieval.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who is not a virologist nor infectious disease specialist: is it possible that, instead of children having some innate resistance, the virus can replicate freely in children and simply does not initiate an immune response to get rid of it? Or, alternatively, activates an immune response that does not present with flu-like symptoms?</p>
<p>If either of those are even possible for viruses/this virus (respectively) to do, what sort of public health data, transmission trends, outbreak data, etc., would support those hypotheses? Similarly, if children do have some innate level of resistance, what data would support that?</p>
<p>Don’t feel obligated to answer this, of course, but I am genuinely curious. My field involves the immune reaction to “injured self” as opposed to “other”, so I have no real basis for how viruses can/do act. They seem like the type to misbehave, given their odd existence in the grey area between living and non-living.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One hypothesis it might be because children have less of the receptor the virus uses to enter the human cells. So the infection grows more slowly and the immune system has time to boot up before it gets severe. Consistent with high initial load correlating to more severe infection in adults. It's all a race between virus numbers growing in your body and your immune system booting up immunity before it gets out of hand</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - that's possible and even likely in both children and adults. The Diamond Princess cruise ship in February or March - half of the people testing positive <em>never showed any symptoms.</em> That they tested positive is a good indication the virus was replicating in their upper respiratory tract.  Some people's immune system may just ignore it, others goes completely apeshit. The reasons aren't entirely clear yet. </p>
<p>Another indicator are the antibody surveillance studies showing infection rates are anywhere from 2-10x higher than reported PCR positive rates.  That's pretty common with any outbreak. </p>
<p>Data supporting some level of resistance in children is provided by their relative case numbers, which are much lower than cases numbers and mortality rates in the elderly, as a matter of extreme ends of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Is their immune system really ignoring it? Or is the immune system doing what it's supposed to do...defeating it quietly?</p>
<p>Antibody studies show that it is normal for people to have antibodies to colds and flus that they never knew they had. They're infected and the immune system just handles it without you even realizing that you're sick.</p>
<p>Isn't that what you want to happen? I know that's what I would want to happen should I get infected with this (which I hope I don't).</p>
<p>So isn't the same thing happening here? The people are infected and the immune system is handling it without them even knowing that they're sick. Then they emerge at the other end with antibodies against it and never felt ill.</p>
<p>Note: Yes, I do know that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/23/864536258/we-still-dont-fully-understand-the-label-asymptomatic" target="_blank">some people who appeared asymptomatic still had mild damage to their lungs.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Hey new word, thanks internet friend!  </p>
<p>So children are less susceptible because it's difficult for the virus to replicate, is that because they are still growing or what's the consensus there ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, nothing to cite but you could find with a Google search, but I think it's believed that children have fewer ACE2 receptors (which the spike protein of the virus targets) in their upper respiratory tract, and these receptors increase as you age.  In most people, the virus starts replicating there before spreading to the lower respiratory tract and possibly becomes viremic in some people - leading to vascular damage seen in the most severe cases.</p>
<p>Viral numbers are referred to as titers in many cases because infectious virions are measured by diluting and assessed by damage in cell culture for example - ie titrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there is also a study going on that looks at kids infections and when/if they had the mmr vaccine.  I have also read the theory on the ACE2 receptors. I find it interesting how quickly we are learning about this virus and the many different pathways the research is taking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an aside to say, what a blessing it is that children are at least less susceptible to the worst outcomes of this thing. At least, whatever the mechanism, and understanding it can pass through them to the more susceptible and potentially long term adverse effects, we don't have to deal with an epidemic of child death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flip side is that’s why people don’t care as much about social responsibility.  There’s an implicit notion that old people will die anyway. You show children in mass body bags and suddenly everyone is wearing masks.</p></div>		</li>
