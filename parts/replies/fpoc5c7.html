			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine too!! “Games can save the world” and the “Epic Win” moments. Sadly, [video] gaming is frowned upon in our society and has an image of being ‘lazy’ in life. Anyways, I’m thinking of applying same principles &amp; game theories in my Masters... the design of public spaces (landscape architecture) Thank you for inspiring people, like me!! Hope we can do research in the future!!</p></div>		</li>
