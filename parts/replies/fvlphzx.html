Also what kind of work do you do as a geologist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always been very fascinated by geology but didn’t pursue it. Could never figure out what job it lead to. I love learning about all the unique features on this earth and I especially love looking at a hillside or especially rocks/soil around water like the ocean or rivers and imagining the cycles that caused the changes in color or rock type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say engineered stone, is that like cultured marble? That’s like saying cardboard is more resilient than notebook paper, but I assume you know that better than I.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I say engineered stone, I mean surfaces that are made of crushed stone bound together and sealed with resin. Generally they're about 93-97% natural stone. It's marketed under brands like Quartz, Silestone, Cambria, and others. So yeah, a bit like cultured marble. I just know what research that I put in when helping my mom choose countertops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the reply, and my apologies if my initial comment seemed inflammatory. I have a lot of “working experience” with this type of material, and appreciate the opportunity to have heard from somebody that is more educated on stone than I.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The manufactured stone is aggregate held together with resin.  it has the strength and durability of natural stone with less maintenance since it doesn't need to be sealed regularly to prevent stains.</p>
<p>But it cannot handle hot pots and pans like real stone can.  the resin will melt.</p></div>		</li>
