			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with what you've said. A crowd can smooth out very minor fluctuations in pitch (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_effect" target="_blank">chorus effect</a>), but if you're actually off key, it still stands out unless the crowd is so large it drowns out your voice. But as you stated...it's not an &quot;averaging out&quot; but a &quot;merging&quot;.</p>
<p>In my experience, group singing sounds good for 3 reasons (2 of which you pointed out):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Good, confident (and on-tune) singers sing the loudest. If you have even a few of those it can really tie the sound together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joining with a existing pitch is really powerful. If you have the first condition, people can join with the confident singers. Even if not, if the instrumentation is playing the melody, turning the volume up on it can cause people to find and match that tune. As the majority of people find the melody, the few who cannot are drowned out and not heard (as long as you're not standing like right next to them).</p>
</li>
<li>Kind of going along with your last paragraph, I think bad technique goes unnoticed because people just can't hear it. If one person in 50 runs out of breath in the middle of a note, people aren't going to hear it, let alone in a group of hundreds. But a single singer who makes that mistake would easily be heard.</li>
</ol>

<p>No, sound and pitch do not &quot;average out&quot;. That's not at all how music and tonality works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>maybe the term &quot;average out&quot; doesn't make sense, but layering sounds that are slightly detuned from each other is a common way to make them richer and fuller, without sounding like it's deviated from the central pitch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely, but that's more to do with quality of sound (timbre) and richness rather than pitch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I'm the outlier here because I don't like hearing crowds sing along, lol. They all sound like they're shouting and singing how they speak which causes the tone to flatten and lacks the luster of someone who knows how to resonate properly. </p>
<p>But you're spot on about people knowing how to get relatively close to the right pitch, but especially in faster arpeggios or runs, it all goes to shit. If they sing slow, relatively small intervals, or no intervals, they sound ok.</p></div>		</li>
