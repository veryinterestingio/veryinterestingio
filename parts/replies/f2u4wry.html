The more often and faster you're forced to do it, the more mistakes you make. Each mistake carries over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I remember hearing somewhere that cancer is basically inevitable and that number 1 indicator for getting cancer wasn’t smoking or anything like that, but your age. Essentially, your body WILL eventually make that mistake during cell reproduction and each time is more likely than the last to create cancer cells.   It’s scary to think that if no other medical issue, accident, or crime kills you, then cancer will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, over time, you wear out your eraser to correct that misspelled word and from then on continue to make copies of that misspelled word. That is cancer, your cells no longer able to make corrections and mistakes propagating.</p>
<p>Things like radiation and free radicals from chemicals or what have you destroy this cellular eraser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty good! I would add that in a healthy cell you also have several people proof reading it for you as you go (cell cycle check points). Often when cancer starts it is due a defect in one of those proof readers that allows the mistake to go unnoticed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a very good answer. Thanks. I knew that one of the things in cancer cells tied to it was that usually (?) the self-destruct mechanism in cells that limited growth was shut off, as it were.</p></div>		</li>
