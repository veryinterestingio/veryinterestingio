<p>I'll add that wind and humidity have a lot to do with sensing temperature levels.</p>
<p>A breeze that's lower than 90F in temperature often cools you because it removes the air that's closer to your skin and that has been warmed up by your body and replaces it with cooler air. That cool air next to your body takes heat away from you, so a breezy day feels much less hot than a still-air day.</p>
<p>Humid air is denser and prevents your body from removing excess heat through evaporation. When water (sweat) evaporates, it &quot;steals&quot; heat from your body because water requires a little thermal bump to transfer from a liquid to a vapor state, and it steals that thermal energy from your surrounding skin. This is why blowing across a wet patch of skin feels so cool. If the air is humid, you can't transfer more vapor into it, so this cooling mechanism is blocked.</p>
<p>So if it's humid or there's a draft, we can often sense a change of a few degrees in temperature much more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have insanely humid summers here and it's torture. It feels like there is no air, like you struggle to breathe. Sweat doesn't evaporate, it just stays on your skin, sticky and gross. Truly one of the worst seasons for me due to humidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more in depth, the nervous system works by  the receptors in our skin. The receptors take that information to the brain and then sends it back with a task. When cold it decides to contract the skin and keep warm, and when hot your body sweats to relieve some heat.</p></div>		</li>
