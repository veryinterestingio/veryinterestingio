			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m saying this with limited confidence, but I believe the mutations of (rna?) virus is dominated by random mutations, due to the fast replication and no error-checking. </p>
<p>So, less cases would mean theoretically less mutations. and then if there is lowered transmission less people would then pass on that change. </p>
<p>Any modelers out there playing around with the major variables able to weigh in on my statements?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two seasons per year and the review process takes place throughout the whole year, with recommendations on vaccine composition being issued in February (for the Northern hemisphere whose influenza season starts roughly in September of the same year) and September (for the southern hemisphere, with their influenza season starting too when it's winter there). It's in the WHO website.</p></div>		</li>
