			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello!  That's a good question.  Currently, the astronauts who have had an opportunity to harvest plants from VEGGIE, harvest much like you and I do at home.  Using scissors, they either harvest the entire plant at once or harvest part of it, allow it to grow out again and then harvest again.  We call this method Cut and Come Again.  After the plants are harvested, the astronauts sanitize the produce using wipes that contain a citric acid based solution call Prosan.  They are then allowed to eat the produce.</p>
<p>Other aspects of space crops we are exploring is characterizing the microbial and fungal communities that live on the plants and seeds. We are very interested in the automation of crop production as astronauts are very busy with exploration and habitat maintenance.  Automation would allow the astronauts more time to do other things.
