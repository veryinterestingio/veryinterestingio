			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know of any vocals that are not double tracked ever these days, it's literally the first thing done you copy the track and start it like 1/10 of a second later. I also don't know if OP is just talking about warm and cold envelopes as well within the mixing.</p>
<p>Especially since a lot of newer music makes the envelopes a lot more cold and crisp to suite high end speakers/monitors, as it makes the sound a lot clearer. </p>
<p>Not only that I don't know of any digital recording that occurred back in those days, so the analog recordings could have something to do with it as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah normally when you hear any recorded vocal of a big production, and it sounds like it's just one singer, it's 2 takes or 3 or more put through Vocalign and lowered in the mix or something.</p>
<p>If that's not true correct me producers, cuz as a singer I can never get that invisible effect (no vocalign) but I'm told about it.</p>
<p>Probably safe to say low-budget indie tracks aren't doing it. I think layering helps it stand out in dense mix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost all rap is doubled. Check out the a capella tracks. Same for most vocals in all genres actually. It’s tough to notice with background music.</p>
<p>Not doubling is actually pretty rare these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first example that pops into my head, where it is very easy to hear that the vocals are doubled (or tripled) would be Bon Iver - Skinny Love.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear it a lot in rock, Foo Fighters and QOTSA have this effect all over.</p>
<p>Of course none of us have magic knowledge about what the producers actually did, but once you get familiar with what it sounds like it's not too hard to pick out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And carefully avoiding mentioning that Lennon’s hatred of it is the reason why automatic double tracking and all the chorus effects that flowed from it got invented.</p>
<p>Edit: he disliked having to go through the trouble of doing it, not that he didn’t like the sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is inaccurate. Lennon disliked the sound of his voice <em>without</em> double tracking. Why else would he have used it on his own albums? It’s a perfectly acceptable technique to make a singer’s voice sound richer used by everyone from Freddy Mercury to Ozzy Osbourne.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, cool. I've been listening to Bowie a lot lately and noticed the vocals doubling up was a very common thread in a lot of his early work. Would have been right around the time he was hanging out with John Lennon, too. I hadn't looked at it as a widespread trend for the time, but thinking about it now, I'm pretty sure I've heard it in all sorts of places.</p>
<p>Very cool to see those little details and snippets of context, of people giving each other ideas and imitating each other as they developed as artists. All contributing to a zeitgeist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bowie and Lennon most likely got this from Marc Bolan of T-Rex. The &quot;T-Rex Sound&quot; was doubling up everything with a very slight delay in the double.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Les Paul is usually credited as the real innovator here. Doubled vocal and guitar tracks were around when Bolan was a kid.</p>
<p>George Martin had Lennon and the other Beatles double a lot of their vocals. You can hear it clearly on Lennon's verses in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Goxw7VgxfA" target="_blank">I Feel Fine</a> (1964) and McCartney's in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSpiwK5fig0" target="_blank">All My Loving</a> (1963), as two quick examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lennon was definitely doing that before Marc Bolan. Vocals, at least, were double tracked on most of the Beatles recordings.</p></div>		</li>
