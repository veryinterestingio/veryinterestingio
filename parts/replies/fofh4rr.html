Or using it to spin up a massive weight then using the momentum if the weight to drive a generator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tons of room for something to go wrong - probably why you won't see any real progress from them. While I suspect its a company built to scrape venture capital funds. Skyscrapers use hundreds of tons of dampers to counter balance against wind and can flex several feet in each direction. And you're going to build a skyscraper-like structure? Next to a <strong>wind farm</strong>? Something that's just a bunch of bricks sitting on top of each other with 1-2 feet of flex?</p>
<p>I understand that this is a proposed solution for flat areas that don't support a pumped hydroelectricity solution, but it's never going to work to even 10% of what the company is proposing. If it were just many many small cranes with a single weight for example - that would work since you basically throw a need for precision out the window (hugely reduced capacity though).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems stupidly over complicated. Instead of meticulously stacking a million bricks into a tower, why not just have a fixed tower with an electric winch at the top and a very large weight suspended within the body of the tower. Move up, move down, no stacking algorithms needed, and no wasted time and energy shifting cranes around to pick up the next block.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read about one proposed idea years ago that used a massive heavy train on an inclined rail. Too much power? Turn on the train and drag the load uphill. Need more? Let the train roll downhill. Similar to the flywheel ideas but a little more expandable. I'd assume there's some significant friction losses though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if you could use the incoming line frequency as a &quot;trigger&quot; to charge or discharge the power wall.</p>
<p>When the frequency goes high, the load on the grid is less than the generation energy, when the frequency goes low, the load is more than the generation energy. (speeding up, or slowing down the armature.)</p>
<p>Theoretically you could monitor that frequency and charge when the average frequency is higher than 60.05hz (60hz target frequency), and discharge when the frequency is lower than 59.95hz.    Granted, if this becomes ubiquitous, you'd inadvertently cause frequency surges because everyone would be charging at 60.05hz, and discharging below 59.95hz.</p>
<p>Though, in my area you can opt in to a &quot;rewards&quot; program if you have a central AC unit, where the power company installs a device that is remotely operated (essentially a remote operated contactor) which can cut power to your AC compressor/condenser unit during times of peak loading on the grid.</p>
<p>It may be more simple to setup a system where they re-purpose these devices (or just use the same connectivity as these devices) to let systems in a certain area know whether they'd rather more load, or less load, on the grid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your suggestions to charge/discharge based on frequency are correct, but in practice of grid operations, wouldn't work.</p>
<p>Frequency rarely deviates by 0.05 hz for longer than a few seconds.  I think you'd be better off using price signals for charging/discharging of storage rather than frequency UNLESS your using those devices for that specific purpose.</p>
<p>And your utility has that program for what they call LMRs or load modifying resources, to do exactly what you said, peak shaving.  It's a good deal since they're not called for very often (and certainly better than having residential load shed for reliability)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, to make the frequency based charge/discharge work (or possibly work), you could take the average, then monitor instantaneous readings, when you get instantaneous readings that are higher than the average you start charging (and have it setup to charge for a certain amount of time/kw or until batt full) and instantaneous readings lower than average you discharge at a certain rate, possibly limited to what your household is currently using. </p>
<p>of course you could/would put upper/lower limits on what determines a charge/discharge signal. and what rates you want to charge/discharge at, etc.  it would be an interesting project to be sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And also, what happens when different plants on the grid have different loads? One tries to slow down, the other tries to speed up, somewhere in the middle, where the wavefronts collide, will see some crazy harmonics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An intriguing idea of using line signal to program the switch. There used to be internet over power devices for in home use. </p>
<p>I actually wonder if the power company already does something similar.  We have smart meters in our area that digitally provide use data to the power company. So they can charge us üí∞</p>

<p>Most commercial power has a lot of slop in the frequency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the time, the shift is in the range of +/- 0.1%, which I wouldn't define as &quot;a lot&quot;. Overall, it is also artifically steered to keep up with UTC time so that clocks stay in sync. Time error correction is mandatory in the US since 2009.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many places use the electricity up by pumping water back from rivers up into reservoirs, and similar.  Then it just gives you more hydroelectric power later on without having to limit your intake because the reservoir's gone too low.</p>
<p>But, as you say, it's megawatts of power - and sinking that is hard without heat, danger, damaging things (even through wear and tear), etc.</p>
<p>There's no simple solution, but we should have a more reactive source that can just &quot;turn off&quot;.  Base load should be catered for by things that can't turn off easily (e.g. nuclear), everything else should be something where you can just say &quot;Ah, well, disconnect the blades from the turbine and let it spin freely, because we don't need it at the moment&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do have something that is a more reactive source: natural gas turbines.  They're incredibly good at this.</p>
<p>You wouldn't want to just let a wind turbine spin freely in full wind, it would overspeed and destroy itself.  Pretty much every turbine has a combination of disc brakes on a part of the transmission and either variable pitch rotors or blade tip brakes or the ability to rotate off axis from the wind (or all three).  The best you can really do to manage turbines would either be to disconnect and stop them, or depending on their capabilities, rotate the blades to be less efficient and generate less power.</p></div>		</li>
