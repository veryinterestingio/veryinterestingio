			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s much more actually. The enthalpy of vaporization of water is 2257J/g. That’s the energy required to boil water at boiling point. The specific heat of liquid water is 4.18J/g ° c, meaning it takes 4.18J to raise 1gram of water 1 °c, and from freezing point to boiling point(0 °-100 °) it take 418J. So for the same amount of water (1g), it takes 2257 J for it to evaporate; more than 5x the energy to heat from freezing point to boiling point(418J).
If room temp is about 20 °C or a little more, to get it to boiling requires even less heat, about 4/5 as much or less, so less than 340J/g likely.</p>
<p>For comparison, the heat of fusion of water at freezing point, or energy required to melt, is 334J/g, less than 418J/g, and significantly less the 2257.</p>
<p>I just now realized I should’ve used calories instead of J for simplicity because 1cal=4.18J which is the point of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should’ve mentioned in response. The heat that is lost with no lid is important, not because of condensation. Condensation is not going to be happening much(with a closed system), and no where closing to the rate of evaporation. It’s pure because of the steams high temperature and ability to transfer heat to the water, not through condensation but thermodynamics. Condensation results in square 1 and gives the same energy back to the system as was taken to evaporate. Energy isn’t magically created.</p>
<p>But if the lid is taken off, and the gas escapes, then yes it will take the heat with it and eventually cool and condense outside of the system. But that’s irrelevant to the system. As soon as its allowed to escape is when the system loses the heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither of these are entirely accurate. The main reason water can get hotter with a lid on than with the lid off is because of vapor pressure.</p>
<p>If the vapor pressure is higher, the water evaporates less readily and is therefore taking less state-change energy out of the heated water.</p></div>		</li>
