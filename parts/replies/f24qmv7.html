<p>If a home customer wants super fast internet, the ISP can install whatever equipment it needs between the customer's house and the ISP's central office to make that happen.</p>

<p>Not really.  They only upgrade service in an area when the over subscription ratio goes over by some amount.  In almost every case, if a home customer calls up and says, &quot;I want to go from a 15Mbps plan to a 100Mbps&quot;, zero new capacity is added to the area.  They just adjust the settings to allow that consumer to use more bandwidth and charge them more.  Only if you get many customers in an area that are doing that are they going to upgrade (and then only if they feel like they're going to lose those customers to a competitor).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be nice. My ISP doesn't allow you to chooss data limit and speed independently. There are just a few tiers, each one faster and higher limit than the last. Asinine that if I just want a slightly jigher limit that I would need a higher speed too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be very tricky to manage all your customers with different speeds and limits, and that administration overhead would massively increase cost, so companies would charge far higher. For most of their customer base, those that want higher speed will use more data, so it makes sense to pair the two when deciding which low number of fixed options to provide (to keep cost down).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the other person. Anyone can have any speed of internet they want, the only inhibitor is cost.</p>
<p>For example. There is a super duper rich guy who is in my serving area. He owns a portion of a different ISP. He paid his company to run one fiber line I think 10 miles out of the way to his house so he could have their internet.</p>
<p>THEN, he paid my company a ton of money to run fiber to his house as a backup. There was zero fiber there before.</p>
<p>For residential stuff, you would be correct. But if you pay enough the world is your oyster</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yah, but you're underestimating &quot;enough&quot;.  You call call up CentryLink, Spectrum, or whatever and throw money at them to run a dedicated line to you under business service.  And across that one piece of glass you'll get some super fast service.  But it's going to end up in the same area with everyone else.  I suppose yes, you could pay them to upgrade a CO and everything that goes with it (a local fiber ring, peering connections with other ISPs, etc), but in practice that type of request would be so astronomically expensive that it's rarely if ever done.</p></div>		</li>
