			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there. Can you clarify something? Based solely on your comment, strong steel is hard and brittle. But when smiths create swords and cool/heat them in fast succession, we (if the history doesn't lie ) can get extremely hard swords that stay very sharp very long, and can even cut more soft swords in halves. Is this assessment correct? If yes, why very hard swords aren't brittle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick is that when you quench a blade (or any piece of metal really) the whole piece doesn't transform all at once. Rather, the outside of the blade sees a rapid temperature change which changes the steel into a harder phase called martensite, and that's perfect for keeping a sharp edge; however, the core of the blade is not affected as quickly, since the temperature change has to diffuse and reach through the steel. That means the core of the blade doesn't have the same phase change (or at least not to the same degree) and stays more ductile. That gives you a good combination: the edge of your sword is sharp, but the core of the blade can absorb shocks without fracturing.</p>
<p>There is actually a standard test that specifically tells you how &quot;far&quot; into the steel this martensitic transformation goes (the fancy term is hardenability), called the Jominy test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, one sword can never cut another in half. It's a myth. Even if it's the world's best made sword cutting soft annealed steel, it could make a big gouge, but not slice clean through. If the target sword breaks, it's not a cut, it's a snap due to poor tempering.</p>
<p>Which brings me to tempering. After quenching, the steel is hard, meaning it resists deformity, but also brittle. If flexed, it will snap. You temper steel by heating it to a moderate temperature for a long time, say 400 Celsius for an hour or two. This allows the steel to &quot;de-stress&quot; and trades back some of that hardness for toughness, the ability to bend without breaking or deforming permanently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The step they skip on those &quot;EEET WILL KEEL&quot; reality shows is &quot;tempering&quot;, which involves gently heating the hardened steel to a temperature such that it loses some hardness but gains a LOT of ductility, meaning it's &quot;tougher&quot; and less brittle.</p>
<p>They still DO temper their KEELING blades, they just don't show (or ever even talk about IIRC) the process. Gradually heating metal to a temperature to relatively low temperature (no red hot glowing metal) and then letting it cool slowly apparently doesn't make good TV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, realize that in general, if we can make the steel harder, it will be stronger, but it will also be more brittle so there is a balancing act with the various mechanical properties and design. </p>
<p>To follow up on this, strength in the iron-carbon system revolves around forming iron carbides. There are two primary forms, the equilibrium cementite, Fe3C or metastable martensite Fe23C6. The formation of martensite is what gives steel its very high strength. This is done by rapid cooling (quenching), adding more carbon, or adding alloying elements such as chromium, molybdenum and nickel. Classic alloys are 4140 and 4340. Note that one or any combination of these are typically used.</p>
<p>What nice is that one can apply these concepts to surface harden parts. There are many applications (gears, shafts, knives) where you want a strong, hard outer surface, but tough, ductile body. This way, the body can absorb the physical blows and impacts, yet still have a hard, outer surface.</p>
<p>Another way to make metals harder is to cold work them. This is done for low alloy steels. As a metal becomes deformed, dislocations are formed, which strengthen it. This is the only way that a low carbon steel such as 1020 can be strengthened. Think of bending the straight part of a paper clip and see how it gets stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really forge cast iron, no - forging means &quot;shaping through heat and mechanical deformation&quot; (i.e. beat it into submission while it's hot) and cast iron is far too brittle for that. If you heat cast iron and try to forge it, it will splatter and/or fracture. So cast iron is only cast, as far as I know.</p>
<p>You may be thinking of wrought iron which, on the other hand, is a low-carbon content steel that is very malleable, and is what's used for fancy railings, balconies, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply but I'm a tad confused. My question was 'is cast iron only cast?' and it sounds like you're saying that assumption is indeed true, is that right?</p></div>		</li>
