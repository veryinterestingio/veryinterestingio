			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's one way (for example) to stop Canada geese from nesting on your property. Let's say you have them coming every year and destroying your yard. They nest, lay a clutch of eggs and hang around eating up your garden and shitting all over the place. You wait until it's too late for them to brood again and oil their eggs. The eggs won't hatch and they won't nest there again.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's sometimes done with pest species, to control the population - if done early enough, there's no &quot;baby inside&quot;, so it's not like you're killing baby birds, you're just preventing the egg from developing into a baby bird.</p>
<p>If you remove the eggs, the parents will just lay more - but if you coat them, they'll tend to &quot;care for&quot; the eggs until it's too late in the year for them to breed again.</p>
<p>It's quite an effective and humane technique for limiting the population: you don't kill the adult birds, you just prevent them reproducing as much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact:<br />
<del>Eggs of even the biggest dinosaurs were no bigger than that of an ostrich. Any bigger than that and</del> [Eggs cannot grow in size indefinitely since at some point] the oxygen would not penetrate all the way to the middle of the egg</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit.:<br />
As was pointed out several times. There are dinosaur eggs bigger then ostrich eggs, my memory, or the documentary I took this information from, failed me there. However, they are nowhere near the size one would expect, seeing the difference in size between ostriches and e.g. a brontosaurus. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit. 2: (includes some formatting)<br />
In other words, the size difference between a freshly hatched brontosaurus and a fully grown brontosaurus is without comparison in today's fauna. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems reasonable. The surface area to volume ratio is a real thing. Volume grows in a cubic manner because it’s in three dimensions (think length x width x height) while surface area is a square rate of growth. After a certain point there’s just too much volume of egg for the surface to absorb adequate O2. </p></div>		</li>
