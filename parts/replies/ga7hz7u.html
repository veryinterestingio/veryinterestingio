			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, a question I can answer!  My doc told me to &quot;use the eczema ointment he proscribed me on a q-tip and lightly coat the inside of the ear canal&quot;.  He did warn me to pinch the q-tip at the base of the cotton part with my fingertips to ensure I only insert that much in.</p>
<p>Best advice - ask the doctor.  I saw the doctor when the skin was cracking and oozing blood, so he was pretty convinced it needed a bit of treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been through that (sigh)... Mine had suggested baby oil since the fluocinolone acetonide oil stopped being effective. That worked for a month or so. A dermatologist gave me a steroid lotion to use which was nice. The first ENT I saw prescribed ciprodex, the second simply told me to stop using qtips then see him again. I'm stuck wearing ear plugs in the shower and drying my ears with TP/tissue when they're leaking fluid. It's miserable. I have to wear ear plugs for work most of the time which has made the fluid worse. At this point it just seems like an endless hell. Guess I need to find another ENT...?</p></div>		</li>

Now I just avoid certain foods to prevent flare ups, and I've found a good cleansing &amp; moisturizing routine that keeps it from being a pain in the ear. Also, get a pen camera.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get a lot of ear infections as a kid.  I was also told to use q-tips and have not had an ear infection in maybe 20 years.  I should probably go in and get a full cleaning done at some point, but have otherwise not had any problems.  I just am conscious of the fact that you can push it back further, so I do circular motions to avoid that as much as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much my exact experience. Got constant ear infections as a kid, was told to clean my ears daily using Q-Tips. You can't just jam it in there, which has to be what people are doing if they're blocking up their ears all the time with these. </p>
<p>Circular motions, not back and forth. 30 years on and never another ear infection and I've never had a wax blockage.. Still clean ears daily with q-tips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same!!!!! I tend to get dermatitis allergy, or mostly eczema, if i go out without cleaning my ears with a qtip for a long while, they get so itchy and dirty, and trust me i clean them great in the shower, i have a condition on my ear that from time to time it hurts and i start to ear less, specially if i get sick or catch lot of cold, or its too hot. Trust me is weird. What im saying is that if i stop cleaning them with qtips, they start to get worse, i do it in circular motions aswell, but i may try some drops stuff in the future and see how that helps with the itchiness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speech path with tons of audiology schooling here. Do NOT use q-tips. They are terrible to put in your ears. Get a metal ear scraper instead. It is far more effective and won't cause any micro-cotton buildup. Best is to let your ear do its job but if you must clean your ears manually, metal is best.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I did change doctors, too. So maybe I can bring this up to my new doc, and ask if it’s really so bad or if that other doc just had terrible manners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can try to soften it with mineral oil and then flush it (gently!) with a stream of warm water. </p>
<p>There are kits you can buy at the pharmacy that have everything you need. Or have your family doctor do it.  </p>
<p>If it’s badly impacted, an audiologist may have to manually remove it under an otoscope with specialized picks. Don’t ever try to do that yourself. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please don’t spray or syringe your own ears. You don’t know the specific techniques to avoid damaging the canal or drum. You may also not be effectively angling the water to remove the plug. Plus you may have other conditions in the ear that you can’t see without an otoscope that are contraindications to flushing eg an infection, whole in the drum etc. get it done by a professional. </p>
