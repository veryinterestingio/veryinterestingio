			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about them, but when I had hair, one washing with gobs of shampoo didn't feel anywhere near as clean as doing two washings with fairly small amounts.    Think of using two teaspoons of shampoo rather than one tablespoon with the single wash.   (that's an example, I never measured precise amounts)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Measurements here are just used as examples, I've no idea how much shampoo is used;</p>
<p>Say if you wash your hair once, you might use 50ml.</p>
<p>If you know that on a second wash your hair ends up smoother, shinier and smelling really good, you might use 25ml on the first wash, rinse, then use 15ml on the second wash.</p>
<p>Speaking from personal experience; when washing twice that's how I do it. On the second wash I only ever need a much smaller overall amount of shampoo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty good answer, but micelle formation is not a prerequisite for foaming. Foam is just the result of a surfactant packing the air/water interface and stabilizing it (similar to how surfactants can stabilize oil droplets in water or water in oil). Totally agree with the last part though, subsequent washes are more foamy because most of the dirt/oil has been removed already. That means less soap is used for cleaning and more is available for foaming on the second wash.</p></div>		</li>
