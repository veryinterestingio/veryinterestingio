			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily in Zelda, but some old games would reuse sprites, but change the color. A bush in Super Mario Bros is the same as a cloud. One is just green and the other is white. So you might be able to store one sprite and just say &quot;color this cloud green when it's a bush.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Palette swapping can do much more than that too.</p>
<p>Palette swaps can also do animations. You can see that here <a href="http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/" target="_blank">http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/</a><br />
These are not animations. They are all static 256 color images and all the movement is done with palette swapping.<br />
Many older games used this for background water animations.</p>
<p>This can be taken a step further. Look at these <a href="http://www.effectgames.com/demos/worlds/" target="_blank">http://www.effectgames.com/demos/worlds/</a><br />
These are images with palette swapping animations AND palette swapping time of day (show the options to see the slider).<br />
The ones with different shadow directions based on time of day are extremely impressive.</p>
<p>And we can go even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZjEAS5i" target="_blank">Here you can see seven images</a><br />
A forest at different times of day, some clouds and then a city at different times.<br />
There is only one image. The forest, the clouds and the city are all the same image with different palette.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to nitpick, actually curious what the difference between showing a series of images in sequence and &quot;animation&quot; is.</p>
<p>I've always thought of animation as literally showing a series of images in sequence, each of these images is a frame.  Here isn't each frame of the animation the same but with different colors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are great. November Mirror Pond - Clear on your second link is amazing scrolling through the time-of-day. Was this ever used on actual games to this extent?  I'm wondering if any graphic adventures used the technique for time-of-day etc but I don't think so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd quibble with some of the details but this is the basic idea. Old school programmers paid a LOT more attention to memory optimization than most do these days. I'm horrified today when I see that my browser is using several <em>gigs</em> of RAM, because that's ridiculously wasteful and unnecessary.</p>
<p>There were more than 16 map tiles in Zelda, and a bunch of other special tiles, but the music was only a few kb, all the text and dialogue took only a few kb, and so on, so 512k was plenty. The NES itself only had 2kb of RAM(!), though some carts had a few more.</p>
<p>For comparison, the original <em>Quake</em> (1996, ten years after <em>Zelda</em>)--which at the time was a huge world of mindbogglingly amazing 3D graphics, and had to run on general purpose hardware rather than optimized hardware like console games do--was only about 50MB installed. These days, a single high-resolution image might easily be a tenth that size.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact: On the original Sonic the Hedgehog game for Sega Genesis, the audio file for the &quot;Seeeegaaaaaaa!&quot; chant at the beginning took up a full ONE EIGHTH of the entire cartridge!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most interesting thing about Crash Bandicoot is how they wanted to fit big levels in the game, but they were hampered by the PS1's lack of RAM.</p>
<p>But since the levels were linear, they were able to write it so that each level consisted of small 'pages' and you only had to have some number of pages loaded at any given time, and you could only reach them so fast, so they were able to have levels far in excess of the PS1's total RAM without having a loading screen in the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You didn't work for Level 9, did you? I remember their text adventure &quot;Snowball&quot; had something like 7000 locations, all in a game designed to fit into the RAM of an 8-bit computer--there was even a version for the BBC Micro, which had a bit less than 32kB of available memory!</p>
<p>Then there was the game Lords of Midnight on the ZX Spectrum, where the programmer used every trick they could to save space--for instance, if they had a subroutine that called another subroutine as its final action, they could save 4 bytes (the CALL instruction and the additional RET) by re-ordering the routines in memory so the second routine just followed immediately on from the first one.</p></div>		</li>
