			<div class="markdown"><p>To me this sounds like it's just as likely to hit with gravity as without. Meaning, the only way it'd hit the sun is if it was on a direct course towards it. Anything else would have it orbiting the sun. Whereas, without gravity it would just pass by and keep going.</p>
<p>If that's right, it just seems weird to people that objects aren't hitting the sun because there are so many orbiting it. But really those objects would just fly by the sun and keep going if gravity wasn't a factor.</p>
<p>Is that right or am I missing something important?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you're absolutely correct, that's the exact reason it's so unintuitive that objects in the solar system basically never fall into the sun: anything that wouldn't have collided with it without gravity (in the incredible vastness of space) isn't gonna collide with it <em>with</em> gravity either, even if they are kept in near orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I find fascinating is just how hard it is to get probes towards the sun. This is because anything we launch starts with the same speed as the earth, and its stable orbit. The act of getting near to the sun requires some serious deceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a little extra complication in that the sun has some width. So if it bends any orbit where the orbit becomes lower than the surface of the sun, it still collides. Planetary scientists refer to this as the &quot;gravitational cross section&quot; as oppose to the real cross section.</p>
<p>Actually, this concept comes up for people learning about the process of planetary formation. Imagine the early solar system. You have a bunch of particles flying about, chunks of dirt and ice. Some of them will naturally collide with one another, but while they're really small, their odds of colliding with one another are effectively directly related to the size of their cross section. However, as they increase in size, and acquire some gravity, they start to capture things that would be a narrow miss, because their gravity bends the path towards the object (now a planetoid). This new effective cross section is larger than its real cross section by some small amount. But, as it grows, this process becomes multiplicative. And planets form.</p>
<p>The analogy works for the sun too, if you imagine it flying through interstellar space picking up objects. It will grab more than are on a direct, straight line to it, but how much it grabs depends on its radius, gravity, and velocity vector of the incoming object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this that it is incredobly hard to hit sun on purpose. From Earth, it is much easier and less fuel costly to place something on orbit that escapes (exits) the solar system than it is to aim for the sun. All of our sun-researching vessels took some convoluted paths using slingshots from outer planets and such. It is very difficult to just &quot;drop&quot; inzo the sun starting from moving position.</p></div>		</li>
