			<div class="markdown"><p>Great reply.  I especially like &quot;research is widespread in universities because that is where researchers are trained&quot;.  I would like to add that in a university setting, professors are wholly responsible for a good portion of their time.  If publications slow down a bit while a professor ventures into new ideas, it can work out in the end.  It's much more difficult in a company with a profit motive and management breathing down people's necks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is 100% right. I cofounded a medical device startup and we are at the preclinical stage. All of our work is funded by a combination of investor and state and federal grant money, and the research occurs in the universities for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Quality control (GLP) and unbiased ethics boards.</li>
<li>Facilities needed for research are very expensive and you have limited funding prerevenue to implement infrastructure. </li>
<li>Expertise. There are many aspects of a research project to cover and it cannot be undertaken by a small team. The government and taxpayers like to fund the researchers in their universities to recycle taxpayer dollars back to their children at universities, which I think is a really cool thing. The company benefits by having the work delegated to unbiased and highly skilled researchers, which cannot be in the scope of management.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of universities have funding for their students if they want to create start ups, and even more sell/rent lab space out to businesses. (idk if it's a lot, but of all the colleges I toured last year this seems commonplace)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a great relationship so long as you can facilitate an IP agreement. We have even been able to create a few PhD projects as a result!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so true, when you have to pay on-costs and overheads for research, you almost pay the uni an extra 30% just to access their researchers/facilities. Yes there are general tax breaks for research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, companies often sponsor “fundamental” research at universities, and this is becoming a very common practice. I’m in charge of the IP that comes out of a few schools at a major research university and I’ve negotiated a huge number of sponsored research agreements. Major universities bring in millions and millions of dollars this way. As for what this “fundamental research” entails and how fundamental it truly is is a different question however.</p></div>		</li>
