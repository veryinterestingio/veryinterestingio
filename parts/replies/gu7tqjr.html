			<div class="markdown"><p>Asking for a friend, how can I prolong the good feeling picking a scab gives? Is it possible to reproduce the feeling without...a scab and without hurting my skin?</p>
<p>Edit for another friend:
DON'T USE SKIN PICKING AS A STRESS RELIEVER, go to a therapist and dermatologist if you have problems with picking your skin. They are very familiar with your conditions and see your problems very often, they will not embarrass you in the slightest. They are there to help you feel better 100% of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a horrible thing to be addicted to. Lotta people use skin picking as a coping mechanism, myself being one of them.</p>
<p>The problem is that your brain starts making phantom itchy feelings for you to scratch. You'll start scratching at otherwise healthy skin and ruining it because your brain randomly decided it hates that patch of skin. Then comes scarring and bloodstained clothing. White t-shirts become impossible to wear. </p>
<p>Seriously, of all the (relatively) minor things to be addicted to, don't choose picking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean ... I don't know that this really answers OP's question.  When you pick a scab, it generally doesn't itch in my experience.  It's just that the action of removing it, especially in one piece, is satisfying somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since this is usually a self-targeted activity, I was wondering if it is removing the scab that's satisfying, or having the scab removed. So I did a little experiment.</p>
<p>Results: Removing someone else's scab feels just as satisfying. And having someone remove your scab does not generate any enjoyment. </p>
<p>Sample size: 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read it might be an evolutionary trait against bugs / critters / foreign matter, it's your brain signaling hey there might be something on you. Blind guess but maybe also in some ways keeping a healing wound clean. If it feels good you're more likely to do it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the itch is actually a small, prickly pain.  By scratching, we disguise the pain. Then the scratching feels so good,  we scratch more and more,  having forgotten the original itch, unless it's like a mosquito bite. Then slap that bite,  or put some rubbing alcohol or ice on it.</p></div>		</li>
