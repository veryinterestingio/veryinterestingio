			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mind-boggling to even try to understand this. How can all this have been at a single point? Why did it spread out all of the sudden? And how did it get to that single point in the first place?!</p>
<p>I absolutely love and hate the fact that we know so much but yet so little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, because it was all at one point, it wasn't there very long. No time at all, in fact, because time wasn't invented until it started inflating. It inflated into the universe in fractions of a micropercent of a nintrillisecond, and created the laws of physics along the way.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's all pretty weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it is accurate to say time wasn’t invented. According to relativity time isn’t special and should more or less be treated like another spatial dimension.</p>
<p>The laws of physics were not created along the way, we have models for inflation consistent with our current understanding of physics. I don’t really understand that statement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've watched a lot of stuff about the universe and everything in my high school years, and I'm pretty sure it had to do something with my depression. Like dude, I'm not sure about scientists, but when you're trying to think about this with little scientific background... It still blows my mind. How insignificant and pointless is our existence in this vast world.</p>
<p>Edit: meant to write insignificant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so... what about this thought. If there was “stuff” already there before the Big Bang. Where did the stuff come from?</p>
<p>The only answer to this never ending question is that there is no real such thing as time. There is no beginning or end, everything simply always <strong>has</strong> been there. What do you think, is that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t make sense to say “before the Big Bang”.</p>
<p>It’s like trying to find a point further north than the North Pole. It’s simply undefined.</p>
<p>This is partly due to our current model of the universe being incomplete. Given this, we can’t really say anything about what happened at the singularity “before” the Big Bang. </p>
<p>There may have been matter. There may not have been. We don’t know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if you take time out of the equation, it still doesn't change anything and replaces one question with another.</p>
<p>If &quot;everything simply always has been there&quot; the question still remains: how? If you want to argue that it's just how things are, it still doesn't explain why.</p>
<p>If you want to argue that there never is a starting point because that's how and why it is - it has to be <em>something</em>. So what is <em>that</em> then? A continuum? Some sort of exotic state of matter? Is the universe as we observe it now just one of many evolutionary stages? A never-ending loop? A simulation? A tinyverse? </p>
<p>No matter what the explanation would be - either based on hypothesis or actual data - unless it can explain the nature of &quot;stuff&quot; that has already been there all the time and why it did change etc. we won't really have a proper answer, just different approaches to provide more or less satisfactory answers, depending on our personal beliefs.</p></div>		</li>
