<p>Before launch.  Once it's launched a heat-seeking missile is possible to detect, but huge caveat here, detection can be difficult due to various environmental factors.  It's not an easy task.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is that...</p>
<p>The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was. It is able to obtain a deviation, and a variation, which is called &quot;air&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flight of 4 aircraft (stroke 1-4) were operating in Iraq.</p>
<p>They were engaged by multiple SA-2, which you can hear them calling out at the beginning. It's a radar guided surface to air weapon system.</p>
<p>They began evasive maneuvers and attempted to exit the engagement zone of those SA-2s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, after that brief period of relief while exiting, we would learn later that it was a trap.  </p>
<p>They were pushed into the engagement zone of multiple SA-6s, another type of surface to air missile with a different type of radar system, one that they couldn't detect, hence their suddenly bring caught unawares and instantly panicking about half way through the video. The remainder is them attempting to evade those.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, they still assumed it was the SA-2s engaging them, another flight of 4 flew through the same area and was again engaged and that is when they figured out about the other weapon systems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Short version is that you're looking at the view from the aircraft called 'Stoke 3' (basically looking straight ahead with the HUD visible).  It's shitty video because digital cameras in 1991 sucked.  However the high pitched beeps and whines are the radar warnings, that's the 'weapons locked' sound.  And he dodges sixs missiles shot at him from the ground by turning really hard just at the right time to dodge the missiles.  Turning that hard makes you black out, that's why he's breathing so hard to try to stay conscious (they also do other stuff like tensing his legs and abs to try to force blood out of his lower body and back into his head).  And a few of his friends were shot down (you can hear the audio of them saying they're hit on the radio).  It's crazy to pull it off once.  He did it 6 times in a row and made it out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a nutshell, this Desert Storm F-16 pilot dodged multiple surface-to-air missiles.  He received the Distinguished Flying Cross as a result.  I loosely know this pilot today through a shared hobby.</p>
<p>When he landed, his flare and chaff (countermeasures that can draw a pursuing missile away from a target aircraft) were undeployed.  I'll have to ask him sometime if his flare/chaff failed to deploy, or if he was simply too busy to deploy them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so the problem is, modern missiles are smart. Specifically, modern IRCCM techniques include the ability for the missile to assess the thermal spectra of the target, and to reject things like flares that couldnt be the target, either because they are too hot, too cold, a different thermal frequency, too large, too small, or even the wrong shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, systems to detect and track missile launches are already fielded by several combat aircraft. The problem with such systems is not making them small enough to fit on an aircraft, thats pretty easy. The problem is making the system have a low rate of false alarms. </p>
<p>The MAWS for the A-10 is turned off fairly frequently by its pilots, reportedly, due to the number of false alarms from things which are bright enough to trigger the system, but which are not missile launches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what flares are for, flares are deployed which burn at high temperature to confuse heat seekers as to which one is your actual jet exhaust or the flare thus saving you from a missile up the ass. Chaff  is a radar countermeasure designed to obscure radar tracking.</p></div>		</li>
