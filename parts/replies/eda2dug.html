It's one of the safest place to invest your money so long as you are happy with the relatively low rates of return compared to the broader market.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This only is correct in economies with a fixed exchange rate (either fixed to gold or another currency). This is not correct for the US or Japan or China or other independent countries with their own currencies. When one of these countries’ governments wants more money, the central bank simply credits the government accounts. The purpose of “borrowing” in these economies is to support interest rates. The natural interest rate in fiat money economies otherwise would be 0%</p>
<p>In such economies, the purpose of taxation is NOT to get more money into the government accounts, but to erase some dollars from the economy, to adjust the aggregate demand for the economy’s services. The government obviously can “print” all the money that it needs. Taxation is the opposite of this “printing,” the opposite of money creation. Taxation is money destruction. </p>
<p>Too much demand possibly creates inflation. Too little demand creates unemployment. Taxation adjusts  that aggregate demand. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This only make sense if you consider the central bank and the government to be a single entity. I understand that from a certain perspective this can make sense, but given they don't always work together or even always have the same goals it's a bit of a stretch.</p></div>		</li>
