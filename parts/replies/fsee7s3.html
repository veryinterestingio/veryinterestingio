<p>Obesity also makes it harder for muscles to grow and maintain their size: <a href="https://www.lifefitness.com.au/8288-2/" target="_blank">https://www.lifefitness.com.au/8288-2/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there isn't any fat in the chest cavity except around the heart, but it's too small to actually press on the lungs. Fat people have difficulty breathing because the abdomen pushes on the chest cavity through the diaphragm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been looking at chest CTs for over 20 years now. You’re right that the main reason for under inflated lungs in the obese is abdominal fat keeping the diaphragm from descending. </p>
<p>You’re also right that the majority of the intrathoracic fat that obese people have is pericardial. </p>
<p>But there can be an awful lot of fat there, and elsewhere in the mediastinum, enough to reduce lung volume. Some people even have deposits of subpleural fat peripherally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And all the weight on the chest wall makes it harder to expand.  This is why a lot of morbidly obese people can't lie flat, they literally cannot fill their lungs due to the excess weight on top of them.  The lungs are being crushed from the bottom and the outside at the same time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obese people certainly tend to have lower lung capacity on average then people in a &quot;normal&quot; weight range of the same height.  (Height is typically the most strongly correlated metric to lung capacity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source for &quot;they are usually a lot stronger&quot;?   </p>
<p>This is bullshit statement. Obesity doesn't just mean that you carry a lot of extra fat and therefore is heavier. It comes with a whole lot of other debilitations that inhibit muscle growth, such as lower testosterone, insuline resistance and inflammation.</p></div>		</li>
