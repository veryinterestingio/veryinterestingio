			<div class="markdown"><p>My Dad worked for a Chicago engineering consulting company that pioneered many of the Geotechnical science around this. He did steel and concrete design and I worked IT there a few summers and they had a very cool soil composition testing lab, drill rig trucks for deep core samplings, nuclear ground sonar systems, remote monitoring dataloggers, etc etc. The old guys had parts in most of the downtown high-rises and their computers were all Matlab type stuff digesting piles of sample data. Never thought I'd be excited about dirt science but there I was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean nuclear density testing, this is different then sonar systems. Soil science is a cool subject actually, many people are just obvious to at all. Super cool you get to experience that first hand. No one argues with a soil engineer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No matter how swampy the soil is, you drill it far enough you will hit bed rock,</p>

<p>Not necessarily. Sometimes the bedrock is too deep too realistically hit, but that's also not an issue. You just need to drive piles deep enough that the soil friction can hold it in place.</p></div>		</li>
