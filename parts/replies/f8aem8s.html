			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer.  All the countries of Eastern Europe experienced a huge economic collapse in the early 1990s with the fall of communism in the region and the collapse of Russia as a trading partner.  As they integrated with the European community, the saw spectacular growth, which brought them almost -- but not quite -- up to the income levels of Western Europe in a decade's time.</p>
<p>Russia also recovered during this time, and saw similar growth, so it's not just about the West.  But it is about the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Most of the other answers in this thread are focusing on American economic changes, which were not nearly as important to East European economies as we'd like to think.</p>

<p>I live in Slovakia and the income is 1/3 to 1/2 that of developed Western European countries like Austria. Not almost, far lower. And Slovakia is much more developed than Serbia, Romania or Bulgaria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people also look at the numbers in percentages, which can be misleading.</p>
<p>If you're &quot;behind&quot;, then it is easier to grow 100 % than if you're a developed nation.</p>
<p>If you can keep the high percentage wise growth, then it is amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Corruption can kill economies. Russia has a huge potential but the endemic corruption stifles development. In Red Notice, Bill Browder documented how Putin and his cronies will stop at nothing to enrich themselves. Murder, theft, and zero respect for the rule of law has driven entrepreneurs like Browder out of Russia. </p>
<p>Without entrepreneurs, you canâ€™t develop the general economy.</p></div>		</li>
