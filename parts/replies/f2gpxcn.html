			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you are joking (maybe) but more generally, crying is a way we physically and mentally deal with stress. It’s not <em>only</em> about communicating to others. </p>
<p>I think of it as similar to a cat’s purr. While they do purr when they are happy and content, they also purr when they are sick or injured as a way of self-soothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Matches what he said perfectly actually. You are not content with your life, you inherently know that crying won't bring people out of the woodwork to help you, but your body does it anyways. So you cry when your alone in the car right before you clock in to do the thing you hate.</p></div>		</li>
