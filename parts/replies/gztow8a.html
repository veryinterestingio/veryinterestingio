			<div class="markdown"><p>We know there are animals and plants that reflect/see UV light(flowers/scorpions/bees/spiders off the top of my head). Are there any that actually emit it that we know of?</p>
<p>As for lower frequencies, this may be getting overly semantic, but aren't all warm blooded animals constantly(and uncontrollably) emitting in the infrared spectrum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah there are ultraviolet emitting biomolecules (though rare). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1011134416304262" target="_blank">Ultraviolet fluorescence of coelenteramide and coelenteramide-containing fluorescent proteins.</a></p>
<p>in the bigger picture, on the full electromagnetic spectrum, UV and IR are the boundaries of visible light. they're not very different from visible light. there's a huge amount of range outside that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome, thanks for the info on biomolecules.   </p>
<p>As for the rest of EM, yeah, as you said, above UV it's too high energy, and below it, what would be the point?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Even boiling a pot of water emits infrared light. OP acknowledged that in the post's title.</p>
<p>If animals used radio waves, we'd have likely uncovered some anomaly in the past century of broadcasting. If animals use microwaves, we'll soon uncover that anomaly with the rollout of 5G and later cellular generations as the wavelength decreases from radio further into microwave range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, while photons are broadcast much like permanent machine-gun fire in 3d. Anything that formerly was able to sense photons, non-visible spectrum, in organs or tissue with concentrated reactive metals or otherwise, would be blinded. It's an entirely reasonable assumption that use of transmitters that broadcast RF will be superseded by mandatory, government and public demands for coherent narrow RF transmissions, simply to reduce pollution. Without the background in science needed to demonstrate facts in this area, I'm wondering if there are papers, studies, popular science or evidence showing human-created photon emissions are greater than what would be naturally found, beyond pictures of earth at night from space, and the need for silent zones around radio telescopes studying space-origin particle/wave emissions. </p>
<p>Eg. how much greater is the RF from a modern city full of RF transmitters at specified frequencies, vs. natural sources? A scale with the logarithmic variation of natural (eg. solar, earth emissions) vs artificial (antennas) might be useful to get an idea of quite how much invisible particle/wave pollution there is from the hundred antennas on the equipment in my house...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>mmm a wall or a rock emits in the infrared spectrum as well, it's hardly intentional there. BUT I'd imagine changing your infrared spectrum could be a really useful defensive trait. Maybe one could decrease their emitted infrared to hide from a thermal sensing predator (like a snake), or increase it to appear threatening.</p>
<p>At least, that's what my brain stormed up in the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you are correct with tungsten being used as an X-ray emitter anode material, practically every heavy metal could emit in that range. You just need core atomic orbitals deep enough such that the relaxation upon ionization releases enough energy.</p>
<p>However, the mechanism of ionization is not really applicable to biomolecules because even if some biomolecular process would be able to generate the energy required this would cause ionization of the biomolecules which are rather fragile.</p>
<p>Regarding the lower frequencies (i.e., non-ionizing radiation) I have already written a reply to your other post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/nn9csx/if_some_animals_can_emit_light_can_they_emit/gzutbtq/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your excellent contributions here.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there could exist a carbon based pigment molecule containing a heavy metal, that could absorb/emit high energy x rays in a controlled manner. Seems you're saying this is not possible (with Earth's carbon based biomolecules) because the high energy x ray particles would destroy the bonds upon contact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is somewhat outside my expertise but I would say it wouldn't work that way.</p>
<p>The way an x-ray tube works is very similar to an old CRT (cathode ray tube) TV. A heated cathode filament emit electrons which are accelerated by high voltage towards an anode. Instead of being redirected and hitting a phosphor and emitting visible light as in a TV, the electrons in the beam are hitting the anode metal and by collision knock off a core electron (most importantly from the K shell in the Bohr model). This creates a highly energetic ion which immediately recombines with a surrounding electron of higher energy (which would be the molecular bonding electrons) to minimize the overall energy. Therefore any organic linker would be quickly deteriorated by side reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>X-ray absorption/emission is a deep core business, meaning only electronic states very strongly bound to nuclei can do that (i.e. heavier elements).</p>
<p>But most importantly, since the relevant states are very localized, they are atomic in nature rather than molecular/etc. This means chemistry has almost nothing to do with it. An X-ray will be absorbed by a tungsten atom floating in vacuum or a piece of tungsten metal, just the same.</p></div>		</li>
