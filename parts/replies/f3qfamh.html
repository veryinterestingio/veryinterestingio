			<div class="markdown"><p>On a typical day during foraging season a bee colony will loose well over a thousand bees a day.  Forager bees quite literally work themselves to death.  They get injured, they get exhausted, they get eaten by birds or spiders, and some of them get lost.  A queen lays 1,500 to 2,000 eggs a day; the colony doesn't notice the losses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may have just made a strange connection..</p>
<p>I have sentry carpenter bees (due to an old structure on the property) throughout my yard in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>I used to smoke and sit near where one was stationed...
I would always feel the bee get close to me and then felt something wet hit my hand/arm/wrist and when I would look, nothing was there! </p>
<p>Could they have been marking me to let other bees I was a safe person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No the bee does not have the capacity to spray you with any amount of liquid that would cause a wet feeling.</p>
<p>If it was bees touching you, they were probably just trying to tell you to move away.</p></div>		</li>
