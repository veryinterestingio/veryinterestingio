			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more eli5: scales have letters, and letters must be in order and you can't have two of the same letter in one scale, so . . . E-F#-G is part of a G major scale (or asc. mel. minor), but . . . E-Gb-G is not part of a scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also make a LOT of diference in being able to (for example) have the notes descend and ascend neatly in space, line, space, line, etc,. When descending, for example, instead of having C, B, Bb, A, Ab, G you would have C, A#, Anat, G#, Gnat.</p>
<p>It makes less 'modifications' necessary and thus easier to read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your example confused me, since you were selective in your usage of 'nat' for no explained reason. (ie why not Bnat, Bb.) Is # used for something other than sharp?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. It blew my mind when I found out it was simply so every note in a scale (A B C D E F G) could be represented (edit) regardless of the root chord. Using this thought also explains why a scale would use either sharps or flats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep this is the &quot;real&quot; reason. Each diatonic scale must have all 7 notes represented. Thus you can't have a scale with Ab and A# together but no G, so you use Gb instead of A#.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another answer is A sharp and B flat are only the same note in equal temperament. In just intonation (the real way notes are), they're different notes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, similarly to scales, also consider the way we  build chords and use scale degrees to describe chords. A major chord in root position is built with scale degrees 1 3 5. C major chord being C E G. But also a C Maj chord could enharmonically be spelled C F flat G, which now changes the spelling of the chord to 1, diminished 4, 5. The chord still sounds right, but isn’t spelled right. Using sharps and flats helps with uniformity and creates patterns that we then apply to all scales, chords, modes, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your &quot;chords&quot; comment also brings in the &quot;fingering&quot; required on certain brass instruments (and their alternates).  Depending on the key, note progressions become easier with the alternate fingering for a &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;sharp&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
