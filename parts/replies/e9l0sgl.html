			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, and also less ELI5 friendly, ethanol is miscible with water because its polar like water. In chemistry, like dissolves like. </p>
<p>The structure of ethanol is CH3CH2OH. The -OH portion is the part that makes it polar and the hydrocarbons are nonpolar. Ethanol, with two carbons, is short enough to be polar. As you make the hydrocarbon chain longer, or add more carbons, then the alcohol would become more and more insoluble with water. </p>
<p>Edit: Forgot the 2 in the formula for ethanol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a written way to explain the structure, a C with 3 Hs coming off, connected to another C with one H, connected to an OH.  As opposed to C2H50 which we have no idea where things go.  That and C2H5O is a completely different molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Structural formula versus elemental formula.</p>
<p>With the structural formula, it shows the bonds: H3C-CH2-OH.  This way, we know it has to be ethanol.</p>
<p>With the elemental formula (C2H6O), we don't know if it's dimethyl ether (H3C-O-CH3) or ethanol (H3C-CH2-OH).  This affects things like toxicity, polarity, and flammability, so you really don't want to mess that up.  It's more useful for organic chemistry, where you can have many elemental isomers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethanol is only about 80% as dense as water, so high alcohol content mixtures will have a tendency to linger on top.</p>
<p>Pouring them over ice only worsens this, as the melting ice releases more pure cold water that will sink to the bottom, and low temperatures slow down diffusion.</p>
<p>No ice will help, or just stir like hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>> Why does alcohol tend to settle on the top of mixed drinks quickly? </p>
<p>It doesn't, it's just poorly made.</p>
<p>> How can I encourage a more evenly mixed drink? </p>
<p>Depends on the drink. </p>
<p>For simple alcohol + mixer drinks, use this order: ice, alcohol, mixer. Don't be gentle when adding the mixer, you want it to combine.</p>
<p>For more advanced drinks, use a shaker.</p>
<p>For advanced drinks with carbonation, use a shaker, pour, then add the carbonation and give it a quick stir.</p></div>		</li>
