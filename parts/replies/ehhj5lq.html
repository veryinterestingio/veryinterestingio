			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep this.. any place there is commision there is room for profit haggling.  Hence why anytime there is an new industry that removes the haggle is met with stern resistance from the existing market.  Examples include Tesla trying to sell direct to customers removing car delearships and buying beds and furniture over the internet (though that is a scam in itself!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, fuck.  That's actually an exceptional source of misinformation and shitty behavior.  I have this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/81tcuf/can_we_please_stop_already/" target="_blank">reddit post that explains it</a> but there's far more out there that will say the same stuff if you want a second or third opinion.  It's unexpectedly shady as fuuuuuuuuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the real crux of OP's question though is why do we have the commission system. Sure, bargaining and sales behavior stems from commission, but I think OP's question is more like &quot;If the customer / buying experience would be better, and the prices would be lower, and the profit margins higher, why bother with this system at all.&quot; And the answer is a mix of power dynmaics, inertia, and money. Car dealerships have been around a long time, they pay a LOT of local taxes, and the weild a lot of power over the car companies. Sure, the buying experience would be better for everyone if dealderships were more like best buy or target, but if the car companies tried to do that the dealerships would use every crooked tactic in the book, including trying to use legislation, to stop it. For a source for all this look into what happened when Tesla started expanding into various states with their store model. Car dealerships are very powerful locally and lots of them tried to influence local and state governments to make direct sales illegal.</p></div>		</li>
