<p>Like NaOH + HCl -&gt; NaCl + H^(2)0. How many bonds are broken/created? It seems like 1 break between Na and OH, and one between H and Cl. The 2 creations for Na and CL joining, and H and OH joining. So would it be neither? Or am I misunderstanding.</p>
<p>A better one might be one I just looked up CH^(4) +2CO^(2) -&gt; CO^(2) + 2H^(2)0. I assume its exothermic as its burning natural gas, how does the breaking of bonds work in that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole bonds broken vs bonds made talk works a lot better for covalent compounds. For ionic displacement reactions you need to think about the stability of the crystal lattice if the reaction is happening in the solid state, or with the case of an acid base neutralisation, you need to consider the interactions between the water molecules and the acid/base and the salt. However, you can also ignore what I just said and just think that you will start with ions in a solution and end with a covalent compound being formed (water) as well as essentially the same ions in solution. Thats 1 covalent bond made for 0 broken, meaning that the reaction should be exothermic, which it is. This obviously isn't exactly physically true, but it tends to get the job done. </p>
<p>For the complete combustion of methane (assuming you meant 2O_2 in your reagents), you break 4 relatively weak C-H bonds around the carbon in methane, as well as a pair of O=O double bond. The reaction makes 2 C=O double bonds which are considerably stronger than the C-H, as well as a couple of pairs of O-H bonds, which are slightly stronger than C-H. From this you can tell that the reaction will be exothermic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The acid and base are already ionised in solution. The NaCl is ionised too. The neutralision enthalpy is pretty much the formation of water from H+ and OH-.  I rushed this during my lesson last week so feel free to add / correct me.</p>
<p>I haven't looked at the combustion one properly, but double bonds count double may work here. OH bonds count 1 1/2 may work too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc depending on how strong the acid or base is, not all of it will actually break and give off either the H or the OH</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help you to remember breaking bonds takes energy while forming bonds releases energy. So you have to include both in the calculation.</p></div>		</li>
