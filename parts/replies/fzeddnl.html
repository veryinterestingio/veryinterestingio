			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! That's an interesting question. The Ingenuity helicopter is designed to operate on Mars for about 30 days. We do not expect a dust storm to come up during its operation. Dust storms usually happen in the southern-hemisphere spring or summertime, and the mission will start in the northern-hemisphere spring. If a dust storm were to happen, the main effect is that the sky would become quite dark--it wouldn't be much more windy and the helicopter would not be pelted with sand. Those just happen in science fiction! The dust is so fine that it mostly just darkens the sky somewhat. Since Ingenuity is solar powered, it would mean that it would take a little longer for it to charge its batteries before the next flight. â€“RCW</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait dust storms arent like we all think? Now that js interesting. But i imagine the dust does make filtration, technology, cooling, and basically the use of anything with moving parts that much annoying to deal with the maintenance of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im nowhere near an expert, but as far as i know one of the bigger setbacks of mars is the dust. If the dust werent there we'd just have to figure out how to create an atmosphere. WITH the dust, even if we made an atmosphere, we would have to wear suits because the dust is so fine it would scratch the hell out of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the dust storms of earth do happen, but they don't happen like that on Mars. A 100km/h wind on Mars has the same force as a 10km/h wind on earth, or a brisk jog.</p></div>		</li>
