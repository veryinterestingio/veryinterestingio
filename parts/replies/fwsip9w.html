<p>The more objects are on screen the more power you need, especially if they're complex items or you're rendering atmosphere and lighting or something. This is why stuff the player interacts with regularly is generally higher quality than stuff they aren't expected to look at up close. That Spider-Man screencap with the pidgeon is a good example.</p>
<p>Making any redundancies to the overworld, which is essentially a very large and complex object everything has to interact with, can be complicated and horsepower consuming.</p></div>		</li>
