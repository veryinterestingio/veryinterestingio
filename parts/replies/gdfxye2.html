			<div class="markdown"><p>A car engine does suck, squeeze, bang, blow.<br />
It sucks in the air and fuel, squeezes it, makes it go bang and then blows it out the exhaust. It does this over and over really really fast and this makes your wheels turn in a good way.  </p>
<p>Water doesn't squeeze very much, so the engine does suck, then tries to squeeze and instead goes bang in the wrong way that lets all the inside parts fall out and your wheels stop turning permanently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically piston engines do each stage individually, i.e. suck in a portion of air &amp; fuel, then squeeze, then bang, then blow the exhaust out, then suck, and so on - all 4 are done in the same cylinder.  So like you said, water doesn't squeeze and the piston tries to squeeze water, and yes, bang in the wrong way.</p>
<p>However, a jet engine does all 4 at the same time, it's a continuous effect, going through the engine - the front does the suck, then the next bit does the squeeze, then the middle does the &quot;bang&quot; (burn) and the back bit does the blow.  So water just passes through unmolested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrolock is when you suck in more water than fits in the cylinder at compression. Water doesn't compress, air does. So, if you have too much water when the engine rotates and compresses you will break stuff</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You essentially reduce the compressible volume within the cylinder. Let's say that the cylinder is only half full of air, and half full of liquid. The pressure inside the cylinder at the end of the compression stroke will now be double.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a car engine, your piston goes up in a closed cylinder ti compress air. If you have water in this cylinder, things go bad because water is very hard to compress.</p>
<p>In a jet engine, compression is created by accelerating air, not by squeezing a volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turbine engines do squeeze the air.  The turbines force the air into a smaller area thus causes pressure to increase.  With the increase of molecules in a smaller area it causes the air to heat up, and this is before combustion.  Once the air is compressed it is ignited in a combustion chamber and energy is released.  A a gas turbine uses a few main principles.  Bernoulli’s principle on how a fluid is compressed and energy is gained, also when the fluid is released rapidly and energy is lost.  Also you have to think of a gas turbine as a blown up balloon rather than an air accelerator.  It’s not a prop, at least the turbine part isn’t, the fan is.  However under Newton’s action reaction laws a gas turbine specifically a turbojet engine operates more like letting a blown up balloon go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a car engine the motor pulls in air and fuel, then compresses that air and fuel, then ignites it (that's where the power comes from), then exhausts it.  During that compression stage, the piston chamber is completely sealed.  If you try to compress water in a sealed chamber it won't work because liquid water does not compress.  That causes the engine to stall.  Additionally, if there is too much water in the air intake, then only water gets in and no air.  Without air it's impossible to ignite the fuel, and again, the engine stalls.</p>
<p>In a jet, the combustion chamber is <em>not</em> sealed.  The air intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust all happen in one continuous &quot;jet&quot; of air.  Therefore, water won't cause the compression stage to fail, as the water can be squeezed out.  Additionally, the fan in front of the engine spins so fast that most of the water will simply be thrown to the outer edge of the engine cover and never enter the combustion chamber at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Engines boil the water to steam, which gets thrown out the exhaust just fine up to surprising quantities. Applies to piston and turbine engines.</p>
<p>With too much water however, you start to choke the engine in various ways. </p>
<p>With a piston engine, the problem happens when you have so much water that it isn't getting boiled, and when the piston goes to compress the fuel/air/water mix, it can't compress all the way, and basically runs into a wall of incompressible water. That whole thing about how at a certain speed, hitting water or concrete is the same? Yeah, that. But inside your engine. Things tend to break.</p>
<p>With a turbine engine, it will extinguish the combustion long before it starts to run into analogous issues.</p></div>		</li>
