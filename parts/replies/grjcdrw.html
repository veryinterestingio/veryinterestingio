<p>They both sound nice, but the symphony has a much richer, fuller, smoother sound. You can't pick out individual 2nd violinists e.g., they all blend into one big violin sound.</p>
<p>It's also louder. That was a big deal before electric amplification. You needed a lot of people playing to fill a big hall with sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. You’ll also notice that for every two brass instruments you need about ten strings or they just get absolutely blown out of the water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, if we had one gigantic violin ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting to see that the orchestra... all the violins are actually using a mute to dampen the sound. the chamber orchestra is not. this may also contribute to the timbre differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq7oGenbp2I" target="_blank">documentary</a> on YouTube about the making of 10CC's &quot;I'm Not in Love.&quot; They used tape loops to turn a few guys singing into the lush, deep, layered background vocals that the song is famous for.</p>
<p>I'll never forget the first time I attended a symphony performance in a rather small theater. It was a Beethoven performance, I think. There was one movement where the violin section played a series of rapid low notes in unison, and the way the sound from those violins &quot;popped&quot; was nothing I've heard before or since. It's not something that can be readily reproduced by a recording system (perhaps a full surround recording with expert engineering could capture this.) You have to pretty much be at a live performance to experience this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Even copying/pasting the same recording but moving one ever so slightly out of sync has the same effect&quot;</p>
<p>That's not entirely accurate though. It just makes it sound like chorus effect was applied to it. You need to actually track it twice to get that real 3D effect. It's not just timing, no matter how good of a player you are you will never hit the string with the exact same force, get down the notes to milliseconds, etc. The many tiny differences between the parts that are always there is what makes it work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll never forget the first &quot;studio&quot; recording I did with one of my high school band. We were actually able to record the instruments together live which was nice, and we always left a little bit at the end of the song (a minute or so) to go out on a jam. Once we finish, the guy goes to our guitarist &quot;Ok, just play it again so I can double track it&quot;. Guitarist looks at us and is like &quot;I have no idea what I played at the end that time&quot;. Ended up working out since the minor differences in that end part worked out pretty well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I once had to show someone that copying and pasting the same thing and panning hard left and right will only result in a mono sound.</p>
<p>It’s due to the minute differences in the waveforms when playing the same thing twice that creates the thick sound that results as no one can play something exactly the same on the second take - unless they’re some sort of robot perhaps</p></div>		</li>
