			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, a trumpet or French horn, or even (looks at user name) clarinet will be heard over all of the strings if they want to be. This is why winds are generally one to a part and strings are dozens.</p>
<p>But there's actually a second reason, and it's less intuitive. Orchestral performance is about perfection, but it's the fact that there's no way that 2 dozen violins can sound the same that make such a rich texture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ended up having to play concerts with a mute in... They couldn't just double the size if the other sections, and you can't have half of a tuba player.</p>
<p>Obviously, if I was better at playing tuba, i would likely be able to control my volume better. But i was in 7th grade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, this is on track. However, a couple of violins mic‚Äôd and eq‚Äôd on a stage will not sound <em>exactly</em> like 30 violins performing the same piece acoustically in a concert hall.</p>
<p>Imagine 30 people across the room speaking a phrase in unison, and then only a pair of people speaking the same phrase a few feet away from you. The sounds will have noticeably different characteristics in terms of perceived size, proximity &amp; depth.</p>
<p>Many factors come into play, particularly the small variations in timbre, intonation, timing &amp; phrasing between each musician‚Äôs performance.</p>
<p>In my experience, once you get up to about 6 to 8 channels deep, you start to actually replicate the sound of a large ensemble. Until then it‚Äôs pretty much ‚Äúa handful of violins but louder‚Äù</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to add to this: volume increases as the log of the number of instruments, not linearly.  Two violins make almost exactly the same level of sound as one violin.  You need ten violins to double the sound level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the volume level increases linearly‚Äîtwo are twice as loud as one. The <em>decibel</em> level is not linear, it's logarithmic. So 10 times as many players adds 10 to the decibel level (deci-bel=1/10th of a bel, so 10 decibels=1 bel, and an increase of one bel corresponds to the volume increasing by a factor of 10). </p>
<p>Why is the bel/decibel scale logarithmic? Because our ears are sensitive to an incredibly wide range of sound levels. Using a logarithmic scale makes the numbers more manageable, at the cost of the increased conceptual confusion evident here.</p></div>		</li>

It‚Äôs been a long time since I dropped out of my audio college, but we went over orchestra arranging to demonstrate how to mix a track, and if I recall correctly flutes and triangles will be heard over almost any instrument due to pitch and timbre.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And of course, the arranger will give the flutes an incredibly fast and difficult part that they will spend hours practicing with a metronome... Just to sound like some <a href="https://youtu.be/DJvniUzPoDU?t=20" target="_blank">indistinct bird song over the rest of the orchestra.</a> Seriously, fuck you John Adams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former percussionist, this is why I laughed when we played modern compositions with aux percussion bullshit like &quot;graze a silver dollar across a ride cymbal.&quot; Nobody's gonna hear that shit.</p>
<p>We were one drummer short for that awful piece, and our orchestra conductor who hated percussionists (is that redundant? I think that's redundant) clearly marked his score looking for excuses to berate me as I triaged 2-3 instruments at any given moment in that piece. &quot;RealNewsyMcNewsface, where are my finger cymbals!?&quot; I was behind the trumpets and the clarinets, and it was during a part where the orchestra was playing mF, if not F. Maybe the trumpeter directly in front of me would have heard those finger cymbals. Maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, adding more violins does more than just make them louder. The slight variations in pitch make them sound fuller and richer. The violin section quite literally becomes more than the sound of its individual parts. You can test this by using 14 MIDI violins all stacked on top of one another, or even a single violin part copied and pasted on itself 14 times. It will sound louder, but still won‚Äôt have the qualities of a full violin section, which depends on those tuning and timing variations.</p>
<p>A similar technique is used when multitracking vocals in a chorus of a song. If three vocals recorded by the same vocalist are panned left, center, and right, then tuned to exactly the same pitch and time, they won‚Äôt sound as full as if there were slight variations in their pitch and timing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has the effect of averaging out those variations in pitch as well as dynamics (volume in layman's terms) so you get a much more coherent sound. Even an expert string player will have tiny variations to how loud they are bowing a note, their timing of when they start and end a note, and the pitch they are playing the note. That can add character, just listen to any string quartet. But with a full section in an orchestra they all blend together to create a very pure (and as you said, rich) tone that would have been quite unlike anything else outside of choral music. And that was kind of the point, most composers of the day were composing religious music, and they wanted to get as close to divine and heavenly sounding music as they could.</p></div>		</li>
