			<div class="markdown"><p>I just kept thinking about my vertebrates anatomy course in college. It was interesting learning that many dinosaurs like the T-Rex and other raptors had similar bone structure to modern birds, that their bones were hollow and had the same tubes in them that modern birds have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s one of the reasons why they got so big, that and a mixture of things like overlapping bones and air sacs (respiratory and non-respiratory) meant that Sauropods could get so huge and still support their weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, we're they not super heavy? I mean obviously they would still have been quite heavy, but does that mean they weren't as plodding and ponderous as movies like to portray them? Don't bones make up a large portion of an animal's weight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite fact from the vertebrate anatomy course I took is that Dinosauria is split up into two groups, depending on the structure of the hip. There are the Saurischians (&quot;Lizard-Hipped&quot; dinosaurs) and Ornithischians (&quot;Bird-Hipped&quot; dinosaurs).</p>
<p>Modern day birds are Saurischians.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the reason their respiratory systems are so delicate, they transfer more oxygen with each breath than a mammal - but they also transfer far higher concentrations of toxins in the air. This is why fumes from Teflon cooking pans can kill pet birds.</p>
<p>Their air sacs also reach into the bones, so respiratory disease can spread into the abdominal cavity and become very difficult to treat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a common misconception, but since they only have 1 trachea, it's not possible that birds breathe in and out at the same time. But they are very efficient because they don't have the same sort of lungs that mammals do. They have a system of air sacs that allow air to flow in one continuous loop meaning that they can extract much more oxygen from the air per breath than mammals. In mammals we have a considerable amount of air in our lungs that is deoxygenated. It's just inefficient. In birds, the air just goes in a loop, so the air in their body is just fresher before it is depleted and breathed out.</p>

<p>edit: the misconception probably comes about because the air passes through the lungs a second time as it's exhaled</p>
