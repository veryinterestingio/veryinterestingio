			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, sort of but not as much as it seems. Remember humans are evolved to recognise humans, so the difference seems much more pronounced for us.</p>
<p>But we used to be a tribal species, so delegation of tasks may have guided our morphology, sending males out to hunt and females to guard the camp and raise the young (remember, human young take much longer to mature than most other mammals). Having males become more physically adapted to hunting makes sense. </p>
<p>Should also point out one of humans greatest traits, menopause. VERY few mammals have this trait, and humans are the only terrestrial ones. Having a female lose her reproductive ability may sound like a flaw, but it's one if the reasons we are so successful. This leaves females free to assist their tribes in rearing other children besides their own, which increases the chances of survival for the family as a whole by passing on help and knowledge.</p>
<p>There's also a similar theory behind the resilience of homosexuality with the &quot;gay uncle&quot; hypothesis. If being gay is genetic, it should die out since we don't breed. BUT, a gay family member in our history may have filled a similar roll to a grandparent, assisting the family which in turn passes on the genes of your kin, which would contain the gay gene. </p>
<p>But back to the main point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed it does. The more males fight over females, the more evolution will select for bigger, stronger males (compared to females). So we can infer from our dimorphism that throughout our history, male humans fought each other pretty frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably a bias because you're human, so you can more easily tell the differences. Other primates like orangutans and gorillas are much more dimorphic than humans.</p>
<p>Humans show relatively low sexual dimorphism compared to many animals.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting, because of what we know about now-extinct Cave Lions/ Steppe Lions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Males were not maned.</li>
<li>They lived in groups like modern lions</li>
</ol>
<p>We actually know both of these things partly thanks to cave paintings by early humans. Very interesting. </p>
<p>I suppose that could mean they had a less gender-stratified social structure?</p></div>		</li>
