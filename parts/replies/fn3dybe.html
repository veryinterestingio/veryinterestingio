			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that was because you were too lazy to actually get up and get it, so you twist, turn, and stretch in order to somehow manipulate your body into positions it shouldn't be.  At least, that is what happens to me :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I didn't do any fancy contortions or anything. The pain lasted a day or so, and the weird tightness in my back finally went away like a week ago. Stretching is important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a tv station and one day between shows the weatherman was teaching us how he does the weather and was letting us do our own forecasts</p>
<p>I clipped a mic on, but then had an issue where i needed to unmute it and instead of unclipping it I stretched to hit the button and pulled something in my shoulder. Hurt the rest of the night. I'm 23 but I felt like i was a 70 year old cuz I used to be so much more flexible that I could get away with shit like that and now my body is like &quot;bitch stop being lazy and unclip the mic&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go out to a farm/ranch during calving and watch the few day old calves get up and stretch. The ones that don't stretch a lot of the time aren't doing well. Young calves are fun to watch. Also, how about your cat when it get up after a nap. Sometimes we humans need to take a lesson from nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what yoga is all about! Many postures were arrived at by observing animals' bodies and movement. Some examples off the top of my head include downward facing dog, camel pose, sitting king pigeon, fish pose and a host of others.   </p>
<p>Yoga is old, there are mentions of it in the Rig Veda which is some 3,000 years old but likely it's even older than that so humans have been watching nature in the way you described for a very long time!</p></div>		</li>
