			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. Cooking doesn’t add calories but it does cause water to evaporate, making the food lighter, so the calories per gram are greater </p>
<p>On the other hand, cooking food generally<em>does</em> make many nutrients more available to your body and make it easier to digest. Some kinds of cooking can also pull caloried substances out of hard to get places (eg boiling bones for stock extracts calories and nutrients from the bone that you probably couldn’t access otherwise)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone said that they are probably worried about vegetables losing vitamins and minerals, which are not caloric. AFAIK (not particularly qualified) boiling vegetables may cause them lose nutrients in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not generally true. <em>Boiled</em> veggies can have fewer nutrients because some of the water-soluble ones end up in the &quot;broth&quot; you're discarding. </p>
<p>A tiny bit escapes with steam during other kinds of cooking, but generally speaking, the increased availability from the cooking more than offsets those tiny losses.</p>
<p>With most vegetables, though, the difference isn't so large in <em>any</em> of these cases that you should worry about it outside a survival/starvation situation. It's so easy to have access to a quantity of veg that your best strategy is to prepare them in the way that most encourages you to eat more veg. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it isn't. Cook8ng food deaminates proteins and gelatinizes starches and allows your body to break bonds it couldn't before and thereby scavange more calories. The question may be worded poorly but there is more to it than energy/mass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also one of the downsides of dehydrating food, it becomes harder to &quot;eyeball&quot; the amount of calories you're intaking when significant amounts of the water is removed. This is especially significant with fruit, because while fresh fruit has a good amount of sugar, it also has a lot of water. Whereas dried fruit still has all the sugar, nutrients, and calories of the original piece of fruit, while being significantly less filling. Some dried fruit is actually more calorie dense than even something like a candy bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The advantages of fruit and vegetables for weight management is high water and fibre content relative to energy. Removing the water negates much of the satiating effects and concentrates the sugar!</p></div>		</li>
