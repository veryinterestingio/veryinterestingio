			<div class="markdown"><p>First, a bit of clarification: the initial images of M87* were produced from a series of single-night observations carried out in April 2017 over the course of about one week.  That is, the individual observations each lasted several hours over the course of a single night, and the whole observing campaign lasted about a week (i.e., the observations themselves did not take months).  What took many months was all of the effort that came after the observations themselves: shipping all of the data from each of the telescopes to the central correlation centers, calibrating the data, carrying out the downstream analyses, and writing up the results.  The resulting effective aperture has a size approximately equal to the Earth’s diameter.  We are unfortunately (for a number of technical reasons) not able to combine observations taken at different times from many points in the Earth’s orbit to simulate an even larger telescope; to do that, we would need to physically put telescopes in space (which is an idea that many folks want to pursue!) and observe simultaneously with the ground and space telescopes.  On the point of imaging in hours: we already do this!  That’s what each of the M87* images represents.  Imaging on timescales of minutes or less is a much more difficult task and is one of the primary goals of the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), which will contain many more individual dishes to help fill out the aperture.  The ngEHT anticipates being able resolve (in time) the accretion flow near Sgr A* -- the black hole in the center of the Milky Way galaxy -- to enable exactly the sorts of disk dynamics studies that you mention.<br />
