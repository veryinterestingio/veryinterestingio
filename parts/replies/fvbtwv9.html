			<div class="markdown"><p>The Persians often employed mercenary forces to supplement their own troops. The Persian Army also wasn't as Standardized as say Imperial Rome. Each Satrap in the Empire was expected to rally however many men the King told them, and meet the King at a specified location. So each satrap brought troops from the region they managed, creating regional diversity in the army.</p>
<p>But typically no, there wasn't separate armors worn by the same person. Persia primarily relied on numbers, speed, and tactics to win. And if there was an enemy they couldn't beat on the battlefield the Persians would smack them with their wallet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's the account of Robert's march toward Jaffa in the Third Crusade where Saladin's forces peppered the crusading troops with arrows and they were described as looking like pin cushions, but still protected from the volleys. That was with mail, vs large plate armor. Here's an academic paper on the subject. </p>
