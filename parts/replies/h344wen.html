			<div class="markdown"><p>The mix used for very high pressure breathing gas is called heliox. It is a hypoxix mix of oxygen and helium.</p>
<p>The lower partial pressure of oxygen makes it safer.</p>
<p>Replacing nitrogen with helium removes the risk of nitrogen narcosis, but does make your voice sound different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard you’re not supposed to inhale helium because of the risk of asphyxiation due to displaced oxygen.  But could you produce a heliox mixture for 1 atm that would provide the same entertainment value without the risk?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It needs to be at a high pressure to push the water out of the way. Filling with helium is good because helium doesn't react easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a scene in the movie Sphere where they receive helium-enriched air as their submarine is diving to the research station. But their voices only temporarily go high-pitched from the helium and are sounding back to normal within minutes. Was that just nonsensical or does the helium only need to be used temporarily?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass concentration is defined as kilograms per cubic meter. If the volume stays constant like in a space station, you can have less pressure, which means less stuff, but the concentration is can still be low, even if the fluid is homogenous. Concentration is not a percentage, but how much stuff is in given volume.</p></div>		</li>
