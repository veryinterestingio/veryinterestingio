			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think this phenomenon is actually under represented in these comments. Technology is still <em>constantly</em> advancing, but the journalism about it is specifically designed to drive traffic, not to report on the actual progress.</p>
<p>This means that what we hear about is usually the most sensational things possible and at the earliest stage of development possible to take advantage of viral fads.</p>
<p>By the time it has gone through the countless trials of rigorous science it is old news, and so it quietly just becomes another treatment option. (Assuming it is viable of course.)</p>
<p>If you look at cancer survival rates over the last 30 years it is <em>very</em> obvious that cancer treatments are getting much better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s absolutely incredible, so happy your relative is cancer free! My mom died of cancer and couldn’t participate in any trials because she had a pacemaker, I can’t help but wonder if a trial treatment could have helped her. Stories like yours gives me hope for a future where cancer doesn’t have to be a death sentence as it so often is.</p></div>		</li>
