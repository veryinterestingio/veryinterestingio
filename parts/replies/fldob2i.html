			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off of this, the fact that particles are quantized excitations is one fundamental consequence of the quantum theory. </p>
<p>To address OP's overarching question, the perturbation theory viewpoint of QFT is that you can look at interactions between particles as determined by the classical theory (tree level) with quantum corrections (loop diagrams). So, to some extent, quantum fields are a lot like classical fields, with some corrections. That's why the classical theory of electromagnetism works so well for almost all day-to-day purposes, you need to make very precise measurements to realize that light is actually quantized. Of course, once you start going down the QFT rabbit hole, you find a lot more divergences (no pun intended) from the classical theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They have some energy and momentum, they can interact with each other – they are particles!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that they don't do that if the equations are linear. You can for example simulate the classical Klein-Gordon field and see how two &quot;bumps&quot; will simply travel past each other if there's no quadratic mass term. If there's a mass term, <em>then</em> they will interact. This doesn't even require quantization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, in linear toy models of non-interacting particles, they won't interact. But all even remotely realistic models are non-linear, so their particles do interact.</p>
<p>By the way, a mass term is not what is needed to make particles interact, a mass term gives them mass, hence the name. For a single real scalar field, you need e.g. a quartic interaction to make the particles interact.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, don't photons basically not interact in first approximation? Sure, they actually <em>do</em> interact - both through gravitation, and through their coupling to other fields and the creation of e.g. virtual electron-positron pairs - but for low energies, that's a pretty good approximation.</p></div>		</li>
