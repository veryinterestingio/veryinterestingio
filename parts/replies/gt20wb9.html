			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that sounds so much easier than it was in the 1970s.</p>
<p>I helped my Dad survey a grade schools playground when I was about 10. He had a scope on a tripod. The scope also had a compass and a level.</p>
<p>He'd send me out with a tape measure (big long one) and a tall, graduated stick. Probably 8 feet long.</p>
<p>I'd walk away from him along a cardinal direction holding the end of the tape and the stick until it stopped at the distance Dad wanted. He'd direct me right or left with hand signals until I was exactly the right vector. Then I'd hold the stick perfectly plumb until he could could center the scope on a target on the stick. He then wrote down the angles etc.</p>
<p>I would mark the spot with a little flag and then I'd move the same distance 90 degrees off that measure. Repeat, over and over over.</p>
<p>But, when it was done, he could plot out the slopes and contours of the land. It was old school even by 1979s standards, I think. </p>
<p>But it was cool, and made me want two learn the math he used.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now the surveyors i work with use GPS. Basic GPS isnt precise but if you set up your own extra transmitter nearby, which the developer has done because of the number of sites, then it becomes incredibly accurate.</p>
<p>So the surveyors go around marking points everywhere pre construction and the system applies them to the drawings. Then cut and fill is determined by us in office. Finally the earthmovers go out. All their equipment is tied to gps too, the gps is even lowering and raising the blade slightly to get the necessary grades based on our drawings.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe for the big boys, but if you're setting the level for a pole barn in podunk county, you're doing it with a transit and a stick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dumpy levels are still used where I work, it's useful for very rough survey and figuring out fall directions, or where you can't use GPS or a total station such as under a tree on a very bright day, which happens more than you'd think</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had our runway surveyed.  5000 ft by 150.  The rod man hit 5 points across every 20 feet. It took 3 days as the runway while quiet was still in use.  </p>
<p>We have a local operator who has been running a grader for about 150 years (old as the hills and twice as dusty as the saying goes).<br />
He got to try out a new computerized gps guided grader simulator that a company was hawking. (Cat, I think).
He scored the highest in North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even an afternoon and with an accuracy to a tenth of a foot. A tenth is the standard that RTK GPS receiver is rated to. </p>
<p>I had a local six acre construction site that I'd fly once a week that took 15 minutes to capture and about 25 minutes for the computer to process. The local engineer sent crews out to shoot a topo and it took them half a day. When compared the drone matched near every point they took within a half a tenth. Of course they missed a lot of subtle swales in the topo that we picked up. About 400 cubic yards of difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used one years ago while I was studying Archaeology at University. We would set it up &amp; then use it to take measurements of everything; the corners of the trenches, the position of interesting finds, even the top of the spoil heap, so we could see exactly how high it was getting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here is a map for the area around Austin Texas for example.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're typically marked on maps, in part because they used to be an important tool for mapmakers. People went surveying along and placing such markers at known positions so they could measure back to them, some trig point markers are quite old.</p></div>		</li>
