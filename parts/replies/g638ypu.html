			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as giftedness (and more generally, the broad range of musical ability) within humans, there are both genetic and environmental components to musicality! There are really interesting studies in twins that begin to disentangle these effects (because in twin studies we are able to compare identical and non-identical twins in order to estimate heritability and environment). See for example work by Miriam Mosing and Fredrik Ullen. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113874" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113874" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113874</a></a><br />
Their study and several others show that musical ability is moderately correlated with auditory perception ability, general cognitive skills, and language skills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;biotyping&quot;, if you are referring to phylogenetic or other cross-species work, this is a nascent area where scientists are comparing vocalizations and sensori-motor coordination patterns across species to try better understand to what degree music evolved as a &quot;special&quot; trait in humans and what components of musicality are present in other species (including some songbirds and seals)! See for example <a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nyas.14166" target="_blank"><a href="https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nyas.14166" target="_blank">https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nyas.14166</a></a></p></div>		</li>
