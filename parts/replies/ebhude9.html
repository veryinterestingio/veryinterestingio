			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, I was actually incorrect on that front! Did some major editing in my comment - in short, relying on memory, got my holes confused; fish gills became our pharyngeal arches, which give rise to our jaw and <em>ear</em> (that was the hole I was thinking of!).</p>
<p>So yup, our ear hole was once a gill opening, which is why our auditory cavities still remain connected to our respiratory/digestive tract via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustachian_tube" target="_blank">eustachian tube</a> and why swallowing helps to equalise pressure in our ears when we're on aeroplanes or SCUBA diving. Our olfactory bulb has always been connected to a 'nostril' of sorts; just that unconnected fish nares have since joined up internally with our pharynx.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually really cool. I always wondered about the ear/air connection. </p>
<p>Do we know what caused the mammalian breathing system to form and the nose to attach to the breathing system?  If if we don’t know what caused it at least when and how it happened?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is somewhat unrelated, but it might help to understand how this functions.</p>
<p>I have a congenital Eustachian tube defect, and often (frequently after having caffeine, some foods, exertion or allergies) my ears - especially the right side - will pop every time I swallow.  From what I’ve been told, though I have not been able to see a specialist who is well-versed in this even among the ENTs I’ve seen, this is due to my Eustachian tube being more of an oval than circular in lengthwise profile, and therefore when I swallow the negative pressure in my mouth and throat cause the tube to collapse and become “stuck” somehow.  I’ll admit I do not understand it and if anyone does and can explain it to me, I would be eternally grateful.  It is <em>maddening</em> and doing things like diving or flying, or even going for a run, which I used to love to do, become completely unbearable, because I have to constantly be un-popping my ears.  I’ve also sometimes had extremely sharp, shooting pains in the side of my head and even in my sinuses related to this, I believe.  I am sometimes able to get relief using Benadryl and ear drops, but not always.  I’ve developed something of a reflex to just inhale sharply through my nose which un-pops the ear, though it always re-pops when I swallow again.  The only thing that will prevent this re-popping is to use a finger, while holding my nose and swallowing, to plug my ear and then kind of “plunge” it, to force it to pop in and out (or open and closed, or positive and negative pressure) a bunch of times.  That takes care of it for a few minutes at best.</p>
<p>The only suggestion for a permanent solution was a surgery that <em>might</em> have fixed the problem, but also opened me up to some pretty extreme risks.  After all, it’s surgery on my head, in places where an infection (if one developed) would be close to my brain and have basically an open door to migrate there.  Add this to a history of ear infections and the fact that the popping isn’t exactly anything more than a kind of minor inconvenience and it just wasn’t worth the risk.</p>
<p>However, it has in the past caused people to think that I’m a cokehead, because when this is happening I’ll often be unconsciously sniffing a lot.  Remember during the debates in 2016, how Trump was sniffing a lot?  It’s kind of like that.  Frankly I don’t blame people for making this assumption, it’s more reasonable than coming to the correct conclusion.  I mean, we never hear of the plights of people with deformed Eustachian tubes, after all.  I kind of doubt most people know where they are and what they do, much less what can happen if they malfunction.</p>
<p>So yeah:  The plumbing in our heads is vast and complex, and any dysfunction therein can have pretty extensive negative ramifications.  Your ears, nose, and throat are all connected and blockages in these connections is problematic to say the least.</p>
<p>Also, if you have any kind of infection in your head make sure to get it taken care of quickly, because if it spreads it can be very serious.</p>
<p>If anything I’ve said here is incorrect, please correct me because it could have significant positive impact on my quality of life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I remember correctly, something similar still happens during the development of the human embryo, doesn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! One nice example of 'ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny'. Incidentally, because this second pair retraces their way from the front of the face back into the pharynx during human embryo development, occasionally they don't migrate n' fuse properly, hence why some babies are born with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleft_lip_and_cleft_palate#Cleft_palate" target="_blank">cleft palates</a> (slightly NSFW / medical imagery)</p></div>		</li>
