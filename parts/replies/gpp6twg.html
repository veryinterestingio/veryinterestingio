			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to that...</p>
<p>The DJ has to hear and keep track of two songs at once in an effort to synchronize them. Usually the mix everyone else hears is being played near the DJ through loud &quot;monitor&quot; speakers, and the headphones contain the song the DJ is preparing to bring in next, perhaps partially combined with the sound that's going to the monitors.</p>
<p>The DJ often needs to make adjustments to be able to hear one song or the other better when trying to keep them in sync. Sometimes it gets hard to tell which song is which. Pressing on the headphones, taking them off, putting them all the way on, or having them only on one ear helps the DJ distinguish and keep track of everything. Also, adjusting the headphones is a natural reflex for many DJs, easier than messing with the mixer's controls.</p>
<p>Along those same lines, there's a &quot;quality&quot; to the sound in the headphones that makes it distinct from the sound of the monitors &amp; echoing mains. Having this contrast from ear to ear can help the DJ keep track of which sounds in the music belong to which song.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It always surprised me why DJs wouldn't just use headphones that accept separate inputs to each earcup.  Right ear = what's coming up and Left ear = what's playing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some DJ mixers (and also DJ software, for when that's being used) make this an option available.</p>
<p>But, because most DJing is done by playing on the venue's existing equipment, and that equipment might not be able to set up that way, professional DJs will generally work in &quot;very standard&quot; ways to reduce surprises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be a feature of the mixer rather than the headphones. It's called &quot;split cue&quot; and is only on expensive gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/4m7fDlzKK10" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/4m7fDlzKK10</a></p>
<p>Some people rig up DIY versions via special cables. I've never tried it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a former small time DJ but have dabbled with some programs for mixing, there are applications that will present a visual representation of the beats as they come in and inform the user of the BPM, it probably takes skill under pressure but not nearly as complicated as mixing vinyls used to be I’m sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to find the right time to transition from one track to the next one. Sure you have the BPMs aligned, but if you suddenly jump from track to track without a smooth transition it's not going to sound really good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the difference between a mediocre DJ and a good one. I had always assumed that DJs basically run up a play list and stick their iPod in (which some DJs pretty much did at some of the nightclubs I went to). Being able to adapt on the fly is the skill that matters.</p></div>		</li>
