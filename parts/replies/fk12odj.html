			<div class="markdown"><p>You should also know that the amout of light you recieve from an object dosn't just depend on the temperature of the object. Some materials give off more light at the right wavelength for the detector some less, even if they are the same temperature. Typically if you are interested in actual temperatures you need to calibarate your camera for the particular material your are interested in. This light (IR) is also not magic, it can be reflected just like any other light so a shiny surface can give very wrong values.</p></div>		</li>
