<p>When they processed and cleaned the signal data they were left with a few dozen data points. Not a blurry image, but a few pixels of a blurry image.</p>
<p>They fed these pixels to a model that spit out the final image that was published. What we see is an artificial reconstruction, it is a big stretch to call it a photo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, it's a <em>real</em> reconstruction. Like an everyday photo with heavy post-production reconstruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like starting with a clean image, setting a dozen pixels to random colors, applying hundreds of filters and effects to it, and calling the final result a photo, because... </p>
<p>Because it looks like what we imagine a real photo of the subject would look like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your concepts of &quot;real&quot; and &quot;photo&quot; are naive. It's reconstructions, all the way down, for everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely the correct answer. There are a few pixels in the image that are directly imaged but the whole image is a generated image from an AI that is &quot;likely&quot; to be what the real thing would look like and fits with the known pixels.   </p>
<p>I think it would be fair to say it is an AI artists impression based on very limited data. It most certainly is not a direct image of a black whole as has been widely reported.</p></div>		</li>
