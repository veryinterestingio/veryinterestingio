And once they do, <del>Clarkson</del> is like: just note that the tires will only hold for roughly 45min at this speed. But don't  worry, the tank is only good for another 15.</p>
<p>Edit: May drove it</p>
<p>Edit2: I got fact checked and the tires will only hold for 15(!) minutes, and the tank for 12.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Ferrari f40 and the Porsche 959 are competitive HyperCars just like the 918 and the laferrari are now. </p>
<p>Ferrari cracked 200mph first on the spec sheet but who knows which car actually could do it first. Porsche historically underrated their cars so that performance is greater than advertised. Ferrari fudges their numbers or use an average. It’s very possible the Ferrari couldn’t always break 200 when the Porsche could.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I did a report on 80s cars once. It was long a go but I’m remembering it in this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only posting results from a German Magazine called Auto Motor und Sport, as they seem to be the only outlet to have tested all 3 contenders for the first car to hit 200 mph. </p>
<p>1986 Porsche 959 Sport - 197 mph measured</p>
<p>1987 Ferrari F40 - 201 mph claimed by Ferrari, 199 mph measured</p>
<p>1988 Porsche 959S - 211 mph measured</p>
<p>The caveat is that only 29 examples of the 959S were ever built, which by many standards means it does not count as a production car.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT1:</strong> u/Nya7 points out that the Ruf CTR Yellowbird reached 213 mph in 1988, which makes it faster than the 959S. I initially left it out initially because it is a modified Porsche and not something directly from the OEM, but it is certainly worth mentioning. Just like the 959S, only 29 units were ever produced. </p>
<p>If you exclude the 959S, the next car that <em>may</em> have broken the 200 mph barrier is the Lamborghini Diablo in 1992 with a claimed top speed of 202 mph, but I can't seem to find any independent outlet that actually tested its top speed.</p>
<p>The Bugatti EB110 GT is the first car measured above 200 mph, released in 1991 as outlined below in my edit below. </p>
<p>The <del>first</del> second car actually verified to reach over 200 mph, going both directions, is the McLaren F1 in 1993, at 221 mph without any modifications. With the rev limiter removed, it reached 240 as measured by Car &amp; Driver magazine. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> u/PeteRit pointed out that the Bugatti EB110 GT beat McLaren to the punch in March 1993 at 210 mph measured. Impressively, the EB110 SS was measured at 218 mph in 1996, but that exact car entered production in 1992, which safely secures the Italian-made Bugatti as the first production car measured above 200 mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the next 200mph car verified and tested would of been the Bugatti EB110 in 1991. All major test magazines got the car over 200 and even up to 220mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your definition of &quot;production&quot;. The 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona (carbureted 440 cid) was hitting something like 212 in multiple NASCAR races (Taladega, Daytona, etc). Didn't last long though. In 1970 Nascar banned engines over 305 cid in winged cars, and that was pretty much the end of factory-sponsored racing in the US, which led to the decline of muscle cars on the street.</p>
<p>Within 5 years, smog control laws completely destroyed the high performance market for a couple of decades until computer controlled fuel and ignition systems took over.</p>
<p>From what I've read over the years, the primitive 1960s factory drum brakes were only barely functional at 160mph. At 200+, the car essentially had no brakes at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long ago I drove a lot of expensive cars and the occasional performance antique.  Many of the tips and tricks the oldsters gave me were about scrubbing speed, like double-clutching, and the similar idea of holding on to a lot of momentum by not using the brakes.  It never happened to me, but the fear of brake-fade was so real in the people who taught me that it still influences my driving habits today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Buddy Baker drove the Dodge Daytona that was the first NASCAR to go over 200 mph on the track. He did it first at Talladega on March 24th 1970.</p>
<p>Those Daytonas and Plymouth Superbirds were something else. Worth huge money nowadays.</p></div>		</li>
