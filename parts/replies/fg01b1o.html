			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more due to motor unit size with additional shaking due to muscle activation delays related to fatigue and difficulty resupplying ATP. The brain’s primary motor cortex generally gives the same high level command, but biological dynamics of fatiguing muscle produce the wobble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, muscle cells don't fire individually, but in groups called muscle units, and they vary in size depending on how delicate the operations of the specific muscle are. In the legs they might have thousands of muscle fibers per motor units, while in the fingers it can be just a couple dozen.</p>
<p>I left that part out because it seems like it was an unnecessary complication. It is still ultimately about the number of muscle cells firing, it is just that they fire in specific groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your reply was good overall. I don’t mean to be pedantic, but without mentioning motor unit size, heavier weights might actually cause smoother lifts due to the law of large numbers and averaging effects. It’s like having a parallel capacitor in a circuit where the ripple voltage is determined by the frequency and amplitude of the voltage pulses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not a biologist, but this is almost certainly wrong.  Yes, muscle cells are elongated, but they aren't the length of the entire muscle.  The cells link together to form the muscle tissue.  It's more like a chain-link fence that can stretch very far in one direction.  As the muscle tissue stretches in one direction, the cells become more elongated and closer together.  As the muscle contracts, the cells get shorter and wider, causing the muscle to bulge (like how flexing your bicep looks better when your elbow is bent).</p></div>		</li>
