			<div class="markdown"><p>Hogwarts is a school for wizards.  There's four houses/dorms, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.  Your first day there a magic Sorting Hat places you into one of said houses, based on who you are as a person.  Gryffindors are brave, Ravenclaws are smart, etc.</p>
<p>Further knowledge on Harry Potter isn't necessary to understand the rest of the top comment.  You can replace the references with Zodiac signs and the message will come across the same.</p></div>		</li>
