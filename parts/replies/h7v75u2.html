			<div class="markdown"><p>If your card has the V or MC logo, you get all the fraud protections whether credit or debit. Your bank wants you to use credit because they make more interchange fees under credit rather than debit transactions. Source: 36 years in banking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fraud protection systems themselves are identical, but what happens to the money is very different.</p>
<p>When you pay by credit the money gets transferred from the creditor (the bank) to the business, and then you pay the creditor later, while when you pay by debit the money gets transferred from YOU to the business.</p>
<p>What this means in case of fraud is that if someone fraudulently spends $50 on your debit card, YOU are short $50 until the fraud gets cleared up - which might be a problem if you need to pay for something before that happens.</p>
<p>BUT you if you pay in credit the BANK is short $50 until the fraud gets cleared up, which the bank doesn't like but doesn't affect you. So basically the credit creates a security layer between your money and the actual expenses, so you don't ever actually lose access to that money during the investigation process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are differences in the legally required thresholds in debit vs credit cards, but I've never even come across a bank that didn't actually have $0 liability for anything reported in a reasonable time period. If a bank is going to make you pay a penny for fraud then get a different bank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is availability of your cash. With Debit fraud, often you lose all the money until the fraud case is closed, which can be a month or so. With credit, you don’t lose the cash in your account while it is resolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still more difficult to get your money back with a debit card than a credit card since with a debit your money is already gone and you need to get it returned while with a credit card you only incur a fraudulent debt that can be cancelled. It is more work for the bank to get your money back with debit and thus more time for you on the phone with customer service.</p>
<p>Some stores offer a discount with debit or cash since the processing is cheaper. Most don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a consumer there's no difference in liability, unless you admit to telling someone your PIN and they use it.</p>
<p>For the bank/vendor whoever offers the least secure method of transacting is on the hook for fraudulent charges. If you have a chip+PIN card and the vendor only takes swipes, than they're holding the bag for a fraudulent charge. If your bank only has swipe cards, and the vendor accepts chip+PIN, the bank is responsible for the charges. Once you get up to chip+PIN on both sides the bank is repsonsible for fraud. In any case, they're responsible for doing the legwork of getting your money back, whoever's money that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There at least used to be a dollar threshold at which it swapped which one was better for the store, financially. If I'm frequenting a small business I sometimes ask the cashier which they prefer I use, because I can never remember what that threshold is and which is better above and below it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone's deleted comment backed up my memory and gave me enough keywords that I was able to google to find a <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/cost-of-debit-card-transactions/" target="_blank">series</a> <a href="https://www.cardfellow.com/blog/debit-card-transaction-fees/" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://www.cardfellow.com/blog/average-fees-for-credit-card-processing/" target="_blank">articles</a> about debit card fees, which aren't actually flat rates once you include interchange and processing fees. I don't recognize any of the sources (many more than the ones I linked above) and at least some of them look like they're trying to sell their processing services to small businesses, but they are consistent enough that I believe they're probably correct. </p>
<p>I am definitely not following all of the numbers this late at night, but it looks like on average PIN debit <strong>is</strong> cheaper, but there's a distinct change in rates at $15, and actual effective rates vary between the merchant category, average sales (ticket) amount, the network/processor they're contracted with, and even (this is a big one) whether the bank the debit card is issued by is large enough to fall under the Durbin amendment, which caps interchange fees. So someone with a card from a local credit union might end up costing a merchant three times what a card from Bank of America or Wells Fargo does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Debit is always cheaper.
Credit card is extremely expensive, regardless of authorisation method.</p>
<p>And if you are in some parts of Europe, paying with an 'EC-Card' and signing is usually the only option that's completely free.</p>
<p>Pin is still much cheaper than credit though.</p>
<p>This is signing the contract for a pharmacy. For any regulars with large purchases, I'd always manually override the terminal so it would save the business 10+ Euros.</p></div>		</li>
