			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Example: We had an old microwave that worked fine. When my son switched over to a laptop (in 2011) and came home from college, he complained that his laptop and the wifi signal (can't remember which or if both) had big issues when the microwave was in use. We soon got another microwave and haven't had any issues since. (Microwave-wise)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was doing a WiFi scan for interference the other day and my 5GHz router was the only device using 5Ghz frequencies.</p>
<p>There was over 20 2.4 GHz networks, and I'm in the suburbs.</p></div>		</li>
