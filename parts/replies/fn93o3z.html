			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious if there's something about the design of movies, games and surfing the internet that better encourage dopamine. It is also raises the question of why we find studying less interesting than entertainment. How much of it has to do with the design of entertainment vs academics and how much of it has to do with the designation of work vs play. For example, if video games were made mandatory and studying optional, how would that change our respective interests?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely! These things are designed with the goal of being entertaining.  Academic texts instead have the goal of conveying information clearly and effectively.  So of course movies are better at holding your attention because it's in line with their main. Textbooks can try to be entertaining but they can only go so far with it because they have a separate primary goal they can't compromise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I found curious about studying literature in high school. Most high school texts we were handed were originally written for the purpose of entertaining and yet, people found the class a chore, including myself at points. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact that we had to go into great detail, or the fact that the style of writing isn't suited to today's entertainment diet? I don't know. Just something I found interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah sorta but the brain has evolved to look for feedback. This is a point that's commonly overlooked when comparing modern entertainment with something like education. It's not like the brain wants hours and hours of low stimulus input. I also contend it's not necessarily &quot;gratification&quot; that people demand maybe more than they used to, but rather they want to waste less time on any particular endeavour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's a direct opposite to dopamine e.g. sad and happy. Dopamine is known as your 'happy' hormone, as far as I know there isn't a specific 'sad' hormone. I think the closest example to that would be a lack of serotonin which is linked to making you feel down and depressed.</p></div>		</li>
