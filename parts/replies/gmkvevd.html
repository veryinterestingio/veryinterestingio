			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to track what’s happening when it comes to COVID nationwide, I recommend to keep an eye on the CDC COVID Tracker:</p>
<p><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home</a></p>
<p>If you are interested in tracking vaccine distribution and administration nationwide, or if you are interested in drilling down by state, here’s the direct link to the CDC website that gets updated daily:</p>
<p><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations" target="_blank">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations</a></p>
<p>You can track how many doses have been delivered, how many have been administered, how many people have received 1st doses and how many people have received 1st and 2nd doses. --BC</p></div>		</li>
