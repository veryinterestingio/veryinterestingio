			<div class="markdown"><p>Curvature of the earth (circumference ≈25k miles) is insignificant compared to the 2-1/2 miles range of a rifle bullet. For the purposes of maths, you can assume a flat earth in this scenario.</p>
<p>Edit: I couldn’t find an easy formula to demonstrate the difference in height from a line tangent to the earth to 2.5 miles out. So I just drew the earth in AutoCAD and added some lines. The difference in height is about 4.125 feet, just slightly more than what I thought would be insignificant. But it would be much more difficult to align your rifle perfectly straight. A fraction of a degree would have implications greater than 4 feet over 2 miles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The critical point is that all the force is transferred in the horizontal axis. None in the vertical direction, gravity affects the vertical all the same in both projectiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny. They talk about 39 milliseconds like it's nothing, but I heard that and my thought was &quot;yeah, that's fairly significant&quot;. They talk about movies being 24 fps, but I was already thinking &quot;that's over 2 frames at 60 fps, I can tell when input is delayed 2 frames, or if two actions take place 2 frames apart&quot;.</p>
<p>To look at it another way, it looks like their setup was to drop the bullet from about 1m high (actually it looks to be a little bit lower, but I'll work with 1m). Then it would take 452ms for the dropped bullet to reach the ground, ignoring air resistance. That means that the fire bullet took 8.6% longer to hit the ground. I consider that &quot;significant&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course this all assumes that their setup was even accurate enough to measure with this precision to begin with. Was the gun perfectly level? Did they account for the time it takes the bullet to leave the barrel (timing shouldn't start until the bullet has left the barrel)? But if their setup wasn't accurate enough for this, I would just consider a null result (neither confirmed nor denied).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Mythbusters, they tend to gloss over some details. Like, What is the length of their range? What is their exact trigger point? Did they compensate for the cable length? How many times did they repeat the experiment? (They imply they only tried this once, which is just a bad eway of doing science)</p>
<p>And then to add onto that, they'll make a conclusion that has a fundamental flaw in it. (&quot;39ms is less than the human eye can register so myth confirmed!&quot;)</p>
<p>That doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong, but it's good to remember they are not a scientific institute.. They are a TV show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus even if the gun was level before triggering, the recoil has probably moved that slightly before the bullet left the barrel.</p>
<p>And then you have to do it a dozen times or so to know how consistent your results are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed the point. Precisely because they were unable to control for every variable is why a few milliseconds is unimportant. The point is to prove the bullets land at the same time in the stated conditions, which are nearly impossible to achieve. The next best thing is getting close, which they did, and the experiment effectively proved the hypothesis as a result. This type of experiment is done literally all the time and the results are informative enough to do things like launch satellites and dissect brains.</p>
<p>In other words, their model was as representative of the real situation as was necessary to sufficiently demonstrate the underlying concept.</p></div>		</li>
