<p>15 miles per hour. Slower than humans run, but definitely not slow either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Being medium sized is the ideal for running. Look at cats for instance. A cheetah is a fairly medium sized cat. It is much larger than something like a housecat or a bobcat, but it is smaller than a lion or a tiger. Due to having longer limbs, they can run faster than a housecat and, due to weighing less, they can run faster than a lion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So not to burst any bubbles but I wouldn’t say humans can <em>easily</em> run 20mph.</p>
<p>Quick google shows fastest 400 at 43.03s and fastest mile at 3:43. If you assume a sprinter could run a full mile at that world record pace, the mile time would be 2:52 for one mile, with 3 minutes being the 20mph mark. Whereas the full mile record is 3:43 so just under 18mph if my mental math is correct.</p>
<p>I know people can do it, just maybe 5% of the population or less even over anything longer than 100 yards. I think the interesting part is it seems like pretty much all of these animals we see are capable of running at or near what we can call the species max velocity (or something less silly idk).</p>
<p>Also side note on the whole fast versus quick thing, they are both technically completely subjective to relativity. We are slow compared relative to a car, which is slow relative to a jet, which is not moving relative to the earths speed. Humans are just faster than elephants which are massive compared to us (granted humans being extremely gifted in endurance) but rabbits, dogs cats can go very fast for their size (speed / body length or mass). </p>
<p>I get your point totally, I just feel like it’s rather different or peculiar how quickly these little animals are capable of moving, relative to their size or just their outright speed.</p></div>		</li>
