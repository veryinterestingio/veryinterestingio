			<div class="markdown"><p>If the house is filthy you do see all that. Just because it's occupied doesn't mean it's taken care of. You don't see dust because you clean it, and because there aren't treasure troves of storage for it to come back. With hoarders, everything is filthy all the time. Doesn't matter the usage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what I meant. Of course filth accumulates in neglected homes. In fact, that was precisely my point. A lot of dust and filth accumulates pretty much everywhere, but it will always be less than a completely abandonned house. In an abandonned house, every single inch of surface accumulates dust, not just the spots you don't clean.</p></div>		</li>
