			<div class="markdown"><p>You could get addicted, but you would get the side effects long before you got a high. Side effects include</p>
<p>nausea and vomiting</p>
<p>low blood pressure (hypotension)</p>
<p>loss of appetite</p>
<p>psychological problems</p>
<p>hallucinations (seeing, hearing, feeling and smelling things that aren’t there)</p>
<p>sleep problems.</p></div>		</li>
