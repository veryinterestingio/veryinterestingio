			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned already; food safety courses are meant for commercial settings. Food safety guidelines are generally MUCH stricter than they need to be to remove room for error.</p>
<p>As an example: FDA says chicken must be cooked to 165!!! I cook chicken sous vide at 150 all the time (even 135 is safe but gross). FDA wants 165 because it instantly kills harmful bacteria so there is no room for error. I can leave mine at 150 since i can trust myself to cook it the correct length of time to kill bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t say it must be cooked to 165, just that it is a safe temperature. They have a table that shows different temperatures and times, but most commercial settings don’t want to pay attention to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Below 40 or above 160 or we don't serve it. If its between those temperatures for 4 hours, its garbage. Now those are holding temperatures so soup needs to be at 160 in the pot, salad toppings need to be below 40 in their station. Itsnot gonna be that temperature when it reaches the customer, just held in pots, stations, fridges ect. I work in fast food the amount of food that gets thrown out when something breaks down in the middle of the night makes me depressed. We can't verify how long it's been in the danger zone so its trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because random teens can't be trusted to do shit right, so by making the guidelines stricter than they need to be, they ensure that the vast majority of the time, the actually necessary measures are taken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Retake your course. You have 2 hours to get food from <strong>135°</strong>F to 70°F, then a further 4 hours to get from 70°F to under 41°F (or 6 hours total if you get to 70 faster than 2 hours).</p></div>		</li>

&quot;Never leave food out of refrigeration over 2 hours. If the temperature is above 90 °F, food should not be left out more than 1 hour.</p>
<p>Keep hot food hot—at or above 140 °F. Place cooked food in chafing dishes, preheated steam tables, warming trays, and/or slow cookers.</p>
<p>Keep cold food cold—at or below 40 °F. Place food in containers on ice.&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>USDA &quot;guidelines&quot; aren't as correct. I'm a health inspector, and I teach the class for the food manager safety certificate. The FDA model food code (as well as California's retail food code) dictate cooling as I said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minimum pasteurization temp is actually around 131. At this temp it will take hours to fully pasteurize (as in the context of sous vide) but properly cooked food should be safe until it falls below this temp. After its fallen to 130 or less I'd get it in the fridge soonish, but theoretically it should be ok as long as it is cooled from 130F to 40F within 4 hours per the USDA</p></div>		</li>
