			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone wondering about the last line; approximate estimate, which is heavily reliant on many factors including the person's body, food/water/other drinks (such as carbonated soda etc), is that the body eliminates 0.01-0.02 g EtOH/100mL of blood per hour. And this begins as soon as you start drinking and absorbing the alcohol. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's really no way to get you sober faster, per se. It'd be more like you get drunk slower.</p>
<p>The ethanol is eliminated from your body mostly through metabolization in the liver. It's broken down into acetaldehyde, which is then further broken down into acetic acid and sent out through the kidneys. A small portion of ethanol is eliminates through breath, sweat, and urine. The speed of this all is dependent on your body, which is why the rate is very broad, and isn't very easily determined for an individual as it can also change.</p>
<p>So if you wanted to drink a lot and not feel the effects as heavily, you'd want a full stomach of food. The alcohol is absorbed <em>mostly</em> in the intestines, so by slowing the gastric emptying (emptying from the stomach to the intestines), you are slowing the absorption of alcohol. So lots of food, I believe carbs being best though could be mistaken, will slow the gastric emptying as it is digested. An empty stomach will allow the liquid to be emptied faster, and carbonated drinks will also increase the rate of emptying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;/100 mL of blood&quot; is more that the amount of liver function (which breaks down the alcohol) and kidney function (filtering it out) pretty much matches your weight, so the thing you can actually measure (alcohol % in the blood) goes down at about the same rate for most people - there's no direct relationship to blood volume.</p>
<p>Still good to keep hydrated though since you'll be peeing out a lot of waste products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water just keeps you hydrated and spaces out the time between drinks, ie slows you drinking more alcohol. Eating high fat and high protein foods will allow some of alcohol to be absorbed if you eat before and during but just slows down how much is getting processed at once, still the same amount of alcohol will need to get broken down. Eating on an empty stomach irritates your stomach and duodenum and allows for rapid absorption of alcohol. </p>
<p>In terms of sobering up it is literally only time that helps. Keeping hydrated will stave off hangover somewhat but elimination of alcohol is done at a rate of unit per hour by liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s more that intoxication is a variety of effects such as impaired judgement, slowed reactions, drowsiness, etc.</p>
<p>It’s possible to counteract some of the effects but not others.</p>
<p>It’s the same way <del>many</del> some non-drowsy cold medicines work; they just add stimulants to counteract the active ingredients’ drowsiness.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For many, the difference between drowsy/non-drowsy is whether it can cross the blood-brain barrier. This also is what separates 2nd gen from 1st gen antihistamines, and often associated with reduced effectiveness. Diphenhydramine (sold as Benadryl in the US) is a good example of a 1st gen, while cetirizine (i.e. Zyrtec, others) is a 2nd gen. Anyone who's taken both can attest to the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks that’s a good point. I did know about the effects difference in gen1/gen2 antihistamines but I didn’t know the reason was which crosses the blood/brain barrier.</p>
<p>I was more talking about things like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both sets of capsules contain Phenylephrine Hydrochloride, which reduces swelling in the nasal passages to help increase airflow and make breathing easier through your nose. They also contain paracetamol, an analgesic which will help bring down your temperature and ease any aches and pains. The Day capsules also contain 25mg of caffeine to help you power through your busy schedule and fight off tiredness associated with colds and flu.</p>
