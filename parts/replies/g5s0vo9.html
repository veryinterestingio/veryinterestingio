			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent write up. I work in a hospital with some of the highest acuity in the US. Prior to Covid, we were always treating patients with ARDS and on ECMO frequently anyway. We were also lucky that when COVID hit we didn’t get overwhelmed and remained well staffed. Even in the beginning the mortality of our ICU patients was under 30%, and were getting very sick patients. Talking to the intensivists, it seems like they were just sticking to sound medicine / management of critically ill patients in respiratory failure. Just not doing new unproven things certainly saved a lot of patients that came to our hospital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll ask the same thing that I asked the OP since they may be getting deluged with comments:</p>
<p>In areas that saw high CFRs early on that now appear to be abnormally so, is there any evidence that the use of unproven therapeutics elevated the CFR significantly? I understand there are major confounding variables -- namely undercapacity and general lack of knowledge about what they were dealing with -- but I'm curious what other factors now seem to be the largest drivers of the high mortality rates seen in Italy, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is going to be too many confounding variables to figure that out. Especially with Italy, but also probably New York. The reason is for one thing you’re right there was a capacity issue which certainly limited how well each patient could be managed. We didn’t hear about hospitals running out of equipment, but we did hear about people being treated in hallways and that could not have helped. On the other side though, these areas were probably undercounting their confirmed cases by 10x because of the limits of testing. At the very beginning in New York, a much higher % of people being tested were those patients coming into the hospital critically ill because those hospitals needed to triage. After large scale testing and antibody studies, an astounding % of New Yorkers were found to have had it. </p>
<p>So being behind the learning curve in the medical management skewed towards higher mortality and the limits of testing skewed towards higher mortality. However many people who died outside of hospitals were never tested as to not waste a test on someone who wouldn’t benefit. I don’t know if they went back and tested tissue samples. But that would skew towards lower mortality. I would basically take those early numbers with a grain of salt. Oh also Italy demographically skewed older so that would push the number higher. Just a lot of factors. I’m sure someone is going through data to clean it up but I haven’t read anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that Italy was split in many areas. Most of it didn't have any covid. If you look at the numbers of lombardy alone, so that it don't get average out, things are much worse (37% CFR for people who got infected before end of march).</p>
<p>Lombardy was <em>totally</em> overwhelmed. We closed every single operating teather to use their ventilators for almost 2 months. We were airlifting ICU patients to Germany. We built tent hospitals staffed by the army. Our normal ICU capacity is 800 beds in the region, at the peak we had 1400 people in ICU for covid only.... So... Factoring out bad treatments from hospital collapse is going to be difficult.</p>
<p>Take also into account that the age distribution of lombardy is extremely skewed old and that we had rampant infections in retirement homes. That worsened our numbers.</p>
<p>We had seroprecalence testing with correct random sampling and it turns out that we had at least 7% of the population infected. Which would result in only a 2% IFR. Which is worse than average but not that much if you account for old age and hospitals collapse.</p></div>		</li>
