			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple storage technologies for heat, cold, hydrogen, and electricity storage. These are discussed in Chapter 2 of the book. For electricity, aside from hydropower reservoirs and pumped hydro, there is also gravitational storage with solid masses, compressed air storage, flywheels, and concentrated solar power with storage. There are also multiple types of batteries. It is not clear that rare earths are a limitation given that they are not so rare, but given the multiple options, even if there are shortages, other options are available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s nice, apart from regular hydropower how many of those have been <em>demonstrated</em> at an adequate scale. Tesla’s big battery in South Australia only holds twenty minutes of power for a state with almost no heavy industry.</p></div>		</li>
