<p>Modern ssds are little different from what you learnt. </p>
<p>Imagine you have a plastic sheet 1cm*2cm, there will be a limit on how many bumps you can fit in there as they will start getting closer and will be hard to make. </p>
<p>So you come up with different strategies. You start having different size of bumps. Earlier you has either a bump or not. But now you also have other state where the bump is little less.
So you have state
No bump, slightly bump, bump.
Using 3 states in binary you can store twice the data as of 2 states ( no bump, bump ) </p>
<p>Basically SSDs come in SLC ( single level cell) nand, MLC Nand, TLC nand, QLC nand and we have some news on 5LC nand too. </p>
<p>So with each increase we are able to store more on the same surface which is pretty cost effective. </p>
<p>We mostly use TLC ssd since few years, however qlc also has flooded the market. </p>
<p>The issue with storing more on single cell is there's a time when the voltage difference between two states in indistinguishable that's when you loose data and storage space on the device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does leak out gradually, but very slowly. Of course, other memory storage devices have similar issues. Magnetic hard drives eventually lose the data due to thermal flipping of the magnetic domains. In the end, entropy always wins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chances of tunneling through the barrier randomly are very, very low. by applying a voltage when the computer is powered up, you can reduce (but not eliminate) the barrier and make the tunneling happen much quicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tunneling is probabilistic, and becomes more likely the more energy the charge has. Throw a thousand teleporting balls at the cage, choose their speed so that each one has a 1/2 chance of getting in. Then ~500 will go into the cage, where they will meet the opposite wall, and ~500 will bounce off. At the inner wall, again, half of balls will go through, but half will ram into the wall and lose their energy. Those last ~250 balls are now stuck in the cage and no longer have the ability to leave. There's nothing theoretically stopping you from getting really unlucky and having all the balls either bounce off or pass through, but the universe will probably end before that happens to an SSD. Worst-case, you read the bit back, realize it didn't work, and try again. There is the issue that the electrons will never actually have 0 energy, and so they <em>always</em> have a small chance of leaking, but as another commenter said, this apparently takes decades to be problem.</p></div>		</li>
