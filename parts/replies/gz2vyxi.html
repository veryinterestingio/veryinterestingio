			<div class="markdown"><p>I got taught this sentence, but not in English, so I didn't catch the mnemonic. I just learned it by reasoning that it's common to get erections at extremely relaxed moments, while it's kind of hard to ejaculate without a sympathetic stimulus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought of it as like... if there's a fight-or-flight kind of stimulus (stimulating the sympathetic system), that would be a good reason not to start messing around with sexy time. You have more important things to worry about. On the other hand, if you're already <em>in</em> sexy time and you get such a stimulus, the best thing to do is ejaculate quickly and then address the threat.</p>
<p>Hence sympathetic stimulation tends to reduce erection, but trigger orgasm.</p></div>		</li>
