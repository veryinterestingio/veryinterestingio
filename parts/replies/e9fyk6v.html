<p>For humans, a number of clinical trials using LA have been undertaken which also assessed adverse health effects in the participants (Table 3). The ALADIN (I, II, and III), SYDNEY (I and II), and ORPIL clinical trials used LA supplements up to 2400 mg/day with no reported adverse effects versus placebo. LA has also been administered intravenously in doses of 600 mg/day for three weeks with no evidence of serious side-effects [37]. Oral doses of 1800 mg LA (600 mg t.i.d.) for 6 months did not elicit significant adverse effects compared to placebo [39]. LA has been used in Germany for over 50 years as a therapy for diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy.</p></div>		</li>
