<p>In addition to less time and energy being spent moving around and being awake, you also do not notice things while you are asleep.  During the day, changes happen over a few hours are small enough that you might not notice, but being asleep for eight hours (plus however long before you fell asleep) allows those changes to add up.  </p>
<p>It is similar to how you might not notice how much a younger sibling grows when you see them every day, but if you are gone for a summer, you will notice the change.</p>

<p>I don't think this effect can be overstated.</p>
<p>Ironically, for RA the classic symptomology is that the symptoms are worst in the morning when the body has not been moving and immune complexes can form more in the joint spaces. Patients classically wake up with morning stiffness which then improves during the day as they are moving.</p>
<p>EDIT: osteoarthritis is classically worst at night; however, depending on how old OP is, if the RA is long-standing such that there has been noticeable damage done to the joints, it would make sense that symptoms are now worse at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I probably should have been more specific with the RA, I’m 28 with seronegative RA - in the morning my hands are always a bit stiff especially along the knuckle line / fingers but throughout the day it’ll start to move to other places of my body like up my wrists or maybe my feet and then disappears by night.
The reset part I mentioned is how it’ll be back in my hands in the morning in the exact same spot, kind of like Groundhog Day for RA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have both chrons disease and arthritis. Both of which are much worse in the morning and gets better throughout the day. But it has alot to do with a ton of different factors such as, diet, exercise, rest and so on. Stress is also a huge part of autoimune diseases. Because of that I think it can vary from person to person.</p></div>		</li>
