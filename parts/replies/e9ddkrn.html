			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine, but we already pretty much have touchless screens.  You could lower the detection threshold on rise time to define touch as being a smaller change in rise time, that would make it more sensitive (and not require any new engineering), but there's a catch.</p>
<p>As I said here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's electric field rapidly dwindles to zero as you get further from the plate, but when you're close to the plate (&quot;close&quot; being roughly on the order of the characteristic length of the plate, so an 4 cm x 4 cm square plate would have a characteristic length of roughly 4 cm,) your finger starts to perturb the electric field. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing is, when the capacitor is non-ideal and has a non-zero resistance, you can imagine it's not really 1 large single-plate capacitor.  It's actually 200 smaller single-plate capacitors with total surface area equal to the whole.  (I say 200 because in my example we've divided it with 20 sensors along one side and 10 along the other.)</p>
<p>So now the characteristic length of each capacitor is pretty small.  You can't do much about that, because under the hood, what's happening is that the electric field emitted by each capacitor no longer goes straight up, normal to the surface of the plate.  Instead it kinda spreads out left &amp; right.</p>
<p>So now the higher your finger gets, the more it reads not only above one sensor-pair, but above a bigger group of them.</p>
<p>There's probably software optimizations you can make to extend that a bit, to find the center of the circle of readings, but eventually it spreads out so much there's nothing more you can do, short of creating a <em>really big</em> plate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's kind of similar to how magnetic field works? </p>
<p>I mean, touch screens work even with a screen protector, or when wearing rubber gloves. I'm not exactly sure how it works when there's no direct contact between the finger and the screen. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, kind of.  It's an electric field, not a magnetic field.  A magnetic field is generated by current moving through a wire, or a permanent magnet, which is a magnetic dipole.  An electric field is generated by the accumulation of charge.  There are two laws governing these two fields, both called <em>Gauss's Law</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gauss's Law:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>∇ E = ρ / ϵ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This says the <strong>divergence</strong> (given by the ∇ symbol) of the Electric field is given by the charge in the space in question.  It's articulated mathematically as a closed surface integral.  So the number of electric field lines leaving a closed surface (any closed surface) will be proportional to the charge enclosed by that surface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gauss's Law for Magnetism:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>∇ B = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This says the divergence of the <em>Magnetic field</em>, on the other hand, is always zero.  So if you take a closed surface, <em>any</em> closed surface, the number of magnetic field lines leaving the surface in one spot is precisely equal to the number <em>entering</em> the surface at another.  Or, put another way, there is no such thing as a magnetic monopole.</p>
<hr />
<p>The presence of your finger, (or put another macabre way, &quot;the presence of <strong>human flesh</strong>&quot;) changes the dielectric constant of the field emitted by the single-plate capacitor.</p>
<p>Well that's not precisely correct.  It changes the dielectric constant <em>of the space</em> through which the electric field emitted by the plate flows.</p>
<p>When the dielectric constant changes, the capacitance of the plate changes, because capacitance of a circular disk is approximately given by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C = 8 <em> ε </em> r</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...where r is the radius of the circular disk.</p>
<p>We can rewrite this in terms of surface area of said disk, given by A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C = 8 <em> ε </em> √(A/π)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can <em>hand wave</em> and say an iPhone is <strong>roughly</strong> circular so we can express the capacitance as a function of the surface area of the screen.</p>
<p>So as you can see by the above equation, the capacitance depends upon a bunch of constants that don't change, (8, A, π) and the permittivity of the space the electric field goes through, which is what changes when you introduce your finger.</p>
<p>This way probably more information than one can conveniently handle; sorry.  The math actually isn't that hard, but the formulation of the math, with <strong>divergence operators</strong> and <strong>surface integrals</strong> is kind of a pain in the ass to wrap your head around.</p></div>		</li>
