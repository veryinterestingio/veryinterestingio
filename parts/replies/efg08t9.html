			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;feel cold&quot;, but I live in a cold climate where we are currently enjoying a deep freeze, and it's definitely noticeable in the eyeballs department. It mostly seems to register as eye irritation though, e.g. I was out in the cold tonight and now feel like my eyeballs have been sandpapered.</p>
<p>Aha, I found science that mentions that people generally register cold as irritation!  <a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2166183" target="_blank">https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2166183</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Cornea Is Also Innervated by Cold Thermoreceptors</strong></p>
<p>Cold thermoreceptors represent a separate class of corneoconjunctival sensory neurons with unique, specific properties. These include spontaneous firing of nerve impulses, often in bursts, at the normal background temperature of the cornea or conjunctiva (34–35°C) and immediate increase of their impulse activity when the corneal temperature drops, which thereafter stabilizes gradually at a higher impulse frequency level, proportional to the new value of corneal temperature. Thus, cold thermoreceptors encode in their firing frequency the speed and magnitude of temperature reductions at the ocular surface as well as the final static temperature. In the normal range of corneal temperatures (36–29°C), cold thermoreceptors are able to discriminate transient temperature variations of 0.5°C or less. 7,17,18 As expected, psychophysical experiments using corneal esthesiometry in human subjects have shown that they are able to discriminate corneal temperature drops of 1°C to 2°C below basal level.<br />
The prominent sensitivity of ocular cold receptors to small temperature reductions of the eye surface is puzzling. There is no evidence that corneal thermal information is used for environmental temperature assessment in animals, including humans. In fact, <strong>only under precise experimental conditions are humans capable of clearly ascribing a thermal quality to the mildly irritant sensation evoked by moderate cooling of the ocular surface</strong>.</p>
