			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be a Q ship. Those were merchant vessels armed to destroy surfaced u boats. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-ship" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-ship</a></p>
<p>Merchant raiders, like the Atlantis ( <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_auxiliary_cruiser_Atlantis" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_auxiliary_cruiser_Atlantis</a> )  were specifically tasked with hunting down commerce. </p>
<p>The Atlantis would disguise itself as ships from many different countries. </p>
<p>same with the kormoran <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_auxiliary_cruiser_Kormoran" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_auxiliary_cruiser_Kormoran</a></p>
<p>Point stands though, both sides got crafty and armed merchant vessels for a variety of different uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the &quot;Q&quot; ships. also the Axis powers used heavily armed merchant ships as raiders against solitary enemy vessels. 1 Nazi raider the KOROMAT was being approached by an Austrailian light cruiser HMAS SYDNEY who's Captain very foolishly came right alongside the unsuspected raider who's own Captain realized his cover would swiftly be uncovered had his own ship's torpedoes' safety arming switches disabled and as soon as he ordered the Nazi flag run up his mast, exposed his hidden guns and began firing as the torpedo was launched at SYDNEY less than 300' away. the torpedo hit SYDENY in the bow, fatally damaging her while KOROMATs guns aimmed at SYDNEYs 6&quot; gun turrets, rapidly disabling 2 of her 3. SYDENYs remaining aft turret managed to in return hit KOMORAT at least 3 times including her rear cargo hold containing 2 spotter aircraft and at least 60 naval mines, starting uncontrollable fires. HMAS SYDENY limped away to sink with no survivors from a crew of more than 600, KOROMAT sank several hours later with less than 300 of her 400 man crew remaining.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laconia_incident" target="_blank">Laconia incident</a>, where a British ship was sunk by a German u-boat, which then attempted to coordinate a rescue effort with other u-boats. The u-boats were spotted and strafed by American bombers and forced to crash dive. Afterwards German command gave strict orders not to risk more u-boats in rescue attempts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>up on declaring war all British merchant ships were under DIRECT orders to radio that they were under attack regardless. supposedly this was so the Royal Navy know where to look for survivors at but it also told the RN exactly where the attacking submarine or merchant raider was also...</p></div>		</li>
