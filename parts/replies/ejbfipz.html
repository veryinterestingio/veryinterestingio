			<div class="markdown"><p>So I don't know about the connection to organs but this diagram shows the areas well <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/GqwVHD7Dksosf9x69" target="_blank">https://images.app.goo.gl/GqwVHD7Dksosf9x69</a> (sorry I'm on my phone and I'm lazy).</p>
<p>So what I like to do is fold my hand with my thumb tucked in and use my index fingers knuckle to rub around the eyeball a little, again avoiding the cornea and not putting too much pressure on. Then with the knuckle massage the eyelid up against the brow bone, then bring it under the eye and rub the skin against the bone there. Then with my index pad I do finer details. And this is what I do most throughout the day. Just massaging the eyelid against the bone, especially in towards the nose where there is a spot that just feels great (the tear duct maybe?). Then I drag my finger down and do the same finer massage below. </p>
<p>Now in the graphic, there's the spot on the cheek labelled heart. With my index or thumb, I go down the bridge of my nose until I feel it meet the high point of my cheek bone, then drag the pad of the finger along the cheek bone. I usually use much more pressure and sometimes have to play around to get the right spots. I will vary between stroking across my cheek along that ridge or poking at a pressure point and holding for a second or two.</p>
<p>The ones on the forehead are much easier to find. The center is the classic sinus point. Often if I have a headache, just putting pressure here relieves it significantly. Then going just a bit to either side is pleasant in a different way. Usually I start holding the center pressure point, then use index and thumb the massage the 2 side ones at the same time, which progresses to a full forehead rub. </p>
<p>Then I take 2 hands and gently massage my temples, jaw, and neck. Then if I'm able, I rest my head on something in front of me and give my neck a good massage, perhaps with bengay, being sure to give attention to where the neck meets the head. Then I stretch and breath and feel refreshed.</p>
<p>If you're suffering from clogged sinuses or clogged nose, I've found that laying on my stomach or leaning forward and resting cheek bone on my palm relieves just enough pressure for the mucus to start moving about.</p>
<p>I hope this helps! Take yourself to a massage therapist! I only know about any of this stuff because of them.</p></div>		</li>
