			<div class="markdown"><p>When starved for water, pepper plants double down on capsaicin production. Perhaps as a last-ditch effort that its fruits will be left behind by mammals for birds that will disperse the seeds further than land-based animals. </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that many living things change during domestication and shrivelly peppers could be a symptom of that. The selective breeding of hotter and hotter varieties drives that versus looks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to grow peppers and they were always 90% sweet (I used the same seeds to regrow every year) until one year when we went on vacation and they must not have gotten enough water during that summer.  My family cooked them up like normal not expecting them to be flaming hot and suffice to say that after that first time, we learned to check before throwing them into recipes.</p></div>		</li>
