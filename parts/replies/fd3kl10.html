			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is important to point out. In order for a person to become meaningfully radioactive they would need to be exposed to a significant neutron flux. I suppose this is possible, being as they were near an exposed nuclear reactor core, but I don't think this is relevant. </p>
<p>Like others are pointing out, the subjects were dangerous to touch and be around because they were covered in and full of a large amount of radioactive particles, from dust and such. Those particles are decaying, irradiating the people near the first responders, and the radioactive particles can get on/in the people touching the first responders, where the continue to produce radiation until the particles decay.</p>
<p>For I-131, which is one of the primary radioactive materials involved, there is a half life of ~8 days. If you ingest that, it goes to your thyroid and continues to irradiate you until all that material decays (say 10 half lives or 80 days).</p>
<p>As a side note, this is why they talk about iodine pills. If you take iodine pills, you saturate your body with non-radioactive iodine and then excrete the radioactive iodine, decreasing your total dose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation doesn't cause burns immediately, and the firemen didn't inhale the radioactive dust. Gamma rays got through the suits, that's it.  Also, there's no proof that the story about a fireman's wife is true, other than her words. </p>
<p>I think this article is a great read to understand the radiation effects and what facts were depicted wrong in the show.</p>
