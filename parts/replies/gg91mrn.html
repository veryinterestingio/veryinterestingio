			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember carbon black. I once did a week's contract work in a factory that made it. The dust was so fine that it would penetrate right through your jeans and you would come out looking like a coal miner at the end of the day.<br />
This was in New Jersey in the wintertime so my most vivid memory is having to take cold showers in the middle of a NJ winter to wash it off. If you took a hot shower your pores would open up and it was even harder to remove.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an engineer in the dust collection industry. I can unequivocally confirm that carbon black is easily one of the most difficult powders to control. It will find any pinhole in a pipe or weak point in a flange, causing a massive geyser of dust. We have to use highly specialized filter media to capture it or else it will pass right through more common media due to its extremely fine particle size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's the 6PPD, an anti-ozonant used in literally all tires.  It comes off in tire dust and reacts with ozone to turn into a slightly different molecule, and that molecule kills up to 90% of salmon in streams returning to spawn.</p>
<p>IMO my state needs to tell the tire and auto industry they have to remove the chemical from all tires sold in the state or they are going to be financially liable for the environmental damage their product is doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live next to a highway, and EVERYTHING within about 100 feet of that highway was covered in small, sand-sized grains of black rubber and soot.  I had to wash the house off twice during the summer as it would cover everything.  Except my vegetables, I guess watering kept them clean.  Still, I do not recommend living near a highway or busy street because of tire particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the link, I was in aquaculture on the west coast for years, so much of the blame I heard fell on the fish farms.  Of course they could only be accountable for part of what's been happening to the salmon (and other wildlife) so it's nice to finally hear about another specific cause so that we can maybe work on fixing it.</p></div>		</li>
