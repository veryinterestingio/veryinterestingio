			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone currently studying a Nuclear Engineering minor with some work with cyclotrons, I knew about most of that, but I had never heard of Compton backscatter to create high energy gamma rays. It makes sense now that I think about it, but I hadn't realized the need for high energy gamma rays. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>(And while I am at it: Is there recent research about those hypothetical gamma lasers? From googling around all I could find articles indicating there's some occasional research going on for the last 60 decades, but nothing too promising).  </p>
<p>There is a lot of work being done in x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). We can produce high energy gamma rays as well using accelerators, for example using Compton backscattering. They can produce gamma rays with hundreds of MeV of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, a laser, by definition, generates a photon when an electron in a higher energy state drops to a lower energy state.  This happens only when hit by another photon and its newly generated photon is of the same wavelength, phase, and direction of the initial photon.</p>
<p>The thing is, the wavelength of lasers comes from the energy of that electron jump, and they are exact.  Adding more power to a red laser diode makes more red photons, but never shifts them up to blue.</p>
<p>The gamma photon energy range is far beyond the energy of an electron jump to a lower state.  So if a similar thing was invented, it wouldn't be called a &quot;LASER&quot;, as the process photons don't come from electron gaps, and gamma isn't referred to as &quot;light&quot;.</p>
<p>Gamma is created by nuclear decay or bremsstrahlung.  Now you can stimulate nuclear material to decay (fission reaction), but that's with neutron impacts, not other gamma photons.  The resulting gamma photons are emitted a short time later, not instantly, and have random phase and direction.  They don't stimulate each other.  So it's inherently unlike a LASER.  We do have devices to generate a &quot;beam&quot; of gamma (or neutrons) but it's not coherent light and its process is nothing like a LASER.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the idea is that the nucleus has its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_isomer" target="_blank">own excited states</a>, which possibly can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_gamma_emission" target="_blank">release gamma rays</a> due to specific circumstances. The goal is to create something that works on the same principles as a laser, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_laser" target="_blank">works on nuclei</a> instead of electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mode of operation of an XFEL is different than a regular laser, but I’m just using the standard terminology of the field.</p>
<p>The “lasing medium” in an FEL is an electron beam. The beam is made to oscillate using a wiggler/undulator, and the power of the emitted synchrotron light increases exponentially as a function of path length through the undulator. Quantum-mechanically, there is stimulated emission occurring. And people are working on developing the technology to get the best coherence possible.</p></div>		</li>
