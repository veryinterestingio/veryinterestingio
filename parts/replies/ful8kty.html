			<div class="markdown"><p>In pretty sure that this one uses a RTG for power, there is no way to reverse that process. Solar panels work for crap that far out. It's dark and cold out there.. It's neat though, there is a company set to capture and refuel satellite in earth orbit. But that's a new thing. Scott Manley did some videos on that process. Something to look at along these lines though.</p></div>		</li>
