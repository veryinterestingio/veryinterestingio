<p>While the SCP is scary looking, it engages in no actual hostile activity and actually seems to show genuine interest in you. Intense but non-hostile interest can be interpreted by some as a form of love (if somewhat twisted and stalker-like), and there's an appealing feeling that comes from knowing that something really scary is actually friendly.</p>
<p>The Japanese term &quot;yandere&quot; which roughly describes extreme infatuation, often to a dangerous degree, might also somewhat apply to this situation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well as to what applies to that original story specifically, it’s worth noting that the image on the page is actually a fursuit with a filter placed onto it. You can actually find an image of it without the filter and it’s significantly less creepy.</p>
<p>Besides that, some of the tales involving MalO went further in characterizing it, in particular, depicting it as shy but loving. Which a lot of people are into.</p>
<p>I also feel like some of that thirstiness is at least partially for the meme/pure audacity of it. The whole “if it exists it will have porn” thing can, to some extent, be a self fulfilling prophecy. And when it comes to the biggest and most popular SCPs, well...somehow, that one does end up being the most...pornifiable? God, I regret coining that term. But yeah it works better than featureless statue, corpse torture man, unrememberable object, or first-person toaster.</p></div>		</li>
