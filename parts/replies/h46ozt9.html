			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically because they share a common formation mechanism, i.e. very fast sedimentation rates. Petroleum systems need fast sedimentation to prevent the parent organic material from being broken down aerobically before it is buried and can be broken down anaerobically (which is what is required to produce the right type of kerogen to form petroleum and natural gas).</p></div>		</li>

<p>They were without a doubt my favorite natural feature there I couldn‚Äôt get enough of them. I just wanted to hold my hands over them and let the mud slap against my palms! So powerful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the most straightforward and complete explanations I've come across in this sub. Complete with references even. Thank you for taking the time on this. Not only did I learn more about this somewhat esoteric topic, but I never knew that they could ignight. Kudos!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree! Well, except for the part about my question being esoteric. üòâI always learn a ton from /u/CrustalTrudger‚Äôs answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, those are definitely a bit of a different animal than the standard model for mud volcanoes in terms of the source of the fluid, but the resulting features are quite similar. As with the serpentinite ones, the purely clastic ones end up being useful &quot;samplers&quot; of subsurface material as well.</p></div>		</li>
