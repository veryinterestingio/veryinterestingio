			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, struggled with this shit years ago and it took me a while to figure out that depression isn't <em>sadness</em>.  For me, it was supreme apathy.  Nothing mattered.  School didn't matter, job didn't matter, friends didn't matter, family didn't matter... hell, hygiene didn't matter.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a wonderful TED Talk. I shared it with my friend who lives on a remote island with severe depression among a population of people to whom he is foreign. He cannot leave for a couple more years, but I do my best to be there for him when I can. Thank you for this video. Having been through depression myself, I cannot thank you enough for sharing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I generally just tell people &quot;I'm tired.&quot; Because that is the closest and simplest way to explain it. Really there is like three types of tired for me. Emotional, after like, trying to help someone else or deal with their problems and being emotionally tapped out from stress. Mentally tired is after a long day of work and decision making, or logistical decisions, and Physically is like I helped someone move or was on my feet a long time. Depression kind of feels like a mixture of all three, like my body is just done living or my life juice is gone, like it's all done. I once used the phrase &quot;existential tiredness&quot; and I have said &quot;I'm just tired of life&quot; before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting way to put it. I find that if I'm emotionally or mentally tired, I feel physically tired too, even if I was not active at all. Whereas getting a good workout doesn't make me feel mentally or emotionally tired.</p>
<p>What type do you feel is most draining for you? As an introvert, I feel it's emotional tiredness. Being mentally tired but having accomplished something or figured something out still feels pretty good. But if I'm emotionally tired or stressed out? Makes me just want to crawl into bed and do nothing, even though I don't really want to be unproductive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why suicide rates are higher in people at the start of taking antidepressants, you go from not caring about anything and having no desire to do anything to suddenly caring and having motivation, but the negative feels caused by the depressive state take longer to go away since they're not the illness, they're the reaction to the illness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This feels opposite to my experience. But my depression was a symptom of extreme anxiety. Antidepressants (SSRIs in this case) made my life less dramatic and more neutral, more &quot;normal&quot;. I could build up my life again.</p>
<p>But after a couple of years on them I went down in the worst depression I've ever had, this time because I was apathetic to everything. I was suicidal and I knew I wouldn't handle quitting my antidepressants. Moved back to my parents and got some really good help from my doctor in the end.</p>
<p>I guess my point is there's many different causes to depression and many different medicines that would fall under the antidepressant-umbrella.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, my anxiety makes me so tired because my brain is on fire from agonising and catastrophising every single decision or failure to make a decision. I become simultaneously paralysed and horribly exhausted. I also then sleep like shit so that makes the exhaustion even worse. Bed is the safest place to be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if I told you depression is the same mechanism your body uses to fight the flu? Except your brain is confused. You don’t have the flu.</p>
<p>What if I told you anxiety is the same mechanism your body uses to survive against predators? Except your brain is confused.  You aren’t going to get eaten. </p>
<p>I am not trying to be a pop psychology sage. I just want to add that helped me to recognize the body symptoms evolved earlier than the cognitive narrative part, so adding this prehistoric confusion to my narrative helped shift the thoughts from being something that is wrong with my rational thinking to simply a weird illusion that my (ir)rational thinking was putting my body in physical danger in these weird ways. </p>
<p>It helped me to stop worrying about worrying which is like trying to cure a broken leg by walking on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just physical weakness. It destroys the part of your cognitive process that provides positive foresight. In general terms, it destroys hope. But not just in the abstract sense. You hit a light switch because you anticipate and have for sight that doing so will turn on the light. Imagine if your brain cut off that foresight and or made it all seem meaningless. You no longer have that mental connection inherently motivating you to initiate any actions because there is no significance in the result.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's absolutely frightening how this happens and how quickly your mind can turn this way seemingly without cause. I've had nights where I went to sleep feeling absolutely certain that the only way forward was suicide, and then upon waking up could no longer even understand what made me feel that. When I feel like everything is going smoothly and I'm more or less happy with my life, I'm often hit with a feeling of complete futility that makes me want to give up as I feel so tired with life and suddenly feel certain that I've always felt this way and will always feel this way.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I feel that hopelessness and begin feeling that nothing will ever feel good, I try to treat it as a temporary physical symptom like a headache - as in &quot;you feel like crap now, but just bear it the best you can as you know from experience that this will pass.&quot; This helps a lot. I no longer try to &quot;think&quot; my way out of it with logic, and try and rationalise my feelings, which is just tiring and makes it worse, as it gives the depressive thoughts more credit that they're due.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early morning mondays. I have my first 'migration' of the week, by migration I mean the 1hr 10min I have from home to office, all by subway, an unnatural and unhealthy migration but nonetheless inescapable. Nothing to do while the trip goes on but overthink. </p>
<p>On one point or another I start ruminating depressive thoughts. My parents that, my work the other, my finances, my sons, my wife... I get sad and angry to a high level. </p>
<p>Fortunately when I get to mutch angry I am being able to think like you, it is only a temporal headache, remember, is just monday and you have to do things you do not like but have to. It is mutch more productive than trying to rationalize these thoughts, they get more power that way and I get nowhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hope can be just as delusional as a bad case of depression is - in fact, I'd say that the majority of things that people hope for they will never accomplish, and one loses hope when they realize such.  </p>
<p>Ultimately there is no rational reason to live, or to die, they are all part instinctual/emotive.  As such, we're merely talking on a spectrum here - person A likes blue, you like red, etc - </p>
<p>Now, as to being more productive to themselves and others, I can see people overly deluding themselves with hope and similar bullshit, but let's not draw out  case where everyone needs hope or whatever keeps 'em going - </p></div>		</li>
