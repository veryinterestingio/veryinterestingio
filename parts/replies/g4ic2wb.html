			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending where /u/aspartanaccountant lives, that may be normal.  I discovered through a friend in Brazil that often other countries have electric showerheads, and if they're not installed properly, they will do this.  Around the time of finding out, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNjA0aee07k" target="_blank">this video</a> from BigCliveDotCom.  He explains that, if this is part of it, often the installer will never properly ground the unit.  Regardless of what the cause/problem is, it should be fixed properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi I do electrical things for a living. Theres two theories I have.</p>
<p>One: you live in a very arid place and generate enough static electricity that you occasionally shock yourself.  This only works before you actually get in.</p>
<p>Two: with it being an older shower the pipes are probably metal and someone used the pipe as a ground. Whatever that ground is connected to is low power and shorting, sending the electricity through the pipe, tap, and you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a pic once where someone lost their neutral coming into the house. Well the grounded copper pipe carried the load out the house and I imagine  back to the pole ground somehow. Anyway the pipe was bright red. Crazy stuff</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I touch metal in my shower with a spot where my skin is weak (ripped off hangnail, etc.) it gives me a very specific and unpleasant shock. It's happened to my roommate too, we've never understood it, would it be because of the second thing you explain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live we have electric showers, which aren't as dangerous as they sound, except if you fuck up.</p>
<p>My mom used to do everything at home, so once when the shower stopped working, she replaced it, except this time, while doing that, a wire became exposed inside the wall.</p>
<p>I was taking a shower and noticed I was receiving slight shocks while touching things around the bathroom, like the window or the walls. After a few minor ones, I decided to leave, which was kind of a mistake. I touched the knob and still have a tiny scar on my finger to this day, at least a decade later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with the body's electrical signals. It's two dissimilar metals in the presence of an electrolyte (sailva) creating a battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is wrong. If that were the case, you'd get that buzz when two fillings touch aswell.</p>
<p>The right answer is induced current: the filling and the tinfoil are different metals (amalgam and aluminum) which hold onto their electrons with different strength. If there's a conductor between them (your saliva), the electrons move from one to the other, which is a current, which is also picked up by your nerves, thus the buzz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for a detailed response. I was just wondering how the electrical current passes the gap between the filling and the nerves? Is this assuming the fillings are touching the nerves?</p></div>		</li>
