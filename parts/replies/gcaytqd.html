<p>We had an indoor/outdoor bar in our restaurant and a lot of times I was the one to manage the tv's we had 3-4 tv's inside and 4 outside. </p>
<p>One remote for each TV which always baffled me that they wouldn't/couldn't just work out a better system.</p>
<p>The worst part is that even after numbering the TV/Remotes the numbers would just rub off the remotes from daily bar use.</p>
<p>Then you have to diagnose whether you have the wrong remote or are the batteries dead.</p>
<p>Now imagine the girl you are talking about pointing her phone at the cable box X 8 other employee's.</p>
<p>RIP my smoke break.</p></div>		</li>
