<p>What got you started?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: II was a functioning heroin addict who tried methamphetamine on a whim to avoid an overdose, loved it so much because I was able to quit opiates, had ridiculous sex drive and perceived increased productivity.</p>
<p>Long version;</p>
<p>PREVENTING OVERDOSE
Actually the reason I tried it was because I had taken another drug (GHB) and to prevent overdose I was told to snort a line, which lead to me not only feeling better (after horrible insufflation burn) but dancing in the warehouse district rave clubs for 4 days straight, no sense of time. (Later my iPhone said I walked 40,000 steps,lol)</p>
<p>IN THE BEGINNING METH FEELS LIKE A BETTER VERSION OF YOURSELF -
You’re able to learn faster, you’re able to complete more work, and you’re able to do all of the things that once you procrastinated on. </p>
<p>I lost 100 pounds in 6 months. I used to weigh 300. I liked that very much.</p>
<p>I FELT CONFIDENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. I was able to talk to women and sleep with seemingly anyone I wanted through confidence and charm along with insatiable sex drive I had never felt before. Having sex sometimes for 22-36 hours straight with breaks of course but no sleep or food. I liked that very much.</p>
<p>I started to learn all the instruments I’ve always wanted to learn read all the books I’ve always wanted to read write the journals I want to write. Sleep with all the women i ever wanted to sleep with. For a time- it was the greatest thing I’ve ever discovered it was the answer to my laziness. </p>
<p>I had the confidence of the person I always wanted to be as a nerdy, fat, bullied, girlfriendless, first gen- Indian child.</p>
<p>QUITTING OPIATES
I had been an opiate addict for 15 years (functioning on pills)  I wanted to see if I could quit using methamphetamine which was so much stronger than any drug I had ever had in my life. And for time it worked when I tried to quit heroin I stayed up for 14 days on meth, smoking it, I didn’t eat anything I didn’t shower I didn’t sleep I didn’t smoke cigarettes and I didn’t do heroin I don’t even remember if I was sick or withdrawing .</p>
<p>Going from opiates to meth was like the world opening up. The colors the music the feelings all so bright. Along with my pupils once pins were now huge letting in more light,more detail.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next year I continue to use methamphetamine but did not use heroin for almost a year and a half. I thought in my delusion that I had discovered some grand idea for addiction recovery.</p>
<p>Eventually, fun times turned into traumatic times and as I continue to seek drugs and lose my money, my respect, my livelihood, and my friends- I incurred more trauma -which encouraged more drug use to relieve my perceived suffering and guilt, which lowering my morality and dignity to its baseline in order to acquire more and more drugs, situations that added more trauma to the cycle, and then more drugs to forget the pain and on and on.</p>
<p>In the end I needed methamphetamine just open my eyes and I needed heroin just to calm down and feel “normal”</p>
<p>Fast forward five years and now I’m sober looking back and realizing that I was out of my mind but only now do I realize it- if you would ask me then I would tell you I wasn’t even getting high: the drugs weren’t even working anymore-  but they were working.</p>
<p>I’m diagnosed bipolar 2, they say, medication has been helping me a lot, keeps my moods even-ish. I think I was self medicating my ups and downs or maybe inducing them, hard to self investigate my own disorder.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day this can be an inspiring chapter of redemption for me. Because if I go out and use again it’s likely I will die, if not immediately- certainly quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I never believe another person’s experience. Ever since I was an infant I hadro  try things on my own, hairpin in the electrical socket (over and over because I thought I could find a way to do it right), burned by hot cooking pots and basically saying fuck you to any adult who tried to grace me with their wisdom. As an adult my inner self remained a petulant child.</p></div>		</li>
