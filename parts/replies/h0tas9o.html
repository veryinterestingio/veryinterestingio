			<div class="markdown"><p>We're still in that awkward stage of civilization where information has now reached the potential for post-scarcity levels of availability, but because resources and services are not equally common, information has to be made artificially scarce to maintain the industries that are connected to the creation and dissemination of information</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, it’s not that simple, though. People make <em>money</em> from their efforts of writing the books. Not all books are informational, either. Authors wouldn’t be able to sit down and write books if they didn’t have people licensing them and making them money for their extremely difficult efforts, in most cases. What you seem to be suggesting is that everything is free, which is just not how this life works, sadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't go against what I was saying. Because resources and services are not post-scarce, and authors (and people that make movies and video games and podcasts and other types of consumed media) still need things like food and car washes and houses, then produced information (which I'm using to refer to any non-physical consumable media) is still linked to the more material economy, even though the technology exists that can disseminate information at post-scarcity levels. My post before seemed to insinuate that &quot;someone&quot; is shackling information to material economics, when I meant that the economics themselves are doing the shackling. My bad.</p></div>		</li>
