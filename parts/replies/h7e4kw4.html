			<div class="markdown"><p>Naproxen and ibuprofen are both NSAIDs (Pain + inflammation reduction). Broadly you could simplify the difference as ibuprofen being faster but naproxen lasting longer—since they're both doing more or less the same things to you, just on different schedules you shouldn't mix them. Tylenol is in a different class of medication (and without the anti-inflammatory effects), so it could be more safely paired with ibuprofen or naproxen respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tylenol is it’s own class. Basically all other OTC pain meds are NSAIDS and should not be combined unless specifically told to do so. </p>
<p>Tylenol + any 1 nsaid is fine. Don’t combine 2 nsaids, like Aleve and Advil.</p></div>		</li>
