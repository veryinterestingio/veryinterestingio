			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of that one catdog episode where it's revealed that their teeth are swapped- when cat brushes his teeth, dog's teeth will become clean and vice versa.</p>
<p>One of them starts chewing foil to hurt the other</p>
<p>Also, cat inverts his body and comes out of dog's mouth to try and brush his teeth while he sleeps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong about my fillings bit I'm pretty sure I remember biting on foil and getting the slight current before I ever got fillings. I'm not actually sure I ever got metal fillings--I've definitely had a couple cavities filled, but I can't see any metal. Is it possible to have metal-free fillings?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk about the more advanced batteries, but the very basic battery is made by exposing dissimilar (ie different) metals to something that causes a chemical reaction, typically acids or alkaline.  The reaction causes a flow of electrons from one metal to the other - electricity. If you Google potato battery you'll probably get a much better explanation than I provided.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to mention, foil and fillings are dissimilar metals, your saliva has enzymes that attack the metals, and biting completes the circuit</p></div>		</li>
