Glad to hear life is getting easier for diabetic folks. I hope as many people as possible can access the new tech and improve their QOL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine you round rotate the site used to take the blood too right? So a little more healing time per site</p>
<p>That's what we advise for regular subcut injections or for regular cannulation so I figure same logic applies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's true for getting blood out of a finger and giving injections.  But if you do it several times a day for decades things don't heal as well anymore.</p>
<p>The issue with injections, where diabetes is concerned, is scar tissue can build up at injection sites and inhibit insulin absorption.</p></div>		</li>
