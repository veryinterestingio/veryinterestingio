			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There are many very large moths that are excellent at hovering. In fact, people often mistake them for hummingbirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/G5-KAaYmEXk" target="_blank">Check out this guy</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At first I thought you meant mistake it from a distance because it has wings and is hovering, but that thing is straight up adapted to look like a hummingbird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to make that clear: It's not a case of adaptive mimicry, i.e. they are not <em>literally</em> adapted to look like hummingbirds. Hummingbird hawk moths are native to Europe, Asia and Africa while real hummingbirds are native only to the Americas. </p>

<p>Any similarity between the two is entirely due to convergent evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have them in North Carolina.  I was so confused when I saw them.  Even the same color as a hummingbird, only a bit smaller.  Found out what they were after googling  “insect that looks like hummingbird”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dragonflies are actually one of the only insects that can move their wings individually, basically all other insects have all-or-nothing wing control.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it helps with their hovering  though, because damselflies also have indepentent control of their wings and they fly like they're on drugs</p></div>		</li>
