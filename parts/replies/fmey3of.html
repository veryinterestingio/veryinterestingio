			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to add to this, you’re not wrong about GABA literally being an entire degree of information but I wanted to explain why. </p>
<p>GABA takes in a TON of the other neurotransmitters when there’s too much and can recycle them or convert them into others as needed. </p>
<p>It’s the most potent inhibitory neurotransmitter in the body. Parts of its function are directly tied to our metabolism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way to explain it is that it is essentially &quot;replacing&quot; alcohol in the brain.  Because we know kinetics better and have a specific amount of drug as opposed to 4.2% (Miller lite) vs 9% (Dogfish Head 90min IPA) ABV, this is why we use a prescription med versus just giving the patient a beer/shot of liquor.  </p>
<p>It is really all about the GABA receptors in alcohol withdrawal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body does not make any uppers to counter act the effects of alcohol, though.</p>
<p>It attaches itself to receptor sites at the GABA gland. The gland in turn produces more receptor sites which is what tolerance and the requirement to consume more to achieve a previously experienced effect is. When a person with a big tolerance suddenly abstains from alcohol these many receptor sites are left empty because the natural chemistry of the brain isn't able to fill all those sites. In fact, an alcoholic's brain relies solely on alcohol consumption to fill those sites. This causes the brain to become overly active and seizures happen. The process of down-regulation, or the time it takes for the body to adjust the amount of those sites to a natural amount, is the withdrawal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is info that alcohol upregulates NMDA receptors so that it what I an calling the &quot;upper.&quot; We occasionally uses memantine, an NMDA inhibitor in our server withdrawal cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but upregulate means to create more receptors sites for alcohol to bind to. Upregulation isn't a substance but a process. That's why I think the example is a bit flawed.</p></div>		</li>
