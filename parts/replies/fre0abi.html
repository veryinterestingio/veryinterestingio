			<div class="markdown"><p>For the technical explanation of how it got that name...</p>
<p>In houses where gas jets were lit to provide light (e. g. the chandelier was plumbed with gas which could be adjusted high and low to provide more or less light), when more jets were turned on, the pressure and flow to any one specific lamp was lessened, possibly momentarily as the system caught up with the demand. </p>
<p>It's similar to how if you are running a faucet and flush the toilet. When the toilet starts and stops filling, the flow rate of the water changes momentarily, then returns to normal. </p>
<p>In the movie, the protagonist saw the lights flickering when the antagonist turned on lamps in a different room. The antagonist then tried to convince the protagonist that the lights didn't really flicker, and that she was just seeing things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: plot spoilers ahead</p>
<blockquote>
<p>!The villain in this film met and charmed the protagonist, promising undying love. We learn that secretly he was using her because she lived in her famous, but deceased, aunts house.  The aunt was a famous actress and he was looking for priceless jewels which he believed to be in the attic. So at night he would sneak up there,  turn on the gaslight, and search around. This caused the light in her room to flicker.  To cover for the fact he was searching he decided to psychologically throw her off balance. It wasn't enough to convince her that her eyes were playing tricks on her with the light, he manufactured situations to reinforce that she was crazy.!&lt;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a related tangent, my aunt maintains that in the theatrical run of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, there is a brief instant where the screen dims just before the shower attack, which has caused a reflexive anxiety in her anytime the lights suddenly dim in real life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The antagonist also does something like gives the protagonist his mother’s broach, and then later steals it out of her purse and accuses her of losing it because she’s “forgetting things.” Which she’s not, but he’s throwing her off balance and maybe she IS forgetful and losing it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, it's the first time I read a definition of it and I now realize <em>that's</em> the word for the second relationship I had in high school. I've always had so much trouble explaining it to people. I knew full well he was telling me riduculous lies (along smaller, less ridiculous ones that I'd truly believe for a while), but he'd twist it in ways that made me question myself and think doubting him was me being a horrible person and hurting him (among many things, the guy lied for months about his own mother being dead, with tearful stories about her funeral and the whole nine yards. I didn't know until a coworker who used to be friends with him told me he'd seen his mother at the store just the other day). He also somehow made me believe everyone close to me was just as dishonest as he was.</p>
<p>I vaguely recall trying to tell friends about it while it was happening and just not being able to put it into words, because saying it out loud really did make me think I was crazy and I didn't really know what I believed or why I was staying. I couldn't even explain my own emotions. The whole thing really messed with my head. For years, I could barely remember anything from that 5 months of my life — even now, a decade later, I can only remember bits and pieces.</p></div>		</li>
