			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, thank you for the explanation. I asked this mainly because my left knee rarely pops but my right one does every. single. time. I squat down. I wanted to know which was good and which wasn't.</p>
<p>EDIT: not repetitively, my right one. Just you know, as often as a popped joint can &quot;recharge&quot; the pop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you have two healthy, normal knees! Who knows why one pops and one doesn't. Don't worry about popping unless there is sharp, shooting pain associated with the pop. Another analogy I use with my patients: &quot;if you buy a new pickup truck and take it down a dirt road, it will naturally make some squeaks, rattles and noises. Does that mean the truck is faulty, or need to be replaced? Definitely not! It's doing exactly what it was made to do.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>And the analogy helps, by the way, thank you!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, as an engineer, if one wheel on  my truck was making making unusual sounds that the rest weren't, I would take that as a sign that there was some potentially detrimental difference between that wheel and the others. For example, &quot;Hey, this tire seems to be accumulating nitrogen at a much higher rate than the others, maybe it's because this tire has more or less wear, pressure, diffusion, fluid accumulation, swelling, circulation, or trauma that causes it to do so.&quot; Then, I could be like, &quot;Hey, this other truck's tire didn't make any noise until someone clipped a curb and sprained it, and then it made that noise all the time until the shocks were adjusted. Maybe my truck has a similar issue that I could address by adjusting the shocks or changing my driving behaviors to minimize long term damage!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it completely normal to have my ankles and knees constantly pop when I'm walking? Seriously, I'd make the worse ninja ever because it sounds like I'm walking on bubble wrap all the time. I've always worried it was a sign of something bad but I don't really have any other symptoms besides the usual day to day pain from working on my feel full-time </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't have a good answer for you, besides getting a good assessment by a local Physical Therapist. Too many factors and questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>haha...my ankles have always popped a lot and from an early age I always joked I could never be a good cat burgler. Sometimes I think I'm going to wake my kids up as I try and escape their rooms after putting them down for the night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it that occasionally a joint will &quot;catch&quot; until you pop it? That is, the joint can still move through its full range of motion, but not smoothly.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/royal_clam" target="_blank">royal_clam</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of variables. Which joint are you talking about? How old are you? What's your medical history? Any diagnoses of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis? Is there a torn meniscus (knee) which can cause 'catching'? Which muscles are surrounding the joint? </p>
<p>Most of the time, if the range of motion isn't 'smooth', it's due to motor control or muscle guarding around the joint, not solely the joint itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same person but I get what he said too. My fingers will often feel &quot;tight&quot; around the joint with the hand and the middle joint until I pop them. Mostly at work where I type a lot. Could it just be bubbles building up from movement then restricting the joints? No history of those things in my family either. </p></div>		</li>
