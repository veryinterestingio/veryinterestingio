			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is like someone asking 'what's happening in my computer when I play a video game?' and getting the reply:</p>
<p>The crux of your question is how does your computer process information. This works by electrifying different pathways, and depends on many wires and components working together. The mouse, monitor, front third and back third of the motherboard are relevant parts. .pngs, .mp3s and .exes are relevant files.</p>
<p>All technically true but really not that informative. We can tell that some chemicals are 'involved' but we really don't know how. Even the idea that neural connections change to encode information isn't definitive - there's evidence that single neurons can 'learn' for example, and some species of hibernating squirrels destroy almost all of their neural connections during torpor but still remember things upon waking. It's all horribly complex and mysterious.</p>
