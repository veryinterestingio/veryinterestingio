Am I misunderstanding the basis that stored info is nothing unless energy is put into deciphering it? It can't be potential energy, I gather, but is this an attempt to quantify information?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting question. I would say yes and no. We only &quot;know&quot; what we can observe, but we're pretty good at predicting stuff. We're so good at it that we don't even realize that we're not seeing a world around us, but rather we're just seeing a mental representation of it created by our brains based on sensory input.</p>
<p>Have you ever gotten the &quot;sense&quot; that there was someone by your shoulder, but when you looked, no one was there? If so, that little shock you felt was actually your brain scrambling to reevaluate your mental model of reality. It's just because you thought you knew that information existed (someone is behind you) but upon observation, it turns out that information was incorrect. But sometimes it is correct, and you don't feel that little jolt because your mind didn't have to correct anything.</p>
<p>However, I do think that that person behind you feels a little sad that you think they don't exist until you happen to look. Kinda selfish, right? Then again, maybe they wanna stab ya. Watch out! Information is dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you further ELI5:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when people argue about &quot;information,&quot; what exactly are you guys referring to? Information and data are such abstract concepts that it feels like people are talking about completely different things when discussing it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building off the 1st question - if I'm understanding correctly, information requires heat dissipation because it's a result of a process rather than an existing thing by itself? By that definition, what else could be considered &quot;information&quot;?</p>
</li>
<li>What's with the comparison to computer data? If DNA is rooted in nucleotide bases, won't those have specific molecular sizes that aren't related to the physical size of data written to computer memory? It seems to me like this comparison makes some assumptions unless I'm missing something.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, this topic is very interesting to me but I know almost nothing about it lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of computer science, information is spoken about in an abstract way kinda deliberately because it is a very abstract concept.  I couldn't come up with a concise explanation on my own, so to borrow from the Wikipedia article on Information Theory: &quot;Abstractly, information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty.&quot;  I usually visualize Information Theory in the context of lossy image compression algorithms.  Let's say you have an extremely detailed picture of a graduation ceremony - you can make out the face and eye color of every single person in the crowd.  That image carries a lot of information.  If you use a compression algorithm on it to make the filesize smaller, you will lose information - you won't be able to determine the eye color of every single person in the crowd no matter how hard you try because the information simply isn't there.</p>
<p>To give another example from wikipedia: &quot;[you can think of information] as a set of possible messages, where the goal is to send these messages over a noisy channel, and then to have the receiver reconstruct the message with low probability of error, in spite of the channel noise&quot;</p>
<p>Re: your 3rd question, size isn't the matter here - information is.  Information doesn't have a physical size.  DNA has 4 possible values, which can be encoded in two bits (A = 00, T = 01, G = 10, C = 11), four of which can fit into each byte (a byte is 8 bits).  You take the number of base pairs, divide by four, and then that's how many bytes of base pairs you have.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is very true! In normal, every day speech, it's fine to conflate the two things. I only brought up the difference here because it is relevant to the way the number OP cited has been calculated. </p>
<p>To answer both of your questions, I'm going to talk about Maxwell's Demon (/u/in_anger_clad you'll want in on this, too). Imagine a tiny box filled with gas molecules, some of which move quickly and some of which move slowly. If we begin with all of the slow-movers on one side and all of the fast-movers on the other, with a barrier between them, we have a highly ordered, or low entropy state. Of course, if we remove the barrier, the molecules will mix and we will end up with a highly disordered, or high entropy state. This is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics (global entropy always increases). </p>
<p>Now imagine that there's a tiny demon sitting outside the vessel. He can tell which molecules move quickly and which ones move slowly, and he can open a tiny door in the barrier to let a single molecule through at a time. By observing the mixed vessel and its contents, the demon could, over time, take a disordered state and make it ordered by sorting all the fast-movers to one side and all the slow-movers to the other. The demon would be breaking the laws of thermodynamics! </p>
<p>Ah, but can't the friction of the door he is opening and closing generate heat and therefore rescue the situation? Well, even if we account for this (people smarter than me have), he is <em>still</em> breaking the laws of physics!</p>
<p>This irreconcilable idea struck fear into the hearts of many physicists for a long time. It was only when information was accounted for (by considering the demon as a universal Turing machine) that we realized that the heat is dissipated when the demon uses the information he has about the gas molecules. More specifically, when he erases information about the speed of the last gas molecule he saw, he must dissipate heat equal to the entropy gain caused by sorting exactly one gas molecule in this scenario. Information actually saves the day here by making this scenario consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>This also highlights the fact that information is a kind of entropy. Roughly speaking, it is equivalent to the number of yes-or-no questions to which one would need answers to predict the next term in a sequence of representational characters which describes a process. In this case, the sequence could be a combination of the letters F and S for &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;, with the order of this sequence representing the order of gas molecules arriving at the door. In this way, it's true that information is really only relevant when we talk about processes, not &quot;stuff&quot;. Stuff carries data, and information is the way that we can interpret that data. It is only recently (last 50ish years) that we have begun to grapple with non-equilibrium thermodynamics (ie the thermodynamics of dissipative processes) such that information has really been useful to understand.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You've got it! DNA is a chemical data storage system and it does extremely well in terms of compression. Each microscopic sperm cell carries 37 Mb and this is significantly less space than is required on your computer's disk drive to store the same amount of data. Researchers today are trying to find ways to store data in DNA for this exact reason, and this is why the question of &quot;how much data is in a sperm cell?&quot; was asked in the first place. If we could easily store data in DNA, we might be able to vastly reduce the size of physical data storage devices, like drives etc. </p>
<p>For those who are more curious, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235" target="_blank">The Information by James Gleick</a> (and if you can get it not from Amazon, even better). It's an extremely <em>informative</em> book about the history and science of information that is readily accessible to laypeople.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for the very detailed response. You and /u/flagbearer223 definitely helped shed a lot of light on the topic. I think my misconception was that &quot;bytes&quot; accounted for physical size - but it seems like it's just a way to quantify something abstract, I guess in a similar way to other units of measurement.</p>
<p>My other major question would be - is information still considered &quot;information&quot; regardless of whether or not it is useful or somehow used? Or is it only truly &quot;information&quot; at the moment that it is used, like when the demon recognizes which molecules are high-energy? If the demon disappeared, would that information still be there? If that's the case then there should be an infinite amount of information about everything, just depending on who or what is receiving it, yeah? (maybe not infinite but whatever the limit of the universe is, if there is one)</p>
<p>In terms of data storage, I think I understand more now about the correlation between physical space and data. Data storage is constantly shrinking because of more efficient ways to store the same information, right? Like going from 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, to 2 + 2, to 2^2 to store the number 4, for example. But in this case the number 4 is analogous to base pairs in DNA.</p>
<p>Sorta tangential but is it known if human DNA is getting more efficient too? Or is that likely to stay static? Do you think human technology will ever surpass the efficiency of DNA data storage?</p>
<p>I am definitely interested in that book. I didn't pay enough attention during my chemistry classes to get a good understanding of these topics so that book would be good for me now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IT guy here. For us there are 4 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>data</li>
<li>information</li>
<li>knowledge</li>
<li>wisdom</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data</strong> is physical, high voltage, low voltage -&gt; yes or no, 1 and 0, true or false. It could be more, ten numbers for example. Or even pictures and texts and sound. </p>
<p>Those 10 numbers don't tell you anything, here comes context and structure. Data with context and structure is <strong>information.</strong> These ten numbers could be the average temperature of the last ten days. Or the time it took a car go around ten laps.</p>
<p>Thats it about those two, but just to make the pyramid complete.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge</strong> is the collection of information and their relations. What do the information mean. Large number for temperature means its hot. A low number for the time it took a car to finish a lap means it was fast.</p>
<p>And finally <strong>wisdom</strong>. You know numbers, what numbers that are and what they mean. Wisdom is, what you should do because of all these things. Making a sensible decisions. doing the right activities or taking the right countermeasures based on your available knowledge. Like knowing the winter is going to be uncomfortably cold, you should prepare your home and gather supplies.</p></div>		</li>
