			<div class="markdown"><p>That letter is pretty standard.  Basically, the FDA won’t let you make health benefit claims about anything without submitting it to the FDA (backed up with data) and having them approve it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the exact scenario.</p>
<p>If you are copying someone else’s drug, a generic, then you can use the FDA approved claims of the original drug (since your approval is based on the same data).</p>
<p>If you are creating a similar drug, like another cholesterol medication that lowers your LDL, then no, the FDA needs to approved your data and any claims you make.  Other drugs may break new ground when it comes to claims, and if they FDA says it’s ok, you’d be able to make the same claims if your data supports it.</p></div>		</li>

Their ads might talk about helping with a medical condition without specifying what that condition is. It'll also say that it is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly?  They are probably breaking the law, but the FDA has bigger fish to fry.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Warning Letters the FDA sends out.  <a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/compliance-actions-and-activities/warning-letters" target="_blank">Link</a> </p>
<p>What you typically see is a burst of letters that target a particular group of products.  CBD is a big one right now.  Then they move onto the next set of products.  Obviously the priority is tackling the most serious issues first - products that could harm people.</p>
<p>If someone is selling homeopathic (just water), yes the FDA should go after them, but it’s unlikely to harm anyone beyond their wallet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting, but doesn’t answer OP’s question. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, FDA is currently not aware of any adequate and well-controlled studies demonstrating that killing or decreasing the number of bacteria or viruses on the skin by a certain magnitude produces a corresponding clinical reduction in infection or disease caused by such bacteria or virus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn’t say that hand sanitizer doesn’t kill 99.99% of bacteria, just that there isn’t adequate proof that doing this stops the spread of disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that specific case maybe but overall it could be bad. You actually need exposure to germs to develop your immune system to fight them and similar possibly much more severe germs. You also need certain friendly bacteria for a healthy body. These products kill all germs indiscriminately. A lot of now common issues like allergies are believed to tie back to less exposure to bacteria hence people pushing for kids to be able to play with mud/outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty interesting take, you got me lost in philosophical thought for a while with this one. </p>
<p>What if you only drive the speed limit and don't get any speeding tickets. Is this considered a financial benefit? You are not worse off but at the same time you have not really gained anything have you? In this case I don't think it is a financial benefit, you have just avoided a potential financial loss.  </p>
<p>Now with health, preventative seems to be considered a benefit. Exercise is beneficial as it can offset/prevent/delay future negative health issues. </p>
<p>But surely someone with a cold could easily acknowledge that best practice is to not shake someones hand whilst sick. Preventative health measures. </p>
<p>So if the situation can be avoided without the sanitizer, is it still a benefit? Or is it a product unnecessarily marketed to the masses to make them believe that they need it in order to avoid illness? </p>
<p>A good question you have raised.</p></div>		</li>
