			<div class="markdown"><p>To be upfront, it's something I really struggle with.</p>
<p>Practice helps. Forcing yourself to enjoy when you're doing the thing you're trying to be disciplined about.</p>
<p>Removing distractions. Turn off notifications, put your phone in another room. Limit easy reward objects in your vicinity. Have dedicated spaces for specific activities - eat at the table, sleep in your bed, work at a desk, create in your studio, etc.</p>
<p>Set short term, achievable goals. &quot;I want to master playing the guitar&quot; is not a good goal. You will fail it every day. &quot;I want to practice the guitar for three straight hours today&quot; is an achievable goal.</p>
<p>Chastising yourself over failure to be disciplined isn't always effective. It can being negative emotional behavior to the journey, which motivates you stronger towards those easy button rewards. In other words, you subconsciously associate working towards your goal with negative feelings, and you have a stronger pull towards pleasing distractions to make you feel better about yourself. When you fail, have an HONEST conversation with yourself about why and fix that problem.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people better than you. This single handedly got me through engineering school. It's how I'm learning to be ambitious with my thinking and my projects now. People who embody your goals inspire you. They help hold you accountable.</p>
<p>Practice. No seriously practice. Keep practicing. Celebrate your good days of practicing. Don't tell people about your bad days of practicing. Not their business. Let them think you're awesome. Pretend to be awesome at practicing. Live up to this fake persona of practicing. Keep up the facade of practicing. You've built this life around practicing, guess it's who you are now. Eventually you realize you've been living up to this fake story of being disciplined about practicing that you accidentally became disciplined about it. Congrats, you faked it until you made it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic response! I've started living like this 9 months ago. I finished my Bachelor's, got in a very good Master's degree program and I've been doing great there, despite being a bad Bachelor's student.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be productive every day, some days I am, some days I'm not, but it's better than not being productive every day. It gets better, but you need to try everyday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think of whatever I‚Äôm working on as a job. Would I rather sleep in than get up and go to work?  Yes!  Do I know that I need to work?  Also yes. When I started running it was something that I knew I‚Äôve always been terrible at and thought generically I‚Äôll never be good at. But, I spent money to get a training plan (I hate wasting money) and literally schedule every single run as a meeting in my calendar. I don‚Äôt always want to run. I‚Äôm cozy and warm in my house, but once it‚Äôs on my calendar I have to do it. Other people can see my runs on Strava. </p>
<p>I ended up surprising myself and have turned into a decent (still not amazing) runner. I thought if I ever hit that point it would mean I‚Äôd never dread running. I really enjoy it overall and love it when I‚Äôm done every time.</p></div>		</li>
