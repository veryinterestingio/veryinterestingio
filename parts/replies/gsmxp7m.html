			<div class="markdown"><p>Storytime!  </p>
<p>So I'm American that grew up mostly in Taiwan. I pop down to the Philippines a few times a year (pre-Covid). It's like $100 roundtrip.  </p>
<p>I met a  group of locals at a beach party and we were all eating BBQ and drinking late into the night.  </p>
<p>Now, I'm a pretty adventurous eater having come up as a white guy in Asia (everyone wants to show me some oddball snack or drink almost daily), so that Filipino group was all about this boiled egg looking thing. My only rule is not to tell me what something is until I have tried it and formed my own opinion on it, discovered a lot of great food that way (coagulated pig blood anyone?). I took a look at it and thought it was a tea egg. &quot;Great!&quot; I thought, and nibbled the egg-white edge to get a sample. Well, not a tea egg but it tastes pretty normal for an egg. The group, filming of course with cell phones, went wild and cheered when I gave a thumbs up. Then everyone unfocused on me and went back to socializing, San Miguel and karaoke. Long live the Philippines.   </p>
<p>I asked the gal next to me what it was as I continued to nibble, she said Balut. I asked what balut was as I go in for a bigger bite. She said it was something down the line of a half aborted chicken fetus, half egg half chicken.  </p>
<p>It was right then when I got to the innards, Now, at that moment I was thinking an eggy-chicken hybrid sounds delish, and that was when I bit into the middle. Part feathers, part bone, part chicken skin, part yolky mess.  </p>
<p>Luckily no one was paying attention to me, I tossed it into the sand by my feet and covered it.  </p>
<p>For the rest of that week they thought I was legendary.</p></div>		</li>
