			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that is because the vaginal region is pretty much pure muscle.
If women clench their urethra with those muscles peeing stops pretty much instantly.
Also women have a much shorter urethra  than men, that also makes them more susceptible to infections because bacteria have a much easier time getting to the bladder.</p>
<p>That's why it's important to pee after passionate hugging, so that all infections stuff stat might get pushed up there is flushed out.</p></div>		</li>
