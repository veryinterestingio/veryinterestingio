<p>As a chilean (you know, southern hemisphere) I chuckle every time one european says &quot;I am from the <em>south</em>&quot;. Then this australian friend also looks at me and we both stare at the european in disapproval. It's super relative and it depends a lot on where you grew up. Someone from Stockholm <em>goes south</em> to Berlin. Someone from Munich has to go <em>all the way north</em> to go to the same Berlin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rome spread city culture to Europe at large (and cities formed around roman garrisons and after their influence dwindled). So yes it I'd say it has plenty of to do with it. Also the fact that cities usually formed around crossroads in trade routes of what north had nearly not as much. Apologize if that's worded weirdly, not english native.</p></div>		</li>
