			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. Also, many incoming photons never reach a rod, instead being scattered by the imperfect optics of the eye. Also, rods are only active when the eye is dark adapted. Also, worth noting that rods only <em>sometimes</em> respond to 1 photon (its a stochastic process).</p>
<p>Also, there is some active filtering of single photoreceptor responses. Imagine how ghastly it would be if 1 photon did lead to conscious perception? Would be like having visual tinnitus</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean..  those two sentences contradict one another.</p>
<p>It's like saying, &quot;People don't actually walk, what they actually do is put one foot in front of another sequentially.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't remember the person's name but there was a physicist whose discovery in the field of high energy physics hinged on being able to visually detect a single visible-spectrum photon that was a secondary product of the decay... matter-antimatter interaction from positron decay maybe?</p>
<p>Anyway that was like half a century ago.  Since then many experiments have confirmed that people can pick up single photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define &quot;Pick up&quot;? Is it a technicality or would you consciously notice if your eye picked up a single photon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine I fired either 0 or 1 photons of light at your eye and asked you to report whether or not there was a light.  Under all but the most contrived circumstances you would perform no better than chance. Under extremely contrived circumstances you would be maybe 0.001% above chance.</p>
