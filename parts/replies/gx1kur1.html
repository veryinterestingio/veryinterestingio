			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, if I recall correctly there is a story in Ancient china around the time of the Minoan eruption (late 17th century BCE) of how the Xia dynasty collapsed due to &quot;yellow fog, a dim sun, then three suns, frost in July, famine, and the withering of allÂ five cereals&quot; (from the Bamboo Annals). There's a theory that the collapse was due to the effects of the Minoan eruption (which unfortunately the original version of the Bamboo Annals was lost and the reconstructed versions have some dispute on their accuracy) and it's fascinating to see how what was essentially two completely different worlds were so uniquely intertwined in their demise.</p></div>		</li>
