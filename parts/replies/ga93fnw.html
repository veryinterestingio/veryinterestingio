			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless there's holes less than 100 feet wide our mapping is accurate enough to exclude such a possibility.</p>
<p>Like the Marianna trench is more of an extremely wide valley than a trench. Like hundreds of km wide in parts </p>
<p>If you just map every km you'll not have a very detailed map, but features in size smaller than that but thousands of feet deep just don't make sense.</p>
<p>Btw we don't even have to go by ship to measure the earth's seas accurately enough for this purpose, there's satrelites that can measure the rough depth by tiny changes in gravity making the sea level change by no less than 10 cm.</p>
