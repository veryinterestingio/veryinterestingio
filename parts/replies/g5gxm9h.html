<p>Thank you for doing this AMA! What are the next steps you think you’ll take in your research on the subject?  </p>
<p>Also, what was it like when you first detected these results? Was phosphine a possibility you’d considered, or was it totally unexpected?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s my pleasure! The next steps for this work are all about reducing the uncertainties of this discovery. First we have to do follow-up observations so that we can unambiguously confirm we detected phosphine, and so we can map its distribution across Venus (and across time!). We also need to keep trying to think of *any* exotic chemistry that could be producing phosphine on Venus without the intervention from life. But, if we confirm phosphine AND we continue to not be able to explain it, we will have to go there and check...</p>
<p>As for phosphine as a possibility: Yes, I have been advocating for phosphine as a biosignature on exoplanets  for a long time, most recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05224" target="_blank">here</a>. But when Jane came to me with a possible detection on Venus, I absolutely freaked out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice response u/DrPhosphine. I have read the paper you have linked and I want to inquire about something. On page 6, you state that &quot;thermochemical studies on the feasibility of the production of PH3 in temperate environments have found no plausible thermodynamically favored abiotic pathways&quot;, and you cite a paper,  Bains et al. 2019a   Section 4.3 and Appendix C. I wasn't able to find section 4.3 and appendix C, and the entire paper didn't have any mention of the word &quot;temperate&quot;. So I want to ask, what exactly did you mean by temperate environments? Is there like a temperature or pressure range?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Section 4.3 and Appendix C are just a little further along from page 6, but they are basically only a summary of our <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971834926X" target="_blank">Bains et al 2019a paper</a> I cite (I'll try to set up a free version ASAP). For my paper, I was considering possible &quot;habitable&quot; planets so we used a &quot;temperate&quot; temperature range between 273 K and 413 K. We didn't know about Venus yet! You can find our analysis of the Venusian possibilities for phosphine <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06499" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>
