<p>For certain definitions of &quot;can be activated at any time&quot;. There are quite a few situations where it's definitely not recommended, even if modern 0-0 ejector seats can be used in a lot more situations than their predecessors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would actually not be one of them. Modern ejection seats are safe for an upside down ejection down to a height of about 50m (the russian ones are supposedly safe down to a height of 35m-ish, but I wouldn't try that).</p>
<p>But all ejection seats have what's called an &quot;ejection envelope&quot;, the limits of when it's possible to use the ejection seat (safely, or at all). Speed, spin, g-forces, rate of descent all put limits on the ejection envelope, although modern aircraft use 0-0 ejectionseats (zero altitude, zero velocity) so that there at least are no minimum limits in terms of altitude (when ejecting upwards) or speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cable slide escape is pretty interesting. Theoretically you hop in this thing and it whips you down into a reenforced bunker where you can ride out the massive explosion of the rocket above. Practically though, a lot of people didn't think it would actually work. It was all installed and setup anyway, for peace of mind. Though I believe that was directed at people like backers in the government and regular citizens. I can't remember where I read it, but I'm certain that most people actually involved in the launch (including the astronauts) knew that if it ever came down to them having to use it they'd be toast. Rocket emergencies tend to happen very quickly. This thing <em>would</em> work well if there was like a fuel leak and you needed to get them away to stabilize the rocket. It would not work at all for something like a fire breaking out on the pad, there's just too many extremely flammable/explosive things in a rocket to allow for much escape time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think it's one of those things that would work in very limited circumstances and they installed it because if those limited circumstances occurred, it would be unconscionable to <em>not</em> have it. Like you said, in most cases, the rocket would go up before the crew reached the bunker.</p>
<p>It was put in as a response to the Apollo 1 disaster. In addition to the resulting funding crisis for the entire program, the ground crew took it really hard and felt that they had to do <em>something</em>. But there's only so much that can be done when you're asking the crew to sit on top of a massive tank of explosives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that was it! Apollo 1 was the main reason, I forgot that. The space program took a massive PR hit after that, understandably. They were actually at risk of having the whole thing shelved for years because of it, which would have given the soviets the moon. They had to take a bunch of steps to appease the public, including things like this that looked like a great idea to an average person who wasn't as familiar with how rocket accidents actually work. The door redesign was actually the best way to prevent that problem, but I'm guessing that wasn't enough to convince people that safety was being addressed so they went with something showy like a neat cable slide evacuation system</p></div>		</li>
