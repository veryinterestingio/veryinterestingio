<p>How do you asses which species am should be shown exactly on a map and which should not be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We try to use conservation statuses from established organizations and governments, so for example, we have incorporated the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/" target="_blank">IUCN Red List</a> statuses (and try to map all other statuses to their status definitions), as well as species listed under the US Endangered Species Act, and species declared rare in California by the <a href="http://www.rareplants.cnps.org/" target="_blank">California Native Plant Society</a>. We have not done a rigorous job of incorporating statuses from all over the world, but we will incorporate statuses on request if people can provide us with a public, machine-readable version of these statuses published by the organization that made them. We also have some limits, e.g. we generally only accept conservation statuses countries and sub-national entities (e.g. districts in Hong Kong).</p>
<p>So, short answer: we try not to assess which species to obscure ourselves. Instead, we try to rely on other established organizations with more expertise and local knowledge.</p>
<p>That said, there are serious limitations to this approach. For one thing, almost no organization engaged in assessing conservation status considers the threat posed by coordinate disclosures specifically. For example, <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/47372-Sequoia-sempervirens" target="_blank">coast redwood</a> is &quot;Endangered&quot; <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/34051/2841558" target="_blank">according to the IUCN</a>, but it is not threatened by coordinate disclosure: everyone knows where they are, they're commonly planted in backyards and landscaping, and to poach one you need a logging crew and heavy machinery (they're the tallest trees on Earth). We address this by allowing site curators to &quot;open up&quot; the coordinates for certain conservation statuses when they seem to be doing more harm than good, preferably after a discussion with biologists and local resource managers.</p>
<p>For another, these statuses may not apply to relevant spatial scales, or accommodate the views of local stakeholders, e.g. the manager of a park might be very concerned about the dwindling population of a local species that is globally common and thus has no conservation status from an established organization. Unfortunately, we don't have a good way to address this issue. We don't have the staff to individually assess the needs of every single park on the planet.</p>

<p>How do you balance the value of creating interest and education in biodiversity and allowing data on its location available to all?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe that making information freely available helps create interest in nature and enables education, so aside from dealing with the locations of populations that might be threatened by the disclosure of those locations, we don't see much to balance. However, that's a pretty big thing to balance.</p></div>		</li>
