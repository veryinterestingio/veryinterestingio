			<div class="markdown"><p>Surgeons wear them for hours on end though.  And they are not air tight anyway - air passes around the sides of them.</p>
<p>Importantly there are two types of transmission for respiratory diseases. Most transmission is droplet - tiny droplets, but they don't float.  So either sneezes or doorknobs.  And to get an infection after touching a doorknob or someone's hand, it typically has to go from your hand to your nose or mouth.   A mask may help you not do that (and also - wash your hands).  </p>
<p>A small number of infections are truly airborne, like tuberculosis.  It can float around a room for a long time, though uv light helps reduce transmission.  But that's really one of only a few infections spread that way (and for tb patients, you will see docs donning n95 masks, not regular &quot;droplet&quot; masks that allow air to escape through the edges).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADDITIONALLY it’s important to note that there is a cultural difference that exists as well</p>
<p>I’m Japan for example people wear the mask when they are sick ? This does a few things:
1) it reduces pathogens as noted in the above post
2) it reduces transmission behaviors like coughing directly into you hand picking your nose wiping your eyes etc all of which can transfer pathogens to hands and then to the next individual
3) culturally there is an expectation that people work (put effort into) to not get others sick. While in most places it’s “not cool” there isn’t a social burden put on you similar to what happens in Japan etc
4) wearing a mask does bring more attention to you and will likely result in people washing their hands and reducing contact when they see you sick because wearing the mask encourages people to exercise good hygiene. </p>
<p>While I’m not sure which of these has the biggest impact they all (including the previous post) play a role in the end result</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the benefits of wearing a mask is that it keeps you from touching your mouth and nose. Less spread by oral/nasal secretions. Many viruses are not airborne. </p>
<p>Separately, areas of the world that do not shake hands as greetings probably have lower rates of viral transmission as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a sterile clean room and we wear surgical masks as part of our suit. Even with heavy breathing the masks never get saturated from breath moisture. If you talk too much and salivate uncontrollably then sure the mask does get wet and that compromises the security of it. The whole suit does expire and get compromised after 4 hours of use so I have to regown before that time.</p>
<p>Btw the point of PPG like that is not to protect me from anything but to keep my bodily germs and bacteria away from everything else. Same concept with surgical wear it’s to protect the patient from the surgeon not the other way around. </p></div>		</li>

<p>clean rooms typically (But not always) have humidity controlled to ~40-50% with very few going above 60% and some that i have worked in going as low as 35%. This factor combined with the high airflow found in clean rooms can contribute to your face mask staying dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as surgery goes. There have been a few studies that are inconclusive for infection rates and wearing a mask vs not wearing a mask when staff is healthy and clean
When we wear them they are more for our protection from fluids and debris, same as eye protection as we can't wipe our face during surgery.
Some cases stuff flies everywhere.  We only wear the n95 masks when tb is an issue, which is rare. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Masks may mitigate some transmission but are they worn all the time or just out in public? The only real effective means to control influenza at a population level is vaccination.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People have the misconception that people get &quot;colds&quot; because it's cold outside when the reality is that cold weather leads to people staying indoors with closed windows excessively re-breathing each other's air making for a contagion hot spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think face masks are a very small part of the variables that attribute to fewer flu transmissions in Hong Kong. They have had to deal with epidemics in the past, and that has put them on high alert for the most part.</p>
<p>For example, South Korea had an issue with <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-september-2018-mers-republic-of-korea/en/" target="_blank">MERS</a>. From what I know, Korea is the only country outside of the Middle East where it spread as much as it did. </p>
<p>One of the MERS patients who was told to seclude himself in his home decided to go against doctor’s orders, and took a flight to Hong Kong. He never got past quarantine.</p></div>		</li>
