<p>RGB are the colors of light you can combine to arrive at pure white or any other visible color of light by mixing them.</p>

<p>I commented on this in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/n0l3qn/if_blue_red_and_yellow_are_the_primary_colors/gw9nk3h/" target="_blank">my comment</a>, but this is not exactly true. RGB (or any set of primary colors) will never be able to reproduce all visible colors of light. Any 3 primary color system is inherently forming a color triangle within a space with curved boundaries, so you will miss some colors at the edge (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model#Physical_principles_for_the_choice_of_red,_green,_and_blue" target="_blank">this</a>). You can cover more colors if you use more primary colors but you won't be able to represent all colors. Mathematically you can use RGB to represent all visible colors, but it requires using negative numbers, which aren't physically possible using today's technology.</p>
<p>The physical reason behind the math for this is that your cones are not detecting pure wavelengths, and operate in a range. If you shine a pure red color to your eye, both your red and green cones will activate, and your blue one should activate slightly too. This makes it really difficult to isolate each cone with a color and stimulate them separately.</p>
<p>I know this seems like splitting hair, but I don't think it is, because the concept of 3 primary colors are actually more for convenience, rather than a hard biological / physical reason. The fact that we have 3 cones do play into it though (it means we need <em>at least</em> 3 primary colors to be able to have enough dimensions to represent the visible colors).</p></div>		</li>
