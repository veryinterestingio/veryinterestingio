			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting question. Genes encoding taste receptors (TAS1Rs and TAS2Rs) and odorant receptors (ORs) are indeed expressed in other tissues, including in immune cells. However, they are not functioning in these other tissues as part of the olfactory or gustatory systems. The best supported hypothesis right now is that the virus is targeting the olfactory epithelium directly  (either the sensory neurons themselves, or surrounding cells) and exerting its effects on smell that way, not via TAS or OR proteins themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some thought that oral zinc supplements could be beneficial (though I can't say I find the data strong). You should consult with your physician, of course.</p>
<p>This is different than intranasal zinc (such as from a spray). This is toxic to olfactory sensory neurons and can lead to permanent smell loss.</p></div>		</li>
