			<div class="markdown"><p>While many other answers are great and more technical, this is the simplest to understand and widely agreed upon by psychologists.</p>
<p>It's also a great answer because it's practical. Distinguishing between these three distinct components of memory, you can improve memory quite easily. For example, many people study for tests by focusing on storage. Read read read read. You hit diminishing returns. Testing yourself strengthens retrieval and can really help recall things that otherwise get vaulted away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some memory research seems to indicate that once you fabricate a detail in a memory that you are recalling it will become a part of that memory permanently. So it seems that accessing a memory also sort of overwrites it with an imperfect copy which may alter the details. Similarly people may actually form memories just by repeating what they read or what they hear and end up thinking it is their own memory. It is very strange how memory works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a frontal attack isn't working, then sneak up on it from the side.  A common useful method is to play music from that era.  Or you might try thinking about the related items for a while, then go do something else; maybe the answer pops into your head a few hours later.   </p>
<p>Or make cookies using your dead mother's recipe and see if you can get through the whole day without a flood of unexpected memories.</p></div>		</li>
