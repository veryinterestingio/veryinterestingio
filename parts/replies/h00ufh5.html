			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes away after a couple of days of running every day. Keep running and it'll get much more pleasant after you get over the &quot;ohmygodicantbreathe&quot; part of starting out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;After a couple of days&quot;? I lived rather active when I was a kid from grade 1 to 9, P.E a couple of hours each week plus &quot;forced&quot; excercise during lesson breaks (choose to play football, basket or street hockey with classmates). And to top it off we had ice hockey practice 2-3 times a week.</p>
<p>The itching never stopped, and it's a major reason I stopped exercising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some people, it is a legit histamine reaction that requires medication. I always take an antihistamine before I run; even if I exercise regularly, I become unbearably itchy when I run. It's been like that since I was a kid. I had a doctor diagnose it and recommend antihistamines prior. </p>
<p>So yeah, sort of? Only running seems to do it. Regular exercise isn't a problem.</p></div>		</li>
