			<div class="markdown"><p>I do actually work for a financial institution, and you're 100% correct. Mobile deposits, ATM deposits, and night drops all must be verified and negotiated by an actual human being. </p>
<p>Checks are so easy to fuck up, that people do it constantly, so it may be non-negotiable in a way the system doesn't understand. The automated systems that parse mobile and ATM deposits are not exactly bleeding edge tech either, they fuck up too. A lot. Trust me, it's a good thing one of us is gonna end up negotiating your deposits. Those systems almost always err on the side of screwing the customer, simply by virtue of being designed so people can't cheat the systems for more money.</p>
<p>And a little advice for anyone reading... learn how to negotiate a check. It's not that hard. Here are the three biggest things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Payee (the person getting paid) - Make sure this name matches your name, or the name of the person you're depositing on behalf of as closely as humanly possible. And don't try to cash a check made out to your spouse unless your institution specifically allows it. Legally, that isn't your name, so you are not the real payee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Date - How this gets fucked up so often is beyond me. Date your checks, if you don't, whoever has the check had the power to negotiate it for whenever they please. Don't accept post-dated checks (made out for some day in the future), unless you're okay with waiting to use it till that date. Also don't sit on your checks. Personal checks become non-negotiable (&quot;stale-dated&quot;)after 60 days, payroll checks usually after 180, and U.S. state/federal checks after a year. </p>
</li>
<li>Amount - The actual damn quantity of the check. Fuck the little box on the right. It could have a picture of dickbutt for all anyone cares. The legal, negotiable, quantity of a check is the WRITTEN amount on the payment line. Make sure a reasonable person can read your God damn handwriting. If you're accepting a check, don't accept it if YOU can't read the amount you're supposed to be getting paid. Odds are, if you can't, neither can I.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, yeah. All of this and more are why an actual teller etc. has to fulfill your transaction, even if you performed it electronically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just one point on the date.  Not every bank cares about them, I had a contractor &quot;lose&quot; a check.  I put a stop payment order on it and wrote him another check.  A year later (nearly to the day) he found the &quot;lost&quot; check and cashed it.  Bank said stop payment orders are temporary (about six months) and didn't care it was a year old.  I had to get the sheriff involved as the bank wouldn't do shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man your institution sucks donkey balls. I'm guessing Wells Fargo? I work for a relatively small credit union, and our system keeps track of stop payments indefinitely. And for the date, they probably just didn't catch it. It was still stale-dated, though and should not have been negotiated. Tellers are human, we make mistakes, but if the institution wasn't fucking useless they should have been able to look at the history of stop payments, see that the draft was no good, and void the transaction. Fuck this making you get the police involved noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stop payments on checks are 6 months unless you renew it. While it was the bank who should have looked at the date, if the depositor had a large volume of checks in a deposit, it likely was overlooked. Unfortunately, that's the pitfall of being a human. It does happen. And it's total crap when it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal cheques are only be valid for 6 months from date of issue, they become stale-dated after that.  A stop order should have nothing to do with why that cheque shouldn't have been cashed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in my bank ? main reason electronic banking is work days is that the systems the banks use were designed and built when electronic banking first kicked off. They're shit and only understand workdays. We've got a shiny new system that banks 24/7 and payments made to other customers are in real time. But we can't exchange payment information with other banks because there simply isn't the infrastructure for it. </p>
<p>Edit: most, if not all, banks have 24/7 monitoring and system support. So, there's always someone around for approvals, support and job monitoring. </p>
<p>Source: have been in electronic banking for nearly 20 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I handle ATM functions and checks as a part of my job at a FI; automated machines don't always fuck the depositing person over, but settling it out always hurts someone. Nothing like having a check misread 64.91 to 64091 and send that through to your and their accounts. You'll get your money back, sure, but you'll probably cry a bit first.</p>
<p>Be glad someone like me works 5 days a week and catches all the shit that slips through the automated systems. You're fucked on Saturdays though (also, good rule of thumb, don't deposit physical checks at an ATMon a Friday or Saturday afternoon - no one will be able to verify that deposit for you until Monday at the earliest, and more likely the next time the machine is reloaded (which could be up to a month later). If something is wrong, it would need to be catastrophic to justify a fallout to pull a single fucked up check (anything over 10 grand really).</p>
<p>In regards to structuring and the original point. We'd probably temp-freeze your accounts if you pulled some bullshit like 4x 2400 and then a 400 deposit. Run it up the risk CoC and file a SAR anyways. It's easier to acknowledge, file and clear a &gt;10K deposit than it is to track multiple items &gt; threshold, so you'll get a resolution faster from the single check.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in banking for almost a decade, and your reply is spot on. Not many services are 100% automated, and many of them require (human) approval if they exceed certain thresholds. At my company, for example, any check over $2,500.00 or any pre-authorized debit that overdraws an account must be approved by the manager of the branch where the account was opened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, thankfully no. Then again, we're instructed not to disclose the exact thresholds to customers (in order to prevent fraud).</p>
<p>Edited to add: If somebody did try something like that, yes, it would be considered structuring. The FBI wouldn't put you in cuffs the next day, but our compliance department would investigate and possibly terminate your financial relationship with the institution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense if you think in the context of an automated factory.</p>
<p>Yes, the robots in most modern car factories could continue making cars even if the people left, but the robots are still turned off when the workers leave for the night, because having human workers act as quality control probably saves money and also makes it less likely that the workers would go on strike out of fear of losing their jobs because they've become unnecessary to the process of actually building the car.</p></div>		</li>
