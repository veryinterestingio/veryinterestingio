			<div class="markdown"><p>New Jersey. Last month we had numerous days in the 10°-20°F range. Last week we had two 60°F days back to back.  What OP is suggesting is in the summer when it’s 80°F, where’s the occasional 30°F day?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol I visited the UK about 5-7 years ago.  Temperatures were in the mid  80s I think and all the talk was about how horrific the heat wave was and how so many people were dying as a result</p>
<p>Yes  I know how their houses are built, still crazy to me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I swear the weather in the UK is just a steady 13-17 C. In the summer it might blip higher every now and then. In the winter it might blip lower.</p>
<p>It's why we have shitty weather forecasts that include terms like &quot;milder&quot; or &quot;brighter&quot;. Bright isn't weather.</p></div>		</li>
