<p>Let's say I have 1000 of something.</p>
<p>Let's say I sell 100 of the something to people for $10 each. They like the something so they tell their friends, and I have a bunch of people knocking on my door asking to buy the something. Its so good, so I offer to sell them for $20 and I sell 400 more.</p>
<p>You'd say, at this point that, because I have 500 left and I sold them for $20 I have $1000 of value, right? Sure.</p>
<p>Well, in the meanwhile, one of my somethings broke. I guess the quality wasn't there. So all of the 500 people who've bought my somethings for $10 or $20 no longer think it was worth $10 or $20. So people stop knocking on my door. So I go to the town square and offer them for $20 each and no one offers. Finally, I find someone willing to give me $5 for one.</p>
<p>With that one sale, my $1000 lost 3/4 of its value and is now worth $250 - $5 = $245.</p>
<p>That is how stocks work. Your portfolio says its &quot;worth&quot; $X but that is only derived from the last sale price. You need to find a buyer at that price, and if no one is buying, you need to lower your price to finish the sale.</p>
<p>There is a reason when businesses are accounting for inventory that it is accounted for at the cost basis, not its value basis. Value is in flux, cost is finite.</p></div>		</li>
