			<div class="markdown"><p>No idea, wish i knew. Eye doctor told me it was a lazy eye when I was 8 years old. Haven't had it actually looked at. I googled it a while back, i think it might be something called an &quot;eye turn&quot;. Would be cool if I could see a single image someday. Recently got some great health benefits that includes vision. It's something I'm going to attempt to correct very soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had amblyopia (lazy eye) and it is different from what you're describing. My non-dominant eye simply added to the part of the visual field that the dominant eye was not viewing (unless I had dominant eye closed) and I couldn't see &quot;3D&quot;. So having the lazy eye closed I would just see a smaller field of view with my dominant eye - no black static overlay though I can imagine what you're describing. </p>
<p>It's possible that vision therapy could help with this issue. It helped me fix the amblyopia and what cemented my stereo vision was watching a ton of 3D movies on my TV (once I was able to see 3D with glasses but not &quot;IRL&quot;). </p></div>		</li>
