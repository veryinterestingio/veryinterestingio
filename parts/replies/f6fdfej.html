<p>Immanu'el. The ' is a hebrew letter.</p>

<p>There is no special letter between the shuruk (the u vowel sound, more of an oo though) and the aleph (the e vowel sound, as in eh) in Immanuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aleph is not &quot;e&quot;, aleph is the ' (or ` but forward facing and my phone cant do that). Hebrew has no written vowels, just mater lectionis and nikkud.</p>
<p>Aleph is not a vowel sound, it is the glottal sound, the push of air, that in this case is followed by the e sound. But the a-sound is even more known, to the point that aleph turned into alfa. And the second letter is bet, making aleph bet, or alfa beta or alfabet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aleph can essentially take the place of a vowel when it is dotted (it's an אם קריאה, i.e. vowel), which is the case in Immanuel, or el in general. It is there to let you know we pronounce this as an &quot;eh&quot;. Aleph elsewhere is pronounced differently, but in this case, it's an &quot;eh&quot; like sound. The only reason you might want to put the apostrophe in this particular case is to separate the vowel sounds (oo from eh), but there isn't an additional letter in the spelling. There is a shuruk for the u (with the parenthetical being that shuruk is technically not a letter but a nikkud marking of its own) and the aleph for the e.</p></div>		</li>
