<p>As you say they are really diverse not only in form, but in function as well! The thagomizer and nematocysts are examples of the diversity in both form and function. So, the first step is to understand this diversity is to describe it. We need to know what sort of structures animals have, how and why they are using it.</p>
<p>After that, we might be able to categorize them according to their morphology and function (I am actually working on a paper about that at this very moment).</p>
<p>There are weapons that evolved for predator/prey interactions and then were used for fighting competitors. The other way might also be true. So, it is all very messy atm but we are trying to categorize them as we go along. What we can defintely say is that, when weapons are used exclusively for fighting competitors, we have a likely explanation for their evolution. Other than that is pretty hard to say.</p>
<p>Regarding the last question, we don't actually know yet. I studied gladiator frogs a bit and they seem to injury each other more than expected. So, still looking for answers.</p></div>		</li>
