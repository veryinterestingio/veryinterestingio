			<div class="markdown"><p>A guy named Friedman made significan inroads into breaking Japan's encryption named Purple which was an improved version of Enigma.</p>
<p>The guy had no example of Purple machines to reference his work off of, but he did look at stepper switches used in Japanese telephone exchanges.</p>
<p>It was a great idea to look at the switchgear that the Japanese were making as a starting point for cryptanalysis. </p>
<p>It also helped that there were many duplicate messages sent with both Purple and less secure (partially broken) encryption methods. </p>
<p>Having examples of decrypted messages and Purple encrypted messages provided the cribs for attacking Purple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't one of the reasons Enigma was so &quot;easily&quot; cracked was the supposition that certain words would be repeated in &quot;each&quot; message, such as ending with HH, or starting off morning reports talking about the weather? Basically if they knew they were going to end most messages with Heil Hitler, that gave them a huge jump start on the possibilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the typically cited example is a German weather station that transmitted a weather report a few times per day.  They could reduce a huge set of the key space because they knew the word &quot;weather&quot; was always at the same position in the message, and a letter could never encode to itself.  They would then attack this message, because they only had to get the first few letters to confirm the key, rather than decode an entire message.  If the sixth-ish letter wasn't &quot;W&quot; then the key was obviously wrong and they could try again.  The built computers could attack this very fast and try tons of combinations in parallel.</p>
<p>This is a subset if cryptographic attacks known as Known Plaintext, wherein the known text meant targeting for a key was greatly improved.  Encrypting a message twice would have eliminated this vulnerability, but may have introduced new one known as a Key Collision Vulnerability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not crypto mathematician, so grain of salt here.</p>
<p>But he was able to deduce the encryption method using his knowledge of currently existing technology and crypto theory right? I'd imagine that would be much harder to do today, because he'd have no way of guessing the encryption method. If you were given a piece of ciphertext today, and provided not hints to it's origin, but also were not allowed access to any previously existing software for decrypting any known methods, this would be a lot harder to solve.</p>
<p>Edit: a quick bit of research later. Rejewski even had access to the training manual for the thing with straight up genuine PT/CT pairs and relevant settings in it. So while it didn't have the technical specs, he had something to go off of. Not to downplay the geniuses who solved the things, but the intel gathered by spies was vital to getting the mathematicians started in the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rejewski had access to the manuals but he did not have access to an Enigma machine. He didn't have access to the rotor wirings, and was able to use permutation theory to deduce, from messages, what the wiring inside the Enigma rotors looked like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General logical structure, but the German Enigmas had unique rotor wiring that he was able to deduce without access to them (nor blueprints)! The Cipher Bureau intercepted a commercial Enigma machine, but it wasn't that helpful at that point, since the interior wiring of each of the rotors was substantially different on a military Enigma.</p></div>		</li>
