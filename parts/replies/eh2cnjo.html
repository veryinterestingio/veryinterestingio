<p>No, doesn't hurt. Most everything has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_controller" target="_blank">charge controller</a> built in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  I mean, it's okay for it, and it will probably last 2 years with acceptable battery life.  But you can prolong a li-ion battery several more years if you know what you're doing and are careful.</p>
<p>These devices mostly use li-ion type batteries or similar chemistry, which have particular charge characteristics.</p>
<p>If you install accubattery for Android, it will sound an alarm when you're charging and it reaches 80% by default.  Read their help info in their app or on their website or for more in depth technical information, see batteryuniversity.com</p>
<p>Charging from 0 to 100 % gives it 1 cycle of wear, and charging 0 to 80% does only a fifth of that according the the research that has gone into this app.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And keeping your minimum charge level at/above 20%  will extend the lifespan of the battery too. Tesla cars do this by default. (I believe their &quot;full&quot; and &quot;empty&quot; are at around 80% and 20% of the actual capacity of the packs, for better longevity.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. The Chevy Volt does something similar, I think it's &quot;empty&quot; at 20% charged and &quot;full&quot; at 85%. Plus they use active thermal management, such as running the air conditioning system to cool the battery pack when it gets too warm while charging and while driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's easy, the catch is you need to live with a lower energy density (that is if you have a 3000mAh battery and only use the middle 2500mAh you will get way longer battery life). The phone manufacturer's don't think  20% less battery life is worth a battery that lasts 5 years instead of 3 years, because really if you want it to last longer than 3 years you can pay for a battery replacement.</p></div>		</li>
