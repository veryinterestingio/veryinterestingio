			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing in a documentary about dreams that we dream in order for the brain to sift through all its inputs. Like maybe its evolutionary . . . Because literally almost everything alive sleeps. Some people say they don't dream, but I would wager they just don't remember what they dreamed.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation can manifest serious problems and even brain cell damage in severe cases (citation needed). My layman's guess is that its necessary as a sort of computer reboot. I wouldn't be surprised if part of it has to do with Earth's rotation around the Sun. Awake day, sleep night, or vice versa. If we evolved while our planet rotated once every 72 hours I bet our brain activity would last longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to dream frequently. You may not recall what you dreamed but you know you did. </p>
<p>In the last few years, I don't even remember having a dream. Not just that I don't remember the content, but the entire having a dream at all.</p>
<p>Inversely, my father in law couldn't recall having a dream for decades. After he had surgery, he has had many vivid dreams. Generally every night.</p>
<p>The brain is wild.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a large extent it’s mostly genetics. However, you can train your brain to allocate processes in the way you want. For example, you drive a car every day, and when you arrive sometimes you don’t even know how you got there. This is because your brain is so good at driving a car and processing that type of information, that you use your sub conscious for the task. Back to your question, if you do a task so often, it is likely to become natural and easy because you are familiarized to that info. If the decisions and choices change every day then the “strong performance” you talk about, may be the quickness/accuracy of your decision making. </p>
<p>As always, sleep helps to keep your tank at full, if you get less sleep you may only have a half a tank that day, or if you get more sleep you have a full tank.</p></div>		</li>
