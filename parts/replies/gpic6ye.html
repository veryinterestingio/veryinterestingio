			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh nice. I was approaching the question from the other side: your brain is like a battery, being awake drains it (some activities more then others), and sleeping recharges it, but it can't go beyond 100% charged. However, if you don't recharge for long enough, you only end up starting the day with a partially charged battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original answer is still better though because when you sleep, the brain actually removes waste build up, hence the trash can analogy is a good fit. The battery analogy works but the brain isn't actually &quot;charging&quot; up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The battery analogy makes far more sense to me, because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However if you sleep lots and lots, your trash-can can't get under 0% full</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A trash can at 0% has had everything removed. You can't keep taking out trash, because all of the trash is gone. So we canceled the sleep debt by snoozing all weekend, right? Mission accomplished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most concise and understandable answer. Plus, it was part of an experiment I did in 2020 struggling after losing my job and working freelance. I could experiment with my sleep a bit and noticed it's indeed like a battery and some activities drain it more than others.</p>
<p>My question would be now, like, how do you get it to 0% if you slept less in a day than the amount of hours you accumulated through the week? There's no way to have it reach 0%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case it's like a lipo battery. It has a minimum charge to keep it useable or repairable. Once you get to that level of below you run the risk of killing the cell. Hallucinating or other mental disorders. Go below those levels and it quits functioning totally.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The trash can being at 0% sounds like you've paid off your sleep debt by sleeping through the weekends. The battery analogy actually works.</p></div>		</li>
