			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. /U/msmoonpie is right. A lot of these infection samples are sent to a state or federal lab like mine where we test/confirm/ and sometimes sequence the strain. For instance porcine influenza is rampant currently.</p>
<p>We create vaccines depending on client and virility.</p>
<p>You can Google search vet diagnostic lab or USDA and navigate to tests if you want to learn more.</p>
