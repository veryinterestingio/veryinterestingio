			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d go a bit further, what causes the explosion is a build up of positive charge in the metal lump. This was detailed in a great paper in nature Chem about 5 years Ago <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2161?proof=true" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2161?proof=true</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice. I always thought hydrogen to be the culprit for any bang you get. But this actually explains why potassium is so much more volatile - I mean, with an equal size of both metals you get a rather distinctive difference in reactivity.</p>
<p>Sodium is one I feel comfortable dealing with, lithium is so lazy you can actually let pupils experiment with it - but potassium? That one I really respect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah completely agree. I’ve had three small fires with potassium and none with lithium or sodium despite using them a lot more frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school our chemistry department would take all the chem classes out to a field at once, and drop the years supply of potassium into a milk jug of water.   And then run.  It got the point across pretty good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen is the culprit but the charge causes the sodium to immediately spread out, drastically increases the surface area and reaction speed.</p>
<p>Otherwise the surface of Na would quickly turn into NaOH and stop reacting until the NaOH is dissolved in water and exposes fresh Na underneath.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you are incorrect here. It is the HYDROGEN that accepts the electrons from the sodium metal. This is how you get H2 gas as a product. The oxugen remains essentially unreacted as part of the hydroxide anion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I am incorrect because I try to simplify and it makes it easier to understand, I am fine with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but you didn't simplify. You added extra ideas that weren't true. It actually made it more complex. The oxygen does not bond to the sodium at all and does not accept any electrons here.</p></div>		</li>
