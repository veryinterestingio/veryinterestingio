			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, Perseverance, the latest rover, is going to collect samples from Mars to be sealed and studied in a later mission (likely early 2030s). These samples may serve as backups/standards of a pre colonized Mars. If certain organic molecules or other indicators of life are discovered in these samples a decade or so from now, we’d have good reason to believe it’s a genuine finding. And future samples can be compared to these samples to ensure they were not contaminated by our presence.</p>
<p>I believe perseverance will also be collecting baseline samples of some sort that would show any contamination from the rover itself to help ensure it’s samples are as uncontaminated as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually work on this project for my job, it is part of the Mars Sample Return campaign. We’ll be launching the return hardware in about 6 years and should see Martian geological samples back here on Earth in 2031. The contents of those samples are the big mystery though. They’ll be collected from an ancient lakebed/river delta. Could be mud, ice, soil, dirt, sand, even (not joking here) fossilized aliens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh nice. My kid is asking me why it takes 11 years to get the sample collected and back here. Can you shed some light on that? He’s reasoning 7 months travel both ways so a couple of years with margin, maybe a couple of years collecting samples. Why so long for the return flight, is it just not ready yet or does it have to do with launch windows?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish there was a public campaign that effectively got this info to the public often and in an interesting way. It seems to me if the average person was more aware of the thoughts and efforts of these projects were displayed it would generate some real excitement and support in the public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all bacteria, but some of them, and the answer is literally evolution, and the ubiquity of life on earth. Find some places that is extremely hostile to life, stick life right next to it for millions or billions of years, and over time any of that life that has mutations that allow them to tolerate the conditions allow them to migrate further into those hostile areas, and reduce their competition with other life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not all bacteria. Basically, if there is an ecological niche that can be filled, life will usually find a way to fill it. Bacteria being what they are, they're usually the first ones to fill the niches.</p></div>		</li>
