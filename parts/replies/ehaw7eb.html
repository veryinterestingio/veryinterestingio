			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Source: mom's a brachytherapy (treating abdominal cancers with seed implant thingies) nurse at our local hospital, and she also used to run the skin clinic. She's usually the one that has to explain prognosis to both the patient and any family that comes along for moral support. She's a very strong woman, but when I was a kid, every once in a while she would come home just that bit extra tired. She generally doesn't want to talk about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm so sorry. my brother and sister in law went through this - my sister in law died at age 35 from stage 4 breast cancer leaving behind ages 3, 4 and 6. it's impossible and unfair. those kids are older now and have adjusted well. they are great great kids.</p>
<p>i'm sure you'll rise to the challenge and be the best dad possible for your kids. please take the time to grieve WITH your wife and to take care of yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter died at 36 yrs of breast cancer after a 9 yr fight.  Her 5 yr old twins, when told by our son-in-law, had lots of tears and sobs for about 5 min.  30 minutes later they were playing in the backyard.  Kids are different of course but are generally resilient.   Like us. They go back and forth with denial.   Wish I had thought of the 'rest' analogy.   So simple to understand.  Son-in-law remarried to a great gal, kids happy.  Good luck to you.  Can't have or give too many hugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bravo. That makes perfect sense for someone with no real grasp on human anatomy or knowledge or cells and such. I would imagine that staging is based off a few criteria that the oncologist reviews: size, area affected, general health and symptoms, and time??</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for silver kind stranger!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Staging is really dependent on the type of cancer and often different prognostic indicators.  For instance melanoma is really complex and will depend on things like the depth,  ulceration,  ect... generally speaking though staging goes from primary tumor only (stage 1) to nodal involvement (stage 2 or 3) to distant metastases (stage 4). But there will be sub staging in many cancers of a, b, c which are dependent on different factors.  </p>
<p>Different types of cancers can also have varied prognosis even with widespread metastases.  For instance a stage 4 prostate cancer will often still have a rather good life expectancy depending on the health of the afflicted person, since it is usually very receptive for a very long time to hormone deprivation (castration) and so will grow exceedingly slowly.  </p>
<p>To answer your question more directly,  the health and age of a person can be prognostic indicators but not used in staging.  They look at nodes,  cancer cell type, and increasingly at the genetic characteristics of the cancer cell itself.  Time can be a factor in prognosis if the primary tumor cannot be removed or completely irradiated, but the initial staging would still reflect only a single tumor even if they know that time is going to lead to metastasis.  So the initial staging may look positive but the prognosis would still be grim. </p>
<p>It's a very complex field and it's ever changing.  ASCO/AJCC staging guidelines have had major changes in the last few years for many types of cancers as researchers learn what prognostic criteria to even look at. </p></div>		</li>
