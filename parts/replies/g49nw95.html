			<div class="markdown"><p>Given a selection pressure that benefited offspring who attempted such? It would probably be a more likely (or at least possibly over a much shorter evolutionary period) than developing gills.</p>
<p>Looking at the shared bone structure among a variety of animals (including classic pictures showing arm/hand/finger bone comparisons among whales, humans, and bats), the structures are there to potential develop back into land-mobile structures. There would still be massive trade-offs, as they’re currently very sleek hydrodynamic design would be compromised. So you’d need a strong selection pressure benefiting those land-exploring offspring to offset the functional losses as fins and flippers became less efficient.</p>
<p>The other part that becomes incredibly problematic are inefficient mid-points and how critical <em>breathing</em> is. Ineffective generalized movement isn’t ideal, but flippered turtles go on land to lay eggs. Being bad at breathing during generations of transitioning between lungs and gills would be extremely precarious.</p>
<p>So in the terms of likelihood and/or ease of adaptation, going back to land living is probably easier. It’s a matter of changing limb locomotion versus swapping out lungs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The other trouble is a gill, especially a simple one would be extremely difficult to maintain along with endothermy (warm-bloodedness)- the circulatory system being directly exposed to ambient temperature water is basically a radiator.</p>
<p>Losing endothermy would be a massive change for our physiology and many of the advantages that whales and dolphins maintain over always-aquatic, cold blooded competitors.</p>
<p>The only fish that manages to maintain whole-body endothermy, the opah, does it with a complex countercurrent exchanger at the gill, and even then it can only maintain a few degrees above ambient temps.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it suggested that whales and dolphins evolved from land based animals to aquatic animals??? I had never considered this and had an assumption that they evolved from mammals that never left the ocean.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that’s definitely more likely, but also something that would take a very very long time from our perspective. They have evolved to live in an aquatic environment despite being unable to breathe in. There would have to be evolutionary pressure over millions of years to get descendants back to land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air has more free oxygen available in it, and so is more efficient at fueling metabolic processes. It not only allows cetaceans to grow larger, but also for them to be more energetic. Which doesn't necessarily mean faster or more athletic, but rather they can use more energy for things like warm blooded metabolisms and larger brains.  </p>
<p>Notably, the other large marine animals throughout time, ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs, were also air breathers. They're the only animals to rival whales for largest animal to ever live, and some definitely got close to blue whale size, though blue whales are still the largest animal to ever live that we know of definitively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lungs are very efficient, so more oxygen available to tissues. And animals with lungs are also warm-blooded. Being able to regulate their body temperature independently means they can hunt in a wider range of water temperatures. Even some large fish moved towards warmer blood (some sharks, tunas).  </p>
<p>But a big driving factor at least for blue whales is their food source. The bigger the mouth the more food they can catch in one gulp. But with a huge mouth you need a huge body to move it. And you <em>have</em> to move from feeding spot to feeding spot from pole to equator and back. But moving so far means you better stash up reserves, making the body bigger, to get those reserves you better eat more efficiently, means, bigger mouth. </p>
<p>With krill density going down in the oceans blue whales won't be able to reverse that development. They're so crazily specialized, it's gonna be their end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that lungs scale in two dimensions, e.g. their ability to do their job is based on their surface area, while the oxygen demand scales with volume, in 3 dimensions. So at some point the 3D whale's oxygen demand outpaces the capability of its 2D lung.</p>
<p>No, it isn't strictly true - a blue whale can dive for ten minutes on a breathhold. If it was so close to hitting the limit where its lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen, they wouldn't be able to payback ten minute long oxygen debts.</p></div>		</li>
