			<div class="markdown"><p>Paint it Black is the most underrated of the Stones hits.    Charlie Watts kills it on that tune.</p>
<p>However, it is not on the Full Metal Jacket soundtrack.  That movie is about how we sent boys over to face horrors all while we had it all wrapped up in patriotism.  The sound track had novelty songs like Surfin' Bird playing while they were in a fire fight while being filmed for propaganda.  It was supposed to be out of sync.  Paint it Black would have been too in sync with the action.</p></div>		</li>
