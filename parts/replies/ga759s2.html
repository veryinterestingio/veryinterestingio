			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had a hose full of gunk. How would you get the gunk out of the hose without sticking a wire up the hose (and therefore risk damaging it from the inside)?</p>
<p>Well, you'd hook it up to a clean source of water and blow it out.</p>
<p>Your ear is a hose full of gunk. Your ear is also creating more wax every day. That wax is the &quot;clean source of water&quot; that slowly blows the gunk out of the hose.</p></div>		</li>
