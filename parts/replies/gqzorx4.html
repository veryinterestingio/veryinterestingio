			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the problem. A lot of people are taught major = happy and minor = sad and it cause problems when they hear a minor sound and don't feel sad. Brightness should be what is taught.</p>
<p>You can listen to major song that feels really sad however you still hear the &quot;brightness&quot; of the scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some really great videos by David Bennett (linked above) on pop/rock songs using specific modes, and they are very interesting especially in seeing how different songs using the same mode can still sound very different.</p>
<p>Another good source is Adam Neely, who made some great experiments with friends, e.g. to crack the Locrian mode (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el1ZhkN85Mc" target="_blank">see here</a>) and he showed that even the &quot;darkest&quot; of these modes can have rather uplifting properties (can you imagine &quot;Surf Rock&quot; in Locrian? :-D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah mode don't dictate a emotion, it's what you do with it however it will still sound like the &quot;mode&quot;. I have never been a fan of &quot;Locrian is awful&quot; you can't just use what works in other scales and paste it in locrian and expect it to sound good, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVBTUGvrRac" target="_blank">I think it can sound quite modern if used correctly.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that many people are taught music theory at a very young age. Calling it happy/sad was the best way for children to understand the difference. It works as a good rule of thumb.
I agree though once you go into it more on a technical level you should see it differently to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His entire premise is flawed when he says to sharpen a note in the major scale to get a brighter scale. Then he shows the darkest scale is a super locrian, which is a major scale with a sharpened root. Unless I'm misunderstanding him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thing as a „scale with a sharpened root“. If you change the tonic in any way, you are in an entirely different scale altogether.</p></div>		</li>
