<p>is says that an engine at its maximum load will be the most efficient, at an rpm range of 1/3 to 2/3 its max rpm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Armed with that, we can see that a.) most automotive engines are far too big to be efficient, b.) CVT transmissions really are a great idea, and c.) it's going to suck when letters A &amp; B become dominant forces in the auto market. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a.) correct, especially American vehicles. if you look at cars in Europe/Japan/Korea, significantly smaller and more efficient, cant even get those cars in north America. </p>
<p>B) correct again, except too  many consumers hated the fact that the engine was super smooth and efficient, so now CVT's are dying off, or including &quot;gears&quot;  which  basically makes the CVT act like it has gears for the sole benefit of &quot;feel&quot; while taking away the most advantageous aspect of it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>C) To those who enjoy driving, especially standard vehicles, have fun before that becomes a thing of the past. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first car that I drove had gears, and trying to accelerate hard was such an unpleasant experience. The car's acceleration would cut out as it changed gears, which seemed like it took a full second for each gear change. Sometimes, when the gears finally reengaged, the car would experience a concerning jolt that made me wince for my drivetrain. Then I got a car with a CVT and its acceleration is SO NICE AND SMOOTH! Ahhhh...</p></div>		</li>
