			<div class="markdown"><p>Historically a lawyer is trained in and can advise you on the law and represent your interests, where an attorney is licensed to practice law and argue before a court.</p>
<p>The terms are synonymous these days, but the licenses still say &quot;attorney&quot;. </p>
<p>Kind of like &quot;doctor&quot; means anyone who has a doctoral degree and physician doesn't necessarily mean a doctoral degree, but we use &quot;doctor&quot; for both colloquially now. Yet the doctors you go to put &quot;M.D.&quot; or &quot;D.D.S.&quot; or the like on their signs to be accurate and clear as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long story there, but it’s a title that means your a lawyer. About 1,000+ years of history on that one. And as a lawyer, the only people I see using “Esquire” are freshly licensed baby lawyers and really pretentious douche bags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an outdated honorific (indicator of social status). It has protected status in some states—that is, you can't use it unless you're licensed to practice law—but it's not required anywhere or anything. </p>
<p>So some attorneys use it as a way of saying &quot;no, really, I am licensed&quot;, much the way people list certifications after their name. It's mostly pretention. </p>
<p>Sometimes it's used if there's another person with your name who isn't a lawyer to say &quot;no, I'm the one who's a lawyer&quot;, though that isn't as useful in the modern world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, American English is pretty straightforward - so it’s interesting to read your examples. </p>
<p>For once, Danish takes the prize in clear definitions.</p>
<p>Just a quick sunup, of how we deal with the same titles:
Power of Attorney -&gt; Fuldmagt (full power)</p>
<ul>
<li>this doesn’t include the word attorney, but just states that the other person has full power to act on your behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attorney at law -&gt; Advokat</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only be an advokat, if you’ve gone through the proper education and are suited to represent in court. </li>
</ul>
<p>Doctor -&gt; Doktor</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone with a doctorate gets this title.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doctor with M.D. -&gt; Læge </p>
<ul>
<li>A guy that will fix you.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American English is one of those things that's straightforward until it isn't. :)</p>
<p>It's easy enough to learn to communicate decently, but passing as a native speaker is tough, especially in any case where there is jargon. We LOVE jargon, and even hobbies generate so much it's almost like learning a whole dialect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American law is derived from English law. In England you have Barristers, attorneys who go to court, and Solicitors, attorneys who give legal advice outside of court. Early American law made a similar distinction, but the categories later merged. The term are now used interchangeably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, “attorney” and “lawyer” are synonymous.  If anything, all lawyers are attorneys but, technically, not all attorneys are lawyers. Someone with a power of attorney can be attorney in fact without being a lawyer.  (As noted above, though, those people aren’t usually described as “attorneys” anymore.)</p></div>		</li>
