			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly the example I was going to use. More males die with prostate cancer than males dying of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>If a male lives long enough, he'll eventually develop some level of prostate cancer. The trick is dying of something else before it gets you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are both treated as chronic until they progress to secondary myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia, though most do not progress. Treatment is mostly to reduce thrombotic events, which are far more likely to occur and hurt/kill the patients.</p></div>		</li>
