			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna leave this as a reply to a few comments that essentially said the same thing as you. This is a common myth. In reality the risk of fire is mitigated in space because of the low pressure of oxygen. The density of the oxygen, not the purity, is what matters both for fires and for human breathing. 3 psi of pure O2 interacts with fire the same as 15 psi of 20% O2. The Apollo 1 disaster occurred because -since the test occurred at sea level- they used pure oxygen at standard pressure. Ever since then, they have made all ground tests use a regular mix of air. For space though, they just use oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has answered the other part of the question. If it's not a pure oxygen environment, what's the method used to supplement the internal atmosphere. Are tanks of gas supplied to the station for this purpose?</p>
<p>Edit: nvm, it was answered elsewhere. They regularly fly up oxygen, air, and nitrogen as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NO, never again (see Apollo 1). Pure oxygen exponentially increases the risk of fire. Materials that are fine in mixed air become insanely flammable and easy to spark under pure oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Scientists are still debating why, but when this type of oxygen generation/reclamation system is utilized, miniature dinosaurs are a byproduct. Usually they are just vented into space once they stop being cute.</p></div>		</li>

<p>water is always available on the south pole of the moon. requires more infrastructure to harvest than on mars, where theres water ice just 3 meters beneath the surface, but still doable.</p></div>		</li>
