			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as the Stanford paper goes - Hospitals face some some logistical issues sterilizing their masks at volume. Hospitals don't normally have the ability to do it themselves so they have to send them out.  According to an in-law that is doctor in MA, companies are reluctant to take on tens of thousands of contaminated corona masks. Given that these are generally single use items there isn't an established business for sanitizing them. Even if there are companies that do sanitization it's probably not as straightforward as it would seem... Although MA seems to have figured out a solution <a href="https://whdh.com/news/mass-hospitals-getting-massive-machine-that-can-sterilize-80k-n95-masks-in-a-day/" target="_blank"><a href="https://whdh.com/news/mass-hospitals-getting-massive-machine-that-can-sterilize-80k-n95-masks-in-a-day/" target="_blank">https://whdh.com/news/mass-hospitals-getting-massive-machine-that-can-sterilize-80k-n95-masks-in-a-day/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if we put them in a vaccuum sealed bag and used a sous vide to control the temp?</p>
<p>Edit:
Vacuum bag would keep them dry and you could precisely hold the 158 degree heat for however many hours they recommend. You could do a few hundred masks at a time</p>
<p>An restaurant sized sous vide could probably do like 50k masks a day easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering the same exact thing.  I suspect that the vacuum sealing process would crush or deform the mask though.  I would also note that in a recent calibration test of my sous vide(reference thermometer at freezing and boiling point), I found it to be just over one degree F off.  So my sous vide is pretty accurate but not perfect like a true scientific instrument. I’d be curious to know how exact that 158 needs to be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lastly, studies from Stanford researchers and others show that baking masks at 158 F (70 C) for 30 minutes can also kill the virus without damaging the functionality of the equipment. However, these are all not ideal or &quot;endorsed&quot; and must be rigorously followed to ensure effectiveness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>important FYI, the stanford study is about N95 masks so don't do putting your cloth masks or surgical masks into a microwave</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't new information indicate putting it in a 170°F environment for 30 minutes to sterilize N95 masks from SARS-COV-2?</p>
<p>I suggest using silicone bakeware to hold the masks, in a digital oven. The elastic straps tend to stick to metal bakeware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also been a couple similar studies done recently in Winnipeg, one with vaporized hydrogen peroxide and one with an autoclave. They have yet to be peer reviewed, but the have done some preliminary testing of the sterilized masks with the novel coronavirus and shown some promising results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Stanford study doesn’t show efficacy of this protocol against SARS CoV-2. They demonstrate the masks can be baked and still filter E. coli, which is filtered via a different mechanism (entrapment and impaction, than viruses (van der waals).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I thought that's what I remembered reading, but wasn't sure. They weren't testing sterilization of Covid19, so much as testing whether the masks could retain efficacy after being sterilized for E. coli.</p></div>		</li>
