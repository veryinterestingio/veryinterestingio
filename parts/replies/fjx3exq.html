			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably correct as I can remember times where I've paid for stuff, and only days later has the purchase shown up in my online banking. I think sometimes when you use your card, the business' system contacts your bank's system and says &quot;do they have the funds to buy this?&quot; While your bank's system says &quot;yes, they do have the funds. Here, let me set them aside for you, you'll get them in a day or two.&quot; Or it says &quot;no, they don't have the funds.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyone else have a similar experience?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why when your card declines, it can still appear that the store took the money as your bank has put the money as pending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I don't think most charges are as instant as they seem, but when you buy something you'll see it online immediately as pending just so you know how much you spent and how much you have remaining in your account so you don't overdraft. Most places it takes at least a day for a charge to clear in my experience.</p>
<p>Most refunds I get back in a 2 or 3 days, rarely does it take 10 full days, then again I don't get a lot of refunds ha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else I've just remembered that can take extra time, but mostly applies to credit card transactions and not debit, is that if a business doesn't have a merchant account with the card company they might go through a third party to deal with that type of card.  In that case the transfers have to go through an extra account, which means more time waiting for authorization, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some Asia banks there's sometimes two dates for credit card transactions. Transaction date (the date the money was set aside/authorized) and post date (The date the transaction was posted/money was actually transferred). And the interest free/interest starts accumulating only from the POST date in order for it to be fair to users.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual words are authorization and capture.</p>
<p>Authorization is to check if funds are available and puts it aside.<br />
Capture is to start the process of transferring funds to their account.</p>
<p>When you make a purchase, they submit an authorization and capture the same day (capture may be batched to be processed after closing).  If you preauthorize your card, your only doing the authorization part of it.</p>
<p>The same happens in a refund.  Just that, instead, they authorize your account to put funds in and then the actual transfer (capture) happens later.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have the technology to completely finish the transaction within milliseconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many banks still use software that is 30 years old. To make it worse, they only process data once per day or only every other day. Even worse, its not automated and needs manual supervision so somebody has to run a file and then make sure there are no errors.</p>
<p>That software can be very expensive and difficult to replace and the new software needs to be compatible to every other ancient software still out there and be very reliable and bug free so it doesn't cause more issues than it solves. That's why the change to faster systems is slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) there's no alternative, so they aren't incentivised to do anything any different</p>
<p>2) even if they wanted to, instant automatic money transfer still has issues. Automatic systems can break/be faulty, and should be checked manually (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery</a> )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure about other answers here, but the reason bank transfers often take a couple of days is interest. The more money the bank can hold at any given time, the more they have invested and earn interest from. So they want to hold on to it for as long as possible. The EU is cracking down on this right now, if I understand it correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m doubtful of this. I can only speak for Canadian institutions but this is not the case at all for us. It’s primarily a security and error catching system. Hence why we in Canada have the ability to transfer funds instantly using a service our banks jointly formed.</p></div>		</li>
