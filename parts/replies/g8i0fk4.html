			<div class="markdown"><p>Scale it up. One inch of rain over a one square mile basin would fill nearly thirty olympic swimming pools at the center. Scale it up some more. An inch of rain covering the city of Atlanta would fill almost three thousand five hundred olympic pools.</p>
<p>Obviously, plenty of this ends up evaporating or soaking down into the ground, and doesn't directly end up in lakes and rivers, but the city of Atlanta averages fifty two inches of rain each year.</p>
<p>And that's just Atlanta. The Mississippi river is fed by water from more than a million square miles of land. That's more than eight thousand five hundred Atlantas (though with a slightly lower average rainfall).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's so hard to keep up with Americans...as if 27,152 gallons was not enough, I'm now supposed to calculate rain in Atlantas. If anyone is wondering, I googled it - one Atlanta is 423752222.22217983^2 yards.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One Atlanta was quite enough for me, four college years there. On a related note, it snowed exactly once in each of those years, and since the city didn't own so much as a shovel, it would shut down for a couple of days. People would trudge through the snow for miles to the Georgia Tech campus to see the obscene snow statues.</p></div>		</li>
