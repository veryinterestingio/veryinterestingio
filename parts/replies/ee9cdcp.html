			<div class="markdown"><p>“May you rest in a deep and dreamless slumber.” Generally people do not dream under general anesthesia. </p>
<p>Though people are quite susceptible to suggestion, especially when under the effect of potent psychoactive medications. I ask my patients to close their eyes and visualize a nice beach, nice vacation spot as I am putting them to sleep. Sometimes it works! </p>
<p>A teenage kid once woke up with a huge boner and desperately begged me: PUT ME BACK! PUT ME BACK! I was on the beach! And there were all these GIRLS!</p>
<p>We all laughed of course. A few minutes later everything wore off a bit more and he had zero recollection of the incident. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aw, man. I just had surgery and wish they had told me to do that, it sounds like such a nice way to to under.  Instead, I went under trying to figure out how they were going to flip me from laying on my back to face down on the pile of foam for my back surgery.  Instead of waking up and wanting to go back under, I woke up with a fat lip.  I think they just dropped me on the pile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s my job in theatre to position people once they’re asleep for the procedure. Basically they put you to sleep and intubate you and then a group of us, maybe 5-6 people, flip you over from your bed on to the operating table. Your head will usually rest on some type of memory foam or gel support shaped to hold your head and provide some access to the ET tube, there is usually a mirror underneath the headrest for the anaesthetist can monitor your airway and face. Your fat lip was probably caused by pressure from a spot where the et tube was pushed against your lip against the head rest or your lip was resting on the head rest for the duration of the procedure. Happens all the time with patients put into the prone position for an extended time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol! I too hate waking from such dreams. I figured the suggestions would be along the lines of &quot;don't forget to pay your medical bills, especially for the anesthesia - we did you a solid.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not and I doubt anyone else has, though it's different for everyone. If you've never experienced it, it's an interesting process. They hook you up to an IV for the initial dose and tell you to count to 10. You usually don't make it that far before you're out, then, provided everything worked as intended, you wake up and it's been however long the procedure took. </p>
<p>There's no real gap when you're out. Maybe a few minutes or seconds. I went down at 1 PM and came back at 4 PM. Felt like I was out for maybe a minute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg same. I don't think I've ever slept so will or even again until I next get put under. I was expecting them to ask me to count down like in the movies but instead he was like, 'tell me when you taste it' and I was super confused for a split second until my mouth suddenly tasted metallic and horrid and the poof. Out like a light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, I didn't even realise when I blacked out. I was counting down with my eyes open and at some point (at 7 I think) I heard one of the nurses calling my name, my eyes were closed even though I didn't recall ever closing them, and I could swear the things I was hearing were a mixture of pre and post op noises. When I woke up I was still trying to count down until I realised it was over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been under a number times for colonoscopies. Once for a major surgery. For the colonoscopies, I remember being told I’m being to put to sleep. But then it’s like a minute passes of nothingness. Then I’m awake and the procedure is done. </p>
<p>For the major surgery, I don’t even remember them telling me they were starting. I remember talking to the anaesthesiologist and lying down. Then I experienced no time. Just nothingness until I woke up in extreme pain post surgery, begging for some pain relief. </p>
<p>It’s a very surreal experience. You don’t remember anything. You don’t dream. Feels like one minute you’re waiting to go under. The next, you’re all done.</p></div>		</li>
