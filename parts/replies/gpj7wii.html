			<div class="markdown"><p>I often take 5 to 10 minutes breaks to either play a game or exercise. I find that some times I need different &quot;puzzle&quot; to solve (like that in gaming) and sometimes I need to reset my mind using physical exercise (like pushups).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my work, a common technique when you are stuck is to wander about and poke your head into other people's offices. Talk about <em>their</em> problems. And suddenly you go unfocused on that, because the solution  to <em>your</em> problem just came up. It unlocks you from getting frozen into an unproductive chain of though and opens up new ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was still commuting to work on the bus, almost all of my work problems got solved in the first 10 minutes of the bus ride home. The next day’s work was implementing the solution until I came to the next problem and the cycle continued.</p>
<p>The office is definitely a doing place rather than a thinking place for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I’m similar and many on my team are similar. Have you been able to replicate this in telework? The creative juices of my team and serendipitous solutions are all but gone. We have teams and e-mail, but there’s such an inertia to using written forms of communication. Just curious if you had any thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's the same with programming or finding bugs in code, you can stare at it for hours and mentally paint yourself into a corner but if you leave it for a while the solution often shows up much easier or at least some ideas for instrumentation that'll help find the problem much easier.</p></div>		</li>
