			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've had a kid and been going through books working on reading, you probably are more consciously aware of it. Though I assume most people (esp. on Reddit) are still aware of it and would recognize it as a 'g'. They just haven't thought about it being different in forever. Just like a circle and stick nine verses and upside-down '6' nine, or an open top four vs. a triangle four, or an 'a' that has a 'tail' on top that goes to the left vs. one that is just a short stick.</p>
<p>Edit: There are tons more trivial differences in flourishes between fonts but those are the ones that stood out to me as being notably different in the actual structural shape of the character (I may have missed one or two). A borderline one is capital I with the bars vs. just a line is probably the one with the most handwritten usage of both versions. Actually the number '1' has the same issue - some will use a line, some will use the top serif and some will use the bottom bar as well.</p>
<p>There's a 'k' where the diagonal links meet at one point vs. where the bottom one intersects the top partway up the line; there's various versions of how to put the &quot;cross&quot; on the G. There's 't's and 'y's with a rounded tail at the bottom, and '7' with or without the bar crossing the middle. etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the International Phonetic Alphabet, opentail ⟨ɡ⟩ has always represented a voiced velar plosive, while ⟨Looptail g.svg⟩ was distinguished from ⟨ɡ⟩ and represented a voiced velar fricative from 1895 to 1900.[6][7] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a case where I can read the words, but have no idea what the difference is. Those well-paid, fat-cat Wikipedia editors should have differentiated with an example (g as in &quot;golf&quot; or &quot;good&quot; vs g as &quot;gentleman&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The voiced velar plosive is the usual English &quot;|g| as in <em>golf</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>The voiced velar fricative is not in native English words.  </p>
<p>If you want an idea of how it works, think of the difference between the word &quot;breed&quot; and the word &quot;breathe&quot;—the 'd' in the first one (a &quot;plosive&quot;) can't be lingered on the way the 'th' in the second (a &quot;fricative&quot;) can, i.e. it's easier to say 'breath-th-th-the' holding a single 'th' than 'breedddddd' holding a single 'd'.  </p>
<p>That difference between 'd as in breed' and 'th as in breathe' is the difference between 'g as in golf' and this sound.  [There are other differences, but we don't need to go into the details here.]</p>
<p>Spanish has the sound in words like <em>amigo</em>.  Modern Greek has it as well (and the symbol that the current International Phonetic Alphabet uses for it is based on the Greek letter gamma).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, word-initial voiced plosives are usually voiceless (while voiceless plosives are aspirated). /gɒlf/ is generally realized as [kɒlf], AFAIK. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we don't have a voiced velar fricative in English and this isn't really a use of the letter in any actual language. But to describe it, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;golf&quot; are the voiced (you start humming the sound of the upcoming vowel with your vocal cords before you make the consonant sound we're talking about) velar (middle-back of your tongue touches the soft back half of the roof of your mouth) plosives (you completely block the air stream and it stops and then pops). The voiced velar fricative would, instead of stopping the air and making a single pop sound, mean your tongue gets close enough to make a hissing sound. You're still humming and sort of gargling but further forward in the mouth where you usually put it to make the G sound or the K sound (the unvoiced velar plosive, same thing as G except you don't start humming and instead pop the air out from nowhere).</p>
<p>Not what you asked for but hope it's fun!</p></div>		</li>
