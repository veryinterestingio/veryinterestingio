			<div class="markdown"><p>What would a planets gravity/atmospheric density need to look like in order for humans to experience that same level of freedom from fall damage I wonder.</p>
<p>Would be fun to be able to jump off a building and not even be bothered by it.</p>
<p>I don’t really know what I’m getting at. I guess it’s like our terminal velocity would be deadly for us if falling from a certain height. At what terminal velocity would we be able to survive like an ant would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminal velocity is reached when deceleration from air resistance equals acceleration from gravity, so that would be a good place to start... I don't know the formula for air resistance off the top of my head (and it would involve factors like whether you were falling in a standing position, with your arms and legs spread to maximize surface area, drag of your clothing etc), but whatever it is, that'll have to equal the acceleration from gravity on that planet (here on earth, it's around 9.8 m/s\^2 but we're considering other planets). And then there's the question of how much force can a human body withstand, which I suspect is also dependent on the angle of impact, but definitely a curious idea, to fall and not take damage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air pressure would be lower so that would increase terminal velocity but I have no idea how much that factors in.</p>
<p>Edit: Seems like dynamic pressure is linearly depending on gravity so that would cancel out? But there's also friction...</p></div>		</li>
