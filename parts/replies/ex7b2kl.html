			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never read a more accurate example of what my experience is. I also had the surgery at a very young age, wasn’t given glasses until 6th grade for astigmatism (which I have had my entire life), and only as an adult was suggested to reach out to a specialized optometrist to review. When I told her I played sports in high school she was surprised. I asked why and she noted that I must have trained my eyes to work. That due to my condition “there was extra work involved” that would have slowed my reaction time in comparison.</p>
<p>When asked by friends and family, I explain it through the lens of the controller drift of the Nintendo Switch controllers, one is off.</p>
<p>Surprising some do not believe it. </p>
<p>Thanks for noting your experience as I had not come across someone with such a similar experience. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had severe astigmatism (first set of glasses at 18 months) (this was in the early 80s) ... I had the advantage of seeing many eye doctors for a long time.</p></div>		</li>
