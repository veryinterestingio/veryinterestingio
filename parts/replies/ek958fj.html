			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, fish obtain almost all their Vitamin D from dietary sources. There are a few exceptions but for the most part, Fish don't synthesize their own Vitamin D because of the poor penetration of UV-B rays through an aqueous medium.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D#Evolution" target="_blank">Phytoplankton</a>  create Vitamin D via photosynthetic processes and these serve as the bottom of the food chain for most aquatic species. Zooplankton eat phytoplankton and then small aquatic creatures eat phytoplankton and then bigger aquatic creatures eat them and so on.</p>
<p>Fish also store large amount of Vitamin D which terrestrial animals don't really do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fish are excellent dietary sources of Vitamin D and much of the non-human arctic wildlife eats fish or other aquatic wildlife that is obtaining Vitamin D from the aquatic food chain. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for humans in the Arctic. In the premodern period, fish covered all the dietary needs of Arctic peoples; those who didn't have access to fish lost melanin to compensate. That's why North Americans and people in far Siberia remain dark-skinned; Norwegians and Icelanders presumably lost melanin before really getting into fishing, since Swedes, Germans, and other related peoples with a primarily agricultural reliance also have the whiteness.</p></div>		</li>
