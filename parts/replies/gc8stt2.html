			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly. Dopamine isn't even a &quot;feel good chemical&quot; like some  say, in the reward system it's the neurotransmitters implicated in motivation (salience &amp; incentive salience) to do stuff beneficial to your survival.</p>
<p>Drug addicts don't seek drugs for pleasure, they answer a compulsion to use that is the product of your brain believing that since using drugs felt good, then drugs are needed to your survival and you need to do drugs to survive. Dopamine is there to make the association and encourage you to repeat the behavior so you thrive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, physical addiction does involve your body adapting to regular use of a drug and literally coming to need it to survive or at least stay “healthy.” That’s why people go through withdrawals when trying to quit drugs like nicotine or alcohol or opioids.</p>
<p>There’s also a mental “addiction” that can occur with pretty much all drugs, which we understand less well but acts similarly to how you described</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my problem, when I started to address the fact that I probably smoked too much weed. There's such a wierd anti-stigma to it, where I had a lot of people insist that, it's not addictive, you're body can't get addicted to it.</p>
<p>No, it doesn't create the same kind of physical dependency of other drugs, but you can absolutely get &quot;mentally addicted&quot; to anything that makes you feel good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try. Recreational drugs don't typically give you a hit of dopamine or serotonin. That would be very bad and quite counterproductive.</p>
<p>Dopamine and serotonin are chemicals released between nerve cells to communicate some information. Essentially, the first nerve cell releases some of these chemicals when it wants to signal something. This chemical then gets stuck between the two nerve cells that are meant to talk to each other. The second nerve cell has receptors for this molecule which can detect the presence of dopamine and serotonin, which will activate the nerve cell. This is how messages are transmitted between nerves in your body.</p>
<p>When the message is transmitted, the nerve cell that released this dopamine molecule will try to take it back. There is a protein that the nerve cell has in it that attaches to the dopamine between the nerve cells and pulls it back into the original nerve cell. This is what we call <em>reuptake</em>.</p>
<p>Most drugs actually use this mechanism to have their effect: they attach to the protein that is meant to do the reuptake, and block it from working. This is called <em>reuptake inhibition.</em> This has several benefits: it causes a net increase of dopamine and serotonin between nerve cells, but it does not cause random dopamine molecules to flow around, it just makes the existing dopamine messages between nerve cells last longer.</p>
<p>If you think of it in terms of electronics, injecting dopamine would be like the interference caused in speakers by your cell phone. It will produce a signal, but it will be very undesirable, because it causes noise you don't want to hear, because it's just interference. Using a reuptake inhibitor is like using an amplifier: it will take the signal that is already there, but make it stronger.</p>
<p>Most drugs work in this manner: antidepressants are typically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cocaine is thought to be a dopamine/serotonin/adrenalin reuptake inhibitor, MDMA is a very potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor, etc. There are also drugs like amphetamines which are <em>releasing agents</em>, which work in a similar way except they decrease the threshold for your nerve cells to release dopamine.</p>
<p>There are certain drugs where this approach works, though, especially chemicals that will just knock you out. GHB/GABA come to mind, which are the chemicals that benzodiazepines (Xanax/Valium/etc.) and alcohol release. You can just take them by themselves, and it will give you similar effects to both -- the general intoxication associated with alcohol. But they are also very dangerous, as you can end up with a fatal alcohol overdose without your body realizing you are poisoning yourself.</p></div>		</li>
