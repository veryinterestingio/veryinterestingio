			<div class="markdown"><p>NasdaqGS is not a market.  It is an index like the Dow.  It encompasses large companies traded, I assume, on the NASDAQ.  I just googled that, so you'd be just as knowledgeable as I in that topic in less than 5 minutes if you Google it too.</p>
<p>Presumably when you hear a newsperson talk about NASDAQ performance it is in reference to an index based upon that market as a whole.</p></div>		</li>
