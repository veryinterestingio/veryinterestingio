			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't point to a reference or source, but I was told at one point that wells were dug on higher ground so that sewage could flow away from the well when you drop it on the streets. Run off from the streets can soak back into the ground and end up contaminating water near the well, so if you dig near a &quot;pooling&quot; area, all that bad stuff can seep down into your drinking water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In scandinavia these used to be seen as holy, so you have areas and cities named after them. The city of Viborg, gets it name from Ví-berg. Ví is the name for a norse holy site, like church for christians and berg just meant hill.</p></div>		</li>
