			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add, humans have more than 5 senses.</p>
<p>A couple of examples include: your sense of space (or proprioception) is knowing where your limbs and body is in space, even with your eyes close. Your sense of time. You can perceive time and &quot;feel&quot; its passing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually have quite a few more senses than five (sense of balance, sense of direction, proprioception, etc...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not against extra senses, but most of the ones theyve said arent.  Sense of balance is just your sense of feeling the liquids in the ears,   proprioception is just feeling and keeping track of where your body last was.  Time, and direction are just your brain keeping track of things mentally.  </p>
<p>those aren't real senses, if you don't know what direction your facing right now, your entire &quot;sense&quot; is negated.  Same with time   With something like touch you can touch something that you don't know what it is, and figure it out.  You cant &quot;figure out&quot; how much time has passed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also If OP wants to see something that will blow his mind here's a video of der8auer inspecting transistors of both Intel and AMD CPUs under an electron microscope.</p>
<p>Those tools, the precision they move with and their capabilities are absolutely mind boggling, and that's not even close to the complexities to things like LHC that were mentioned previously.</p>
<p>Here's the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kQUXpZpLXI" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kQUXpZpLXI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kQUXpZpLXI</a></a></p>
<p>Edit: Also consider that electron microscopes use beams of electrons to image things.</p></div>		</li>
