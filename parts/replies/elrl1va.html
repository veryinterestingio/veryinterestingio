			<div class="markdown"><p>I was dealing with pretty bad psoriasis on my face and itchiness/dryness/flakiness on my scalp last year. Here are the only two products I used that actually worked and cleared it up within 2 weeks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/psoriasin-deep-moisturizing-ointment-4-2-oz-prodid-2080024?skuid=408329" target="_blank">Cream for face.</a> I would apply this in a thin layer right after showers while my skin was still kind of moist. Apply every day, even if you don't shower.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/mg217-medicated-tar-shampoo-prodid-444501?skuid=444501" target="_blank">Shampoo.</a> It's pretty runny so I just pour it onto my head and rub it in, making sure to rub down to the scalp. Rub until it lathers up and leave in for like 3-5 minutes. Use 2 or 3 times a week with normal shampoo on off days. Smells kinda funky but it makes my hair super soft too!</p>
<p>Both can be bought at CVS without a prescription. Hope it helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will have to try the cream! I have spots of either Eczema or Psoriasis in some areas around my hairline and ears. They come and go, and it seems random. I haven't been able to connect it to weather, seasons, temps. But I've read that stress could have an impact. Still, most of the time it feels like there's just no rhyme or reason. It's incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>It's been years since I went to a Derm (my last PCP acted like a body guard, refusing all referrals - have a new PCP now, so I'm hoping for an actual referral). So I've been using this cream my SO has and a leftover one I found of my own from years ago. I know, I shouldn't use the one I found, it's probably no longer as effective - though it does seem to work still. But if I could find a non-presc that actually works, that'd be great and make life easier.</p>
<p>For my scalp - I used to think I had Dandruff, but all the dandruff shampoos never seemed to work for me. What I found <em>does</em> work is <a href="https://www.neutrogena.com/haircare/tsal-therapeutic-shampoo-scalp-build-up-control/6809650.html" target="_blank">T/Sal Shampoo</a>. It's similar to the one you mention - runny, needs to get to scalp and massage in, leave for a couple mins. (Plus, you need to use a decent amount if you have thick/course hair like I do) But it really works well. Felt like a miracle-cure when I found it. They also have one called <a href="https://www.neutrogena.com/haircare/tgel-therapeutic-shampoo-extra-strength/6809466.html" target="_blank">T/Gel</a>, but that one doesn't work the same for me. I don't <em>why</em>, exactly, since they say they treat the same things. But it just doesn't do the trick like the T/Sal does.</p>
<p>Anyway - thought I'd share, along with what you shared, in case any of these might help some folks, too. I know having a flaky scalp and hairline/ears has made me super self-conscious. So anything that helps combat that is welcomed!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn’t seem completely accurate. I’m gonna have to look into this, at least for myself out of curiosity. As far as I know, dandruff is a fungus and dry scalp is just dry scalp because, with the exception of medical conditions and environmental conditions like occupations or hobbies that put you outside, people generally over wash their hair and scalp. The function of sebum is to moisturize and when you over wash, it’s unable to serve that purpose. You can use a conditioner but you’re not really conditioning  or moisturizing the hair. Depending on the product, you’re more likely to be depositing waxes or wax like substances which makes it harder for you to moisturize the scalp and hair because of how strong those waxes bond to the hair and stop moisture from entering the hair shaft and skin. </p>
<p>I see it all the time. Most people who wash everyday have dry scalps and most people who have dry scalp think they have dandruff but the treatment for dandruff tends lead to dry scalp. </p>
<p>Also, sweat and sebum don’t necessarily make you dirty, it just attracts dirt. Like walking in sand after being in the water. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. </p>
<p>As far as barrier function, I have no idea but a healthy body is perfectly capable of producing moisture and as long as you leave it there or don’t remove it entirely the barrier function should be intact. I do know that using harsh surfactants will cause issues with barrier function and most shampoos you can purchase at your local grocery store use pretty harsh surfactants. </p>

<p>Could also be completely wrong but that’s why I’m studying biochemistry. This stuff is fascinating to me, I’ve done a decent amount of reading on it but not an expert...yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had some itchy scalp problems, tried (I think) coal tar shampoo?, fluconazole shampoo, etc. They work for a week and it's back to the same. If I don't wash my hair for a couple of days, it gets awfully itchy, but if it's wash daily with tea tree oil shampoo it's fine. Although I still get flakes, especially if I scratch it.</p>
<p>Then I go camping for 5+ days with no hair washing and it's fine, except maybe some itch towards the ends. It's weird and frustrating.</p>
<p>This didn't happen til I was 30 either...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use head and shoulders itchy scalp. It is traditionally an anti dandruff shampoo but my God the relief... I can go for 4 days without hair washing before my hair starts to get greasy and my head starts itching again. Still don't know what causes the itching but been using that for ~9months and cannot recommend it enough</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you have dandruff which I strongly suspect you do, this blog article could shed some light on what’s going on and give you some options. </p>
<p>Some people need to switch up what they use to treat the dandruff so having two or three dandruff shampoos to switch between might benefit you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only shampoo once or twice a week with a shampoo that's sulfate free, and I'm hoping that means it won't completely strip the oils off my hair, just mostly help wash off the dirt. Occasionally I'll flake up after shampooing but there's usually an end to it after a day.</p></div>		</li>
