			<div class="markdown"><p>The vacuum is used to suck out any air to prevent bubbles, to draw the epoxy through the carbon sheets, and will cause the sheets to lay flatter and better against the mold (again, due to the lack of air).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  Vacuuming is used to get certain shapes, but in general it's just 1) lay up the carbon, 2) apply epoxy, 3) heat treat.   Then those pieces can be joined together if needed to make something complicated like a bicycle frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vacuum does not affect strength in so far as it allows the part to hold the desired shape in some moldings.</p>
<p>It can also optimize epoxy usage (less weight) and help prevent defects (voids), both of which could &quot;increase&quot; the strength of the part, but only by making it match the design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make and machine carbon fiber plate</p>
<p>It's not sheets as much as it's very thin but strong fibers bonded in epoxy</p>
<p>When you hear of things like 3K carbon fiber it means that per &quot;strand&quot; that you see there is 3,000 fibers</p>
<p>What is great about it is it is very lightweight and moldable while having a good balance between rigidness and flexibility</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seems a good conversation starter. What is the difference in why we can make carbon fiber, but  graphine is kinda impossible at scale?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also be flexible for similar reasons only enough. I play ice hockey and use carbon fiber sticks. They are flexible so you can load the stick with tension then as it’s released the stick snaps straight and increases the kinetic energy applied to the puck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're new to ice hockey, and you're not sure which stick to buy in terms of flexibility, just look at the number on them. You want the number that is roughly half your body weight in pounds, so if you are 180, buy an 85-90 flex. This will change a little based on your height and preference, but I found it was a good general rule when I first started!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m gonna piggyback this comment to point out that carbon fiber is not used on the part of the object that sees impact, instead it is used on parts like shafts and handles. </p>
<p>Carbon fiber is perfect for a golf club shaft because it is light and flexible. The amount of flex can be adjusted when manufacturing the carbon fiber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CF design engineer here:</p>
<p>different usage. the strike face of clubs sees much more impact than you slinging the puck, and a club requires a large lobe at the end which is then weighted internally. a stick by comparison is much more composites friendly since it's just a flat thru-thickness face. </p>
<p>I would expect a club to have around 6 plies for the head; your stick could be anywhere from 10 plies wrapped around an insert to just a slab of carbon fiber BUPs for the higher end ones. the stick is much friendlier for production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but the difference there is that the stick doesn't rely on high impulse to shoot a puck, rather the puck is usually &quot;pushed&quot; so that the contact time is longer, or for a fast shot the player will flex the stick on the ice and use that stored energy to power the shot.</p></div>		</li>
