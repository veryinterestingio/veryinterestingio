<p>The only wisely spent Reddit award is the &quot;Party Train Award&quot;, at the very bottom of the awards page, which gives somebody 100 coins for your 75 coins, which in theory should be able to generate more coins than put into the system if given enough time and cooperation. Unless I horribly misunderstood some part of it.</p>
<p>Edit: Hold up, I didn't receive the coins. It actually says you need to get 5 awards for you to get the coins, rendering my plans to crash the reddit economy impossible.</p></div>		</li>
