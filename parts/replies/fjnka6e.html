<p>But this is rare and only occurs with people with known antibodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up the Bombay Phenotype. I'd try to explain it but I'd probably make an error somewhere. There's probably many more lesser known cases where antigens exist that can't receive O negative. The A, B, O, and Rh blood systems are most well known because they apply to a very large majority of the population without many practical problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People with antibodies against other antigens such as c or e will react to O Neg as almost all O Neg is e and c positive.</p>
<p>&quot;O Neg&quot; only covers a few antigens (O from ABO system and D from RhD system). </p>
<p>Other antigens exist too and could be present. There are dozens of antigen systems but not all cause serious reactions. If the patient has been exposed to an antigen before then they could have an antibody against it and will have a reaction. </p>
<p>Some of the serious* ones are C, c, E, e, K, k, Fya, Fyb, Jka, Jkb, Lea, Leb, S, s and sometimes M.</p>
<p>*serious in this case is defined as our guidelines requiring that a patient be given blood negative for that antigen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clinically significant.</p>
<p>Even among the clinically significant antibodies, some are less serious than others. Which I guess only matters when a physician wants emergency release and if they have antibody history, the likelihood of a transfusion reaction has to be weighed.</p>
<p>Like Leb is considered “unlikely” to produce a reaction. But if they have it we will screen for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a little morbid. But if you had an O- pt who was receiving transfusions during a massive bleed and unfortunately doesn’t make it. Can you take the rest of their blood and bank it? Like how we do with organ donors. I’m A+ so screw me, but if I was O- and I died it’s not like I need it anymore and that stuff is rare. Might as well do some good with it.</p></div>		</li>
