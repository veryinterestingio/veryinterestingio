			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s freakin’ bonkers. How do they change the distance between the crystals? Is it a bunch of tiny movements of the layer beneath the crystals? I’m imagining like how horses can twitch their skin but on a whole different level.</p>
<p>And what is guanine? To an uneducated guy like myself it sounds like they might have millions of tiny little diamonds or something beneath their skin lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not correct. The form used in signaling (and RNA) still has the sugar unit, though in that case it's ribose rather than deoxyribose. The phosphorylation specifically occurs at the 5' position on the ribose unit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not a direct parallel, but in response to your question; imagine asking yourself &quot;how do you pull up all the individual hairs on your arms when it's a bit cold&quot;. It's interesting that you can know how, but not <em>how</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a better analogous question would be, &quot;how do you move your arm?&quot;  </p>
<p>I mean, you just think to move the arm and then you do it. It's that simple. But moving your arm is a hell of a complicated process when you actually start to break it down into its constituent parts and you take no conscious role in all of the complicated bits like, &quot;which individual muscles should I contract to make the arm move the way I want it to?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m not sure I understand what you’re saying here, because how goosebumps happen is pretty well understood: tiny muscles near each follicle contract, raising the hair.</p>
<p>Are you pointing out that you can know how, yet it’s still an involuntary action?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't immediately see each answer to your second question, but guanine is one of four basic molecules that comprise DNA (like eggs are to a cake, I guess, but that analogy is very broad). The other &quot;ingredients&quot; are cytosine, adenine, and thymine (which is replaced with a very similar molecule called uracil in RNA, which is like DNA but half as much (one strand vs two strands)).</p>
<p>This might be more than you want, but structurally, all of those are made of a sugar (ribose - the D and R in DNA/RNA stand for deoxyribose and ribose because of this part), a phosphate (call it a sort of caffeine or energy because sticking 1-3 of these on most biological compounds makes them less stable, more reactive, more <em>energetic</em>), and a nitrogenous base (one or two chemical rings which contain the element nitrogen - two of those bonded together is a major component of atmospheric air). It's the nitrogenous base part that differs between all four of those ingredients for DNA.</p>
<p>While guanine isn't diamonds, one of the major components of it and any other organic material is carbon, which when compressed enough does form diamonds. Fun (morbid?) fact, you could literally keep a piece of deceased relatives with you by turning their ashes into diamonds. There's apparently a market for it...</p>

<p>In squid and such, the mechanism is different. They actually expand and contract cells or structures that are filled with different colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cephalopods also have eyes that evolved independently ours. Consequently they focus by changing lens to retina distance rather than reshaping their lens like humans. Cuttlefish also have W shaped pupils to let them see polarisation of light. Cephalopods also use different blood - cyanoglobin uses copper instead of our iron haemoglobin - giving their blood a blue-green hue.</p>
