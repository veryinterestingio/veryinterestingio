			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, theres a few reasons why longer-lived species tend to evolve slower. </p>
<p>Over a longer lifetime, the reproductive rates are generally slower, so they're having fewer offspring per unit time than other species. A slower rate of reproduction leads to slower rates of mutation accumulation and genetic drift, divergence, etc. </p>
<p>If an individual reproduces once, then again a hundred or two hundred years later, their 2nd genetic contribution helps to prevent the gene pool from wandering or drifting too far relative to when they gave their 1st genetic contribution. Imagine a population trying to diverge, but never being able to, because 'old' or 'original' genes keep getting recycled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed on your first point, though I would argue it's backwards. Species that reproduce slower need to live longer in order to reproduce. But that's somewhat circular, too.</p>
<p>The latter portion works but only if you assume a 100 year lag between generation times for all individuals (including initial offspring) and stop checking after the second contribution. It's similar to the question of what contribution an 'aged' yeast mother cell continually contributes to the gene pool of a growing colony. The more generations of offspring the individual produces the smaller the effect of each contribution as the offspring will themselves start to reproduce and those grandchildren reproduce. This process will still allow for significant divergence to occur within populations that retain aged individuals. Such divergences can be observed with the emergence of suppressor mutations that mitigate deleterious alleles within a single colony founded by a single reproducing individual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Generally true, yes, but there exist species with similar lifespans and different reproductive rates. As a purely mathematical function, those that reproduce slower will evolve slower. For example, elephants, humans, and saltwater crocodiles all have a roughly similar adult lifespan, and even become sexually mature at around the same time (their early-middle teenage years) but elephants generally have fewer offspring per individual than humans, which generally have fewer offspring per individual than saltwater crocodiles. </p>

<p>If you're talking about a rapidly reproducing species like yeast, yes. But in populations of trees, the population can have reproductive events every season, but particular individual trees may not successfully reproduce, or produce offspring that survive to reproduce on their own. Assuming a non-trivial lag period between successful reproductive events for some particularly unlucky individual tree, in a species that already has a long lifespan, that individuals latest contribution to the gene pool (it doesn't have to be just the 2nd contribution, then ignore the rest) will have a retarding effect on genetic drift and the rate of speciation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a very invalid question to ask but how does &quot;life&quot; decide the lifespan of a species? Also, if more generations mean more chance of evolution, shouldn't &quot;life&quot; try to minimize the lifespan of all the species? Why do some trees live for 10,000 years but some insects die in a few days?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely not an invalid question. It's a good question, but it has a very, very, very complex answer. To give you an extremely simplified, extremely general answer (that barely scratches the surface of the issue and will inevitably leave a lot out), it has to do with fitness trade-offs &amp; evolutionary pressures. </p>
<p>As species adapt to certain habitats and ecological niches, everything about them will adjust, including their physiology &amp; body size, their metabolism, their behavior, and their life strategies. All of these variables influence lifespan.</p>
<p>Consider a small mammal, like a mouse. These are endothermic herbivore vertebrates with a high metabolic rate, who scavenge seeds, fruits, and other vegetable tissues for food. They are also heavily preyed upon, experiencing strong selective pressure from a whole food chain's worth of predators. For such a defenseless, easily-killed organism, those that mature the fastest and reproduce the fastest are more likely to pump out an offspring generation before they get killed. Those that mature and reproduce slower are more often killed before reproducing, so this trend in the mice life strategy is discouraged; only those that mature and reproduce quickly are preserved over many generations. This evolutionary push towards reproducing faster, with shorter gestation periods, and faster maturation rates makes the animals entire body age faster, and die sooner. This is so, because of the evolutionary pressures acting on the mouse population. This general evolutionary strategy of rapidly producing a large number of offspring, exists in r-selected species. </p>
<p>Consider a larger mammal, like an elephant. These are also endothermic herbivore vertebrates with a high metabolic rate, who eat vegetable tissues for food, but due to their size &amp; social structure, they are not heavily preyed upon. The elephant social structure gives many benefits, including the ability to perform strategic group defensive maneuvers to discourage predators, and a shared community to help raise offspring. This evolutionary context allows elephants to take their time maturing and reproducing; the lineage has been shaped by evolution to prioritize quality over quantity. The elephant offspring take a long time to gestate, and because their babies are so big, the process is extremely nutrient intensive. Furthermore, when an elephant gives birth, it's usually to just one or two offspring at a time, and as these juveniles grow, the parents and the social group invest a lot of resources into raising them to be healthy and active. This is a K-selection strategy, in contrast to the r-selection strategy (to learn more about this, read the K/r-selection hypothesis wikipedia page). </p>
<p>Now consider a large vegetable, like a tree. These are static autotrophic primary producers, and their biggest threats are pathogens (fungal or otherwise) and herbivores. Fungal and bacterial infections provide an evolutionary pressure encouraging the tree (or any plant, for that matter) to evolve pathogen resistance mechanisms, usually some kind of cuticle or mechanical seal that keeps the pathogens out (like the skin), but also includes internal chemical defenses (like a plant-equivalent to an immune system). The herbivores, like a browsing ungulate, threaten the plants life only when the plant is very young and small, but as it ages, the plants is producing enough tissue that any browsing ungulate will likely damage it, but not destroy it completely. Fully grown trees are more or less impervious to death-by-herbivore as the small amount of vegetation eaten by an ungulate is but a fraction of the trees total photosynthetic and vascular tissue. You'd think trees would evolve to mature faster, like the mice, however, due to the physiological and biochemical restrictions of how woody plants grow, evolving to mature faster is not really an option. Instead, the trees (and most plants, honestly) have addressed this evolutionary selective pressure by prioritizing more offspring; more seeds, more pollen, more flowers, etc., to simply roll as many dice as possible when trying to reproduce, in the hopes that some percentage of them will survive to adulthood and reproduce on their own. The key thing here, is that the evolutionary pressure exists mostly on young trees, but when trees become large and mature, the nature of their metabolism (photosynthesis + soil nutrient absorption), their physiology (woody tissue), and their life strategy (like seasonal blooming, etc.) allows them to live for hundreds if not thousands of years. And even then, it's usually a pathogen or mechanical damage that kills a mature tree, not old age. </p>
<p>As you can see, there's really no simple answer to the question. Lifespan is a product of evolutionary forces acting on the organism; threats from pathogen and predator, metabolism and food sources, social interactions &amp; mating strategies, and countless other variables. In most circumstances, especially in the examples I gave, lifespan is not so much a goal, as much as it is a result of evolution working on certain biological forms to get them to reproduce with maximum efficiency in their given ecological niche. Just as the mouse and the tree have wildly different body forms, life strategies, and ecological niches, their lifespans will also be wildly different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;More evolution&quot; isnt necessarily an advantage. Remember, evolution doesnt happen with a goal or intention. Change can be detrimental as well as beneficial, so if a species remains able to survive in its environment, then there is no pressure for it to change. Good examples of this are animals like sharks and crocodiles, which have changed relatively little over time because they remained able to survive in their niches. </p>
<p>Another important thing to understand is that there are many strategies that can be equally successful at maximizing survival in response to any given evolutionary pressure. For example, lets say a species can thrive if each individual has 5 surviving offspring at the end of the year. A species could achieve this by spending all its resourves on having 100 offspring a year, of which 5% survive to adulthood. On the other hand, it could also have 10 offspring a year but put its spare resources into guarding and feeding those offspring, making sure 50% survive to adulthood. Both strategies meet the criteria: 5 surviving offspring a year. Which strategy a species adopts is determined by what variation exists in the species - are there individuals that can have more offspring than others, are there individuals that are more protective of their offspring, etc. Not all options might be equally available, and the strategy that becomes most common in a species doesnt have to be the best one - it just needs to be better than the other ones in use at the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically, &quot;more evolved&quot; doesn't really mean anything. Every lineage is always evolving, even the &quot;primitive&quot; species like sponges and jellyfish, and they've always been evolving since the point way back in time where they all converged into the first life form. </p>
<p>Species like mice dance to the evolutionary music at a faster rate; they accumulate and distribute mutations faster, they age and reproduce faster, and they die faster. This speed allows them to respond to evolutionary pressures faster, but I don't think this cleanly translates to being &quot;more evolved&quot;.</p>
<p>It's like saying something is more complex, so it's &quot;higher up the evolutionary ladder&quot;; this doesn't really mean anything, as evolution can simplify things just as it complicates others. &quot;Simple&quot; creatures may be more resilient than &quot;complex&quot; creatures that need a specific, delicate kind of habitat to survive, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In most long-lived organisms, generations overlap, which means that individuals are born every year (or at some other frequency) and other individuals die every year and the ones that die are not necessarily the parents of the new ones. In a situation like this, phenotypic evolution of the population is better measured using absolute time rather than generations.</p>
<p>In the case of plants and other non-animals you have the additional complication that there is no isolated germline, so somatic mutations arising anywhere in the organism as a result of regular cell mitosis can be passed on to offspring. Absolute time is again a better measure of the accumulation of this kind of mutation. The only relevance of generations to the evolution of these organisms is that when they reproduce they go through a haploid phase and embryonic development, which could expose mutations that are only harmful at these stages, but not others.</p></div>		</li>
