			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely, most deserts are not sand deserts.  The Sahara for instance use to be a huge sea.  What makes a desert is the lack of precipitation, technically Antarctica is a desert its just that what precipitation (i.e. snow/rain) does happen never melts and the snow builds up over time.  While wind, sunlight etc. does cause the erosion of rocks over time, it is not the sole factor in making a sandy desert.  So the loose answer to your question is that what the area was in previous geological times causes the soil type of the desert.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Empty of what, if not more rock or sand? Acidic rain, heating/freezing, and friction is all I can think of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here. Regular day and night cooking processes do not erode rocks in the way we thought they did about 3 decades ago. In fact the regular day and night heating process will only cause erosion if the freezing point is messed with. </p>
<p>A beautiful place to observe this is in the desert belts of the world. The main driver of erosion in the desert is through wind (aeolian) processes and through the minimal precipitation deserts can get. In fact even though temps can change from 110°F to 50°F a day, this temperature change does not do anything to the rocks.</p>
<p>We previously believed that the rocks would swell and shrink respectivley during the day and at night causing cracks to form. </p>
<p>Once you get to a freezing thaw cycle however, the rocks will be eroded very effectively by the process known as frost heaving. Frost heaving/frost wedging is a huge process in most deserts around the world but it is obviously a winter &quot;special bonus&quot; type of erosion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While i get that it wont crack a rock, rocks still expand and contract with temperature, yea? They are still atoms at the core. Maybe wont change as much as something like steel because of the pourous rock surface, but shouldnt it still expand and contract to some extent?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are incorrect. Even in non-desert environments, diurnal solar heating can drive subcritical crack growth and disintegration of rocks. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>E.g. this excerpt from the abstract of a recent paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, we present an 11 mo data set of cracking, using acoustic emissions (AEs), combined with measurements of rock temperature, strain and other environmental conditions, all recorded continuously for a granite boulder resting on the ground in open sun. We also present stresses derived from a numerical model of the temperature and stress fields in the boulder, idealized as a uniform elastic sphere experiencing simple solar temperature forcing. The thermal model is validated using this study’s data.  </p>
<p>Most observed cracking coincides with the timing of calculated maximum, insolation-driven, tensile thermal stresses. We also observe that most cracking occurs when storms, or other weather events, strongly perturb the rock surface temperature field at these times. We hypothesize that these weather-actuated thermal perturbations result in a complex thermal stress distribution that is superimposed on the background stresses arising from simple diurnal forcing; these additive stresses ultimately trigger measurable cracking. Measured locations of observed cracking and surface strain support this hypothesis in that they generally match model-predicted locations of maximum solar-induced tensile stresses. Also, recorded rock surface strain scales with diurnal temperature cycling and records progressive, cumulative extension (dilation), consistent with ongoing, thermal stress-driven subcritical crack growth in the boulder.  </p>
<p>Our results therefore suggest that (1) insolation-related thermal stresses by themselves are of sufficient magnitude to facilitate incremental subcritical crack growth that can subsequently be exploited by other chemical and physical processes and (2) simple insolation can impart an elevated tensile stress field that makes rock more susceptible to cracking triggered by added stress from other weathering mechanisms. </p>
