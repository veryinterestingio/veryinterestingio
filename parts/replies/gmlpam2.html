			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this describes me. I'm hoping that I return to &quot;normal&quot; eventually after my SSRI use. I took zoloft for 8 years and still feel like it could be causing me my issues even since I finally stopped months ago. Maybe it'll be a full year off until things resolve but no one really knows. I'm glad I have at least enough sexual function now but really miss how much pleasure is gone. I had a really weird episode of back and pelvic pain when I cut back use which coincided with the sexual issues. They didn't stop when I reupped the dose either. Months of agony. The PT doesn't think it's exactly due to the physical issues at this point. It's all very frustrating not knowing and terribly slow working with various providers just ruling things out. In general I feel like my nervous system is out of whack on matters of pain and sensation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Took me more then a year after taking Lexapro for 90 days for the side effects to go away.     freakin ZAP ZAP ZAP was so annoying, thankfully the reason i quit the drug (the one side effect I had while using it that was too much to handle any longer ) went away in about a month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you have no more of the prolonged effects. I remember a month of &quot;brain wooshes&quot; when I finally got off zoloft (I even tapered), but wow was it a year of brain zaps for you? Any other issues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just restarted Lexapro. No weird zaps but I get really anxious when I start and stop taking it. Nothing like a random panic attack to start your day off right :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an encouraging counterpoint, I've been on Zoloft for a decade and it completely changed my life for the better with basically no side effects at all.</p>
<p>Antidepressants effect people VERY differently, so don't feel like one person's bad experience means a drug won't work for you.</p>
<p>My best friend went on Wellbutrin and it was DEVASTATINGLY bad for her, whereas I went on it a year ago (in addition to the Zoloft) and it has been amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I know you didn't ask but I want you to know that my quality of life has increased substantially since I started Zoloft. (I did have to add in Wellbutrin because I missed orgasms lol.) But fwiw, it brought me so much mental and emotional space to work on coping and working through my issues. It's been 3 years and the difference between the person I was and the person I am is staggering, in a good way. There are trade-offs for sure, but I would do it over and over again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your doctor prescribed it to you because you were having major problems and you are getting good benefit please take that into consideration. Zoloft worked so great for me for years, I felt really well and got through a lot of shit which I'm grateful for. I truly believe I needed it when it was prescribed to me. I think it was a wise decision for the doctor to prescribe it to me granted risks (known or unknown), and many people don't have problems.</p>
<p>I still don't know what's my own case and it's just speculation about the aftereffects of the SSRI on me in particular, and the topic is not well researched. I don't want you to have great anxiety about it, just take care of yourself friend. You'll probably be fine. I sought out therapy and could have done this more so earlier on, and seeing a psychiatrist I felt was a good thing for managing medications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes years to go back to the same number of opioid receptors, if ever, but they do increase in as little as 24 hours with no usage. This is why youâ€™ll see folks who take a few days off from using (going home for the holidays, getting arrested, running out of supply, etc) overdose using the same amount they were before taking that break. The number of receptors has started to increase, so their body is more sensitive to the dosage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can confirm. ran out of weak antidepressants after around 9 months of continuous use and my doc was too retarded to give me new ones as an emergency treatment. soon i was mentally on the verge of dying for a month, like i literally didnt have the will to eat, drink, go to the toilet or even clean myself, so much so that i obviously couldnt go visit the doc or the psychodoc. once i wasnt in the pretty much vegetative state and went to see them again to ask for new pills, they were just like: &quot;oh well it seems like you dont seem to need them anymore, let's just keep it this way&quot; bruh. i'm struggling to this very day.</p></div>		</li>
