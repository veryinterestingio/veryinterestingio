			<div class="markdown"><p>Without knowing any more, this sounds reasonable since nuclear waste needs to be thought of on the magnitude of hundreds of thousands or millions of years. Do you know more about why this isn't how we are handling nuclear waste?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/dont-dispose-waste-in-ocean-trenches-1441116" target="_blank">this</a>, it looks like there's a few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's too slow (in 10,000yrs, the waste would travel at most 1/2mi down into the crust using the fastest subduction zone)</li>
<li>It's not reliably secure (chance of the waste being spewed back out in magma/mud flows around the subduction zone)</li>
<li>It's logistically expensive and risk prone (shipping waste out over a deep sea trench, burying it at depth, etc all without any accidents like the oil industry)</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, so the fastest plate over the course of 50 years would only move it like 12 ft. And I imagine it's hard to contain something for 50 years at the bottom of the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear waste can actually be recycled. It may not be monetarily feasible right now, but it is good to keep the waste in a place where it can in fact be accessed and recycled when we need to in the future, such as when easily mined Uranium deposits start to run out. This page has more details on the recycling process: <a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/recycling.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/recycling.html" target="_blank">https://whatisnuclear.com/recycling.html</a></a></p>
<p>From that page one interesting tidbit:</p>
<p>&quot;Typical reactors only extract a few percent of the energy in their fuel. You could power the entire US electricity grid off of the energy in nuclear waste for almost 100 years&quot;  </p>
<p>Long story short plans like &quot;shoot it into space&quot;, &quot;put it into a subduction zone&quot;, or &quot;dilute it&quot; would be incredibly wasteful, and completely prevent us from getting future benefit from what is in fact still a valuable resource. The very fact that the waste is still radioactive is because it has an immense amount of energy left in it, and just because its not economically feasible to access that energy now doesn't mean that will be true forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw Bill Gates talk about this once several years ago! I really hope technological advances continue on the recycling direction because nuclear energy seems like an excellent possibility for clean power, but nuclear waste is simply too much of a burden for that to be the case right now.</p></div>		</li>
