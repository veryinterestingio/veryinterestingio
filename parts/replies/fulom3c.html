			<div class="markdown"><p>Flash could run fine on mobile. Adobe released Air which let Flash run on mobile. Apple banned Air, claiming that Flash drained mobile batteries too fast. This is possible but also possible is that Flash challenged Apple's app store as Flash allowed people to run random apps on iOS without buying them in AppStore. Also possible is Flash was a security nightmare and Apple didn't want to deal with it.</p>
<p>Anyway, Flash ran on Android and iOS, Apple banned it, and that was that, Adobe gave up on AIR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the best things Apple has done is help slaying that beast. It helped the development of newer, saner, web techs. It helped the success of the App Store, and all of us consumers are better off because of it, regardless if we use Apple products or not. Android wouldn’t exist as it is today without the competetive pressure from Apple, and the opportunities slaying Flash opened up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly disagree that we are better off with the success of the App Store. Steve Jobs claimed we needed to kill Flash in order to support web standards, yet Apple has been extremely hostile to web standards and stifling the web's progress. Mobile web absolutely sucks, and I place most of the blame on Apple. And to be honest the current state of Apps is far from ideal in how they silo information and herd users. The real opportunities for a robust, open, and ubiquitous platform will likely never be attained while Apple commands so much power over web standards. Apps as they currently exist are mostly just shiny UIs that actively disempower users.</p>
<p>I am not disagreeing that Flash eventually had to die, but the web is a better place because Flash inspired people to push it forward, and actually allowed web standards to compete alongside it. Apple is a far bigger beast and enemy to the web than Flash ever was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple didn’t ban AIR - you can still build iOS apps with AIR today. They just never allowed Flash in the browser, which is where the vast majority of Flash content lived.</p>
<p>I remember it being slightly annoying, since HTML video wasn’t widely supported yet and a lot of video on the web relied on Flash. Within a couple years it was fine though; web tech got better and people started ditching Flash to reach iPhone users.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flash runs ok on mobile, just download puffin browser. Only issue is the periodic ads when loading flash content and the lack of keyboard support (they have an on-screen game pad which kinda works) I occasionally use it to play old flash games and it works fine :)</p></div>		</li>
