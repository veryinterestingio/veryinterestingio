			<div class="markdown"><p>Do I assume correctly that you are talking about commercial fossil hunters? Academic paleontologists in North America are very divided on this. (European and Chinese researchers usually work with commercial and private collectors.) I know many commercial fossil collectors and welcome them as long as they abide by all laws for collecting and show professional standards in other respects (example: accurate, detailed records for sites with fossils).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that is what I meant. Thank you for the answer. Also are there regions of the world that are impossible to access now that you are dreaming of excavating? Can be for political or geographical resasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are welcome. There are some promising regions for paleontological research that happen to be conflict zones (e.g., Mali) or areas where the locals are deeply hostile toward Westerners (e.g., Pakistan, NW Nigeria). Sometimes, when the political situation changes, access becomes possible.</p></div>		</li>
