			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it killed quickly, does that mean the rate of spread was dramatically slowed? On top of it not being contagious until you present symptoms, did it actually &quot;kill itself out&quot; once the restrictions and public policies were in place? I guess, was it too deadly too quickly to be....as effective? as Covid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of its spread was slowed slightly by how quickly it killed people, but the bigger factor was it made regions and groups of people giant glowing red targets so willing/forceful Quarantine was dramatically easier.</p>
<p>Also helped that the summer heat basically destroyed the virus. Or at least reduced it to the point scientists downgraded it to backburner for finding the &quot;Vaccine&quot; for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Ultimately, testing, quarantine, and contact tracing was 100% effective worldwide. Testing was easier, because the symptoms were hard to miss. And contact tracing was easier, because people were so sick they didn't go out (or they died). It also wasn't as infectious as Covid-19 (thanks partially to summer heat and partially the hardiness of the virus outside the body), so it spread slower and gave us more time to react.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key difference is that with SARS-1 people werenâ€™t contagious before showing symptoms. There were fever checkpoints everywhere and those with symptoms were given a mask, tested, and isolated. It was a combination of symptom checking and mask wearing that prevented SARS-1 from becoming a pandemic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Covid 19 sounds like the opposite of SARS tbh.  SARS high death rate once infected but low contamination rate where Covid is the opposite (except for Elderly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a question of balance of attack, do you yell and scream, and start killing people right away ensuring you get identified as deadly like SARS1 and Ebola. </p>
<p>Or do you quietly poison the community for days, not killing them but demanding resources respond and become victims,  quickly building a team of unwitting accomplices to spread poison, like Covid.</p></div>		</li>
