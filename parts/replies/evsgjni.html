<p>I believe this journalist was using the papers to look into corruption in her state (Malta); she was not the author of the papers.</p></div>		</li>

All persons named in those papers are living life here just like they used to before the revelation of panama papers. The media coverage and attention to the story was so meh that the public doesn’t even hate those people for it or even acknowledge something like this happened. It’s fucked up. And old. I’m bored of doing this everyday, what is the world coming too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A reminder that when WikiLeaks got leaks of the Panama Papers, which exposed the corruption of Vladimir Putin, they <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/17/wikileaks-turned-down-leaks-on-russian-government-during-u-s-presidential-campaign/" target="_blank">refused to publish them</a> and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/717458064324964352?lang=en" target="_blank">publicly called them a plot by George Soros to make Putin look bad</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: long paragraphs checking some keywords like &quot;narrative&quot; and &quot;claims&quot; for everything that sounds bad while brushing of clear written evidence that Wikileaks called an independent investigation that made Putin (among others) look bad &quot;a plot by Georg Soros&quot; are not exactly helping your points, guys. Neither is making this about Trump. Talk about bias and propaganda...</p></div>		</li>

Wikileaks definitely has bias in selectivity for what information they sought out and published.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having read this article and others like it in the past, what strikes me about it is that there is no real  way to evaluate the claims about wikileaks without accepting uncritically the claims being made.</p>
<p>The claims are made by the US govt investigations.  Journalists who reported them had no more insight and evidence than the assertions about &quot;evidence &quot; being made.</p>
<p>The claims are made only after the US is given a very serious blow to the credibility to its electoral process, among other things. </p>
<p>Compared to wikileaks responses about how info already had  been published elsewhere, or them not publishing from sources they couldn't verify, there was no way to in my opinion to simply take the word of US claims.</p>
<p>What is clear is that wikileaks had published material about Russia in the past.  So what had changed? FP atte.pts to fill in the blanks with anecdotal claims.</p>
<p>What didn't they give weight to?
Well for one, it  has clearly  become an extremely important goal to discredit such an important whistle blower organization. If their was no hidden agenda of misconduct from wikileaks to find, It would be necessary to create some.</p>
<p>I am not impressed by Foreign Policy in their efforts here to critically asses competing  claims. They are supporting a narrative - even going so far to cherry pick claims and make irrelevant points which infer Assange's relationship with Russia. This is where they show their hand.</p>
<p>One can easily imagine re writing their story with a different slant using much the same info and their selective  style of what is relevant to the issue with  a very different tone. </p>
<p>If they showed an ounce of critical distance from the narratives being pedaled, I would take it more seriously.</p>
<p>I want to see a journalist give a serious critical appraisal of what constitutes  evidence, and make their headlines fit  accordingly. Otherwise, I will assume they are fulfilling the typical US media function as propagandists for US interests  which HAS been documented at length.</p></div>		</li>
