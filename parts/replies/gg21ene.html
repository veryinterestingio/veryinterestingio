			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses astound me in their ability to just do nothing. Obviously being able to stand without using energy helps but still.</p>
<p>During college I worked at a horse camp during the summer. When it was hotter than about 70 to 75 F out, the horses would stay in the barn even after we let them go at the end of the day, and I used to go up and just sit down on the tie rail in the center of the barn and watch the horses do horse stuff. In every movie that involves horses, they always add a ton of sound effects of the horses whinnying or nickering or whatever. Also like snapping at each other, little cat fights and so forth. In real life, in that sort of situation horses kind of just stand around mostly, without making any noise whatsoever, and when they did infrequently move it was very slow and an indirect manner. </p>
<p>It was actually extremely calming, and it was kind of cool once the horses got to know me a little bit they would sometimes meander over and just touch me really gently with their noses, on the arm or something, looking for pets and/or snacks. Their noses are so soft, and when they wanted to beg they would put their nose right in your face and make sniffing noises. It looked comical because it's really hard for them to see right in front of their noses, so you would see their eyes desperately straining to make eye contact with you. I couldn't help but laugh every time</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are actually a ton of microscopic critters living inside your body, specifically in your intestines. They help break down the food we eat even further, so we get more nutritional value out of the food we eat. </p>
<p>Also, have you seen humans? We spend a <strong>lot</strong> of time just sitting around doing nothing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't other animals have this too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in the example of hummingbirds, we obviously eat a lot more but because of their small size they eat comparably much more when looking at it as percentage of weight.</p>
<p>Hummingbirds will flap their wings 200 times a second. If you were capable of doing that with you’re arms, you too would be using a lot of energy and need a lot of food.</p>
<p>But compared to other animals we do eat a ton. Several species don’t need to eat for years due to their low metabolism, olms and tardigrades can slow their metabolism and go decades without eating.</p></div>		</li>
