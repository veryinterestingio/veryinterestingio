			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. The polygraph is an interrogation device, not a proof producing one.</p>
<p>On this regard, GAD and other stress-related disorders (eg PTSD, SAD, Burnout) can make one react differently on the polygraph. This might be or not be taken into account in decision-making.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I took and failed a polygraph for a law enforcement position, right after I separated from the marines. I was 100% truthful.
About a year later, I was diagnosed with GAD. </p>
<p>I never really understood why I might have failed besides polygraph examinations being junk science.
But maybe the GAD played a factor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it’s not the polygraph that you have to beat but the administrator.  His job is to stress you out enough to make you upset enough that your not calm and collected on the examination and he can make truthful and false answers stand out on the test so that he can tell them apart.  Anything that can make you sweat, make your heart palpitate, make you hesitate... But this also means that on the flip side if he can’t make you have any reactions then he can’t tell the difference between when your telling the truth and when your telling a falsehood.  This is an inconclusive response and it’s why polygraph administrators think people are trying to defeat the test thereby invalidating the test.   There’s an art to polygraph tests... it’s not straight up science and hence why it’s inadmissible in court.   If I were you I would reapply for the law enforcement position and try again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so fucking frustrating that we use such a shitty bit of pseudoscience as part of a government-endorses applicant screening. It's just as (which is to say, not at all) credible as the Farmer's Almanac or a horoscope or a divining rod. Why the fuck are we just accepting this as part of government? It's fucking ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to all sorts of factors, polygraph itself is so unreliable that it's really used as more of an intimidation/interrogation tactic to get information/confession (which of course would me admissible in court)</p></div>		</li>
