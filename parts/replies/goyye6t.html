<p>In Canada at least, in my area, there is a lot of granite rock and not a lot of soil on top. The granite has traces of uranium, the decay or which, which normally leaches trace amounts of radon into the soil. Unless you scrape it up and build a house on top of the slightly radioactive rock to contain all those gases.</p>
<p>My house has an air exchanger in the basement. It cycles the air with the outside as to prevent any buildup of harmful radon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These masses of granite and highly-metamorphic granite form the Canadian Shield. This is one of the primordial nuclei of the North American continent that, actually being less dense than the rock deeper in earth, buoys the continent and prevents its being consumed and recycled like the oceanic crust is. </p>
<p>Because of the chemistry of granite, it contains a large part of the earth’s radioactive material, like uranium, thorium, and certain rare earth elements. </p>
<p>While not actually significant enough to cause a measurable health effect, people can get exposed to higher doses of radiation inside large granite buildings than the normal amount on earth’s surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly though many of the areas with the highest rates are those with the deepest soils and overlying limestone over that bedrock i.e Southern Sask and MB. Conversely, some of the lowest rates are over <a href="https://gin.gw-info.net/service/api_ngwds:gin/en/images/hydroreg/shld.gif" target="_blank">the granite shield region</a> (Labradour, North eastern and central Quebec, Nunavat).  Since this map shows reported rates, the distribution might be unrelated to the shield but rather testing and reporting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reporting is test results with high radon levels as a percentage of all tests done.</p>
<p>Manitoba has very high levels due to the clay soil and clay layers in that soil, put down by lake Agassiz. The clay traps radon in the ground, until a basement is dug and acts as a gas well. Saskatchewan is very likely Similar, but I'm not familiar with their local geology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those measurements are divided up by health region and averaged, which causes artefacts like this.  There's probably just a big blob of high-radon-level crust in SE Alberta that fades out before it hits the border with Saskatchewan, resuting in a boundary that looks a lot more striking than it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, nuclear engineer chiming in to give a +1 to this comment. Statements on cancer and density are correct. In fact the whole post looks good. </p>
<p>Bit of expansion on the cancer thing:</p>
<p>radon is particularly damaging if inhaled because it's a reasonably spicy alpha emitter at ~5.6 MeV. Now alpha particles are large and carry a decent amount of kinetic energy but they do not have penetrating power. Alphas are stopped in several cm of dry air, or by a piece of paper and generally they don't pose an external dose threat. The reason they're so harmful when inhaled is because of how sensitive your lung tissue is. Without the protective layer of dead skin and whatnot that protects your body, alpha particles cause a lot of kinetic damage to your cells.</p>
<p>Also, just as a note, if you, OP, are worried about radon, collecting, you can get an extraction system installed in the basement. We've got one in our home as it's built on top of granite bedrock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! As a former radon lab owner, just one point of clarification, the mitigation systems don’t really extract radon- ok, they do- but that isn’t the design principle at work. The idea is to change where the lowest air pressure exists. Without a system, the lowest air pressure in a house is in the basement, as warm air leaves the top of the house, and air is drawn up from the basement, replacing it. Then the negative pressure in the basement leads to soil gas being drawn into the basement. </p>
<p>A radon mitigation system works by depressurization of the sub slab space- applying a vacuum to the area under the home- thus reversing the direction of airflow- causing makeup air to the house to be drawn in from above ground, instead of the sub slap space. So while radon laden air is extracted via a mitigation system, the mechanism by which is works is actually more about pressure differentials than straight removal!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for answering so many questions in this thread, the subject is fascinating.</p>
<p>We live in an area where granite is abundant and our house is built on granite ledge.  Our primary heat source is a woodstove in the basement.  Is radon heavy enough to stay in the basement or does the stove-heated air drag it up into the main living area?  I've searched about this topic and not found anything conclusive as it's an unusual situation.</p>
<p>Thanks for any insight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loving the term &quot;reasonably spicy&quot; to describe a radionuclide. </p>
<p>Only one thing to mention, it's a bit weird to say &quot;kinetic damage&quot; to your cells, which gives the picture of the cell being damaged by impact and mushed to oblivion. Instead it's the ionisation produced by the alpha particles as they slow down in tissue. If this either directly interacts with the cell nucleus' DNA or indirectly damages it by hurling free radicals all over the shop, then we have a chance of causing cell death or a cancerous mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I gotcha. I used &quot;kinetic&quot; because alphas are just so damn big and do create knock-ons and such because of their size. Heavy charged particles almost interact more like a wrecking ball than something like an electron will. But yes, it is ultimately ionization and subsequent effects.</p>
<p>Also I promise it's a scientifically accurate term to describe things by spiciness :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Because it's a gas that enters your lungs. It gets trapped in the lungs, and the lungs get the heaviest radiation dose from the daughter products.&quot;</p>
<p>Adding to this: Radon undergoes alpha decay. Alpha particles are fairly easily stopped, for example a sheet of paper or even a  jacket can block then. Once, the Radon gas is in your lungs, however, there is no protection between the alpha and your cells. The alpha particles then act like bowling bowls crashing into your DNA. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just nit-picking at this point: </p>
<p>Radon itself doesn't get stuck in the lungs. It's a noble gas. Instead, once it undergoes alpha decay, the particulate daughters will be trapped in the lungs (for the most part.)</p></div>		</li>
