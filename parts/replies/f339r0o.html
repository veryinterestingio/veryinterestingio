			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy gets it. It's not just driver error and the ripple effect. The bottlenecks at the exits are an insurmountable cause of traffic that would slow everyone down even if everyone drove perfectly.</p>
<p>That's why there will still be traffic (but less) once everyone is using automated cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These were the things I came in hoping to see. One more thing to add is that a lot of expert planning goes into reducing the effects of traffic. This is why you may see roundabouts, one-way streets, 4-way stops, lights for cars entering the expressway, and many more that I'm probably forgetting. These things all slow the flow of traffic from multiple directions in order to ensure that all directions keep moving, even if slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple contributing factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>People moving too slow (as you guessed)</li>
<li>People moving too fast<br />
(someone who is moving <em>slightly</em> faster than regular traffic is not as big of a problem as someone moving <em>a lot</em> faster than regular traffic - the analogy would be comparing regular walking pace to a fast walk to a run)</li>
<li>People refusing to allow a merge</li>
<li>People who don't know how to merge in</li>
<li>Inattentive people</li>
<li>Angry people</li>
<li>Frustrated people<br />
(usually those who have no control over other parts of their lives and are going to &quot;control&quot; this part of their life by frustrating other people)</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>You could probably break each of those (and other types of people) into sub-types that would further define/refine WHY they do what they do and HOW their behavior will affect others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So much this... You're making it worse for yourself and others by not allowing people to merge. </p>
<p>One more thing that affects traffic flow is roadway design. If there are a bunch of closely spaced on/off ramps, that will slow traffic down. If the ramps are cloverleafs, that will slow traffic down. If the ramps are largely used by truck traffic, that will slow traffic down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The sub-type for this one that’s a big problem are the people that take forever to recover after braking. You don’t have to go 20 below for 10 seconds because someone in front of you tapped their brakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are all correct, and my comment does not necessarily relate to the topic at hand but man, you just helped me realize why I enjoy frustrating people on the road so much. Thank you for the internet therapy session.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be this way though. Slow people <em>are</em> fast people's problem because they clog up traffic. But fast people are only a problem for slow people because they make it so. Just move the fuck over and everything would be OK. But <em>noooooo</em> they have to play traffic cop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while back, my town spent a couple of million on a computer-controlled traffic light system that covered a three mile stretch of road in a business corridor. </p>
<p>There are two dozen traffic lights on this stretch of road. The previous system used the standard combo of under-pavement sensors, and timing. So none of the lights were coordinated with any of the other lights. This lead the four lanes each way to be packed bumper-to-bumper at rush hours, and still a headache most other times during the day.</p>
<p>The new system changed it to be mostly timing-based. BUT the traffic lights along the corridor were coordinated with each other such that, if you drove between 35-40 mph, you would get green lights the whole way along. After people got the idea (via road signs and a huge advertising campaign), rush hour traffic actually flowed smoothly for the first time ever. It was glorious.</p>
<p>Thing is, this is a college town/tourist town. Besides, there are always assclowns bent on 'beating the system'. In this case, the system was designed so that the faster you drove, the more red lights you'd hit.  You'd think these idiots would learn, but no. Turns out that dodging and weaving at high speeds through dense traffic causes accidents.</p>
<p>After about a decade, the traffic light system was replaced with another one that was even better. The timing of the lights was now adjusted based on the volume and flow of traffic. Speeders caused the system to adjust make the lights cycle faster, slowing traffic down <em>for everyone</em>. Traffic flows very well now, no matter the time of day, and speeders are all but a thing of the past within the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> 'Fast' people were everyone's problem, until they were dealt with. Self-driving vehicles will eliminate the rest, and make things faster for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the problem are actually the dickheads, slow people will at max slow down to their own slow rhythm which is not optimal but it's consequences would just slow traffic to their slow standard, while that micro breaking form the dickheads will actually end up eventually creating a chain reaction that will end up stopping traffic completely.-</p>
<p>Still, i think we need higher minimum speeds because slow drivers are fucking stupid.-</p></div>		</li>
