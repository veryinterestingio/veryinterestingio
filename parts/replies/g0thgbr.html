			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting topic. The interesting part is that in animal studies ice does decrease edema and micro vascular permeability - there is a clear mechanism for why it should work. In clinical practice ice is used by a lot of medical professionals after tissue damage. But there is a lack of randomized controlled trial evidence to actually prove it works. My personal opinion is people don’t put ice on early enough or correctly. When it is used early and correctly, I’ve seen good results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. Basically, you need to cool the tissue down before you get swollen. And when I say cool the tissue down, I mean actually make the tissue of your knee/ankle/etc cooler not just the skin. Where you see this being done effectively is in sports locker rooms where they shrink wrap a big bag of crushed ice around someone’s injured joint as soon as they are off the field (or they just submerge in an ice bath). And in surgery, where they put a device like a polar ice around someone’s joint under compression as soon as they are out of OR for a knee replacement (most common joint I see this). </p>
<p>If you are a regular person and you sprain your ankle hiking, and it swells up before you get home and then you give it two days to see if it is actually injured and then you decide to put 4 ice cubes in a ziplock and rest it on your ankle while you watch tv... you might as well just not do anything and you won’t get chilly. Seriously though at that point once swelling has set in, you want to apply effective compression with elastic bandages, elevate and move the joint through its range of motion gently. I will say too be careful with compression wrapping, doing it wrong can make it worse. </p>
<p>Instead of worrying about all this, you could just go to a physical therapist and they will know what to do! I am a physical therapist...</p></div>		</li>
