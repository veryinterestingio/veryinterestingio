			<div class="markdown"><p>Playing left handed and being left handed are two different things. Lefties are invaluable in hockey, right handed kids often train to play lefty knowing this. Never saw that 70% figure before now, is that real?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a phenomenal short little podcast by Radiolab on left-handedness (based off a book “A Left-Hand Turn Around the World”): <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/whats-right-when-youre-left" target="_blank">What’s Right When You’re Left</a>. There’s some mention of language in here in addition to some basic sports references.</p>
<p>I also want to mention that there are far fewer language systems than there are languages. I’m not an expert in languages, but you need to understand the development of language as an oral form of a communication to later a written form using symbols then alphabets which then later other languages would borrow to put their words into writing. So these “systems” that are left-to-right or right-to-left are basically alphabet systems, not languages. All of Latin-based languages are left to right because Latin was originally left to right. All Arabic-based languages are right to left because Arabic is right to left. Moreover, these languages might not even necessarily share much with the original language that provided the alphabet that was later used. Maybe English shares a lot with Latin, but does ancient Ottoman share much with Arabic? Probably not. I’m not even sure if Arabic is the source language for the Arabic letters that are the basis of a lot of languages either, and this is probably similar case to many base alphabets out there - it is associated with one language, but may have an origin elsewhere.</p>
<p>All that is to say, I’m sure there are reasons why some languages are written one way and others the other way, but one would need to go back to the source of the alphabet to answer that question, and when they do, they might not find an answer anyway. Great question though and I am curious if any work has been done on this.</p></div>		</li>
