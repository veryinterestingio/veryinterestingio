			<div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety can definitely have detrimental effects on IQ scores, due to patient's mental preoccupation with their anxiety or topics related to their anxiety. This preoccupation lowers patient's focus on the current task and can therefore reduce their ability to encode and recall information properly. In my experience, these effects are less pronounced in anxious compared to depressed patients.</p></div>		</li>
