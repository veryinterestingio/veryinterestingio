			<div class="markdown"><p>Starting around the 1500's on warships they would use furnaces to heat the shot, which became somewhat standard by the 1700's. Heated shot would cause ships to burn and powder magazines to ignite, enough of an advantage to equip naval ships with iron shot furnaces, despite the fire danger. It was almost like an ancient super weapon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hot shot was not used on ships in the 1500s. They had barely figured out naval gun carriages by that time. One reason the Spanish Armada failed was because it took an hour to reload their ships because they they were using land guns that couldn’t be drawn back in deck to reload and so the soldiers-not sailors I mind you-would have to go outside the hull to reload their ships. Proper ships of the line and standardized construction techniques for these large men of war didn’t come around until the 1700s and by that time there were shot furnaces on some of the ships but it’s was by no means standardized. </p>
<p>Most ‘hot shot’ was used by land batteries as they shot at attacking enemy vessels. As you/anyone could imagine it was incredibly risky heating up a cannonball on a moving ship while it was under fire. The shot had to be heated to red hot, then carried over to the cannon. Then the power and a wet wad of rope had to be put in before the ball so the hot ball didn’t detonate the powder inside the cannon. It was a long process that doesn’t really make sense to do while trying to get off as many rounds as possible during a naval engagement. There are testimonies from many ships captains from the US navy and Royal Navy that detest the use of hot shot because of the risk to the ship that it posed. It sounds like a no brainer thing that makes a bunch of sense until you recognize the logistics that went in to something like this. </p>
<p>This is not to say it wasn’t used but it was by no means a standardized practice that was used throughout naval warfare, it was not and a fairly rare occurrence for a ship to use it during an engagement. </p>

<p>Sorry, I don't understand this : isn't the point of the powder to detonate anyway ? What is the difference between doing it with the rope and the ball doing it itself ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of a ship heating shot, I've only ever heard of it done at fortifications on land. In addition, British naval doctrine (in 17-1800's) called for rapid, sustained fire at short range to inflict damage. Heated shot would be more difficult to load, not to mention you'd need the facilities to heat a whole broadside worth of shot at once. Earlier doctrine was about longer range fire from long culverines which would probably make more sense with heated shot, but again I've never heard of it being done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most famously the USS Constitution, the entire French Romaine Class Frigate-bombard line (though the furnaces were later removed), the CSS Virginia (aka the Merrimack), American Gunboats in the War of 1812 (most famously at the poorly named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro_Fort#Battle_of_Negro_Fort" target="_blank">Battle of Negro Fort</a>). Lots of one off instances too among French, British and American navies.</p>
<p>HMS Superb during the Battle of Algeciras Bay lit one of two Spanish ships on fire at night with heated shot. Some of the cannon rounds went over the first ship and hit the second, with the second believing the rounds had come from the first ship and that it was British. They engaged each other, crashed, and both exploded as the fire spread from one to the other, with the Superb already sailing way.</p>
<p>HMS Warrior, at the end of the hot shot era, went one further with furnaces designed to fill shells with molten iron. 64lb guns with 24lbs of molten iron filling the shells. Devastation.</p></div>		</li>
