			<div class="markdown"><p>and is why smart investors take note of a company changes fiscal year arrangements. You can make a quarter look better by pushing the returns to the next quarter and then pushing them back when the new quarter arrives. This is often done at the same time as channel stuffing. (counting product shipped as sales, so shipping more than your distributors and retailers actually want, marking up big sales and then quietly taking back the surplus in the next quarter)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My boss worked at Rubbermaid years ago, and he told us that with the trash cans, they’d get returns from distributors who wanted the “new SKU” and stuff, but it didn’t count as a lost sale. So they’d basically “sell” the same damn trash can multiple times to the same people...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me that’s not true at all.  My charge rate doesn’t get lower and the partners don’t cut them a deal for being fiscal.  I don’t get paid overtime during busy season so it doesn’t cost my company any more money when I work a 95 hour week.  We just charge and move on.  If I work on a company for 200 hours in November vs 200 hours in March that doesn’t do anything different to my charge rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like balancing a million checkbooks spread out all over the place that have all been maintained by different people throughout the entire year and that all handle really different things (wages, income, expenses, etc). It's settling all of an organization's money for the entire past 12 months, so it's a whoooooole lotta tedious paperwork. My place's fy closes on June 30 and I'm already getting started on that year-end paperwork now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that retail companies need to do inventory at some point. You don't want to be trying to count your inventory in December when your primary objective is to get the inventory to the stores as quickly as possible. Better to do it after the Christmas rush - and return period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other responses are missing the point. Ideally you (and shareholders) want to be able to compare your year over year changes. If you’re a winter apparel company and 90% of your sales are Nov-Feb and your fiscal year ends at the end of December then you’re splitting the majority of your sales months into two different fiscal years. It would be hard to tell if your 2019 financials for the year are good because you’d be looking at half of the 2018-2019 winter plus half of the 2019-2020 winter which are completely different selling seasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. To add on to that, retailers like Macy's have a 1/31 year end because it puts the January returns in the same fiscal quarter as the previous November/December sales.</p></div>		</li>
