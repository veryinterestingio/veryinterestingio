<p>The initial premise of the Ehrenfest Paradox involves a rigid object and pulsars aren't rigid.</p>

<p>Doesn't relativity show that nothing can be perfectly rigid anyways, because otherwise you could push and pull on a long enough, rigid rod and transmit information faster than light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a cool “paradox” involving a pole vaulter who runs into a barn (at 86.6% of the speed of light, as one does). His pole is 10m long but the barn is only 5m long. However, due to relativistic length contraction the pole is just 5m long in the frame of the barn, and at the moment the pole is entirely contained within the barn the doors slam shut simultaneously, and stay shut.</p>
<p>However, the pole vaulter sees a 2.5m long barn - only a quarter of his pole fits in the barn before the door slams shut. Given that the entire pole is verified to fit inside the barn, what’s happened? This isn’t just a simultaneity problem, because the doors stay shut forever.</p>
<p>The answer: the pole isn’t rigid. It takes finite time for the information about the door at the far end (which closes first, when the front of the pole reaches it) closing, and by the time it reaches the back of the pole, it’s inside the barn (we’re assuming the barn withstands a few gigatonnes of TNT equivalent in kinetic energy slamming into it). I’m fact, if you solve the wave equations for a material relativistically, you see the wave speed approach c as Young’s Modulus - rigidity - approaches infinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured the entire thought experiment breaks down when applied to the real world since everything getting up to that speed would be obliterated. Has there been anything in the universe observed to go really fast without breaking down into roughly-fundamental particles? Maybe a planet large and fast enough that its gravity would hold it together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's due to relativity. Push/pulling compression waves travel at the speed of sound of the material. However relativity may have some role in proving that no material has a speed of sound greater than light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the resolution to the grandfather paradox is that causal relationships only exist in one direction respecting time. It isn’t that it’s unresolved, it just rests on false premises</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even those are paradoxes in that there are resolutions, but to resolve them requires giving up very familiar ground, like the idea that causality must be a chain of events rather than an event loop. Once you permit causal loops, the grandfather paradox just turns into (one of) the type of sequence of events that can lead to a causal loop forming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick survey of dictionaries shows that a paradox using paradox to mean either an apparent contradiction or an actual contradiction is common usage.

			<div class="markdown"><p>In scientific context, like here, it's never the &quot;actual contradiction&quot; definition. For those situations we use the word contradiction itself, to highlight that we have a situation that really doesn't have a resolution. When using paradox, it's always under the &quot;apparent contradiction&quot; meaning, where any seeming contradiction comes from assumptions about the underlying laws of physics. Relativity is a great &quot;real&quot; source of them (with examples like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGsbBw1I0Rg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGsbBw1I0Rg</a> being nicely accessible), with temporal physics a great &quot;hypothetical&quot; source of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd think this &quot;paradox&quot; only appears to an observer, not to the star  since to the center of the star a point on the surface doesn't appear to be moving relative to it (assuming it is a rigid body).  It's movement is rotational, not radial.</p></div>		</li>
