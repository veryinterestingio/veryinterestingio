			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a Vive and glasses (Rayban Wayfarer sort of frames) and my glasses fit in the headset just fine! The lenses in the headset are far enough away that they don't touch my glasses, and it's not uncomfortable to wear both. A little more uncomfortable than just the headset perhaps, but easily tolerable for several-hour sessions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a Rift and I have not had the same experience. I have to put my headset on a certain way just to get my glasses in there, and even then I kind of have to force them in. Once in they end up rubbing against my face and I have to push them forward to the point of touching the Rift lenses just to get them to a point where I can use the headset with a tolerable amount of discomfort. That's assuming they haven't been smudged by my face or fog up, in which case I have to take everything off, clean them, and do the process over. So if anyone is like me, with a big head and big glasses, I would not recommend the Rift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What version of the rift do you have. This guy made a 3d printable insert for the cvv2 that allows you to use zenioptical glasses lenses as inserts. If you have the same version I'll find the link for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried my mates vr headset and quickly realised I needed to wear my glasses to see anything, that made it the most uncomfortable experience then they steamed up and all I could see was a huge gap between my face and the headset around my cheeks. 1/10 experience put me off wanting to buy my own set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can buy prescription covers for the VR lenses themselves that work pretty well. You don't need a prescription to order, but you do need to know what your prescription is. You can usually get that from whatever office you go to for your eyeglass prescriptions.</p>
<p>I got mine from <a href="https://vr-lens-lab.com/" target="_blank">VR Lens Lab</a>. They've provided long sessions with complete comfort.</p>
<p>In searching for other companies that offer lenses I saw a reddit post about VR Lens Lab specifically warning others not to buy. The reason is barrel distortion. I experience this as well but not severely so, but thought that was just part of the deal with lens adapters. Apparently it's not, but rather just VR Lens Lab. So.. Here's some alternatives. I'll be ordering a pair later today from one of the other vendors and see if they are any better.</p>
