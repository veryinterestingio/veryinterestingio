			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t disagree with you but companies that can build something like the Burj Khalifa are not a dime a dozen. Work for company bidding on higher tower in Dubai, including with company who worked on Burj. At that height, there are not that many companies who can build it (or who will take the risk)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Carpenters with <em>that</em> skill level have become scarce as well. There’s pictures of what I’m talking about <a href="https://www.notredamedeparis.fr/en/la-cathedrale/architecture/la-charpente/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And good luck finding 300 ft trees that will do the trick. In South Korea, when Namdaemun Gate was burned in 2008, they needed to source wood and it was quite controversial because they ended up using Russian wood IIRC because they couldn't find any local wood that would do the job. I believe I read that for Notre Dame, that's going to be a challenge - finding trees in France that will meet the requirements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there's plenty of carpenters, and an entire European guild dedicated to the restoration of historic Churches and heritage sites. So, they have the skilled labor, and this is an excellent opportunity to train a new generation. </p>
<p>But you're correct on the timber. My bet is they will end up going with laminate beams, it's the only thing they can really get that is that big in this day and age unless they want to switch from wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former restoration framing carp here. For massive projects like that, we have newer joinery techniques that afford us the ability to create long structural members from multiple shorter beams, without sacrificing significant strength. Many of these techniques are international in origin, I know a few of the standard fine split/spline joins these days are Japanese techniques that American and European carps took up and improved upon after WWII. These are the techniques used to rebuild York Minster, a cathedral in England very comparable to Notre Dame, damaged in a fire back in the mid-80s.</p>
<p>York Minster is a study case for apprentice framers, especially in how it was built using original techniques for construction, and the same materials (updated for modern safety standards, no lead this time), but the beams and masonry were assembled, joined, and splined in new and novel ways before construction.</p></div>		</li>
