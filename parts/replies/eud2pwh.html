			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you have an air gapped computer and a connected computer right next to each other? Iâ€™ve always read about air gapped computers being in separate rooms, but if you remove the hardware that would enable connectivity from the air gapped computer, is there really any way to get into it even if thereâ€™s a connected computer a foot over?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but in practice never ever EVER do that. </p>
<p>To do that would be underestimating the stupidity of humanity.
Not 10mins after you installed the computer you will have a support call from the server people about unknown hardware being plugged into your air gapped computer. </p>
<p>Because even if you paint the brightest red on your air gapped computer and the brightest cyan on the internet computer, some idiot will plug something they shouldn't in and go &quot;oh shit!&quot;
Or worse case if your air gapped computer don't have detection for unknown hardware you will find out as soon as something in your system is compromised.</p></div>		</li>
