<p>The Caribbean gets more direct sunlight, and it more often shines straight down into the water, which gives a bluer color, especially when the water is bluer to start with (see above). Gray overcast skies in the Northeast make for gray-looking water.</p>

<p>People way underestimate the effect of sunlight on the water color. We'll be at the beach (in Florida) when it's sunny and the water is blue and beautiful, only to have some clouds roll in and suddenly the water looks dark.</p>
<p>The color of the sand on the bottom makes a big difference too. We don't have the same white sand as the Caribbean, but you can tell the difference between beaches with light-tan sand and beaches with a rocky bottom. You can actually spot the off-shore rock reef by the change in the color of the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm only familiar with the water off New London Conn. </p>
<p>Most of the NE bottom is rocky with sea-weed.  So very dark. There are beaches of course, and those bottoms can be sandy. When boating, if there isn't bottom contrast you have to look for swirls in the water for boulders close to the surface (conditions depending).</p>
<p>Geologically, the southern NE coast is the southern extent of glaciation on the N. American continent. So lots and lots of very big boulders in that area. Florida is (my understanding anyway) a really big sand bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated, but one time years ago my band was on a small tour of the northeastern US, and we played a show in New London. All the local bands and the local dj dropped off last minute, so we played to like five bar regulars who basically ignored our entire set (I don’t blame them). But after every song, our bassist would yell, “THANK YOU NEW LONDOOON!!” So that’s what always comes to mind when New London is mentioned. Nice town tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We went to a tropical resort for our honeymoon and one of the other guests suggested we sneak dinner roll out of the dining room and take it out into the water to feed the fish.</p>
<p>So I did so, and it was amazing—a swarm of hundreds of fish spiraling around me, taking little nibbles of the roll. Mostly little brown fish but also a few butterflyfish and one parrotfish.</p>
<p>Well, that parrotfish decided my arm looked like part of the roll (same color, to be fair), and took a bite out of <em>me</em>. Let me tell you, that's a really sharp beak! Left a perfect little &quot;V&quot;-shaped gash on my arm; not a lot of fun in salt water!</p>
<p>I never fed the fish again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whales leave northern waters and migrate down to southern waters in the winter. They come back super skinny compared to their end of summer weights because there’s no plankton for them down there! They love those dark waters; it’s all their food!

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was wondering why a whale would leave food rich northern waters (in northern hemisphere) to go to warmer southern waters if so.</p>
<p>The answer is simple : for <a href="https://sciencenorway.no/forskningno-natural-sciences-norway/why-does-the-humpback-whale-migrate/1553864" target="_blank">sex/mating</a></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Last year one of the whales only stayed for a couple of hours in the Caribbean, after a three month migration, before heading back north. Maybe it was happy with just a &quot;quicky&quot;,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, it was confusing as hell initially, since north/south vs cold/warm get reversed for the antarctic whales</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if that's the reason that Europe was historically so much more populated than Asian equivalent latitudes.</p>
<p>For whatever reason Europe exploded in population density while Siberia stayed mostly hunter-gatherer/pastoral tribes living in sparse populations.  </p>
<p>The long coastline (and productive northern waters) of Europe might have compensated for the lack of sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it all depends on your definition of “dirty”, but if I had a choice of two glasses of water to drink from, I would probably <em>not</em> choose to drink the one with a diverse and healthy ecosystem of microscopic organisms in it. I want the one with as close to nothing in it as possible.  A similar calculation goes into which water feels “cleaner” for me to swim in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For clarity I'd look to the Great Lakes. People used to think of them as really dirty, which it was in a biologically rich kind of way. Now the lakes are getter clearer due to exploding populations of invasive filter feeding mussels. </p>
<p>For another species with pros and cons in the Great Lakes, look at the sea lamprey. It devastated the Lake Trout industry, but they're also prized for the nutrients they add when they die. Some people think they're tasty too, enough so that Tyrion ate lamprey pie in Game of Thrones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a diver, this is certainly the case. Tropical waters are great to dive in because of the temperature and clarity, but colder waters can have much denser life. Diving in the Hood Canal in Washington state can be cold and murky, but the waters are teeming with huge fish, octopus, plants, and beautiful  giant purple anemones are everywhere. I remember a plastic skeleton at a dive park that had one of those anemines right on top of its head like a big purple chef's hat.</p></div>		</li>
