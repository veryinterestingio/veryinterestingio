			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I start my reply I wanna just put a trigger warning for them suicidal people. I‚Äôve felt similarly as many of you. While I may not know your situation, or your struggles, I can say finding a therapist and then psychiatrist made a WORLD of difference. I plead that if you have fantasies about suicide PLEASE seek help in some way, even if it is a small step anything is better than nothing. </p>
<p>When I wasn‚Äôt getting help for my depression and suicidal ideation I was hypersomnic to the max. In high school I‚Äôd sleep any time I was at home, on the bus, in every class except the ones that gave me detention for sleeping, and In detention. </p>
<p>After finding a therapist and psych I‚Äôm now struggling hard with a cycle of insomnia and a much much more mild hypersomnia. I‚Äôm also dealing with manic episodes but I just started getting help in October so I‚Äôve got a lotta work ahead of me. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm just venting now because it sucks and I can‚Äôt afford to see even my therapist, but my psych has kept giving me refills when I need them which is really nice. Hoping to find a solution, or some kind of way to manage it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypersomnia? ....I have had this. All my life. In episodes. Oh my god. I'm having a bit of a ...uh... What's it called? Eureka?moment here. Why didn't anyone think of this? I've complained so much about this. Even when I was a preschooler I was tested for brain damage because I slept too much. </p>
<p>....never heard of this, but I have this. Argh! So much googling to do....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question, how did you know when your depression lifted? When did you feel different? I suffer too but can‚Äôt imagine it ever leaving. I‚Äôm on medication and can also have ‚Äòbetter‚Äô times but it always seems to rest it‚Äôs ugly head at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>personally, i noticed it was starting to lift when i was able to feel a wider range of emotions. i could laugh, i could get excited, i could even feel true sadness instead of just a horrible black hole. </p>
<p>whenever i was bored, i could daydream - i could have interesting trains of thought and plan for things to come, whereas before i would just stare into space and feel detached from the world. the mental clarity i had was unbelievably refreshing.</p>
<p>conversations with people were also much easier. i had so much more to say and i was much more engaged than before - interacting with people was no longer so draining.</p>
<p>i also had more energy, and more drive. i found myself wanting to return to old hobbies like drawing, and the things i drew were no longer bland and uninspired. </p>
<p>things i used to love seemed to give me joy again. i felt warmth being outside in nature and giddy watching my cats play. </p>
<p>hang in there, and possibly try a medication change if that's a viable option for you. the clouds really do part eventually and it's like being born again. i wish you the very bestü§ç</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it's the 'all roads lead to Rome' effect. During a depressive episode, no matter the train of thought, it all winds up in the same dark place. </p>
<p>You can be aware of that, try to change, try to redirect, but it still winds up there. I am very lucky in that I only need to be on meds for a few days, and then my thoughts go back to 'normal'. Topics are considered until they've run their course, and wind up in all kinds of places.</p>
<p>It's so internally consistent as an effect I know almost instantly when to med up. I'll notice the first signs and avoid the spiral completely. Been 10 years or so since I've had anything resembling a close call.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's when I could find happiness in most routine of things for example, food, fresh air, comfort of my bed. Never ever have I appreciated those things and now I'll try my best to appreciate everything good life gives me. </p>
<p>Yes it may feel hopeless but trust me, if you want it hard enough, fight hard enough you will get what you want. Good luck :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can be the same as before. Ketamine and Nitrous Oxide have both been shown to ‚Äòreset‚Äô the brain for patients suffering with depression. Both have been found to act on the glutamate pathway to re-form previously broken neural connections. </p>
<p>Ketamine is available in the UK and USA as a treatment for depression. Noz is available at your local corner store in cans of whipped cream</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, I'm putting all my efforts into fixing me. I've only got one existence and living it like this sucks. I refuse to accept I can't get back what I lost. Never give up! </p>
<p>If you can change slightly, you can change a ton! Find some way to deviate from your path. New experiences and things, change old habits. Switch it all up. You gotta make it easier outside yourself to change so inside you can change.</p>
<p>Imagine your mind like a field of grass, you run around this field playing baseball every day until that diamond is worn into the ground. Go out of it, fight it, refuse it. Or walk away from it numb if that's all you have, the grass will grow back and you'll find a better shape to run around each day. </p>
<p>Neuroplasticity is much greater in children because that's when that first field is growing. That's when you can make all those paths. Anything that encourages that means big progress at any age.</p>
<p>And fight from every angle to be healthier, food especially. You don't need anything else dragging you down right? If you can't solve the problem directly change everything around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spent pretty much the entirety of my teen years severely depressed, wondering how much permanent damage was done.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard telling. I guess it depends on you and your own mind. Depression physically alters your brain, meaning it changes how neurons fire through the synapses in your brain to create thought and actions. It is possible to change and go back to how you were but it will be difficult because of what you've already been through. </p>
<p>It is plausible, and even possible, but you have to make that effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a discussion with my mother last week. She said she was happy I was over my depression. I told her I wasn't 'cured' and it was always going to be a part of me. I told her about how even though I'm happy with my life I still have this feeling that sneaks up from time to time that I don't deserve it and I'm worthless. I explained how I know that's crazy and I can dismiss thos feelings but they are still there. She was very upset by this, but I told her I understand this is how I am and I can work with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;cure&quot; for those thoughts. I would explain that to her. You just find ways to ignore those negative thoughts and tell yourself those thoughts aren't true.</p></div>		</li>
