			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard for me to fall asleep at night no matter how tired I am. During the day I'll fall asleep fot a short while, not meaning to, and feel so lethargic when I wake up. No matter when I sleep I feel like I'm dreaming the whole time. It's not like REM sleep- I'm not rested or recharged, I can't stop thinking about my dreams, feeling the emotions, trying to remember, piecing them together. This happens several times a night. I get woken up for whatever reason and the cycle starts over again.</p>
<p>Edit- adding,my dreams are very vivid- no matter how mundane, crazy, real. Plus I have lucid dreams occasionally (always at night, not naps).</p></div>		</li>
