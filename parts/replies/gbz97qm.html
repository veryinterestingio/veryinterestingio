			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a teacher in high school describe it very well.</p>
<p>Once you start smoking, you’ll never be a non-smoker again. You’ll be an ex-smoker.</p>
<p>When you first quit you have to be careful around alcohol or anything else that Lowers your inhibitions, lest you end up giving the ol’ ex a late night phone call.</p>
<p>Over time you get over it but certain circumstances or feelings will make it pop back into your head, even just for a minute, but you never really forget about it completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my most difficult thing and something my friends don't understand. I can no longer get truly drunk because of the craving for smokes that it causes. I'll have a beer or two, but nothing more than a slight buzz. And I generally don't drink except for one night in like 4-5 months where I want to polish off half a liter of the finest whiskey in the store as a treat. I didn't even smoke much. The most I did was 7-8 a day when I was badly stressed. But the severe lack of control over the addiction just kept me so doubly stressed that I sincerely never ever want to do it again even by mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Took me a good few years before I was able to enjoy alcohol again. I remember stealing a cigarette off a mate, taking one drag and realising it tasted so foul I wanted to vomit almost immediately. That's when I knew I'd quit for good. Takes time so hopefully you'll be able to have a drink again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To anyone reading this while thinking about quitting, don't believe it and don't let it discourage you. This is not a universal truth, an inevitable outcome, or an immutable law of nature. You are unlikely to miss smoking.</p>
<p>I quit 4 years ago after smoking 1.5 packs a day for 20 years. Quitting was the hardest thing I've done in my life. Today, just the thought of smoking a cigarette makes me want to throw up. Catching a whiff on the street is enough to make me sick for a brief moment. It's hard to think of any circumstances where my stomach won't turn and I will feel a craving again.</p>
<p>I drink, I socialize, and I hang out with old friends. Most of the year I live overseas, in countries where half the people still smoke and changes in the price of a pack make the national news. It's never crossed my mind to have a cigarette.</p>
<p>Talking to other people, I am not the only one who feels this way. It makes my blood boil when I remember that it was exactly this kind of talk - &quot;for the rest of your life, you will wake up every morning and make the conscious choice not to smoke because you are still going to miss it&quot; - that made me think what's the point if I'm going to have to suffer for the rest of my life. That's bull...</p>
<p>Down the road, after time, you are probably not going to miss cigarettes one bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I did quit for a few weeks thanks to a book that did say exactly this (Allan Carr I think), and it didn't sit right with me. I didn't want a mental death trap while escaping a physical one.</p>
<p>However I quit, I don't wish for a poisonous thought in my head, even if it may work for the short term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  I don't miss it at all.  In fact, the smell of cigarette smoke literally makes me gag and nearly vomit now.  At first, when I quit, the smell would make me crave one, but I'm really happy that wore off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always compared nicotine withdrawal as similar to the most intense hunger you've ever felt. It won't leave your mind, no matter how much you want it to. I never made it past 2 days so far...I started with hookah pipes and switched to vaping but I want to be done with it completely. But I just...can't, I get a few days in and the urges are too intense for me to ignore.</p>
<p>I hope someday I get the strength.</p>
<p>Edit: Got a lot of good stories and well wishers, just adding an edit to thank all of you, too many messages to reply to all of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On average it takes 7 tries to quit. Also people don't realize this but the addictiveness of nicotine is up there with heroin. Different of course as nicotine doesn't have the withdrawal symptoms of heroin but in the way that it changes your brain. </p>
<p>Just keep trying. Eventually hopefully it'll stick. Also, keep in mind that even if you get weak and have a smoke it doesn't mean you failed. Just keep trying. It's not something that has to have a hard line. My personal quitting process took a long time. Included plenty of parties where I fell of the wagon and just went back to quitting the next day. I still, after about ten years, keep in mind that if my desire gets really strong that I'll allow myself a smoke and then go back to quitting again. It does get a lot easier the longer removed you are so it's no longer a presence that affects me anymore. </p>
<p>One thing that also helped was avoiding triggers. Places, and even TV shows where there is smoking can set you off because they activate the connections in your brain. It takes time to retrain the neurons and build new associations. Don't think that you have to be able to handle being around smoking in the early stages of quitting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I compared it similarly but quantified it as boredom. I have smoked half my life and only tried to stop once. Not quit, but stop to see if I could. I did for about 2 weeks. My buddy asked what it was like and I thought for a second before I said &quot;it's... boring. It's like no matter what you're doing, you're always a little bored with it&quot;. He asked why I started again. I said &quot;well... I was bored&quot;.</p>
<p>We had a laugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drugs help.  I about quit using whatever that shit is that gives you nightmares.  Really makes nicotine feel awful, you just don't want it, very quickly.  Might try again, takes some time to reprogram your brain.</p>
<p>As to the &quot;nightmares&quot;.  I looked forward to going to bed.  Had dreams that would scare the dead and I <em>loved</em> it, like going to the movies at night.  Another friend of mine quit because he couldn't take the dreams.</p></div>		</li>
