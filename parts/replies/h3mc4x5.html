<p>pH is the logarithmic measure of concentration of protons in a given solution</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the definition for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH#p[H]" target="_blank">p[H]</a>. There's nearly no distinction between pH and p[H] for aqueous solutions, but it may not be what the OP had in mind. The pH can be used to quantify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_potential" target="_blank">chemical potential</a> of the proton in any environment, which is a broader definition. (The chemical potential is like a sophisticated version of concentration that incorporates interactions. <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/363816/146039" target="_blank">It's the true determiner of how matter responds.</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh cool, can I ask a summarising question: would you say that &quot;at absolute zero, pH is infinite&quot;, theoretically?</p>
<p>I guess this raises the question of: how close to absolute zero can the universe/anything in it physically get? Does planck's constant come into play here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:
Beyond pH 0 and 14, even strong acids/bases tend to not completely dissociate anymore. Take concentrated hydrochloric acid for example: it's 37% HCl in Water. Much more then 1mol/L. But because of that, it's not completely dissociated.</p>
<p>pH can also be very different in organic solvents, but here measuring it with traditional methods doesn't always work anymore. Often it's just theoretical and comparative measurements.</p>
<p>All that said, the strongest (non hypothetical) acid known to man is CH5+ (which is just Methane bombarded with protons) which has a pka of around -50.
The strongest bases on the other hand are substances like n-Buthyllithium or t-BuLi which have a pka of around 40 if I'm not misremembering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know we can reach almost absolute 0 in a controlled environment. Something close to .05 from absolute zero. We can't do better because a small amount of thermal energy that is still produced by the equipment (if I remember correctly) and at that scale we can't get rid of it.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of an instance of naturally occurring absolute zero. The universe is comprised of heat (reaching 1 point to absolute zero means there is heat), the hard part is to cool things off.</p>
<p>I believe absolute zero will gradually become a natural phenomenon as the universe slowly expands, heat is disipated.</p>
<p>Over billions of years there will be pickets of the universe where no heat will exist anymore and slowly all the universe will stop and reach absolute zero ( this is one of the theories that describes how our universe will end.</p>
<p>But even so, due to quantum physics and us still having much to learn about it, who knows. Things happen differently at quantum level. There is such a thing as particles that just pop into existence due to quantum physics, these are bound to expel some energy into the universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m just kidding, but rest assured that none of the behaviors of solvated protons have to do with absolute zero or Planck’s constant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm too stupid to even fully understand your first comment! I am completely hopeless at non-theoretical science and the first to admit it. </p>
<p>It seems to have at least something to do with absolute zero, as pH depends on temperature, according to many comments here. I mentioned planck because I'm not sure how you would go about measuring temperature in a discrete universe, at the lowest &quot;resolution&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
