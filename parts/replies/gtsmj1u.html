			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly what you asked, but related. There are various theories of the content of the oxygen in the air over earth's history. Some years back, air bubbles inside of amber were sampled and found to contain oxygen levels approaching 35%.  From wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_history_of_oxygen#/media/File:Oxygenation-atm-2.svg" target="_blank">history of oxygren in the atmosphere</a>, all theories show oxygen levels peaking about 250 million years ago at the end of the Palezoic Era. It has been theorized that the giant insects of that era (dragonflies the size of small dogs, etc), were able to exist because the oxygen levels were so high. Back the 35% oxygen levels - the scientists who doubt that figure say that if the oxygen level truly were that high, forest fires would have turned into conflagrations that would have burned off entire continents in one go. So to your question, not so much the earliest fires, but perhaps the biggest fires on earth occurred at the 250 million years ago mark</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also have changed the nature of vegetation and climate. Scientists claiming fires would wipe out everything aren't taking into consideration that the vegetation of 300 million years ago was just as alien as the insects and animals. The continents were all different too. Earth was unrecognizable. It's likely there was strong selective pressure for plants from back then to either grow quickly after a fire or to resist fire altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trees - or things that filled the niche trees do now, but usually were more related to club mosses than to trees today - during the Carboniferous had bark:wood ratios of anywhere from 8:1 to 20:1, compared to trees today which are usually more like 1:4 or less. Also, they had more lignin - 40-60% then, compared to 15-40% today. They were beasts to burn. </p>
<p>If you look at how the bark of redwoods or ponderosa pines protect against forest fires, imagine what a tree with 4 times the bark and a much harder wood might withstand such fires. </p>
<p>It was a period of massive wood piles. No bacteria could break the lignin down for at least some time, and no fires could burn the deadfall easily, so there was nothing for it to do but to build up, and then eventually to compact down into fossil fuels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Things like grasses didn't even exist yet. They only evolved like 40 million years ago. So if you're imagining big steppe fires like we see them today blazing harder due to extra oxygen, think again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also suppose the air was saturated with water all the time back then, which would lower the risk of fires breaking out in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do you get the 500 million years date from?  </p>
<p>That would have been about the earliest possible date for fires to exist, but there wouldn't have been anything to burn (no terrestrial plants = no fuel), so any fires that did start definitely would not have been big.</p>
<p>Those possible giant continent-spanning or even world-spanning forest fires of the late Paleozoic 250 million years ago would have been the largest fires.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Peak oxygen = peak flammability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a misreading of the scale on the graph - should be 250 million give or take a few million. I edited my post, but perhaps only caught one of the mentions of date</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean that there wouldn't have been fires in the <a href="http://ur.amaurea.net/griffinfly_oxygen" target="_blank">low-oxygen period in the early triassic</a>? At that time the oxygen levels had fallen from an earlier high of &gt;35% to &lt;16%. That's a period where there were plenty of plants and animals on land.</p></div>		</li>

We have pretty much continuous fossil evidence of charcoal throughout the Permian, and then almost zero charcoal for the early Triassic, implying that wildfires <em>almost</em> completely disappeared while vegetation recovered and oxygen levels stayed low.</p></div>		</li>
