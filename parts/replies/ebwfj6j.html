			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so looking down at your nail, the edge forward, from the cuticle it will be the standard width of the nail but after cutting it would look like a wedge, with the front edge of your nail being the point (although you don’t make it into a sharp point, it will just be shorter width than at the base of your cuticle)</p>
<p>To achieve this you have to cut from about 3-4mm in from the edge of your nail and down towards the edge of the nail at the cuticle, diagonally basically.</p>
<p>Because the ingrown nail is usually curling in at the sides, You tend to cut this curl out completely and it’s just pure relief from then.</p>
<p>Advisory; it hurts, pushing the scissor tip under your nail can be so god damn painful, in fact at times I swear it’s the most painful thing I’ve experienced but 5 mins of pure pain is nothing compared to constant ingrown nails, uncomfortable in shoes, when you tap your toe on the edge of things and it hurts etc.</p>
<p>I’ll try find a video. I may even make one next time I cut one out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was honestly the same as you. I used to cut it myself but it was infected all the time. Pain relief was heavenly when I did do it tho. </p>
<p>That was until I planned to go to Vietnam and there was risk for a bacterial infection. </p>
<p>I had the surgery and it honestly took 30 minutes to do 3 sides, followed by three weeks of a chlorine footbath every day and a band-aid. </p>
<p>I'm so fucking glad I did it tho. The first day it hurt, from the 2nd day and onward it was such a relief to not feel incredible pain every time I dropped something on my toes haha. </p>
<p>Highly recommend it!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I like to push on the sides both before and after. Gotta feel the pain to feel the extra relief.</p>
<p>Afterwards, pushing on the side and not feeling a razor sharp shard of nail dig in is borderline orgasmic.</p></div>		</li>
