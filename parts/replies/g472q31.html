<p>My uncle needs actual soap for some wood finishing that he does and had a hard time finding it.  Other soap-like products are actually detergents and leave a film on the wood that prevents finished from being absorbed properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plain soap is exceedingly easy to make if you know how to handle lye without being an idiot about it.</p>
<p>I'd recommend checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/unclejonssoap" target="_blank">Uncle Jon's channel</a> because it's really practical and uncomplicated. So much of soapmaking is dominated by soccer moms who lack any drama in their lives and so they are compelled to make up for it by generating it in their hobbies, especially when it comes to soapmaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude this is so true. The amount of pseudoscience, dogma and bullshit in the DIY craft world is simultaneously enthralling and enraging. A little bit ago I had been looking for a scientific explanation of how fragrance &quot;binds&quot; to fat. Dear god, the amount of bullshit I had to dig through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Healthcare products are under their jurisdiction. Basically anything you are putting in or on your body. They'd have a much longer name if the acronym actually listed all of the things they have oversight of.</p>
<p>There are loopholes, of course. For example, &quot;nutritional supplements.&quot; People have been seeking to have those loopholes closed for decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The FDA does regulate non-soap cleansers thanks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act" target="_blank">Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Manufacturers just giving it a different name and people buying into it kind of defeats the purpose of having strict qualifications for products. If it's cheap enough and gets enough a foothold in the consumers market you'll eventually have it take over &quot;properly named&quot; products because the lower demand for those products drives up their prices.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no reason soap is the best. But that substitution should be up to the consumer not the manufacturer.</p></div>		</li>
