			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres actually no such thing as a pain receptor. We have nociceptors which detect different types of sensory stimuli. Once the sensation reaches a specific threshold our brains produce pain as a way to alert our consciousness that we need to address whatever is causing the sensation as a protective mechanism to prevent further damage. But the rest of your statement holds true and is very important when trying to understand pain.</p></div>		</li>
