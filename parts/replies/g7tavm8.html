			<div class="markdown"><p>Wolbachia are also being used to control mosquito populations by making them infertile. It's complicated, it requires different strains of wolbachia being used. Article here -

<p>Ive also seen a presentation about how we shouldn't use wolbachia for mosquito control. I don't recall the specifics, it was down to cellular biology, and that's not my field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a variety of it that acts as an essential symbiotic relationship (I forget the exact term, but it's where the host dies without it) in the parasitic worm brugia malayi. There's actually labs working on targeting wolbachia to treat the worm infections. Point is, wolbachia are super interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, sometimes your body's immune response to one pathogen also prevents any secondary infections from occurring. In response to some viral infections your body releases interferons, essentially alarms that tell your defences to get into gear. It is then very difficult for another virus to become established until your body stops releasing the interferons.</p>
<p>(Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong, this isn't my specialty.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s completely right. With regard to viral infections, release of interferon can produce a localized zone of protection (which ever near by cells are exposed to the interferon). That being said, viruses have ways of evading the interferon response. Though usually not once it’s already been established.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Interferon response is ultimately harmful to cells. That’s why part of the interferon pathway includes a negative feedback loop. Essentially, some of the genes turned on by interferon block the signaling from the interferon receptor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the reverse is possible? Or can it happens when it isn't the same area that is infected?</p>
<p>Says, Mrs Smith didn't have a great dental hygiene while she was sick, because well, when your sick, you skip some stuff like that. She develops cavities, and some months later, bacterias are super-happy and it gets infected.</p>
<p>While her body is busy fighting bacterias in her teeth, she get to the dentist and sat next to someone with a cold. That someone can't control their sneezing, and sneeze right on Mrs Smith. Mrs Smith is a bit upset, but she understood. After everything she passed last year, she can understand how your body can be uncontrollable.  Also she isn't too worried. She usually never get simple cold. She specialized in pneumonia.</p>
<p>3 days later she get the Super Cold like she never had had before. She is surprised, because it isn't pneumonia, (for once).</p>
<p>The only reason she got that cold, this time, is because her body was too busy fighting off the bacterias in her teeth to catch the cold virus in time.</p>
<p>Can this happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm an anesthesia dude not an infectious disease expert, but generally yes people whoa are systemically very sick can be more susceptible to other infections; however the problem that tends to come from dental infections is that bacteria from the mouth can get into the bloodstream and then form &quot;vegetations&quot; (basically pockets of bacteria) in vulnerable parts of the body - specifically heart valves.  (In this case however we're talking about the <em>same</em> organism hopping from one part of the body to another).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You obviously know this dental health stuff, but wanted to expand more on this. </p>
<p>One of the best things you can do to support your teethy pet's health is taking care of their mouth. Gum disease can result in everything from cardiovascular problems to liver working on overdrive. </p>
<p>Same obviously applies to humans also. There is even some evidence that a bacteria found in human mouths produces a gingipain (toxin) which can find its way to the brain and it begins cutting human DNA at the lysines of the Alzheimer linked apoe genes.</p>
<p>There is a company (Cortexyme) developing a drug which would inhibit the activity of the gingipain.</p></div>		</li>
