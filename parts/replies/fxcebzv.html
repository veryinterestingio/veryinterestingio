<p>In addition human voice have a lot of familiar patterns so you can save bandwidth by compressing it with special algorithms for voice.</p>

<p>This is actually the main reason for the specific underwater-like effect.  Blocking high and low frequencies alone would just cause muffled and hollow sound, respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on how you set up your hold music box.  If you call <a href="https://godaddy.com" target="_blank">godaddy.com</a>, their hold music is quite clear.  There are adjustment knobs on the hold music box.  You can play with it until it sounds good.  Our hold music box is hand made by a crazy person and it works great.  It's in a cardboard box using a pre-amp for a no-name Chinese in car system.  It's pretty nifty.  At a previous company we used a Nortel Option 11.  That one had a very expensive hold music box.  You could tune it to sound good really well.  I prefer the cardboard box though.</p>
<p>Convention telephone is only about 4,000 Hz so you kind of have to make the best of the range.  Pick soft music without huge spikes and dips.  The line itself can't carry the detail.</p>
<p>Godaddy uses Squirrel Nut Zippers for some reason and it actually comes across quite well.  The Cisco one works pretty well.  The one that Nortel used came through pretty well too.  I think it's all about tuning your hold music box.</p></div>		</li>
