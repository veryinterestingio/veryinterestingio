			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you fit those interdental brushes in between your teeth? My teeth are too close together for those. I even have a hard time getting floss in between some of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve recently been able to use interdental brushes but before I got my braces there was no way I would be able to use the brushes. If your teeth are just close together (rather than overlapping) then you could try the smallest size. But if they are anything like mine were (a few rotated teeth and overcrowding)  then floss may be your only option.</p></div>		</li>
