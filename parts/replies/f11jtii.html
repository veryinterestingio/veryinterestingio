			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The eye rolling back would take a muscle to pull it up, which you wouldnt be able to do.</p>
<p>Actually, the eyes would drift towards each ear slightly, because that's the natural position of your eyes at rest (which is why many people get double vision when very tired). We are always fighting this while awake to look straight ahead. Because of this, both muscles that pulls the eyes toward the nose are very strong. This is why we can cross our eyes, but cant force our eyes to separate in any other dorection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like reading about this stuff because I have a &quot;lazy eye&quot;, but in reality it's a workaholic eye. Or eyes. I don't know.</p>
<p>But basically my eyes are cool. I've been like..training them? without realizing it since I was a little kid. I have independent vision (I guess that's what it's called, that's what one doctor called it), but basically with BOTH eyes open, I can pick which eye I want to look out of. </p>
<p>I can also look at something, like words on paper or something, and force my eyes to focus (like a camera does while trying to focus on something, that's what it looks like to me), so I can sometimes read things I &quot;shouldn't be able&quot; to read with what my prescription is. </p>
<p>It's weird.. but 2 doctors called me &quot;an anomaly&quot; and that made me happy. So now I run with it. I've only had one doctor try to tell me that it was kinda normal, but I shut him down..lol. I'm like &quot;NO! I'M SPECIAL DAMMIT!&quot;</p>
<p>.....and that's my story......</p>
<p>I don't even remember what the original point was.</p>
<p>EDIT: No wonder the doctors never understand what I'm telling them until they start doing their tests and get really annoyed.. I don't know how to explain it properly.. I apologize..</p></div>		</li>
