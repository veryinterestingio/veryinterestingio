			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, we inspect every bridge spanning more than 20 feet every two years, or more frequent if it has started deteriorating. Most steel bridges have some sort of rust showing on them. It may be notable rust on a component which could suddenly snap and cause failure of the bridge, or it may be that the engineer used their inspection of it, measuring what rusted away, to figure out if it's still strong enough.</p></div>		</li>
