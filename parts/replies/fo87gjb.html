			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in regulatory and the Manufacturing process begins long before actual production. We are talking about procurement, specs, test protocols etc. however, building/producing at risk happens every day all day on very large scales.  If testing doesn’t go well or fda doesn’t agree it’s scrap so, it’s in their best interest to ensure everything is buttoned up and they have a high degree of confidence</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This type of production is called build at risk. Each production job or batch goes on &quot;hold&quot; after it's completed and can't leave the company to go for distribution until the pre-approved criteria is met. There's a product release department that won't be able to release that product for distribution until that criteria is met. </p>
<p>In this case, that pre-approved criteria would be FDA approval. To release the production batches, they would have to acquire proof of FDA (and whatever other regulatory bodies) approval; then quality, regulatory, and production (probably director or above in this case) would sign the required paperwork allowing for distribution of the product which was built at risk. At this point, the product release department would be able to release the pre-built product for distribution. </p>
<p>The risk comes into play if the FDA says &quot;nope&quot; or requires them to change something in the recipe, such that they would have to scrap or rework all of the product they built ahead of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are manufacturing 800 million doses 'at risk' because the physical production cost of the vaccine is actually quite low in comparison to R&amp;D, trials, distribution, etc.  </p>
<p>They gain a lot by being first to market, but lose very little if it doesn't pan out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. Being first to market is the thing that adds multiple zeros on your profit numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in design of pharma plants and construction of facilities before drugs are approved is very common. If it fails in trials you can repurpose or sell the facility.  If you wait, then build/manufacture after you are missing 9-16 months of sales and potentially exclusive license/patent time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My time in industry is mostly small pharma, so plant construction before approval has been par for the course! It isn't the construction before approval that mostly impressed me, it is my guestimated timeline on when they start production and back calculating how fast they have to get their processes locked in.</p>
<p>That said, I'm also curious to see if they go do the CMO route, have in house capacity or if they fit out a building for production since tech transfer or engineering runs would add to the timeline</p></div>		</li>
