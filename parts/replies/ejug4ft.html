			<div class="markdown"><p>So the problem with that theory is that someone who is leptin deficient would have a low tolerance to it so they would get a similar feeling as a normal person just from less of the hormone. Whereas someone with excess leptin would become resistant to it and leptin levels would need to be higher to get the same result. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it does work like that... People with excess testosterone or adrenaline don't build up an immunity to it. They would self report that it takes more accute spikes to take them from their baseline but that's a matter of perception, not chemical dependency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People do actually become adrenaline resistant, usually if they have chronic stress. There's quite a few hormones in the body that you can build a resistance to, insulin is probably the most problematic though but leptin resistance is often why obese people don't feel full after eating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Leptin excess solves problems</p>

<p>Not according to the experts who have weighed in on this thread.  It in fact causes resistance.</p></div>		</li>
