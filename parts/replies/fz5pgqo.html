Vingt et un and instead use virgule for decimals.  Man, my memory is terrible as I don't recall this at all or Canadian French is a bit different somehow.</h2>
<p>99.99 is a mouthful I presume (I can't recall from grade school)</p>
<p>Quatre-vingt-dix-neuf et Quatre-vingt-dix-neuf?</p>
<p>Or maybe something easier?  But I think et denoted decimal/comma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use &quot;et&quot; when using a different unit generally like &quot;dix euros et six centimes&quot;. To denote a comma, we usually say &quot;virgule&quot;, but often omit a word altogether when the number and context allow it like &quot;dix, quatre-vingt dix&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
