			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll second this, and generally human cases come from these so-called reservoir populations. If rabies only existed in humans, rabies would quickly die out. It's not uncommon for diseases that can infect multiple species to have primary species where they live and other species that they can infect that they're relatively poorly suited to, e.g. rabies in human where it's not really transmitted from human to human in a sustainable way, but is commonly found in wild bats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possums do not carry rabies cause their body temperature is too low.
In fact,no animal &quot;carries&quot; rabies. The incubation period varies between species,but when they get it,they all die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found very contradictory claims when looking into this for bats, with about half of them saying they died and half of them saying they didn't. Sadly none of them led me to an actual scientific paper that actually tested this. Have you found a good source for this?</p>
<p>Edit: Below is what I wrote the last time I looked into this.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Rabies virus is fatal in all species. Some might live long enough to transmit it, but the disease kills the host.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27450525/" target="_blank">this article</a> (looks like only the abstract is available), that's wrong (though the wording is awkward):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rabies is a zoonosis ending fatally in all mammals, including humans. Unlike the other mammals, this disease is usually not fatal in bats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: On the other hand, other documents like <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/zoonotic/documents/bats-rabies-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">this one</a> contradicts that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bats, like other mammals, become sick and eventually die from the disease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither of these sources cite their source for this, so it's not easy to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>Edit2:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2018/why-marburg-virus-cant-kill-bats/" target="_blank">This article supports the first one</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bats have long been of interest to virologists, because they carry rabies, Kepler says. And while bats sometimes get sick from rabies, it rarely kills them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It cites an article from Cell, but that article doesn't mention rabies. Annoying.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit2:</p>
<p>I looked some more into this now, and found <a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/jwd/article/44/3/612/121801" target="_blank">this article</a>, where they infected bats with rabies and looked at the outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of 20 infected bats, 16 developed clinical rabies, and the mean incubation period was 24 days (range: 13–52 days). Three infected bats never seroconverted and succumbed early to infection (13 days). Four infected bats that survived until the end of the experiment without any signs of disease maintained detectable antibody titers until the third month PI, peaking between days 13 and 43, and consequent drop-off below the threshold for detection occurred by day 140.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall 85% of the bats that were infected died, and 15% survived. This was for infection with a high dose of rabies. So it looks like even though rabies <strong>can</strong> be fatal to bats, it <strong>isn't always</strong>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure it's out there. I learned  this stuff years ago when I decided to volunteer in wildlife rehab. Before we could volunteer,we had to read this huge blue book that was at least six inches thick on zoonotic diseases.
After we read it,we had to sign a waver that if we died of a horrible disease, our families would not sue the shelter.
I can't remember the name of the book,however.</p></div>		</li>
