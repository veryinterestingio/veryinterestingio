			<div class="markdown"><p>Trust me, it doesn't matter at all. CS major here. I've gone from Operations to Development to IT/Sysadmin to Management to some weird hybrid of Development, IT and Finance right now.  And that's just in a span of 8 years and two jobs. There are people in IT from Electrical and even Arts backgrounds, so no matter what you choose it'll be fine.</p></div>		</li>

Its one of the reasons i love this field, you can end up working in nearly every industry while learning a ton of stuff that's completely unrelated to actual programming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The OP is breaking down what they all should be. But in practice (in Universitys and in Industry) there is a lot of overlap. Employers might expect any candidate from any discipline to answer the same questions. And there is also some overlap in the curriculum of these majors in schools. I got a software engineering job after graduating with a CS degree and I know a computer engineering who is going into IT.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say in my experience that the majority of software engineers have computer science degrees, and the majority of computer science graduates get jobs as software engineers.  That's the normal path.  An actual &quot;Software Engineering&quot; degree would be seen as more of a vocational degree than most selective universities would offer, but for profit and community colleges may offer it.  Computer Science is the most flexible option and would qualify you for pretty much any of these fields.</p>
<p>IT is it's own thing, distinct from Software Engineering.  There are a lot of jobs, but they're often part of other less software focused industries where IT is just seen as a cost of doing business, so management may not value it as much.  IT tends to have more professional certifications of individual skills, and less emphasis on what degree you have, so it's pretty easy to go from another computer related degree to IT, but harder to go from IT to something else.</p></div>		</li>
