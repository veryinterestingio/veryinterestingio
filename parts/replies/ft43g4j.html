			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure there are reliable predictions for what's going to happen with the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly (SAMA), but perhaps someone with a deeper understanding of SAMA might add additional info. The <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Swarm/Swarm_probes_weakening_of_Earth_s_magnetic_field" target="_blank">ESA Swarm satellites</a> are giving us a better view of it, but as highlighted there, these type of anomalies / variations in the magnetic field are well within the normal level of variability in the field, so the existence or changes observed in SAMA are not a clear indicator of an oncoming reversal (but SAMA specifically is of interest not only for what it tells us about the workings of the magnetic field, but because of the risk to satellite infrastructure in the vicinity of the anomaly). Some of this is further highlighted in this paper by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2016.00040/full#h4" target="_blank">Pavon-Carrasco &amp; De Sanits, 2016</a>, where, among other topics, they discuss the importance of the details of the non-dipole components of the field in generating the SAMA (emphasizing that the nature of these types of anomalies are inherently complicated and thus predicting exactly how they're going to evolve is challenging). Finally, it's worth noting that while there is a lot of buzz about the SAMA because of the preliminary Swarm satellite results, our study/interest/knowledge of  SAMA is not exactly new, e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002191699290137A" target="_blank">Pinto et al, 1992</a> discussing 30 years of research on SAMA circa the early 1990's (i.e., so one could now write a 'The South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly: six decades of research' review paper if so inclined).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty fine grained. Seafloor spreading is at the rate of centimeters per year (km per million years). You measure the magnetism of the seafloor bedrock (magnetic anomaly, really) and can date it using typical radiometric methods -- am sure there are prob other ways to approximate age, like distance from ridge if spreading rate has been consistent for long time, or maybe depth of sediment; not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with most things in geology, our temporal resolution decreases as a function of age, i.e. as we move further back in time our records become more incomplete for a variety of reasons. Individual paleomagnetic measurements can be very precise (whether we're talking about intensity or direction), but the issues usually crop in in because of the increasing incompleteness of the records. That being said, for a semi-qualitative sense of this, you can take a look at some of the intensity records in the papers I linked to as most of these provide assessments of the uncertainty.</p></div>		</li>
