			<div class="markdown"><p>Former flight attendant here. We're never going to ask everyone this. Also it's aircraft dependent. The overwing exit windows usually don't have window shades at all, for the reasons being mentioned in this post. Your other exits are the main entrance and usually another door on the opposite of the main entrance. Larger aircraft will sometimes have another set of doors in the aft. </p>
<p>Some aircraft have a small window in those front doors. So it's not necessary for crew to run to the 1st row window to check for fire or debris. The CRJ700, which I worked on, has aircraft stairs as the door, so no window. We're trainer to go directly to the row 1 window in the event of an evacuation to check that the exit is safe. You don't want to walk straight in to burning fuel. We're trained to ask row 1 passengers to keep their shades open for take off and landing. It's inconsistently practiced. Some flight attendants I know just remove those shades all together, to avoid people acting weire at them.</p>
<p>Some general advice to you as a passenger. Take and landing are by far the most dangerous times. Keep your shoes on and your shades up, and a coat ready if the weather is cold. It's rare but accidents happen.</p>
<p>Tldr: it's aircraft specific. Some have better line of sight for flight attendants.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The open shutters also allows more passenger eyes to see if there is something wrong during takeoff/landing (e.g. fire) and alert the crew quickly.</p>

<p>Is a pax going to even recognize something truely wrong with the aircraft or how to describe it accurately to the crew?</p>
<p>Guarantee 99.9% of people riding in back won't.</p>
<p>The other .01% are actual airline pilots (rated ATPs) who are dead-heading and could recognize something truely wrong with the aircraft and know how to describe it accurately.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Listen, no one is going to oppose an extra set of eyes but it isn't the driving reason to ask people to raise the shades.</p>
<p>It is mostly for safety but to help meet the 90 second evacuation rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/25.803" target="_blank">14 CFR ยง 25.803 - Emergency evacuation.</a></strong>
(c) For airplanes having a seating capacity of more than 44 passengers, it must be shown that the maximum seating capacity, including the number of crewmembers required by the operating rules for which certification is requested, can be evacuated from the airplane to the ground under simulated emergency conditions within 90 seconds. Compliance with this requirement must be shown by actual demonstration <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/appendix-J_to_part_25" target="_blank">using the test criteria outlined in appendix J</a> of this part unless the Administrator finds that a combination of analysis and testing will provide data equivalent to that which would be obtained by actual demonstration.</p>
