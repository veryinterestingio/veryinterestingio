Like being on a rocket propelled rollercoaster while Neil Peart plays a prog rock drum solo on your heart</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello Detox nurse here. Most Patients have no idea what they are actually taking. When they sober up and questions are able to be answered appropriately many believe that they don't use Fentanyl. However urine screens say otherwise. They really have no idea what they are talking as long as it gets them to high they want. It really is fascinating that individuals make it long to become sober.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine once took that. If I remember the story correctly, it was called a silver bullet.</p>
<p>He and some friends booked a visit from a guy. The guy went to their apartment with a bag and a suitcase. Inside the suitcase were the drugs in a controlled temperature, and in the bag were several medical tools. He took measurements of everyone and prepared a dose for each one of them, applied it and stayed for some time to make sure no one had any adverse reaction or overdosed.</p>
<p>It cost several hundred euro per person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This pretty much sums up why most drugs are so unappealing to me. How many people touched it? Did anyone poop this drug out of their body? Had it been cut with commercial cleaning products? </p>
<p>Disgusting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good on you for going to rehab. You should seriously feel proud of yourself. I know rehab is only one tiny part of recovery, but itâ€™s an important one</p></div>		</li>

<p>That kind of precision may not be used when people cut other drugs with fentanyl</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>May not</em>? With a normal effective dose of 25-100 micrograms, mixing it up in a basement drug lab with that kind of precision has to be nearly impossible.</p></div>		</li>
