			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation but not exactly ELI5, let me try. The pain from your foot gets sent to your spinal cord and is immediately sent back to the foot (along nerves that control the muscles) to remove your foot from the water. At the same time that pain is also sent to your brain, it just has a longer distance to travel. So your foot is out of the water before your brain even knows it’s in danger. Which is why it may sometimes feel like you weren’t in control of your foot. Cause that quick, jerk reaction to pull your foot away hasn’t even gotten to the brain yet. </p></div>		</li>
