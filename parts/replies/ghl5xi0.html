			<div class="markdown"><p>Enterprise color laser printers are getting pretty good. I've got one that does a hardware resolution of 1200dpi, and a virtual resolution of 3600dpi. It has color profiles for color accuracy, and the stuff it prints looks pretty great.</p>
<p>As a photo printer it still doesn't come out quite as nice as a high end inkjet on glossy paper, but it's very good.</p>
<p>Also, I've sworn off inkjets forever. Screw those horrible piles of garbage, and a pox on the miserable suit that came up with the business model of selling cheap crap devices and jacking up the price of ink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inkjets are great, but only the real high end commercial ones, where you buy the ink by the litre, not the ml, the ones you get for Â£50 that cost more just to replace the cartridges are pure garbage ripoffs though I agree. Great if you just want a cheap scanner though, as standalone flatbed scanners are stupid prices now, because of the All In Ones... My office printer is a 10 year old Brother B/W laser, and my scanner is a 6 year old HP AIO, and I don't use it to print, but the scanner works fine for most non commercial stuff.</p></div>		</li>
