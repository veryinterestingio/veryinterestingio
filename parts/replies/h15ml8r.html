<p>most of our body is water, which is relatively incompressible
What the pressure does push on is the pockets of air in our lungs.
those pockets of air are also at about 14.7 psi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is the key insight missing from many of the answers.
The gasses in our body are also at 14.7 psi because our bodies formed at that pressure. That means we push out the same amount that we are pressed on by the air.</p>
<p>When divers dive deep below the water, the pressure around them increases, but so does the pressure of the gasses in their body if they go down slowly enough (to an extent). </p>
<p>That’s why it’s so dangerous to raise quickly as a diver; because the gasses in your lungs are under pressure, so when you remove the pressure from the water, the gasses in your lungs (and in your blood, yikes) expand, which puts pressure on the inside of your body. And can cause all sorts of issues</p>
<p>Edit: A slight correction, gas pressure in the lungs is only an issue if you hold your breath which you’re trained not to do as a diver.</p>
<p>Edit 2: There are several things somewhat wrong about what I said. Look at my replies for well explained corrections.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, the gas in your lungs expanding isn't an issue at all unless you hold your breath while ascending, which is something they cover in training. </p>
<p>What <em>is</em> a concern is that gases dissolve better in water (i.e. most of you) at higher pressures. So if you've been down long enough to let that happen, and then the pressure drops quickly (sudden ascent), those gases will form bubbles in your blood and tissue, which is what gives you the bends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve got a few hundred hours diving. Not an expert by any means. Short of a crazy emergency situation it would be hard to hold your breath enough to matter when ascending. You almost never have a full lung capacity due to keeping neutral buoyancy and your mouth is forced open partially due to the regulator so air tends to “leak” if you aren’t paying attention. You’d have to actively close your throat (right term?) and then still go quite a ways pretty damn fast. </p>
<p>Anyway, yeah we are taught to breathe out slowly as you go up. Just figured I’d chime in it would be really hard to screw it up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure at which they come out is equal to that higher pressure. Well, specifically, the partial pressure. So, in a sense, the original statement was not incorrect. This is why we often measure dissolved gases in units of pressure; that is the pressure they exert as they would be exiting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always wondered if a fish would get hurt if it swam up a column of water held up in the air. I'm talking a column formed from a pipe that had been filled and inverted while under the surface, then tilted upright. I know there would be a vaccum at the top (well, full of water vapor), but I'd imagine near the &quot;surface&quot; of the water would be deadly to them since the pressure is so low it would boil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This column of water is only 33 feet tall. Since fish are adapted to handle this much pressure change down, I imagine they’d be ok going up as well. Humans can handle the pressure change from 1 to 0 atmospheres, but we can’t breathe.</p>
<p>Edit: After looking around a little more, it looks like a rapid pressure change can be an issue even when the pressure changes are less than an atmosphere. This is particularly bad for larvae. I think in the scenario described, where the fish willingly swims up, it's likely to only swim as much as it can comfortably, then adjust and repeat until it gets to the top (like swimmers who pop their ears when they dive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean something like this <a href="https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/koi-pond-glass-skyscraper" target="_blank">fish skyscraper</a> that fish can swim up and into?</p>
<p>There is no vacuum in it. The water doesn't boil. It gets pushed up into the glass enclosure. With no air inside, there is no weight of air pushing down on the water; but there is weight of air pushing down on the water outside of the cube. This pushes water up into it, kinda like pushing down on the sides of an air mattress forcing the middle to rise.</p>
<p>Water (or air) pressure is literally the weight of the water above you pushing down on you. The force of the water acts the same as it would anywhere else in the pond--the water pressure is equivalent to the height of water above the fish. So half way up a 10 foot tall enclosure (5 feet from the top) is the same as being 5 feet below the surface elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this is what you mean, but if you filled a pipe with water at say, 10,000 feet below the surface and then reeled it in the pressure inside the pipe would not be the same as 10,000 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on the breathing thing: our ability to breathe <strong>relies</strong> on the pressure of the atmosphere.  When we breathe in, our lungs expands and create a very slight vacuum relative to the air, and it rushes in to fill the space.  Without any pressure, no air would enter no matter how hard we breathed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what it means by the air being &quot;thinner&quot; at higher altitudes. There is less pressure to force the oxygen into your lungs/bloodstream. One of the reasons jet liners have pressurized cabins and mountain climbers use supplemental oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
