<p>When I started programming for IBM, I gained a whole pile of other quirks - we had to write code by hand on pads that were then typed up as punch cards by trained typists; we'd check them, type new cards for any errors found, then throw them at the computer. If there was a single mistake, you'd find out three or four hours later. Laborious. Not having errors in the first place was  way less painful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I strike my 7's too but that's more common.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe the striked 7 comes from how certain countries in Europe write their numbers. Their 1s look like 7s, so they'll strike the 7 to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>I'd bet this logic was carried over to Zs because they look like 2s. Never saw a struck Q though...that's interesting.</p>
<p>See this link for how Germans write their numbers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was born and have lived my entire life in Sweden. When I was about 8 and was in 2nd grade we got taught how to write in cursive but I moved and changed schools in the middle of the year so I was never taught that.</p>
<p>Lol my point is, I see similarities in my life and your link :) thanks for the link though, I hope someone find something more useful there than I did!</p>
<p>I also edited my first comment with a link of how I write 2/7/Z/q!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes because in algebra sometimes it was hard to distinguish a z from a 2 and a 7 from a &gt; when writing fast. Never did the q's though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup!  This is exactly why I started striking certain letters and numbers.  I would often get things like z and 2 confused when reading my handwriting quickly.  Hashing my 7s wasn't really needed, but I liked the consistency of it.  Quite frankly, I like the better that way.  Makes them look a little nicer/slightly different from many in my country.</p>
<p>Edit; oh, thought of another!  If L was used as a variable, I would write a cursive L instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>q looks like 9 in handwriting. If you uptick the bottom of the q, it really helps. I learnt to write them like that in the 1970's. Never unlearned it even after switching to a fancy cursive in my teens, wherever I print, the q is struck.</p></div>		</li>
