			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. Outlook 365 not only gives you dark mode in the message pane, but tries its best to invert color brightness for all foreground colors. It doesn't invert images, however, so my dark reading pane can still be peppered with white rectangles containing logos and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had to do this recently because part of our app has rich text displayed for comments. We ended up designing a system to calculate the “dark-mode equivalent” color on the fly. But we also put a button in to display each comment block in light-mode temporarily.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, because what's the &quot;dark-mode equivalent&quot; color of dark purple if the body of the comment contains the text &quot;I highlighted tasks you should take care of in dark purple below&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chances of anybody using a color other than pure red, green, blue, or yellow to highlight text are extremely slim.  Also, any pure color will be readable against both a light and dark background.  So, one solution is to only flip colors that have either a moderately low saturation or an extremely low brightness.  I haven't used this in a production app, but I tried my hand at making my own dark theme extension a few years back and it worked pretty well on simpler sites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gmail's Android app does an amazing job converting email stylesheets.  I'm not sure exactly what it's doing, but unless it's one of those emails that's 50% images (which, thankfully, are going out of style), all emails from real people look like they were made in dark theme.</p></div>		</li>
