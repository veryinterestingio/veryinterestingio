			<div class="markdown"><p>Having not really looked at much of the literature, but mostly from treating COVID pts, the htn and diabetes seem to be major factors and this is likely due to clotting issues which make this virus so damn hard to treat in specific populations. But you’re exactly right, those issues just happen to be connected with being overweight. It seems to be causing ARDS in the lungs but not in the way that we normally see so our methods for treatment have not been super successful. Vent management (I’m an RT) is the most troubling part of this whole equation. In March we were seeing like 70% mortality in patients that were intubated. Things have gotten much better now but we’re still seeing a lot of the same issues in vent management</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good list but it’s also that when you’re overweight your cardiovascular system is already under more load trying to oxygenate all that extra tissue so there’s less “in the tank” when you get sick.</p></div>		</li>
