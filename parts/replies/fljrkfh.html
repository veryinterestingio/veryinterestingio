			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a PhD in CNT electrical conductors, and this is pretty much what I was thinking. A single CNT or graphene sheet has a fixed conductance, so making it bigger just lowers the conductivity. </p>
<p>u/diy_chemE 's comment about metal interfacing is true, it's difficult and it lowers the conductivity of the overall structure, but metallic terminals are very doable and have been demonstrated at nano, micro, and macro scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been half a decade since I took mesoscopic physics, so maybe you can answer this: Say you could make arbitrarily large CNTs, how big would they be before they stop behaving like the nanoscale ones? Especially thinking about chirality etc.</p>
<p>Also, what do you think about <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11433-013-5387-8" target="_blank">copper nanotubes</a>? Do they have any real applications outside of humor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I myself wouldn't bother with it at this point. I got a new job early March in a completely different field and I am too busy studying the fundamentals.</p>
<p>If someone tried, they would quickly find out that it is a daunting task. I had tried to stimulate laser heating if graphene thin films and it was hard. A lot of constants you need for the simulation are not known or there is no clear consensus on them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hats off for staying focused though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean use it like a pencil? My guess is yes, but a pencil would work much better!  Bits of the graphene scroll would fracture off when dragged on paper, and some of those bits would stick to the paper. But a really pristine piece of graphene would flake a lot less than the compacted flakes in pencil lead, and there isn't any binders to help them sick to the paper in a nice thick, visible layer.</p></div>		</li>
