			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals that forage and live high up don't actually look down much, unless they want to go down. Look at primates when they are climbing, they look at where they are going.   </p>
<p>I have worked with circus artists, acrobats that work high up. And every time we have had to fix them a very specific spot somewhere on the stage that they can look at. No matter if they are working the swinging trapeze, wire, or teeterboard. If they ever look down, then it is directly down under them, and even then we mark a clear spot for them to focus on.  </p>
<p>Human eyes are actually amazing and triangulation. We can look at a spot and figure out the distance, angle and speed. Along with our's. This is also a skill that gets better with practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback on this: DO NOT say “don’t look down.” Train yourself to use positive language instead. “Focus on the end.” “Eyes up” “eyes on the prize.” If you say look down even with negation, the person is likely to look down and think about looking down. </p>
<p>Hat tip to Lanny Bassham “With Winning in Mind” for that tip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people aren't used to the visual effects of the different depths/perspectives and this causes untrained people to lose coordination like you say. </p>
<p>I forget the name, something like the horizon effect i guess; this is where pilots become disoriented because they're unable to view any horizon due to fog etc and become dizzy, often resulting in crashes if the pilot isn't trained to fly by instrument.</p>
<p>However, with all this being said, the primary reason you become uncoordinated in view of a height; is the same reason most people suddenly can't speak when they realize an audience is watching them -- despite that they can normally speak to one or a few people just fine.</p>
<p>That is to say; our minds just become so distracted by fearful thoughts and the associated anxiety that we simply lose control of our usual capabilities to balance and to speak, focused instead on the experience of fear</p></div>		</li>
