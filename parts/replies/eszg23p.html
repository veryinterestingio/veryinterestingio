			<div class="markdown"><p>AAA companies CEO (which I don't think your father in law is, but I could be wrong) sold their family life for a career and money long before they became CEO. I don't think that's a justification for how much they get paid. When a mental patient cuts his arm off, we don't give him millions. Yet we use the &quot;sacrifices&quot; (for some of them, these are not even a sacrifice) made by some professionals to justify their wages.</p></div>		</li>
