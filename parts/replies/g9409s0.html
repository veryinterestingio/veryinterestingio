			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some great apps (I use “Sleep Cycle”) that allow you to set your alarm for a 30-45 min window rather than just a single set time. These apps then monitor your sleep phases while you are sleeping based off of breathing patterns picked up by your cell phone’s mic. Your alarm then goes off at the ideal point in your sleep cycle within your set alarm time frame. Some track and even record your snoring for later playback, and have other bells and whistles.</p>
<p>Finding this type of app was a game changer for me. 95% of mornings I wake up feeling amazing. Highly recommend everyone trying one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're on Android, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank">this one</a> is excellent too.   </p>
<p>I have to be up by 7:00am at the latest, so it will wake me up somewhere between 6:15-7:00am, waiting until I'm not in a deep sleep cycle anymore.  </p>
<p>It also links to my smart light bulb in my lamp, and very gradually increases the brightness as it very gradually increases the alarm volume.  It was a game changer for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why does a 30-minute nap feel so refreshing? And I could say the same for a deeper, 1-hour nap - I frequently do one or other of these and rarely feel groggy afterwards.</p>
<p>For that matter, why do none of the various times that various people recommend for sleep lengths (and I've heard all sorts) have anything to do with what I experience in practice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s like saying, the average of the class’ score is 25/30. Does that mean you’ll get exactly 25? Even a dumbass high school kid can tell you it’s merely a reference, a benchmark so you have something to draw off on. </p>
<p>Without that “15 minute” as a reference, you could have ended up going for a number in the 70s pretty much because you have absolutely NO reference point to take.</p></div>		</li>
