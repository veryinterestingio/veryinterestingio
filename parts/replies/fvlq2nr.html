			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey m8 I had (23m) an 8 tier (8 vertebrae) spinal fusion a year ago. I had to completely rebuild those muscles you’re asking about. Like... I weighed 110 lbs at 6 ft tall and they quite literally cut through my back muscles and spread them apart for the surgery. I was made to walk 3 days after surgery... 3!!! They recommended walking as my primary exercise for as long as I can remember. I couldn’t slouch after my surgery like at all and it hurt for so long. I was literally held in place with titanium rods. All is better now and with modern medical science I can still bend a little even with metal rods. I would recommend walking a lot, and doing stair steps. You will really notice a difference about a month in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm sure the best way to strengthen those muscles is to use them. After making an effort to sit up straight every day for let's say a week it will take less and less effort so forth until it's effortless.</p>
<p>Edit: also make sure you're leaning into the back of the chair and letting it do work. Your muscles will tire less easily. And chairs with lumbar and neck support are good too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that is usually considered a static exercise and static exercises are great for tone but not great for overall strength. Finding a dynamic exercise that will make those muscles stronger while sitting up straight as a habit for tone is preferable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An exercise that I feel would be a safe bet for your question would be dead lifts because it works the posterior chain but again that’s just to strictly answer your question, I wouldn’t recommend you do deadlifts to sit up straight I’d probably want you to focus on it and make it a habit instead. Also if your tech isn’t right deadlifts are a sure fire way to make you hurt your back if your putting decent plates on the bar.</p></div>		</li>
