			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the air currents in the room, but yes an aerosol is typically a stable suspension of microscopic particles dispersed in air. Aerosol particles will fall very slowly, if at all (again heavily dependent on air currents) whereas droplets will settle more quickly due to their lower surface area to volume ratio</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, This is my ventilation is extremely important.</p>
<p>In a room with absolutely no ventilation, someone could catch COVID even 30 minutes after an infected person has been gone from that room.</p>
<p>That is assuming they put enough viral load into the air, And in the subsequent people got enough of a viral load to get infected.</p>
<p>I will see if I can find the study, And then find this comment to add it to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring up a question I've had that I have not been able to find an answer to, which is the amount or &quot;viral load&quot; required to get infected. What do we know about the amount (I don't know what metrics are used to talk about this) of virus it takes to infect a healthy person?  Does a small amount of virus get handled by our immune system?  I thought the whole problem with Covid was that our immune system didn't know how to handle it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ask a mathematician to define a common term, like set or manifold, and you'll get surprisingly unrelated answers from mathematicians with different specialties, or even different sub-specialties within a specialty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then, by looking at where the 2nd wave is happening at the very local level, I'm pretty sure population density plays a huge factor (maybe because of mass public transportation?).</p>
<p>In my country the places with the biggest increase rate are the large cities with a subway system. Even Their close hinterlands have fast increase  but not that fast!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to nitpick... but just because this is literally r/science I think it’s really important to avoids words like proven (even when using the word disproven).  One of the biggest problems with people doubting experts in the US today is how often the words scientific fact and proven or disproven are thrown around when science is ALWAYS simply stating what evidence suggests and supports and what it doesn’t.  Saying that experts proved masks didn’t work and then said they did is what causes so much confusion among people who aren’t in higher science degrees.  Everything is open to debate in biology especially.    </p>
<p>We can’t prove or disprove anything because we never have a sample size of the entire population.  We can say that more recent evidence strongly suggests that the conclusions drawn in OP’s paper were inaccurate... but it’s just damaging to those trying to understand science when they’ve been hearing rhetoric about scientists proving or disproving things and that something is ever scientific fact (this doesn’t exist... it’s just something that we have a lot of evidence supporting and little to none contradicting...  but the basic tenets of science say that we can never prove anything because then we have closed ourselves off to the possibility that we are wrong, and that ability to correct our assumptions is what makes science, science... and keeps origin of species or Einstein’s works from becoming the equivalent of holy texts).  If you can’t prove anything. Then it also means you can’t disprove anything.  </p>
<p>I agree with you completely, I just think that the absolute rhetoric of science is much more important to how it is viewed by the average person than most of us scientists realize until late in our careers (masters...PhD... sometimes even later).  As an example the absolutism and the words like disprove or prove is a reason that many religious people think that science is incompatible with their religious beliefs about the intangible and why some atheists draw false conclusions that evidence the world is older than the Bible says it is, like carbon dating, can be extrapolated to “disprove” the existence of a higher power and an afterlife...  personally I don’t believe in any religious texts but I also think that it’s bad for the image of science around the world to imply that people can’t believe in an afterlife or a higher power and science at the same time... and the only way that science actually means that is if people incorrectly interpret lack of proof as disproof... which is extra hypocritical when science is built around admitting that we can ALWAYS learn that our conclusions aren’t entirely accurate and that we should except it graciously (though test it thoroughly), and also that discarded hypotheses can be shown to be accurate by later research as well.  </p>
<p>Sorry for the rant.</p>
<p>TLDR: words like proven and disproven should be avoided like the plague (as they are in most scientific articles) when discussing scientific topics in forums accessible to laypersons as well, especially when they are seeking to understand something they don’t... as the implications of these words are much further reaching than we intend and are playing a role in the doubting of experts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you generally, but I don't think it's really relevant to what I said. If you measure virus in the air after 5 hours, it really is <em>disproven</em> that the virus is too heavy to stay in the air. It has to be. That's a fairly black and white issue. But I agree that generally things are not that black and white and I agree with your examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if I understand correctly, wouldn't the conditions of the air that you measured the virus in have impacted the ability of the virus to stay &quot;afloat?&quot;  Couldn't the same room at a higher or lower temperature, or different pressure effect the findings?  One instance of finding the virus in the air after 5 hours reveals that it's possible, but only for those very specific conditions being measured, and can't necessarily be generalized for all circumstances.  So you still can't have claimed to definitely &quot;prove&quot; anything.</p></div>		</li>
