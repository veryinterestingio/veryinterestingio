			<div class="markdown"><p>You stand in a train, looking out the train window, and you are directly facing a bench outside at the train station. Now you turn yourself around very slowly, so that it takes you 23 seconds to complete the turn. </p>
<p>But while you turn, the train has moved a couple of meters. After you're done turning yourself around, the bench is not immediately in front of you anymore. You have to turn a second more so you will look in its direction again, making it 24 seconds.</p></div>		</li>
