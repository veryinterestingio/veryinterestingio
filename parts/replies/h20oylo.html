			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read any studies regarding her, but both the Wikipedia page and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2082771-people-who-never-forget-their-past-could-have-unique-kind-of-ocd/" target="_blank">this article</a> say her case is possibly just due to a unique type of OCD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other possibility stated was that she has a form of synesthesia, which is more likely the case. I can't recall his name at the moment, but their was a well known journalist that had this condition, and while attending meetings, could recall everything said to the wording used. Some people see words and numbers as colours, which I find kind of interesting. People with synesthesia use more than one sense at the same time which helps to embed the memories, similar to how memory palaces work where you associate memories to more than one sense, in order to firm up a memory. With synesthesia, this seems to occur naturally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is supposedly distinct form the mythical eidetic memory.</p>
<p>For instance, she was given a list of words to memorize, and could not recall several of them.</p>
<p>the original study has never been replicated, and she seems to make a point to not demonstrate her ability in an uncontrolled environment.</p>
<p>if you ask most people over 30yo &quot;where were you on 9/11&quot; they can recall a lot of specific details about that morning.</p>
<p>she does something similar, tying big events together with minor details.  if you asked her about a random tuesday with no significant marker, probably wont know anything about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes except they've done flashbulb memory studies on 9/11 and after a year or a few years most people misremember what they were doing. Scientists will show them their handwriting from the weeks after 9/11 when the study started and they'll believe it's their writing but they will adamantly insist they were mistaken back in the past. People as a whole just have bad memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The myth is that these kind of people have perfect recall. The reality is that it’s a fixation for these kinds of people. They spend their entire day going over and over what they want to remember. It’s more like a muscle and they’re body builders. Being a body builder is impressive in its own way, but there are still limits to what they can do.</p></div>		</li>
