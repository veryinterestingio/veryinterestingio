<p>I think friend bullying probably does look quite a bit different from bullying that occurs in other relationships. It’s probably less likely to involve ongoing physical violence, and more likely to involve gossip, ostracism, and betrayals of confidence. In general, I have found that most adolescent friendships are of poor quality--very unbalanced and unstable--and those probably aren’t “real” in the sense I think you mean. And they are more likely to involve bullying and related cruelties. So one challenge is for us to figure out how to help kids forge stronger, healthier friendships; to learn what how to be a good friend, and what they should expect from their friends. I think school administrators can do more to lay the groundwork for these kinds of friendships; instead, most American high schools tend to reinforce social pyramids, celebrating certain activities (stereotypically, football and cheerleading) and ignoring others. They could do more to create a tide pool environment, with many niches for kids to find like-minded schoolmates.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>I teach at a middle school and we had a MAJOR school culture issue when our last principal left. New principal came in with tons of new ideas. We separated the student body into 4 houses and have worked really hard at getting students connected with the other members of their house. One of our activities was a massive house competition rally. There were, if I’m recalling correctly, like eight categories and every student had to pick one activity to compete in. I can’t remember them all but one was athletic - trying to be the best at a bunch of different athletic activities. Another was engineering - trying to build the highest tower out of certain items. Another was puzzles - houses competed to complete the puzzles first, there was a trivia game too, etc. etc.  I was really impressed by how strategic houses were being. They really encouraged each other to do the activities they could be successful at. (The key is having a prize at the end of the year that is worth winning.) Overall it has made a HUGE difference in the way that students interact with each other. Not that bullying has been eradicated but at least having a place for every student on campus and honoring some talents that typically get overlooked.</p></div>		</li>
