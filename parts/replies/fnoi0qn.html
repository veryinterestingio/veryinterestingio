			<div class="markdown"><p>The iLet bionic pancreas is designed to be small enough to be worn in the userâ€™s pocket or under clothing. The iLet uses a rechargeable battery that would need to be recharged approximately every 5 days, depending on usage.  The battery uses inductive recharging (and is compatible with the Qi wireless charging standard, like the iPhone).  The iLet bionic pancreas communicates with the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor, and uses the Dexcom data to determine insulin and glucagon doses every 5 minutes.  The Dexcom sensor will need to be changed every 10 days.  Finally, the insulin and glucagon infusion sets and cartridges will need to be changed every 3 days for typical users.</p></div>		</li>
