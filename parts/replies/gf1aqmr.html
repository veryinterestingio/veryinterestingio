			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response, especially with a nice concise quote. In short, physics/science sort of tends to move more slowly as temperature goes down because total energy goes down with temp. So similarly, as we approach absolute zero temp, a state of zero energy, sound will essentially stop moving as there is no energy for the sound to transmit across through space. </p>
<p>&quot;much clearer&quot; - lower temps mean less ambient sounds being heard, so any sound you are intentionally trying to hear sounds clearer since there is less noise in general.</p>
<p>&quot;carry farther&quot;, like above, with less &quot;noise&quot; and ambient sounds interfering, the sound you are intending to hear can travel farther since it has less other sound to compete with or interfere with as it travels. </p>
<p>&quot;utterly silent feel&quot; is basically that in colder conditions, ambient and peripheral sounds are not transmitted as well as warmer temps, so they are less heard by an observer, giving the &quot;utterly silent feel&quot;. Because surrounding noise doesn't make it to you as much compared to warmer temps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder whether there is any, even if a small amount of effect, from the difference in signal to noise ratio that comes from colder particles vibrating more slowly than warm ones, even in the absence of other noise sources. </p>
<p>It stands to reason that if a warm particle or molecule vibrates more just because it is warm, it will be marginally less capable of being part of a clean signal path than a cold particle or molecule would. The particle that carries the least inherent vibration, will perform as the better signal transmitter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity does have an effect on the speed of sound, but it is not a straightforward one. According to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23603176_Effects_of_Humidity_on_the_Velocity_of_Sound_in_Air" target="_blank">this paper</a>, when increasing humidity from zero, sound speed first decreases, until humidity is at 14%, after which it increases. After 30%, it increases linearly. So, the answer to your question is: yes, but whether the effect is positive or negative depends on the specific comparison of humidities we are talking about.</p></div>		</li>
