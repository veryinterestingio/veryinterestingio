<p>it's actually at the speed of sound</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, it's the speed of sound in whatever material the rod is made out of. In air that's roughly 335 m/s, in diamond it can be as high as 12000 m/s. Both of those speeds are still much lower than the incredible 300000000 m/s of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related: what's the difference between P-waves (in earthquakes) and sound waves? Why do P-waves have a speed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-wave#Velocity" target="_blank">sqrt((K + 4/3 μ) / ρ)</a>, whereas sound waves have a speed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Equations" target="_blank">sqrt(K / ρ)</a>?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theoretical upper limit is the speed of light, but the speed of sound in any material is a function of its density and bulk modulus (which is a measure of how hard it is to compress a material).</p>
<p>The speed of sound in a material increases with increasing stiffness (that bulk modulus), and decreases with increasing density.</p>
<p>The fastest sound travels through super stiff material like diamond, which maxes out at about mach 35 if it were in air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon (diamond or pressurised melted carbon) gets you the highest speed. It increases with pressure and temperature.</p>
<p>Foregoing atoms in favour of using neutrons you can have very dense matter (under immense pressure) where speeds of sound approach the upper theoretical limit of (speed of light)/sqrt(3). However, recent observations of neutron stars indicate that the speed of sound inside could surpass that limit and approach the speed of light.</p>
<p>If existing matter is not a limitation than anything is possible but will always be slower than light.</p>
<p><strong>Add on:</strong></p>
<p>What the speed of sound cares about is: </p>
<p>-the number of particles per distance. (Speed is inversly proportional)</p>
<p>-the mass of individual particles</p>
<p>-the strength of bonds between particles</p>
<p>The issue is that bond strength is proportional to number of particles per distance squared. Therefore bond strength is more importaint than having fewer particles. This narrows down to crystal structures as their bonds are strong (no weaker intramolecular bonds or anything). So the ideal is a very strong but low density crystal. To be exact the speed of sound is the square root of (&quot;rigidity&quot;/density).</p>
<p>The elements in the second row of the periodic table have both low mass and small atoms. This means they could offer the best ratio for fast travel of sound if there exists a crystal structure made of them. The perfect candidate is carbon followed by bohrium and berilium. The rest are quite far behind while metals (which are also crystals) generally offering higher speeds of sound than others. (The ones making more bonds being better than others). You can of course have crystals made of multiple elements but that's too complex to get into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm that question just made me think: As the speed of light in a material is lower than the speed of light in vacuum; could a material be accelerated at all above the speed of light off that material ? And if yes; What would happen once the ship moves faster than that speed ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because transfering sound is just pushing something back and forth lots of times. The material doesn't know if its pushed once for it to move or if its a vibration of a sound thats going through it. </p>
<p>Its the same effect. &quot;speed of sound&quot; is just a more general term than &quot;speed of push&quot; because it makes more sense for liquids and gases, where pushing is a pretty vague thing, but you can easily measure soundwaves through them.</p></div>		</li>
