			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this basically OJ Simpson's life now? He still owes Ron Goldman's family so much money that basically any income he does make goes to them in part or full until the debt is fully paid. IIRC that's how the Goldman family gained ownership of that &quot;If I Did It&quot; book he tried to publish years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To shed some light, this only applies to earnings OJ Simpson earns that do not come from NFL related earnings. That book he published is about the only significant source of income that Ron Goldmanâ€™s family is receiving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Recovering debts isn't fun when the party is already poor, we refer to people with no assets as judgment proof, but for someone with a lot of assets it still takes a lot of time and effort to get paid.</p></div>		</li>
