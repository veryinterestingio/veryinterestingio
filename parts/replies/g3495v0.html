			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, this is a huge business. The people who work on predicting power usage and planning generation (depending on location, I'm sure) save the utilities massive amounts of money and get handsomely paid for it. Buy-a-Tesla-Model-S-with-your-bonus kind of compensation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I have worked with clients who buy and sell energy futures.</p>
<p>Production companies promise to deliver X GW at time Y. Distribution companies buy these futures. This guarantees enough juice when it's needed and tells production companies how much raw material they'll need or how high to turn the flow meter on the dam, when.</p>
<p>It gets more complicated when the production companies also speculate on their own futures (and other companies', too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, in Canada we sell a huge amount of electric from hydro dams in Quebec to states on the east coast like New York and New Hampshire. Given that their average cost of electric is almost 20c USD per kWh and I pay under 15c CDN at peak hours. It's real big money for sure.</p></div>		</li>
