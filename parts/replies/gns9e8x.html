			<div class="markdown"><p>You just inadvertantly wrote a great description of ADHD for neurotypical people. The subconscious process disregarding &quot;irrelevant&quot; information and preventing you from completing seemingly simple tasks is an occasional annoyance for most but for people with ADHD it is a constant struggle. </p>
<p>ADHD isn't about having a short attention span, it's your brain actively blinding you to things it mistakenly thinks are harmful to your survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may help, but it can also hinder. Stimulant medications like adderall can help you to maintain focus but it doesn't select what you focus on. You can plan on studying geography but end up fixated on a more efficient way to organize your bathroom. Pills can't fix ADHD on their own, they are just one tool in the attempt to keep up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea behind Adderall is that it's supposed to stimulate certain neural transmitters to the brain so you can be more focused. My gf of 7 years has struggled with ADHD her whole life and was unsure if the Adderall actually helped. For her she said she could be focused at the cost of becoming irritable and cold in her personality when she would take Adderall. I'm not sure what alternative treatments are out there, best idea is to consult with a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>Edit: made corrections on how Adderall really works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible to develop ADHD or ADD later in life? I'm close to thirty, but the attention (and memory) issue has increased exponentially in the past 3-4 years, to the point of forgetting EVERYTHING. It's difficult to even watch movies at this point, because it's hard to remember the plot. ):</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible that it was undiagnosed. Childhood is a barrage of constant novelty wrapped in a blanket of unavoidable structure. Once you're on your own the daily monotony and lack of defined trajectory can unearth all sorts of issues. </p>
<p>That said, ADHD overlaps symptoms with a multitude of conditions. To complicate things further, in some cases like depression, ADHD can be a contributing factor.</p>
<p>You should see a doctor that is willing to listen to you for help discovering what's going on.
It can be difficult to find the right doctor so if yours seems unreasonably dismissive, it's time to find a new one. You're not looking for someone to tell you what you want to hear, you want someone to listen to what you have to say and work with you.
(Rejection sensitivity, lack of motivation, and time blindness are all associated with ADHD and makes this type of doctor hunt even more difficult. Stick with it! You're worth it. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a medical professional, but I wouldn’t say it’s something people develop later in life. It tends to be more consistent across a persons lifetime. There are people who masked their symptoms (intentionally or unintentionally) then realized as an adult that these symptoms are causing significant issues and get diagnosed as an adult. For instance, ADHD/ADD can present differently in women so some women didn’t get diagnosed as children and then seek out resources as an adult when they are struggling or realize that they have those symptoms. There are other medical reasons why you might be experiencing memory issues so I would consult with a doctor though.</p></div>		</li>
