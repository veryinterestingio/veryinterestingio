			<div class="markdown"><p>I got bowhunting for deer (which means I have to be pretty darn close to them) and when they come into view I try not to stare directly at them. I have no idea if this helps or not. If it does help I think it’s more due to the fact that it helps me focus on other things (preparing for the shot, staying quiet, slow movements, etc.) rather than just looking at the deer with a dumb look on my face.</p></div>		</li>
