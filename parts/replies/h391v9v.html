			<div class="markdown"><p>to be a little bit more specific: If you imagine a nice streamlined shape (such as a typical jet or rocket) the shape has a nice smooth transition from pointy front to a fat middle to pointy rear end. Air has a very easy time following these smooth transitions over this body and doesn't really experience any big disruptions, or abrupt changes in its path. It kinda just slides out of the way for a second and slides back into place behind the thing. Easy enough?</p>
<p>If you have something with a very wide and abrupt backside the air can't easily flow back into place behind it and you end up with a very chaotic, mixed up region behind the body as the air flow &quot;detaches&quot; from the body and hurries in to fill the space behind it. This creates a swirling low pressure area behind the body. We know that pressure is a Force distributed over an Area, and in this case there's a negative force over that area it literally sucks that body backward, slowing it down. If we could keep that pressure the same but <em>reduce</em> the area that it's working on then we can reduce the force that pulls the body backward!</p>
<p>Now here's the tricky part - on something with that shape, using dimples is a way to trick the air into following the round abrupt backside of that body around just a little more, so the flow stays attached a bit longer. Now when it detaches and creates that chaotic swirling low pressure spot behind the body, that spot is a little bit smaller. Smaller spot, smaller area, same low pressure, what does that give us? Less force!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend studied this in one of our fluids classes. Spin will only affect the speed of the air around the ball, but the dimples will still have the same effect. This is because the speed of the air near the dimples will generally be very small. So the only thing that changes is where the flow separates from the surface. The greatest effect of spin will be creating pressure differences on the surface which creates &quot;lift&quot; on the ball. Making it stay in the air longer than if it wasn't spinning. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect" target="_blank">Magnus effect</a>. Here's a cool YouTube video of it in action: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OSrvzNW9FE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/2OSrvzNW9FE</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it is crazy. Modern premium balls have urethane covers and inner construction to have perfect compression to grip more on club faces where spin is important (wedges for instance) Pros bust the 10k rpm pretty often. The ball flight of a golf ball hit with a wedge is quite something, it &quot;balloons backward&quot; pretty high to drop way more vertically then it launched and then rolls back a lot once it hits the green.</p>
<p>And they do tricks with different materials inside the golf ball so higher swing speed clubs like the drivers where you don't want as much spin, the ball leaves the face a lot quicker so it has less time to get spin from the clubface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious then, was there another explanation for MythBuster's result?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUiGhyHC-1A" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUiGhyHC-1A</a></p>
<p>I'm fully aware that this show is a &quot;pop science&quot; show and not one with particularly rigorous, controlled, scientific testing...  But a ~10% increase in fuel efficiency for something like a car seems more significant than random noise would generate.</p>
<p>I did some reading on this which suggested that it could be effective, provided that the dimples were scaled up appropriately to whatever they were being placed on.</p>
<p>And we have to keep in mind that they had to add the clay to both cars, increasing weight dramatically, which, with something like a thin-material-skinned plane or car would be much more difficult...</p>
<p>Still, their results, while admittedly not particularly scientific or rigorous, are interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't really comment on the experiment, to be honest, since I didn't watch the full video (besides the 2-minutes one you sent), but that looks like there's some kind of error, either random or conceptual, hidden somewhere. Hopefully, they made sure that, by removing the mass for the dimples, they added it somewhere else, did they?</p>
<p>Either way, the reason why it doesn't look aerodynamically sound is the following.</p>
<p>You can split a car in two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laminar: from the nose to a bit after the end of the windshied.</li>
<li>Turbulent: from where the laminar ends to the back of the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laminar flow is, usually, better than turbulent flow because turbulent flow is related to higher friction (what we call skin friction drag). However, turbulent flow is capable of following curved surfaces better than laminar flow. In fact, for a sphere, you'll see that a completely laminar flow will have a larger wake since the curvature on the back of the sphere will be too steep for the flow and it'd rather just go straight. Turbulent flow, instead, is able to follow the curvature of the ball for longer before detaching from it, meaning you get a smaller wake. It turns out that smaller wakes make for smaller wake drag (which we usually call &quot;pressure drag&quot;). You can imagine total drag to be pressure drag + skin friction drag, and of course you want to minimize drag somehow.</p>
<p>Dimples on a car would increase the skin friction drag, and there are two reasons why I think they wouldn't help with pressure drag:</p>
<ol>
<li>The flow is already turbulent at the back of the car, i.e. where you are interested in having turbulent flow to make it so that the flow follows curvatures better, so adding dimples would only make the laminar part turbulent, which doesn't help.</li>
<li>Having a sudden 90° angle turn at the back of the car makes the base a &quot;forced detachment point&quot;. This means that, it doesn't matter whether the flow is turbulent or laminar, the shape of the wake will be very similar either way. You can imagine that as &quot;90° is too sharp a curvature to follow for both turbulent and laminar so they behave the same way&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hopefully I'm not misunderstanding anything: I'm an aerospace engineer, but I don't really know much about car aerodynamics, so I'm just applying some common concepts to them which SHOULD work. If anyone has a better guess, feel free to correct me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate the response.</p>
<p>And, as noted, I fully understand and appreciate that MythBusters is anything but scientific, it's a show for entertainment after all...</p>
<p>But I would still be interested in finding out what &quot;error&quot; was likely made that gave them this fairly significant, if not scientifically inaccurate result.</p>
<p>FWIW - I do know that they used the same car weight in both examples. So, it seems likely there was an error elsewhere, but it wasn't with the overall weight of the car. They used the same weight in clay in both cases.</p>
<p>I think they generally <strong><em>try</em></strong> to be as scientific as they can about things, given the constraints that they have... That usually at least eliminates the more obvious flaws... So it's likely the flaw is less obvious, which may mean we never really figure out what it was.</p>
<p>Oh well :-P - Thanks for chiming in!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfr9akYEbao" target="_blank">Bugatti Bolide</a> uses dimples to modify the flow around the roof-mounted air intake.  They claim it helps reduce drag and improve the efficiency of the scoop. Hypercar manufacturers certainly aren't above gimmicks, but this one is entirely focused on track performance and I'm inclined to believe the hype.</p></div>		</li>
