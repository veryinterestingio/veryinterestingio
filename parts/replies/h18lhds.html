<p>You're right, as the nucleus gets bigger, the attraction between nucleons on one side to the ones on the complete other side is basically 0, while the repulsion (between protons, from like charges) has infinite range, so keeps growing.</p>
<p>What that means is, the larger the nucleus gets, the less stable it is. You can still <em>make</em> a lot of these nuclei, they just don't stick around for very long before decaying. That means there's no real reason to draw the line at 118 and say the periodic table is <em>done</em>, but any new elements are expected to be very unstable indeed.</p></div>		</li>
