			<div class="markdown"><p>\^ This.  David Moser, in his short book <em>A Billion Voices:  China's Search for a Common Language</em>, gives a very good explanation of all of this, as well as a history of China's attempts to unify their language (as you can tell from the title).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common, and most purely pragmatic, criterion for the language-dialect distinction is that of mutual intelligibility.  If two related kinds of speech are so similar that speakers of each one can understand each other, they are usually regarded as dialects of a single language.  If comprehension is difficult or impossible, they are considered different languages.  By this definition, varieties of Chinese as remote as Beijing dialect and Cantonese--which are as mutually unintelligible as, say, Italian and French--should be considered as distinct languages.  Thus, as linguist John DeFrancis has observed, asking the question 'Do you speak Chinese?' is akin to asking 'Do you speak Romance?'  </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p>How many language groups are there in China?  The exact classifications for local languages and dialects are still debated, but seven major groups are conventionally recognized:  Mandarin (<em>guanhua</em> or <em>beifanghua,</em> 'northern speech'), Wu, Gan, Xiang, Min, Cantonese (Yue), and Hakka (Keija), each group is further divided into numerous sub-varieties, most with unclear or shifting boundaries.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to further this point... telling a Chinese person you speak Chinese doesn’t really make any sense to them. You’re really telling them I can speak the standardized national language which is based on the Beijing dialect.</p>
<p>Or to put it this way, speaking mandarin means you can speak (a) chinese language. But speaking (a) chinese language does not mean you know mandarin. </p>
<p>This plays a part in why the written language is difficult to give up. While you may speak each word differently depending your ‘dialect’ they mostly mean the same thing when read. Thus writing a message based on mandarin can also be read by a Cantonese speaker without any issue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only issue i can think of with the chinese written language is classical chinese literature. <del>Majority of classical chinese poem at the time used Cantonese as the base</del>, so when read with mandarin, the meaning is intact but the rhyme and beauty of the rhyme will not.</p>
<p>Edit: as explained by comments in more detail, classical chinese literature used middle chinese, not cantonese, though when read with cantonese it has a higher degree of accuracy in rhyme than mandarin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't get too hung up on technicalities, since in vast majority of cases when you, specially an obvious foreign-looking person, say “I speak Chinese,&quot; it's understood to refer to Mandarin.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's only because Cantonese speaker are generally educated to write in written vernacular Chinese -</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_vernacular_Chinese" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_vernacular_Chinese</a></p>
<p>So that they understand Mandarin sentence structure and vocabulary. A Mandarin speaker will have much more difficulty understanding written vernacular Cantonese. There are some newspapers and magazines that are written in Cantonese which would be a difficult read for people that don't understand the specifics of the language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a Brazilian who has actually had a conversation with someone who speaks Galician, I want to say... almost. We can almost have a conversation with each other, each speaking our own tongue. There are enough differences in rhythm and so many false cognates that it requires a lot of attention and some back-and-forth for clarifying meaning.</p>
<p>To Brazilian ears, Galician sounds a lot more like Spanish than it does Portuguese- probably because of rhythm and all the &quot;th&quot; sounds that don't exist in Portuguese. It actually sounds like a Spaniard is trying to speak Portuguese with a thick accent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably sound similar, for the same reason Basque sounds a lot like Spanish despite having zero genetic links. Dual speakers and proximity blend the sounds over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was on a business trip in Brazil and it seemed our Spanish speaking colleagues got along pretty well.  It seemed to me (not a Spanish speaker) that a lot of the difference was word choice.  Kind of like US and British English taken another degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to communicate between Portuguese and Spanish speakers, but it's way farther apart than US and UK english. Take into account that most Brazilians speak some Spanish- it's a common second language in school, and proximity with so many Spanish-speaking countries makes it a valuable language to learn for business and employment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God no. I'd say the vast majority of words are different, but most are just a little bit different. So depending on accents and countries of origin, you can often get by through guessing. It's even better written down because some of the small differences in words are amplified through the different pronunciation rules.</p>
<p>If I had to make a comparison I would say it's closer to American English vs  some of the more difficult Scottish accents. But even then I would say the difference in words and grammar is higher, and the difference in accent and pronunciation is lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah it's not like that at all, they have way more grammar tenses in spanish speaking countries than we do in Brazil. We can understand their grammar easily enough, but they have to speak real slow.</p>
<p>I personally can navigate my way through spanish text but I'm hopeless in trying to understand spoken spanish.</p>
<p>Also, it's probably easier for a spanish speaker to understand portuguese than the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yo, that's wrong on the Romanian/Moldovan aspect. Let me explain it.</p>
<p>While in the USSR, Moldovan was written with a Cyrillic Alphabet. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Republic of Moldova adopted the Latin Alphabet for Romanian, it's even an official celebration, on August 26, in both countries. </p>
<p>Moldovan as a language and identity is, mostly, but not exclusively, a creation of the Russian-speaking or Russo-phile population, in order to claim it as distinct from Romanian culture and language. </p>
<p>The issues in understanding are of slang and current usage, meaning that denizens of both countries who've studied Romanian will be able to understand each other using literary language, while the slang and the common usage of words differs greatly as Romanian, in its push west, adopted a lot of loan words from French (traditionally), and from English (after 1989), whereas Moldovans, due to constant influence and proximity adopted more loan words from Russian and Ukrainian. </p>
<p>It, usually, leads to humorous mixups when a Moldovan from Chisinau and a Romanian from Bucharest try to use their slang with each other understanding nothing. But if both revert to formal/literary language, they'd have no issue with understanding each other.</p>
<p>Romanian, in and by itself, as a language, is rife with loanwords from several sources so, even though it prides itself with having the strongest neo-Latin character of all Latin languages, it uses the Hungarian loanword for drinking glass (HU: pohár/ RO: pahar), but the Turkish loanword if it's a glass for a window (TR: cam / RO: geam), the English loanword for computer (literally computer all-around) instead of the natural ordinator/ordinateur from French, the French loanword for sweatshirt (FR: Anorak / RO: Hanorac), while a sweater is called by its (old) British English term (EN: Pull-over / RO: Pulover). All this while current use says socks are &quot;ciorapi&quot; (from Turkish) and formal use dictates &quot;şosete&quot; (from the French chaussette). </p>
<p>There's even a humorous example in that a chainsaw in Romanian is called by the Russian word for friendship - druzhba in Russian, drujbă in Romanian, because that was the most popular brand exported during the times of the Iron Curtain. Ironically, if one decides that drujba is too foreign, he'd call it a &quot;Fierăstrău cu lanţ&quot;, meaning &quot;saw with chain&quot;, which is composed of &quot;Fierăstrău&quot; - a Hungarian loanword for saw from fürésztö, the Romanian preposition &quot;cu&quot;, and &quot;lanţ&quot; - the Bulgarian loanword for chain from lanec. </p>
<p>So don't even go there.</p></div>		</li>
