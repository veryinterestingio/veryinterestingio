			<div class="markdown"><p>mhm, there are a few on each side, 3 or sometimes 4, they all govern different things like, airflow, drainage, smelling, vocal features, etc. and their functionality is commonly effected by things like a cold, allergies, sleep apnea.</p>
<p>every few hours these structures will switch roles in which side is congested and which side is open, this is called nasal cycling, and to this day no one is exactly sure why they do this, some say that it may be to let nerve endings in the tissue &quot;recharge&quot;, some say it is for the congested side to regulate humidity in the passages, or for it to remove mucus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I've read somewhere is that it also lets us catch a larger variety of smells, because our nose needs longer to detect some of them. The lower airflow through one of the nostrils would then slow the molecules down enough for this. It doesn't explain why it cycles but nature does love its symmetry.</p></div>		</li>
