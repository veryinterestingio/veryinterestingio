<ol>
<li>if the life shared any genes with some archaic form of Earth life, that would be huge.</li>
<li>If the life were cellular, that would also have enormous implications.</li>
<li>If the life were RNA or DNA like but no shared genes could be found, that would be equally massive.</li>
</ol>
<p>my guesses:</p>
<ol>
<li>implies extraterrestrial (in the literal sense) life originated from Earth, or we share a common ancestor</li>
<li>this one I have trouble with. is it because cellular life is not guaranteed among all life?</li>
<li>implies that RNA/DNA is a likely (or perhaps inevitable) organizational structure for life.</li>

<li>Abiogenesis happened once and moved elsewhere though panspermia. The place with more variation it's more likely to be the original location.</li>
<li>Cellular life may not be guaranteed, life forms may not have neat divisions between parts of their biology like we have. We don't need to be able to imagine alternatives to be aware that other possibilities that we can't even conceive of might exist. </li>
<li>If they use RNA/DNA with the same base pairs and codons we do, that would be such an unbelievable coincidence that it would indicate early panspermia.</li>

<p>It's possible life originated on Mars and migrated to Earth (we've plenty of Martian meteorites). In fact, given Mars' lower gravity, we probably have far more of Mars on Earth than Earth on Mars. However, Mars currently appears to be very hostile to life, so Earth would have the greater diversity simply by supporting it better, not originating it.</p>
<p>In fact, we <em>think</em> Mars was covered with water during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noachian" target="_blank">Noachian period</a> and that's roughly when we think life appeared on Earth. It would have been a perfect time for life transfer. In fact, <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/55481-the-ages-of-mars" target="_blank">there's speculation that the conditions for life on Mars occurred 4.3 to 4.4 billions years ago</a>, considerably before the age when life probably arrived on Earth.</p>
<p>None of this is real evidence of course, though I like the idea that we're all actually Martians :)</p></div>		</li>
