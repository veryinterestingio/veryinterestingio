<p>No. The LHC is &quot;calibrated&quot; against reality,</p>

<p>It's calibrated against the SI definitions</p>
<p>1 gram is 1 gram.  In reality, a gram 50 years ago is not physically the same number of atoms as today, but they are both defined to be equal.</p>
<p>The concept of standardizing 1 gram to a particular year is impossible.  How do you describe what a 1950 gram is?  You make a chemically inert thing that weighs what you want it to, lock it in a vacuum and try not to touch it, right?  Well that's exactly what we did with the 1 kg reference.  It's the best we can possibly do.  Any other definition you could come up with to try and describe what a 1950 gram is will be inferior to the reference kg.</p>
<p>The new definition is something that will allow us to have consistent measurements without having to worry about changes to our definition over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is this? What's changing the mass of the Paris Kilogram?</p>
<p>Is it the object itself gaining/losing atomic matter or is the position of the lab in Paris changing, relatively?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The object itself is losing mass, either via radioactive decay, outgassing of contaminants trapped in the metal when it was created, or some other issue.  It's a mass issue, not a weight issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were reference copies made of the Paris kilogram not to use this fundamental object in practice. They were measured against each other after some time, and as it turned out the copies were lighter than the original, due to the fact they were weighted often. Some atoms were left at the scale after each measurement.</p></div>		</li>
