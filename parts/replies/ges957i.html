			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, grief can be isolating emotionally too. It's harder to connect to others who are not grieving, as you'd have to explain your grief, causing you to  recount your loss. Or, you might feel like you don't want to unload on someone, either causing them stress, or risking getting emotional potentially in an uncomfortable place. </p>
<p>If you and your close family/ friends are grieving the same loss, you are all just as tired, not sleeping, not eating, etc, which can make it difficult to emotionally support each other. Its hard to hold someone else to comfort them when you can't hold it together yourself. Everyone grieving might also not experience the same emotions at the same time either- its a lot harder to connect if one person is feeling anger while another is feeling denial. You run the risk of falling back into grief, just when you think you are accepting it, if another still grieving the same loss triggers you.</p></div>		</li>
