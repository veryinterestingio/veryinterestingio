			<div class="markdown"><p>It is entirely in our heads, but not in the sense that it's purely psychological. If that were the case then people would disagree about basic color theory concepts, for example that yellow and blue contrast more than blue and blue-violet. It's a physiological thing due to the way the cones in our eyes work, so while it's not an &quot;objective&quot; truth outside of our human experience, it's also not completely subjective since it's a consequence of the way our bodies are constructed.</p></div>		</li>
