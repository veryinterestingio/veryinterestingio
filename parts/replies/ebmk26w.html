			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe Russia and what was the Qing Dynasty hashed out the details pretty soon after the Russians took Siberia with a treaty setting the Amur River as the boundary, taking their natural rival off the table. Of course that didn't stop little border skirmishes every now and then (with the later Soviets and Chinese almost going into full battle in the 1960s which the US later exploited to open relations with China) but the border remained intact for the most part because of this Qing era treaty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Russia lost 2 military campaigns against local tribes of Chukchis. Armed with bone spears and bows they were able to hold back relatively modern (for their time) Russian expeditionary forces from 1701 to 1771. They were eventually bribed join Russian empire in 1778. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: u/Echelon64 has a better answer than my assumption;</p>
<p>&quot;Slightly more complicated. The first offensive against the Chukchi cost the Chukchi 800 of their number. After that, the Chukchi decided to instead fight what we now recognize as guerrilla warfare using their knowledge of the land and attacks on lightly fortified targets and hit and run attacks to essentially defeat their Russian aggressors. The only reason the Russians gave up is because their war against the Chukchi was turning out to be more expensive than what the area brought them in wealth.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian musketry can't have been very effective against the bow and arrow. Notoriously poor standard of drilling. I imagine a Chukchi could fire off between 10 and 20 shafts before a musket was reloaded. I shudder to think how they would deal with a charge post volley, I'm not surprised they resorted to bribery. </p></div>		</li>
