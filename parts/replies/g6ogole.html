And it's even better when they're not yours because you can just chat to them on a bus or something and don't have to change their nappies and stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a video of a lioness taking a baby gnu when it was separated from his mother. The lioness had lost her own cubs. I guess that pain is what helps species and everyone in general feel empathy towards one another.  </p>
<p>There was also a video of another lioness killing a monkey and then seeing that it had a baby, she took the baby and brought it up on a tree to keep it safe from other predators, because I think some hyenas had gotten closer to get the body of the dead monkey.</p>
<p>I don't remember what happened to either the baby monkey or baby gnu.</p>
<p>But the truth is, empathy isn't exclusive to humans. I'll see if I can find those videos later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question itself is also presumptuous. It ignores the fact that some people are &quot;immune&quot; to cuteness and implies that caretaking is a universal trait in humans. Plenty of folk don't like dogs, puppies, or babies. I think there needs to be more research into human traits to adequately answer the question. What personality traits make one more likely to find cute things cute (probably Agreeableness) or to become disgusted by pets (I assume high Conscientiousness with low Agreeableness) ? What areas of the brain are activated in response to &quot;cuteness&quot; ? How different is that response in people who find pets repulsive?</p>
<p>EDIT: copy pasting below from a response to a commenter who asked what personality traits are found in people who don't like pets or babies. </p>
<p>I'm just gonna make an educated guess based on OCEAN personality framework. </p>
<p>Someone who doesn't like animals is likely to be, first and foremost, low on Agreeableness. Agreeableness is associated with caretaking behavior, and is usually higher in women (big surprise) - all the most agreeable people on the bell curve are going to be women and the least agreeable are men. If you're low in Agreeableness you don't care as much for what other people (or beings) think or feel especially if they cross you. It's related to empathy, although you can also act empathetically through conscious choice without actually feeling someone's suffering. In Buddhism, that's true empathy. </p>
<p>The second important trait in people who don't like animals I believe, is Conscientiousness. If you're high on conscientiousness, you're going to prioritize order, discipline, structure and cleanliness. Dogs and babies are notoriously messy, undisciplined and chaotic and require a lot of upkeep. Someone with high Conscientiousness + low Agreeableness isn't going to want to clean up the mess and take the time to babysit and discipline when they're already busy in life achieving more noble (by their standards) goals. </p>
<p>Neuroticism I believe can also play a role. It's the trait that determines how easily your mood is affected by negative emotion. Pets and babies, while they bring some joy, also can cause a lot of stress which can ruin your day. Highly Neurotic people + low Agreeableness aren't going to like pets or babies. </p>
<p>Extroversion is probably higher in people who like dogs, since they want to go out more than introverts. Therefore people who don't like pets are most likely introverted. They also may prefer cats since they don't require walking. But overall I don't think Extroversion is a determinant in whether someone dislikes pets or babies. </p>
<p>And the least important trait is I think, Openness to experience. It defines whether you prefer to stay in your comfort zone or to try new things. I'm not sure how this can vary in people who love pets or hate them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People do find some pets repulsive, and still have other pets/children. Meanwhile other people like pets that some people might not, like spiders/snakes.
The core mechanic is about helplessness, when something is 100% dependent on you and needs you it can assuage a lacking within the personality of the person (children and pets).
Some people do not like the sense of burden/helplessness so shy away from these interactions.
As far as animal bonding is concerned with dogs for example there is very little chance of betrayal, another comforting factor for some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not presumptuous when raising a pet is such an absurd thing to do, yet the majority of humans want to do it. Endless amounts of ontogenetic research is needed, of course, not every human will exemplify all of them, there are plenty of individual differences. But why do humans like pets? It's almost certainly because they trigger similar emotional responses that young children would. </p>
<p>It's not ignoring the fact to speak about something as typical. I know they didn't put &quot;most&quot; humans in the question but this is ELI5 so we can give them a pass on that? I would think being &quot;immune&quot; to cuteness is more of a disorder than anything else. I would be interested to know if their Fusiform Face Area (FFA) is functioning properly in their brains. It could be an issue with facial recognition. </p>
<p>I'm not saying it makes them a bad person or any sort of judgement here, but that's atypical functioning from an evolutionary perspective it doesn't make sense for that the happen. Something likely interfered with the development of that cognitive process at some point in their life. </p>
<p>I don't think bringing this back to the big 5 personality traits is something that makes sense there, finding an animal cute is probably more innate than such high level expressions of personality. And research shows that to be the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Results indicate that pet owners were more satisfied with their lives than non-owners, but did not differ on other wellbeing measures, personality measures, emotion regulation, or need satisfaction. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08927936.2016.1152721?casa_token=6CqH6Jg2fNwAAAAA%3APeAyyIzbIQUTatL00J1anvDjlgaGIVZMRorCciZ-_S6RNH72tpa88KckLTjXJa4fxEVj_XmVAEtyEA" target="_blank">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08927936.2016.1152721?casa_token=6CqH6Jg2fNwAAAAA%3APeAyyIzbIQUTatL00J1anvDjlgaGIVZMRorCciZ-_S6RNH72tpa88KckLTjXJa4fxEVj_XmVAEtyEA</a>&amp;</p>
<p>What the research does say about the personality traits is that you can predict someone's big 5 personality from the type of pet that they own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dog owners scored higher on all aspects of wellbeing compared with cat owners, and differed on a number of other measures, including the Big Five personality traits, emotion regulation strategies, and need satisfaction. The relationship between type of pet owned and wellbeing was mediated by the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, specifically), emotion regulation strategy, and need satisfaction. In addition, self-identified “dog people,” relative to “cat people,” showed similar patterns to those of dog owners, but the effects were often smaller and non-significant. Although there may not be many differences between those who own pets and those who do not, clearly owning a dog is associated with beneficial outcomes. Implications and future directions are discussed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You bring a lot of good points to think about. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would think being &quot;immune&quot; to cuteness is more of a disorder than anything else</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could it also be an &quot;overload&quot; of the cuteness mechanism?  Perhaps people who don't like pets are just <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00300/full" target="_blank">overwhelmed by cute agression </a></p>
<p>The way I see cuteness, it's like sugar. We all naturally love sugar, but when something is too sweet it becomes repulsive (and different people have different levels of what they consider too sweet). Perhaps in a similar fashion, when something is too cute it evokes aggression instead of love. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What the research does say about the personality traits is that you can predict someone's big 5 personality from the type of pet that they own:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the research didn't specify how pet lovers personalities differ from non pet lovers; it only distinguished between &quot;dog people&quot;, dog owners, and cat owners , unless I misread it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is ELI5 so we can give them a pass on that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I totally forgot that it stands for &quot;explain like I'm 5&quot;. Still it's interesting to discuss, learn and speculate in the comments on a more sophisticated level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly couldn’t agree less with this. I’m someone you’d say is ‘immune’ to cute and for me it’s a lot of factors that affect that. I do believe it’s more closely tied to personality traits than anything innate. I’ve known I’ve had a distaste for cute things since a child. Like another commenter said I feel most women really have that trait. Also if you’re not coming from a western centric view there’s entire cultures that primarily don’t have pets</p></div>		</li>
