			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not &quot;attracted&quot; to light, they use the moon  as a navigational reference, expecting it to be the brightest light in the sky. Brighter lights near them just jack up their navigation and get them stuck in bad patterns. They're just stupid little bugs running on instinct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. They are basically into anything I overpay and underuse. Luckily my cat is into them. Less luckily, they make her puke all over the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of moths that want to eat your furniture and clothing.</p>
<p>Also, even when talking about moths that don't eat textiles, it's easier for moths to get lost since many of them are nocturnal (so it's easier for artificial lights to confuse them into thinking that your house is a place they want to go).</p></div>		</li>
