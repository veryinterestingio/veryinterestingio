			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR; It is hard to fund public goods adequately when people have very different preferences over how much to spend. </p>
<p>The standard, broad approach used by economists to understand this issue is through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebout_model" target="_blank">Tiebout sorting model</a>. Basically, people with different preferences over taxes and the level of a public good—e.g. public parks, schools—will sort into different neighborhoods and cities. </p>
<p>These differing preferences may be based on family size, race, and income. For example, wealthier people and people with children will have a higher willingness to pay taxes and property prices in order to have higher-quality schools. It’s not that poor people don’t care about schooling, of course; it’s just that, given the income constraints they have, they’d rather spend an extra $1k on better public transportation access than a nicer school. Similarly, poor people might be upset if their taxes kept going up to fund more parks, which are usually lower on their priority list.</p>
<p>If we centralize school funding at the State level, so every area gets the same amount of funding based on population or number of kids, what effects will that have? Well, the main problem is that people still have different preferences on school spending but funding is coming from general revenues. So the model predicts that there will be a general decline in willingness to pay high taxes to support schools, as the State can basically no longer price discriminate. </p>
<p>This is in fact what we have found in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2944559" target="_blank">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/publications/articles/school-finance-property-taxes" target="_blank">California</a>, where per-pupil school spending was 11th in the nation before school funding was centralized and fell to 36th after school funding was centralized. When funding was centralized, many towns quickly passed ballot measures limiting tax increases.</p>
<p>So the trade off is that with centralization we can get more equal school funding for poor students, but with a diminished ability to charge based on willingess-to-pay we might be forced to lower total spending on schools. These difficult tradeoffs tell us why this is such a contentious issue, and why local funding for many public goods is a popular approach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d appreciate if you could point to a good resource for learning more about case histories like Michigan/California as well as comparative ones in states that have less centralized funding.  I’m well familiar with the effects of Prop. 13 in CA, but would love more history. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else about Michigan that surprised me is that there is only at flat income tax, no graduated income tax brackets like most other states. So you can do the math on how to centrally fund anything when tax revenues are so crappy and your population has lots of poor urban and rural people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid I don't have many good historical sources on these cases, as I don't do research on this particular issue. The two sources I cited for Michigan and California are probably a good starting point for references.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is purely a question. Doesnt that just boil down to &quot;poorly educated people are being tricked to support politicians who dont support their interests&quot;? </p>
<p>Like. Yes there is a variation in who is willing to spend what and that's a barrier. But all of the facts (please correct me if I'm wrong that's why I'm in this thread.) Are that centralized funding is the only efficient/effective method of ensuring people have class mobility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Larger school districts <em>will</em> spread that money relatively evenly throughout the district, so all schools should/will get the same amount of resources.</p>
<p>However, there will still be lower-income neighborhoods surrounding certain schools, and all of the issues that go along with them.</p>
<p>You can give all the resources equally, but that won't stop the issues at home from coming to school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But richer areas where property is worth more will have much more funding. The state I live in redistributes heavily but still not nearly enough to counteract this completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a rich area and a poor area are in the same school district, those property taxes go to the same pot of funding for the district.</p>
<p>However, individual schools within a district also can rely heavily on fundraising independent from the school district's guaranteed money, and <em>that</em> is what will separate schools quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s common for state funding to step in to try to equalize there per-pupil funding. The real inequality is that all schools are poorly funded but the wealthy schools receive more donations so they do ok</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, frankly, a school in a community with no resources needs vastly more funding than a school in a community that has fewer socioeconomic issues. As a teacher in low-income school districts in the past, I would have a class of 36, with at least 6 kids that needed behavioral therapy due to trauma, a few kids that didn’t have enough to eat, and then everyone dealing with more stress at school and home. Support for this stuff is expensive. Equity isn’t the same as equality.</p></div>		</li>
