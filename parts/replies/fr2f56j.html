			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to be aware of, though, is that over time, even a tiny rupture in a can can allow in bacteria, and create a perfect environment for some really nasty stuff to grow, such as botulism.  The reason cans expire is because it's quite likely that for one reason or another, the can will degrade enough to not be safe give enough time (although 99% of the time, a it takes LOT longer than the manufacturer says it does).  I'm not saying that a 40 year old can isn't safe to eat, but you should be totally sure there's no rusted areas, or dents.  Modern cans have polymer liners, which can help protect the seal even if the metal gets a tiny puncture, but older cans don't.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a myth, at least in the United States. Federal law only requires expiration dates on infant formula, and some states require them on milk and/or fresh meat. Otherwise expiration/best buy/sell buy dates are pretty much only there to encourage people to throw away perfectly good food and buy some more to replace it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a factory making canned evaporated and condensed milk. They use large steam tanks to heat up the cans of milk. Im guessing the steam pressure cancels out the pressure buildup inside the can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, you're exactly right. I maintain these retort cookers in a plant that makes MREs for the military. While cooking, they're under about 30 pounds of pressure and either submerged/or sprayed with water that is heated to around 250°F. If something goes wrong and we let off too much pressure too soon, it will &quot;blow the load&quot; as we call it, and all the pouches in the cook will basically balloon up and explode all at once.</p></div>		</li>
