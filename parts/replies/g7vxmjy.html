			<div class="markdown"><p>That's called slow-light theory and a few researchers work on it. It's plausible but pretty immature as a theory. Researchers have shown that they can come up with a photon mass where energy degradation + linear expansion matches observed values for a few, specific stars. Notably, slow light still has a Big Bang - it just uses linear, rather than accelerating expansion for the universe. I'm a fan of the theory, not least because it patches a couple of holes in relativity (such as the black hole singularity), but it's far too undeveloped to fully subscribe to. I'm hopeful that it'll get more attention over time, though.</p></div>		</li>
