<p>Edit: As discussed in the comments, the molecule that becomes vitamin D is specifically  7-dehydrocholesterol, which is commonly called pro-vitamin D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive been at some conferances where VitD has been a topic. So far the only case ive really heard of was one that used the wrong metric for how much supplements he should take, and ended up taking several thousand times his recommended dosage. </p>
<p>Dr. Holick says it there in the video as well, the recommended dosage is 1000 IU, in order to develop VitD toxicity you need to take 50,000-100,000 IU over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what time of day and where on the planet you are. Away from the equator there are months where no matter when you go out you will not make vitamin D.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason is that UVB rays—and only UVB rays—catalyze the production of Vitamin D. Yet UVB is reflected and blocked by the atmosphere. The more atmosphere UVB rays have to travel through, the more UVB rays are prevented from reaching the surface of the earth; and the lower the sun is in the sky, the more atmosphere these UVB rays travel through. If the sun is low enough, UVB rays are completely blocked by the atmosphere before they even reach you, and Vitamin D production is not possible.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In order for the sun to stimulate your Vitamin D production, the sun needs to be at a minimum of about 50 degrees, or greater, above the horizon (90% would be directly overhead). Ideally, the sun should be as close to overhead as possible; the closer to overhead it is, the greater its potential for stimulating Vitamin D production (and the less time you have to be in the sun to produce a given amount of Vitamin D).</p>
<p>A good way to test if the sun is about 50 degrees above the horizon, or higher, is that your shadow should be slightly shorter than you are tall. If the shadow cast by your body is the same length, or longer, than your height you will not produce Vitamin D–even while your skin is exposed to direct sunlight. And this is under ideal conditions: clear skies without cloud cover or pollution.</p>
<p>Note: this angle depends on many factors and Vitamin D production is not all or nothing. In actuality, you may start to produce a tiny amount of Vitamin D when the sun is slightly lower in the sky, but this amount seems to be inconsequential. It is only when the sun is 50 degrees or higher that the amount of Vitamin D produced starts to become significant. And the higher the sun is above 50 degrees, the higher the rate of your Vitamin D production.&quot;</p>
