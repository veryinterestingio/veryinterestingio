<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hear an ambulance? Someone might be dying. Or you could see it as people have always been dying, now someones on the way to help.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Country gets aid help for years after a disaster. They must have been devastated. Or you can look it at how great it is that someone could muster enough manpower, time, and money to repair such a mess.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This doesn't help the discussion just something I've noticed. There's usually a really positive way to see things but our mind filters it away for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be the best case scenario, though, if there is already trauma. I lost an uncle to brain cancer when I was around 4, and I'd been going with my grandmother and him do doctor appointments since I was 2. I am 38 now and have no memory of that, though I do have some residual memory of him. During my EMDR treatment, I grieved him for the first time. It was crazy, I had never suffered because of his death, since I was so young. But the therapist asked me to hear my mom's account of what it was like when he was sick and died, as &quot;homework&quot; to complement the EMDR sessions, and I cried the entire time she was talking. She was pretty calm and serene about it, but I was a wreck. I still feel my eyes well up when I talk about this uncle. So this showed me that even though I was too young to have self-awareness of my suffering, I did have unresolved emotions about it that I would never have guessed I had before. I mean, I talked about this uncle here and there prior to my mom's account and I had never felt grief or sadness, only mild wistfulness about the fact that he wasn't allowed to grow old (he was 22 when he passed). So yeah, the EMDR did some serious digging. And it connected, much like a sensation/emotion map, my feelings from the time to other times in my life I felt seemingly unrelated fear or sadness. So the end goal of the therapy wasn't even to make me grieve my uncle finally, it was to deal with this sort of phobia/trauma that I have. So the process helped me connect those things through the recognition of similar sensations and feelings I had in my life. It really did touch on all of those things. I'm still not 100% over the phobia and I am probably not 100% done grieving my uncle belatedly, but EMDR sure helped me get out of a rut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sums it up perfectly. I’ve been in trauma therapy for a little over a year now, and I’ve made more progress than I have in the past ten tears in on and off talk therapy. It quite literally saved my life. I know trauma therapy is not easy on the therapist either, so thank you for what you do.</p>
<p>In my sessions, we use small “paddles” that I hold in each hand for the bilateral stimulation, so my eyes are closed the whole time. Doing it with an light machine seems like it would be more difficult, since I am envisioning the events/memories in my mind while we are processing them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend psychedelics for trauma. Changed my life. There are loads of studies demonstrating incredible results for long term PTSD sufferers. Of course, it should be taken in a therapeutic environment, but you can consider it the fast track to trauma recovery.</p></div>		</li>
