			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect means same exact wavelength and travelling in the exact same initial direction.  Beam size plays no role theoretically in the divergence of a beam. </p>
<p>In theory, a small beam can be perfectly collimated just as much as a large one and neither will diverge. In practice, no beam is perfectly collimated so both will diverge. </p>
<p>I think there is a misunderstanding between the beam itself and individual photons. Of course an semi-infinitely large light source would appear to be seen as a beam that does not diverge, but it's photons can still be diverging. In this case, it can hardly be defined as a beam though....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm missing something, but doesn't the Fourier transform relationship between near field and infinity dictate that a finite support in the near field directly implies infinite extent far away?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a recent paper which describes light refraction of light by itself in an ultra intense beam</p>

<p>What sort of energy levels are we talking about here?</p></div>		</li>
