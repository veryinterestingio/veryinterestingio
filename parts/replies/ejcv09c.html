			<div class="markdown"><p>A good friend came up through ER in the 80s and says there's no way you could run a program like that anymore. Throughout his residency, each class was learning almost exclusively from each other and the class directly above them and he could easily go most of a week without even seeing an attending physician. </p>
<p>I don't know if he'd say if current methods are better or worse because there's a whole lot more safety net for residents than before, but those same safety nets would've robbed him of a lot of the learning opportunities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current methods are better (albeit they still need significant improvement) because there's actual regimented training and while you might miss some clinical experience by not living in the hospital, you're more well rounded, less sleep deprived, and less likely to kill yourself.  Even with all that, the rate of med student and doctor suicide is incredibly high and work practices are still decades behind many other industries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>‘less likely to kill yourself’ is so true, one of the anaesthetists I worked with if trained in New Zealand, same training program as other commonwealth countries back in the 80s. The suicide rate is extremely high because the surgeons/physicians were being nasty, pay was low, hours were long and it was very stressful. Nowadays it’s much better for junior doctors.
Saying that, job security is getting worse in Australia because there is an oversupply in doctors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's his opinion based on being a medical resident and then working as attending physician at teaching hospitals for 20 or so years. That he saw more patients and a larger variety of injuries than you would today at a given career stage today. </p>
<p>I don't know that he would say that the way it was done then was optimal for patient care, but emergency medicine was still a very young field in the US at the time.  There wasn't near the same depth of practitioners as there are today. You literally didn't have a practitioner with 20 years experience when he was a resident because the field wasn't that old yet.</p></div>		</li>

I remember reading that it forces your body to stay more awake so maybe it's a placebo. Drinking sugary drinks vs drinks with caffine also helped since crashing from caffine always killed me.</p></div>		</li>
