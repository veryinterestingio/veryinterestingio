			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a biochemist interested in making genetically modified microbes for sustainable resources. Our issue is basically the same as y'all. We have bacteria that eat plastic (but it takes a month for a few square centimeters to degrade) or make rocket fuel (but it takes a month to make 0.1 g); not economical, not competitive. But one day, both our fields will overcome those issues. Godspeed!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you‚Äôre asking but it would probably have to do with the space needed. If the (arbitrary example of 4x4x4 cm cube) plastic is fully surrounded by bacteria and it already takes a month to degrade, you need to have a new chamber to house another piece of plastic. You can make the current chamber larger for more plastic but that needs more room. Even if the bacteria exist solely on plastic, they need to metabolize it. You can‚Äôt keep replacing the bacteria during metabolization because the old bacteria would need to be stored, or destroyed, and the new bacteria would also take storage space while it ‚Äúwaits it‚Äôs turn.‚Äù All of these take more space which costs more money to buy, maintain, and regulate (in terms of keeping the conditions right for the bacteria to breed, grow, and function) </p>
<p>The only way to really speed the process is to get the bacteria to eat more at once and metabolize it more quickly. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs the end goal but it takes time and effort to reach that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a biochemist, but I imagine part of the problem is that not all of the particles are available at the same time. Many plastic products have a lot of layers and you have to eat away the top layer to expose the next. Therefore, you'll only be able to fit enough bacteria to cover the surface area without poisoning each other with the level of waste they produce. A plastic with a very high surface area-to-volume ratio (thinner) would be able to be consumed much faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All sorts of reasons, I can imagine. Limited surface area is probably a big one. And even if you spend a ton of energy/money to slice the plastic into super small pieces so more bacteria can be used, the waste of those bacteria probably start to interfere with their own metabolic processes. Just like how you can only have so many farm animals stacked on top of each other before they start getting each other sick with their own excrement</p></div>		</li>

<p>I‚Äôm curious what the specific barriers are that stop sustainable polymers from being competitive. If you don‚Äôt mind explaining? I mean, not on the chemistry level but just the cliff notes of the problems you‚Äôre trying to solve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give you a complete answer I wouldn't be able to leave the chemistry out, but I'll try to, in keeping with the spirit of ELI5:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why different plastics are different? Your laptop case is hard to the touch, shopping bags are soft and tear easily, and so on. Glossing over the different processing methods, this is largely due to differences at the molecular level in the structure of these plastics. All plastics are essentially long strings of the same repeating building block and depending on the shape and nature of these building blocks you get different plastics with different physical properties! </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So things like strength, toughness, rigidity, are all derived from these unique repeating units - pretty neat! Petrol-based plastics are called such because the tiny units that they consist of are derived from processed oil/fossil fuel reserves. These units have a unique shape and nature which is not found (easily) in plants. You can think about these strong commercial plastics as being made up of circles and our best plant-based plastic as being made up of octagons - not quite circles but getting there! So we chip away and try to add a few sides to our octagons or find an even better shape altogether.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then of course you realize we not only need to replace the circles, but the triangles, the squares, and 100 more shapes -  used for the thousands of other applications of modern plastics. This is why you shouldn't be surprised if plastic bottles are soon made of completely renewable material, yet your phone is not for another 20 years. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hope this helps! I'm happy to have a more technical conversation about it all if anyone would like to!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your choice of shape metaphor is particularly effective, I might borrow or refer to it at other times this topic is brought up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I‚Äôm not the previous chemist but I can take a stab here.</p>
<p>There are a large number of different types of plastic with varying performances in categories like gas permeability, impact resistance, tensile strength, UV resistance, flexibility, melting point, glass transition temperature, color, clarity, texture, ‚Äútoughness‚Äù, resistance to scratching, ease of manufacture, just to name a few.</p>
<p>The key is in the individual monomer that makes up the polymer and how they interconnect. </p>
<p>We‚Äôve gotten really good over the last 70-odd years at tuning various types of petroleum plastics to meet specific requirements in those categories. Now we‚Äôre taking about starting all that over again with the plant-based plastics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My BIL works for a plastics company, and I can‚Äôt confirm this is pretty accurate. </p>
<p>He works with other companies who order plastics with specific properties. Basically, some company will have a use case where they have very specific needs that can‚Äôt be met with some common off the shelf mix. So they come to his company and give the requirements. They then use their many decades of experience with various petroleum solutions to come up with some solution which meets the need exactly. </p>
<p>When it becomes practical, they will add new materials based on whatever sustainable solution to their catalog. But it will be a very long time before they car replace all of their solutions with things from sustainable sources.</p></div>		</li>
