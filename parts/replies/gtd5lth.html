			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think it has to do with &quot;flow state&quot; as other people mentioned. But I feel like such states exist in different flavors. I know that other activities like driving in lonely roads (i.e. only having to care about the direction and speed, not other cars), walking,  gardening, doing manual work/DIY projects can bring me into flow states, but I'd describe them rather as states of intense enjoyment of doing what I'm doing. For gardening or DIY it is the pleasure of acting on the physical world, the feel of matter being shaped if that means anything? Even pulling weeds can be a pleasure if the weather is enjoyable. Driving a lonely road can feel like interpreting a music partition if that makes any sense. But in general, when I do these things, it is the contrary, I'm totally aware of my surrounding, it feels like a meditation.</p></div>		</li>
