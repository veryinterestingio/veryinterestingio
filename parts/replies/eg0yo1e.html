			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the study I read two glasses of wine or spirits a day can reduce calcification of arterial build up. This is due to the combination of ether and blood flow. The drink mixes with blood and coats the arterial walls from oxidizing stray cells and thins blood while speeding up pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally don't trust that at all. There are several studies out there that find that there is 0 heart benefit from drinking wine. Here is a mythbusting article from Harvard about the issue:
<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-red-wine-good-actually-for-your-heart-2018021913285" target="_blank">https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-red-wine-good-actually-for-your-heart-2018021913285</a></p>
<p>Yeah, there are a couple studies that contradict that and say that it does have benefits, but consider this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nih-cancels-100-million-study-of-moderate-drinking-as-irrevocably-compromised/2018/06/15/21f09fe2-7007-11e8-bf86-a2351b5ece99_story.html" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nih-cancels-100-million-study-of-moderate-drinking-as-irrevocably-compromised/2018/06/15/21f09fe2-7007-11e8-bf86-a2351b5ece99_story.html</a></p>
<p>Alcohol is a huge industry and it's a big money maker. The fact that the <em>National Institute of Health</em> was going to do a huge, long term study about the health risks/benefits and that it ended up getting shut down due  to evidence that they took tens of millions of dollars in bribes to skew the study in the favor of the alcohol companies says a lot, imo. </p>
<p>There is no real evidence that any amount is good for you and there are a couple studies that refute that claim.</p>
<p>I dunno, you do you, but personally, I think it's a fabrication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The major difference is age does play a huge factor. Even with many plaques when we are young our arteries have the ability to dilate to increase flow. As you age your arteries lose this ability as their walls become much less elastic and harden. This combined with severe atherosclerosis is what leads people to have problems.</p>
<p>This is why some four hundred pound people who are still young aren't falling over dead. Especially with no family history of heart disease.</p>
<p>One other thing you forgot to mention is not smoking. Smoking is a massive risk factor for developing atherosclerosis and heart disease, among other things. </p></div>		</li>
