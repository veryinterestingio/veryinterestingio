			<div class="markdown"><p>since no one answered yet, it happens in VR when you get too immersed. for example, during a virtual drop, your brain thinks it's real and prepares for the drop indirectly stimulating the feeling rather than actually &quot;feel&quot; it physically.</p>
<p>that's how i think it is anyways based on my intuition since i felt the same before when doing the leap of faith in the game &quot;assassins creed&quot; as well. (and other game situations)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this happen regardless of having experienced a drop/fall in real life or not?</p>
<p>Or put differently, is the sensation of that internal stress something that the brain instintively already knows or something that it has to experience first in order to recreate the feeling in a situation where that internal stress isn't exerted on the tissue and organs?</p></div>		</li>

<p>no real proof here but if i have to guess, i would think you would have to know the feeling first before you can simulate it yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if a person that has never experienced those kinda drops in their live tried it out, would their brain try to simulates that feelings as well? Since they dont have prior experience of that, it might not get tricked</p></div>		</li>
