			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok...so I am far from an expert. But it seems like the real issue is gravitational &quot;pollution&quot; from gravity wells (ours, the sun, the moon, whatever). Couldn't we perform an experiment at a Lagrange point? Have two masses &quot;fall&quot; towards each other? I mean, I assume they'd be small enough that we could get a pretty precise idea of their masses, right? Wouldn't this solve the problem of not knowing earth's mass? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am by no means an expert on this, this is from what I remember from my physics classes when we tried measuring it ourselves. Sure, you can go way the hell out in space to measure gravity, but you have to get way the hell out there in the first place. Then you still need to take local factors into account, since someone's gotta be there to measure everything. Ultimately it's not worth it, we wouldn't get enough out of knowing to want to try.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, I get that. But I am assuming there are far fewer variables there than on earth. And I know we've sent satellites to Lagrange points before. I'm assuming that this is something that could be automated (the same way that Martian soil analysis is automated...we have no actual people on Mars either). </p>
<p>Is it that measuring this to a higher precision is just not that important? Or is there something really obvious that I'm missing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that would be an interesting thing for SpaceX top launch I their next demo flight. Two one-ton masses (known to at least five significant digits) separated by a light rod in which they can slide and that has a release mechanism and position sensors and a radio, all mounted in detachable hardware that leaves or at Lagrange point and flies away. Can't be that expensive so if the spaceship blows up on takeoff it's not a big issue. A university should do this and convince Space to launch for free in a high risk rocket (e.g. first flight of the Starship).</p></div>		</li>
