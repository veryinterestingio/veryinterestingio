			<div class="markdown"><p>It totally looks creepy, but I get what you mean. I'm not even sure how you would be able to explain to someone what happened  but I'm sure they have the same issue and will understand if they can get past being weirded out. How do you even react to that? In that respect, it really sucks for you. I'm a neurodiverse woman, and for the first time I thought about how awkward this must be for men, especially when talking to a woman face to face. I zone out an excessive amount, I feel for you. The best is when people think you're choosing to not pay attention to them, but because you do this like 10 times an hour you can't remember what was happening ever, like you have memory loss, but you don't. That sucks like hell, because you don't realize it's happening and there are zone out holes in your memory scattered like war mines, and I imagine when you add tits into that equation you would be seen as a massive jerk a lot. <em>pats on back</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooo, I have no answer, but I have observed myself. So I'll leave some food for thought here.</p>
<p>On the train, while I'm standing, I've noticed my eyes tend to rest on people's gead, but sometimes on chest level. When I'm at the same height (like sitting or both standing), they tend to rest on chest area (regardless of male or female though!). Other than that, I've noticed when no one is around, my eyes tend to rest on like a solid and darker filled spaced (like my desk frame) rather than multi colored or lighter colored place. </p>
<p>You may have heard of a little experiment when people stare at you, you tend to stare back. Usually (for me), it feels like 'woah, I should look this way, but I'm not sure why' to catch that stare, but in 'the state', it sometimes feels like nothing or feels like someone is staring daggers at me (both at very extremes of the spectrum). </p>
<p>Very curious about this phenomena.</p></div>		</li>
