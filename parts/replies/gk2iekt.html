			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they aren't distinguishable.   My brother and I have the same timber, same speech characteristics.  Same accent.  My mom can't tell us apart on a recording or on the phone.</p>
<p>The only way to tell us apart on the phone is what we say, not how we say it.   Since we have the same speech patters, my mom has to wait until one of us says something specifically we only talk about.  </p>
<p>We don't look a thing like each.  I'm 2 inches taller and at least 40 lbs heavier.  I'm broad shouldered, he's got narrow shoulders.  Yet our voices are like twins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's three of my sisters and I that all sound alike in a lot of situations, but mostly when laughing or saying specific quotes and phrases we all use. However, when sister number two has a cold she sounds identical to sister three and when I am angry I sound identical to sister one. It's so weird and my mom hates it. Those are also the two pairs that most resemble one another as well. It's ... Weird. We all look alike that apart people tend to have a hard time knowing which one we are, but together you can totally see the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once stole my sister’s phone and recorded my voice on her voicemail, saying:</p>
<p>‘Hello?’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>‘Who’s that?’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>‘Sorry I’m not here right now but leave a message’ etc.</p>
<p>About a month later I called her phone and tried to have a conversation with the recording of myself, because I thought it was her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The resultant sound is formed of the fundamental frequency from the vocal chords as well as other frequencies which get amplified or filtered due to the physiological dimensions AND the behaviour of the speaker in terms of speaking (breathing pattern, jaw movement, tongue movement). These frequencies are known as formants. The physiology of your larynx, vocal chords, throat, mouth, will probably be quite similar to your brother's. Indeed, these things are largely separate from other physiological features such as short/tall/fat/thin (why you get short skinny guys with high or hella deep voices and vice versa). </p>
<p>On top of this, the way you move your mouth, form sentences, and add cadence and tone when speaking will be super similar if you were raised in the same environment (like sharing parents from whom you learn how to speak), and this also affects the formants in the final sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really want to find all the spring literature, but a great place to look at this is bats.  They love in massive colonies, they all emit a range of frequencies that is relatively small, and they must distinguish those sounds.  There is a lot to this, but part of this in the brain is areas maximally sensitive to a very narrow range as the brain goes through levels of processing.  The visual field had an analogous ability to have certain areas maximally respond to a line at different angles--think a spinning bar maximally stimulating different areas as it completed a 180°rotation.  </p>
<p>These pattern recognitions are the basis for things like optical illusions.  Listening to Frank Caliendo talk on his ability to produce the voices he does was actually enlightening in this regards.  Many of the voices are actually the same voice with only a change in pace, gait, and pronouncing.  Obviously, those are important to the identity of a voice, but the idea is the way he has to physically manipulate his voice is only part of it.  The test is pattern recognition.  He have engrained in our mind what Charles Barkley sounds like, and he simply has to flip the switches in the right order to convince is that is who we are hearing.</p>
<p>*Bats require the output to also be compared to the input.  Take the voice you hear the most, and listen to a recording.  </p>
<p>**Because of the structure of our face, we have a very different input than those that heat is speak.  Imagine being able to recognize everyone's voice in a recording but your own</p></div>		</li>
