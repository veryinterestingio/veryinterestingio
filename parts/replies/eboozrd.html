			<div class="markdown"><p>It can work the other way around too, if the husband really is late for the first time and his wife wants to convince him that he was late all week or so. Or the husband calls everytime he is late and can prove that heâ€˜s really working longer. Then the wife could say that the call never happend.</p>
<p>Thats the problem with gaslighting, everbody will have problems knowing what is real, sometimes even the abuser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a person who thinks it is funny to do this, to the point that he tells other people a false story and tries to have multiple people in on it. Not to his benefit, but because the frustration that it creates in me his somehow funny to him. The frustration being his logic of, &quot;If person x and person y say what I am saying, then it is definitely true and  you are incorrect in thinking it is not&quot;</p>
<p>Then, when I get mad about it, suddenly I am the asshole. Eventually, every single time it comes to, &quot;What is your problem it was a joke&quot; but it is not funny because it drives me fucking insane with frustration and anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The making you question yourself so you track things more closely and then get accused of being crazy is spot on.</p>
<p>My ex once told our therapist that I never left her alone when she went to visit her sister (who lived about an hour away and had a new baby). She needed time to herself and with her family. Ok, fair enough. The next time she visited, I made a point to not call or text her. </p>
<p>She again told our therapist that I wouldn't ever leave her alone when she visited her sister and she needed space some times and I just didn't get it. So I pulled out my phone and showed how I didn't initiate any texts and I only responded to hers with one-liners. </p>
<p>She said &quot;see, this is what it's like. he always has to be right and can't just listen to what I'm telling him&quot;.</p>
<p>A couple weeks later, in true gas lighting fashion, she told him that it was a huge problem that I wasnt involved enough with her family and was never willing to join her to visit her sister.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I shared the final tipping point in a reply to a post titled &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ig6v9/divorced_men_of_reddit_what_moment_with_your/dj6m1fh/" target="_blank">Divorced</a> men of reddit: what moment with your former wife made me think &quot;Yup, I'm asking this girl to divorce me.&quot;?&quot;. It got a few thousand upvotes and has been stolen for those click bait content articles.</p>
<p>Basically, the escalation is that she eventually accused me of punching her. </p>
<p>In our next session, she denied ever saying that, and accused both of us of lying. He gave me a look like &quot;dude, run&quot;.</p>
<p>This anecdote here about the texting was early on in our counseling, so the counselor tried to unpack everything. Saying to me, &quot;Well, you know, if you always trying to be right is something that bothers her, then even situations like this can make her feel that way&quot; and saying to her, &quot;you know, you need to be clear on what you want from him and hold yourself accountable too&quot;. That sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Eventually, there were several examples of things like this that made it clear what she really wanted was to not be in the relationship and wasn't actually trying to fix it. And at that point it was mutual.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Counseling was the best thing ever for that relationship because it gave me the confirmation i needed that it was healthier to not be in it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an experience that tore me down so much, that to this day if you can make me doubt myself, I'm done.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I was in grade 8 I had watched the movie Aliens on CITY TV in Ontario a couple of years after the theatrical release, and there was a scene from the movie that involved these sentry guns. When high school rolled around, a friend had rented the movie on VHS and we watched it and I kept waiting for the scene to come up because I had hyped it up. The scene never happened. From that moment on, every time there was any doubt about me or my memory, that was the proof given that I did not have a grasp on reality. From that point on, all the way until 2009, every time I mentioned that scene every one told me I was crazy and I believed it. How was it nobody else remembered that scene?</p>
<p>For most of my adult life, any time I had to be 100% certain about a piece of information I'd write it down, check it 2 or 3 times and even then I was never sure. The instant anyone questioned that info I'd immediately assume I was wrong and they knew better.</p>
<p>Stupid part was, I was eventually vindicated and sure enough that scene existed in a director's cut I bought in 2009 but none of the people I used to argue with about it could see that I was right. I now continue to always doubt myself because of how long it went on. It became a part of my psyche.</p></div>		</li>
