<p>Kind of a bummer because I want a machine heart that never breaks now. Haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They basically get fatigued.  Just like if you went out and ran a few miles.  It just takes less for them to fatigue.  The LVAD/TAH is set a predetermined RPM/rate by the mechanical support team that is caring for the patient.  This rate is determined by echo typically in a very controlled fashion.  The rate does not adjust.  </p>
<p>If venous return where to increase however (if systemic vascular resistance decreases) then there could be an indirect increase in flow due to increased pre-load to the VAD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copied from my reply above.</p>
<p>The device doesn't really respond the way you imagine. It doesn't replace the heart, it just works with it. </p>
<p>The left ventricle is the powerhouse of the heart, it forces the blood through the body. The measurement for how well the heart is working is called ejection fraction. In a normal heart, the ejection fraction is roughly 60%-meaning 60% of the blood in the left ventricle is pushed out with each heartbeat. </p>
<p>In a person with heart damage the ejection fraction is lower. I've seen people with an ejection fraction of 10% still living somewhat functional lives. </p>
<p>The LVAD (left ventricular assist device) does exactly as the name suggests; it increases the output of the left ventricle. Even without the LVAD, a lot of patients would still be alive...just not very functional and what little is left of the heart would give out sooner.</p>
<p>Edit: I realized I never really answered your question. Using a heart monitor(electrical activity) you will see an increase in heart rate. Since the LVAD is generally more powerful than what's left of the heart there is no increase in pulse as you really don't feel a pulse. When monitoring blood pressure(Doppler) during exercise; the MAP can sometimes increase slightly as what's left of the patients heart tries to compensate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like forcing that much blood movement would cause an aneurysm or something.. Even if the heart can push 100L/min of blood, doesn't mean your tiny veins and arteries can fit that volume.</p>
<p>I have no idea how the human anatomy works, but I'd be curious to know how this would go down. In my mind you get a huge burst of blood going out and expanding veins/arteries on the way out, and then the suction created behind the pump would constrict everything to the point of nearly closing... Just seems like severe damage all over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would have all the problems of anybody else with incredibly high blood pressure and probably have a seizure around 200 mmHg. Note that just because their blood pressure can't be measured with a cuff doesn't mean the pressure isn't there, you could measure it with an arterial line. It will be a constant BP instead of systolic over dyastolic, but you could measure it. At the equivalent of 500 bpm from a healthy heart you'd be bleeding out your eyeballs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's ongoing research into replacing/supplementing haemoglobin in blood with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_substitute" target="_blank">synthetic oxygen-carrier</a>, which could potentially be far more efficient - I'm sure I've read one molecule (assuming it could be made to work) would allow 200x the available oxygen transport. That's like, take a deep breath, swim under water for an hour... Obviously that's nowhere near where we are now, but it's an alternative approach for performance which doesn't rely on tons of extra blood flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The very big drawback to these rotar devices is that blood cells wind up sheared quite a bit. It affects long term survival, making these devices really only a short term solution until a matched heart can be donated and transplanted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older devices had this problem, but shearing is minimal in a newer-generation, smoothly operating device. It becomes a problem if clot develops in the device or with other types of outflow obstruction (e.g. pannus formation). That is why some devices, like the Heartmate 2, are approved for both destination therapy and bridge-to-transplant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Heartmate 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still has this issue. There are numerous flow issues related to the fluid dynamics of the impeller rotor due to variable RPM and fixed blades as well as impact with the stator vanes. The Heartmate 2 also uses physical bearings that come in contact with blood, even though it uses ruby bearings to minimize friction, there is still significant amounts of heat generated. </p>
<p>Heartware is much better though with magnetic bearings and a centrifugal configuration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but even with newer devices the shearing and consequent destruction frequently outpaces the production of new cells. Patients are anemic and can require transfusions. </p>
<p>Destruction of red blood cells creates another problem as it begins a clotting cascade making clot formation in the device more likely. </p></div>		</li>
