			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, workers go through many different tasks for the hive as they age. I believe the youngest workers care for the eggs and larva, and the eldest forage for nectar with several intermediate jobs in between. (Please correct me if I'm wrong).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are negative feedback loops built into bee behavior which actually can convert a bee from one job to another.  Foragers, for example, who end up waiting too long to deliver their nectar to another bee whose job it is to store and cure it into honey will buzz or beep or complain in a way that encourages bees that in other jobs to take up the job of storing and curing the honey.  It's all contained in the &quot;waggle dance&quot; and the &quot;beep&quot; and other stuff they do.</p>
<p>An individual bee is dumber than a sack of hammers but the entire colony is actually quite sophisticated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something of a continuum between purely environmental and purely genetic caste determination; many species are somewhere in the middle.  Check out <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Nature-versus-nurture-in-social-insect-caste-Schwander-Lo/ccac30b18b1d5303a863e17f501540613bd75732" target="_blank">Schwander et al. 2010</a> and especially table 1 thereof.  Only a few have <em>purely</em> genetic caste determination though, such as the little fire ant <a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/Ants/Taxonomic-List-of-Ant-Genera/Wasmannia/i-GZG2nHx/0/a04580c6/X2/auropunctata24-X2.jpg" target="_blank"><em>Wasmannia auropunctata</em></a><em>.</em>  This species is really weird; I wrote another comment on it a while back which I'll quote here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in the <em>Wasmannia auropunctata</em> fire ants I mentioned above, queens produce workers through normal sexual reproduction, but produce other queens by cloning themselves.  You can read about this more in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03705" target="_blank">Fournier et al. 2005</a> if you're interested; essentially, workers are the result of hybridization between two lineages, while queens are &quot;purebred&quot; so to speak.  This is obviously super weird and not commonly seen in ants, but it does represent an example where genetics pretty much have complete control over the fate of a female ant.</p>
