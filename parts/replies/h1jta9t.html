			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, websites and services have steadily improved to take advantage of the higher bit rate available. There's more data on a page today then there was when 3G was launched. So, when you <em>do</em> have 3G coverage your browsing experience may be pretty dismal just because it can't keep up with the modern internet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is one of the most depressing admissions one can get from the industry.
It matters the most to get as much information from the user as the system will allow, device metrics, connection, ISP, geolocation, operating system and version, other apps installed, third party cookies.
To provide the user with the information he is looking for is almost an undesired byproduct of the whole process. To respect the user’s data cap is not even an afterthought.
I remember my mom’s Android device ran out of her monthly data in less than a week back in the day, because that shit phoned home so damn much.</p></div>		</li>
