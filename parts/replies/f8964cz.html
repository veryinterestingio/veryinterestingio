			<div class="markdown"><p>There are bacteria which look at groups of viruses as tasty snacks, as well as fungi which would digest them or excrete harmful compounds simply as a matter of course. Even more alarming (if you're a virus) is that there are viruses which preys on other viruses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virophage" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virophage</a></p>
<p>As far as physical trauma, nothing like a human rubbing them or crushing them would matter because as you said, they're tiny. Being abraded by microscopic dusts and sediment, having their substrate eaten by a single-celled organism or otherwise disturbed, and that kind of thing would have an impact though.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>decided to do the math:<br />
quick google search says viruses vary in diameter 20-400 nm. Let's call it 100nm = 1 x 10 ^ -7 m<br />
humans vary in height about 1-2 m. Let's call it 1.7 m<br />
dividing them gives a multiple of 1.7 x 10 ^ 7<br />
1.7 x 1.7 x 10 ^ 7 m = 28900 km (edited for correctness)<br />
diameter of earth = 12742 km<br />
So, a person is about as much bigger than a virus as the earth is bigger than a person.  Agent Smith was right! humans really are like a virus to earth.</p>
<p>thank you for the silver, kind stranger!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses tend to be very specific to certain organisms. If another organism comes along and consumes the virus, and its body temp is above/below the virus’ tolerance, or its reception sites don’t fit the virus, or if its DNA isn’t right for the virus’ inserted reproductive DNA, then the virus just becomes another packet of consumable carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So no light either? I'm not really sure how long it would take to deactivate. It might be that freezing and being totally dehydrated would damage it enough to inactivate it, but I'm not sure how long it would last. Some viruses are believed to be able to survive even interplanetary journeys though, and that's will sunlight taken into account. Some viruses are <em>really</em> hardy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. I guess I meant in the absence of anything harmful. I guess interplanetary travel is rarely quick, so if that's the case, it's a good long time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When the word deactivated is used those this mean the virus could be reactivated with the right conditions and its DNA is ok?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would decay. All molecules, including the proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates in viruses (and any other biological organisms) are subject to breakdown. This happens faster at warmer temperatures, but keep in mind that even in cold temperatures, molecules are still moving and colliding with each other all the time, and some of them will degrade. Even if the fraction of molecules this happens to is small, given enough time, so many components of the virus particles will have degraded in some form, making it inviable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If by nothing you mean literally nothing mucking with it at all, I'd say there's a high chance that it'd just stay in stasis as they don't have the complex functions that larger ... Creatures have. If there's literally no chemical or physical changes... It's in a total state of stasis. As life evolves around it, there's a very high likelihood that it'd be totally useless in the future, as far as propogation is concerned for it's species.</p></div>		</li>
