<p>I believe if a bunch of kids somehow grew up together somewhere that language didn't exist, they'd naturally invent one.</p>

<p>Has this ever been tested? I'd love to read more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a fascinating example of the development of a novel language, though it should be noted that it did not emerge in a context where <em>no</em> language existed. The group of children were getting classes in spoken Spanish and lip-reading, and most came to the school with different systems of homesign as well. They certainly knew about language as a concept, even if they were not fluent in any initially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond Nicaraguan Sign, there are numerous examples in Twin, which is a frequent development in twins. They mature at the same rate and so can frequently present with a natural language, that is entirely coherent to themselves</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should look into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptophasia" target="_blank">cryptophasia</a>. It’s a well known (though not well understood) phenomenon where twins invent their own language that only the two of them can understand. They tend to drop it in favor of their parents’ language as they get older but the language they come up with as infants do seem to have some similarities from one case to the next</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I felt that the way the question was posed it would be better to focus on more unique human instincts. Just like beavers have a somewhat unique instinct to build dams.</p>
<p>Avoiding danger, Sucking a nipple and eating food are, as you said, basic animalistic survival instinct. They're present throughout just the entire animal kingdom.</p></div>		</li>
