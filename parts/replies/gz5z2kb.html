			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone doesn't have adequate human contact (snuggles or being petted) they will have extremely high cortisol levels. (Stress hormone) which leads to anxiety and depression, that in turn leads to substance abuse, crime and bad life choices.</p>
<p>Also if a child is 'walking on eggshells' (or anyone for that matter) this heightened fear and anxiety about a negative emotional interaction (ie. Being criticized, teased, or yelling/ emotional turmoil) causes high levels of cortisol. Even if they never get criticized or whatever, it's the fear and nervousness that they might encounter it that actually raises the levels. </p>
<p>If your child is anxious or depressed it's most likely because of your behavior as their parent. Which is a hard pill to swallow, but high cortisol and low oxytocin (love drug) are the reason for the depression and anxiety. </p>
<p>Simply sitting with skin on skin contact is believed to increase oxytocin, the long term happiness drug. Like that fuzzy feeling you get when you see a baby animal? That's the oxytocin. A wholesome story? Oxytocin. </p>
<p>It's really quite amazing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All throughout life actually. It's mostly been studied in newborns and children of orphanages because they aren't held oftentimes at all. But the trend that is emerging from the science is that human to human contact is as essential to living as oxygen is to breathing. </p>
<p>While it is most notably a problem if throughout childhood a child doesn't receive adequate affection; the child is almost certainly going to have developmental and learning delays, as well as bad behavior or impulsive behavior. This means they are more likely to abuse substances, commit crimes, or just make bad life choices.</p>
<p>I can attest to the fall out from not being loved or given affection throughout childhood. I have struggled with substance abuse, petty crime, and overall am a hot mess. </p>
<p>My identical twin sister and I both suffered from depression and anxiety. (My sister also had the other three issues) however, she committed suicide when we were 27. </p>
<p>A child who is unloved doesn't learn to hate one's parents, they learn to hate themselves. </p>
<p>If you hate yourself, this is a strong indicator that you need oxytocin in your life. That you were given inadequate support, even if unintentionally. </p>
<p>Most parent's don't mean to hurt their children. Most harm their kids because they don't know any better.</p>
<p>Criticizing, teasing, and emotional turmoil in the home (parent's fighting constantly) all increase cortisol, which increases depression and anxiety. They most likely don't realize how detrimental this is to their child's health. I certainly didn't until yesterday. </p>
<p>I highly recommend &quot;the happy child&quot; app. It's a parenting app but if you are depressed or anxious I seriously feel it has easy to understand info about all of this. I literally watched a few videos yesterday and gathered all of this info. It makes dealing with your emotions and understanding why you have them soooo much clearer. </p>
<p>Now it's like 'oh, no wonder we were so depressed and suicidal' it makes complete sense and isn't too difficult to follow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but I’m pretty sure regular close contact with others is really good for everyone. Hug your friends!</p>
<p>Edit: get vaccinated first if you can! The pandemic has been ridiculously hard for everyone in ways we may not even realize for a long time, like in how much physical contact and connection we’re getting. It may seem like something you can shrug off but it’s actually really important for mental health. Ask the people in your life for hugs! You need it and they do too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read Harlow’s pit of despair experiments with chimps*. It applies to infants especially during the first few years of life. But it affects them forever. Infants who had no physical touch were not interested in sex or relationships as adults. He would create a “rape machine” for the females to allow the male chimps to rape them  since they weren’t interested in sex after being denied affection as infants. When the time came that the babies were born, one mother ate her babies’ fingers off his hand while still alive. They ignored their infants unless to punish, kill, or eat. One chimp alone I believe tried to give her baby to another mother who would be a better parent, which is crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting this extends beyond human- human.  When you pet a dog,  both you and the dog are releasing oxytocin, increasing the bond between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I've been in a deplorable nursing home That imported  COVID positive patients from other facilities. The pandemic lock down put a stop to the one dog that was brought in by a resident's family to visit. I miss that pooch and I imagine the lady they brought it for does too... Didn't &quot;the science&quot; say keep the deadly virus, not dogs, away from the elderly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have some good points in here but you really need to be careful saying what the “cause” of depression and anxiety is. The truth is that there are a lot of different theories and none of them have proven infallible. Depression and anxiety are incomprehensibly complex and cannot be reduced to a lack or surplus of specific hormones or neurotransmitters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Much like happiness, you cannot reduce it to simply being loved or having a good childhood. Depression and anxiety are complicated just like every other emotional response. </p>
<p>These do not cause depression or anxiety, they contribute to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was wondering. As impressive as our touch sense might be the brain is what gives it context, including some low level acknowledgment that you interacting with another human being because you can see them, smell them and/or feel them and all that entails. Not a small distinction considering some people touching you is probably repulsive depending on the context.</p></div>		</li>
