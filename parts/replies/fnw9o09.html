			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude don't give up on sweeping! Once you figure it out it's super easy and fun! I end up getting distracted from my practice routine because I end up sweeping too much lol</p>
<p>Alternate picking is a million times more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong, but I don't think that answers the question. When someone picks up a guitar for the first time, they naturally hold it so their offhand is fretting. They're not thinking about picking techniques and deliberately holding the guitar for optimal speed later on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When someone picks up a guitar without understanding the nuances of playing it, you instinctively think that the strumming hand is the most active one and the fretting hand is holding the guitar.</p></div>		</li>
