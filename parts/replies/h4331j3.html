			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not meant in advance, the idea is that the power of the oath you are currently swearing is being warded off/cancelled by crossing your fingers. Thus the later consequences won't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means that you are free to break your oath, as a higher power protects you from the supernatural punishment that you invoked on yourself. It becomes a bit paradoxical when swearing by God though, as you are now signing for God to protect you from His own wrath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well its more funny to me cause the 'crossed fingers' thing kind of evolved into meaning &quot;you dont need to keep your promise&quot; when initially the context was &quot;you intend to break your promise&quot; because its direct meaning was &quot;it protected you from repercussions from God&quot;.  The chain of the meaning changing slightly overtime is kind of interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The origins of its modern use are. The cross as a religious symbol existed for many thousands of years prior to Christianity, starting with the Babylonians, and was used in Syria, Egypt, Greece, India and Mexico. The Tau Cross, which looks like a capital T, is many thousands of years old and was adopted by Christians just like the modern lower case T cross that's popular now - many historical crucifixion paintings show Jesus on a Tau Cross (which was actually used by Romans for crucifixion, called the crux commissa) and many more famous Catholic saints utilized the Tau Cross as the official cross in their time. Even today, the Franciscans utilize the Tau Cross in lieu of the modern design.</p>
<p>In AD 200, the Greek version of the Bible they used then stated that Jesus was crucified on a cross called a &quot;staurogram&quot;, which looks like a P on top of a T.</p></div>		</li>
