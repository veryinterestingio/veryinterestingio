			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it more diffucult than the H1N1 vaccine?  H1N1 jumped to humans around Seotember 2008.  Had a genome sequence April 2009.  Was declared a pandemic in April 2009.  Testing began July.  Approved September.  Had a nasal mist shipping October 1 2009.  Had 3 billion doses starting delivery November 2009 grown in chicken eggs.  So about 1 year from outbreak to vaccine.  Much shorter than the 12-18 months suggested in the study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is more difficult, because of the novelty of the virus, so to say. We are already used to having to make influenza vaccines yearly for different mutations of the virus. So, the supply, manufacturing and distribution chains were already in place. </p>
<p>However, there are no vaccines for coronaviruses available for human (not SARS-Cov-2, but also not for SARS and MERS causing viruses). Some SARS vaccines have been tested in animal models, and there are vaccines against animal coronaviruses, like the feline one. So, having to make a vaccine and the entire infrastructure from the ground complicates matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - immensely. H1N1 was a subtype of the influenza A virus, which means it was a lot easier to adjust production to that specific subtype. Even then, it took six months and was too late to affect the second wave of H1N1 in the US. (<a href="https://rdcu.be/b3JyP" target="_blank">Krammer et. al</a>) We do at least have a starting point, building off of research from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, and there is limited research using the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine that was developed but never made past phase 1 of clinical trials. However, those also point to some safety risks. There are also a lot of potential vaccine candidates, each using a different platform and different modes of action. However, when it comes to mass production, <strong>there is no current process for coronaviruses at this scale.</strong> Certain processes could theoretically be retuned, but that still takes time and as of the publishing of Amanat et al, haven't panned out <strong>yet</strong>. In fact, one of the vaccines that would possibly use similar processes as the influenza vaccine is still in the &quot;<a href="https://codagenix.com/vaccine-programs/pipeline/" target="_blank">discovery phase</a>&quot; according to their website. The vaccine currently in clinical trials is a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04283461" target="_blank">mRNA vaccine</a> that uses a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906799/" target="_blank">much different cGMP process</a> than the influenza vaccine.</p>
<p>I've also seen mentions about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine development. According to Amanat et al., that particular vaccine is <strong>months, if not years away because of it's much different approach.</strong></p>
<p>Vaccines take time to discover and test. <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/influenza-vaccines" target="_blank">In fact, the regular influenza vaccine usually takes months to develop</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fdas-critical-role-ensuring-supply-influenza-vaccine" target="_blank">is a year-round effort</a>. Since they are to be administered to a wide population, it's important to test for efficacy and safety, which also takes time.</p>
<p>I should also mention, the 12 to 18 month time frame isn't based off an experimental study, but an <a href="https://www.cell.com/matter/article-types#perspective" target="_blank">opinion piece by experts reviewed by experts.</a> In other words, this is still peer-reviewed and can be considered as a mini-review article, but is mostly speculative as this question is also speculative.</p>

<p>Actually the Chinese vaccine in Phase 2 is a deactivated Coronavirus.</p>
<p>The phase 1 in Oxford is an antigen on an Adenovirus. The head of the team is 80% sure they will pass phase 3 and start sending vaccines to people by September.</p>
<p>mRNA are about half the candidates, but the traditional (antigen on virus) are tried and tested.</p></div>		</li>

<p>eg:
<a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(20\)30120-5" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(20\\)30120-5" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(20\\)30120-5</a></a></p>
<p>reddit interprets the first closing parentheses as the end of the URL/link.</p></div>		</li>
