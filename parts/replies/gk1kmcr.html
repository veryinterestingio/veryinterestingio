			<div class="markdown"><p>As a professional, we can say with certainty that we cannot be us without our microbiome. These microbes are essential to our development and proper function in many ways. Some scientists make good arguments for the microbiome to be considered an organ (or several organs). Going any deeper into what is and isn't &quot;you&quot; is probably philosophy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is pretty close. They can impact the production of ghrelin is involved in feeling hunger. My speculation is that this is an adaptation to increase the quantity of their &quot;food&quot; in your gut. Kind of like if they make you jam enough food into your mouth, some of it is bound to be what they want</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't entirely accurate. Those microorganisms are all over your body, and may outnumber the total number of cells in your actual body, but they are not inside your body (at least not from a biological standpoint). They aren't made by or derived from your own cells, and thus are not part of you.</p>
<p>Now if you want to think of your body as an ecosystem of which you are only one part, which wouldn't be inaccurate, then you could say those microorganisms are part of that ecosystem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little more complicated than that. They may not be a part of us, but they are important in making us &quot;us&quot;. </p>
<p>Plus much of your bacteria is passed from your mother during birth/ breast feeding, and are even capable of communicating with our brain and vise versa. If you add or remove certain ones, it can start to change your behaviours. </p>
<p>They may not be us on a genetic level, but they are a very important part of us. Its symbiotic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thought when I studied microbiology was that we have this slew of bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc, in us, on us, and evolving along side of us. Kind of the opposite of contemplating the vastness of space, but just as humbling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: this comment was intended to demonstrate that our microbial symbionts should be considered a part of the functioning standard human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that's false logic. We can't function without water but its not part of us. The bacteria are linked to us symbiotically but in significant ways are not part of us. They are not encoded in our DNA and reproduce independently from us (no known sharing of genetic info). </p>
<p>Importantly, they can also exist and reproduce independently of us.</p></div>		</li>
