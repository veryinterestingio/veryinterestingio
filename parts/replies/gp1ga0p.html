			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: this is wrong by a factor of 1000! Thanks u/justamblingon.</p>
<p>A lighting strike contains roughly 1,000,000 joules of energy in it. The specific heat of water is about 4 j/g°C. This means it takes 4 joules of energy to heat 1 gram of water up by 1°C. That's only enough energy to heat 250L of water up by 1°C which won't be very noticeable in a typical pool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“An average bolt of lightning, striking from cloud to ground, contains roughly <strong>one billion (1,000,000,000) joules</strong> of energy. This is no small amount, enough to power a 60-watt lightbulb for six months plus a forgotten open door refrigerator for a day.”</p>
<p>So a 40 x 20 x 6 foot pool would have approximately 446000 liters of water, so a lightening bolt might raise the water of the pool nearly 2°C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that volume is also several orders of magnitude too low, more like a bathtub than a pool.</p>
<p>If the lightning was 1000 times more energetic, and the pool was 1000 times more volume, then the original temperature rise result still stands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The math is right, but you're off by three orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Assuming a pool holds about 75,000 litres, a lightning strike (aprox. one <em>billion</em> Joules) would raise the temp by about 3 degrees C — not enough to cook you, but enough that you'd notice!</p>
<p>Heat (kJ) divided by specific heat (kj/kg) times mass (kg) = temperature difference</p>
<p>1,000,000 KJ / (4.19 kJ/kg)(75,000L) = 3.182 C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that just teaches me to <a href="https://engineering.mit.edu/engage/ask-an-engineer/is-there-a-way-to-harness-electricity-from-lightning/" target="_blank">trust a references from MIT's school of engineering</a>! And yep, all the other sources say 1-10 billion. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
