			<div class="markdown"><p>By making everything as straight and stable as possible. The mirrors are suspended by Glass fibers I believe to eliminate vibration. They tune the lazers to emit a very precise wavelength. This along with equipment to reduce any electrical noise. All of this and more just so they can measure a phase shift in the lights frequency and detect the interference wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know how light is a wave? If you have two beams and their wave patterns are in sync they add together making a brighter beam, but if they are out of sync the two beams cancel each other out. You can use that to build a sensitive measuring device.</p>
<p>Take two beams of light which are in sync, then fire them down two identical tunnels at right angles to each other. Each tunnel has a mirror at the end which bounces the light back. When they return they get combined, and you can then check if they are still in sync by measuring the brightness. If the light gets dimmer it tells you the two beams aren't in sync, because one of the tunnels was slightly longer or shorter than the other. You'd expect to observe a constant brightness normally, but it'll flicker very slightly as a gravitational wave passes by.</p>
<p>Much of the sensitivity comes from the fact that the wavelength of light is so small, so tiny changes in distance make a significant difference to whether the two beams are in sync. That explanation is very simplistic, but it should give you an idea. Veritasium did a nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iphcyNWFD10" target="_blank">video</a> about it if you want more details on how they achieved that level of precision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interferometery is the technique they used.</p>
<p>Imagine I hand you a pair of earbuds playing a song, but one of them was out of sync from the other. You would notice!</p>
<p>Well for an interferometer the &quot;song&quot; is light coming from a laser. If I bounce the laser off of a mirror, it takes some time to come back to me and it will be at a certain point in the song. At the same time, I can use a beam splitter on the laser and do all of this to a second set of mirrors that's perpendicular to the first.</p>
<p>So I have the song coming out of two earbuds (two sets of mirrors), and now I compare them by adding them together. Light waves have peaks and troughs like waves on the ocean, and can similarly add and subtract. If a peak hits a trough, they cancel out--this phenomenon is called interference. Thus, if the song coming from the mirrors is out of sync, it should be very noticeable. In an extreme case I wouldn't have any signal at all!</p>
<p>So how can I use this to precisely determine a distance? Well if the distance to one set of mirrors shifts, I might receive a peak instead of a trough, or vice versa. The kicker here is that in a laser, peaks and troughs are separated by 10^-8 meters. So it's already quite sensitive. Further sensitivity can be achieved with complicated signal processing/amplification, and as LIGO demonstrates, down to about 10^-18 meters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was on a tour of the LIGO Livingston facility, the tour guide stops us and says &quot;okay everyone be quiet... Do you hear that? No? Exactly - that silence was expensive&quot;.</p>
<p>Normally if you're in whatever closed building you'll hear the some ventilation fans moving air around, which you normally tune out because it's ever-present. In the LIGO buildings they still have ventilation but it's special ultra-quiet ventilation. (I guess there's some kind of acoustic filters/baffles along with quiet motors?)</p></div>		</li>

<p>But aren't light particles affected by gravity, albeit on a much lower scale? Not saying anywhere near the extent of the curvature of the Earth, but to a slight degree over a long enough distance.</p></div>		</li>
