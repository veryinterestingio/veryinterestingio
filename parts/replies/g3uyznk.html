			<div class="markdown"><p>Decreased funding is truly a <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/state-higher-education-funding-cuts-have-pushed-costs-to-students" target="_blank">huge part of it</a> â€“ since 2008 (so not even including early 2000s changes):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>State spending on higher education at two- and four-year public colleges nationwide fell $1,220 per student, or 13 percent, after adjusting for inflation.  </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p>Since the 2008 school year, average annual published tuition has risen by $2,708 nationally, or 37 percent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So almost half the cost increase ($1,220 out of $2,708) is directly offsetting decreased state funding.</p>
<p>Clearly there are other factors at play, but that's the biggest one.</p></div>		</li>
