<p>There's always a possibility that you get way too many heads or tails just as a function of chance. </p>

<p>The US quarter is 8% more likely to land on tails because the head side is heavier than the back due to its design</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit misleading</p>
<p>Only with energy on the order of 246 GeV do the two forces act as one, the universe has to be quite hot 10^15 K -- a temperature not seen last since shortly after the big bang </p>
<p>Basically, for theoretical physics and the standard equation this is relevant, but for understanding the forces of the universe it's a bit convoluted and confusing/unclear (as are many things lol) but I think it's tough to say oh there's only 3 forces we know of when there is clearly a distinction between electromagnetism and the WNF.</p>
<p>electromagnetism is on display travelling anywhere up to  millions or billions of light years every time  we look up at the sky, while we know the weak force only applies over very very short distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but when when we're talking about the fundamental forces its worth noting that two of them are different effects of the same thing (like how the electric and magnetic forces are actually one combined electromagnetic force when you start considering things at high speeds)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a model of particles, not a model of reality.  It doesn't say &quot;the universe has the same amount of matter and antimatter&quot;, it says &quot;matter and antimatter are in some ways opposite and in some ways the same&quot;.  That's what symmetry is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know there isnâ€™t actually perfect symmetry in terms of preference for matter vs antimatter, the weak interaction shows a preference for left handed (matter) particles.</p></div>		</li>
