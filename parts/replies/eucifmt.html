			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethernet is actually just a way to connect two machines. So Internet runs over Ethernet as well.</p>
<p>And in general you're right, but that also works if the other computer has no internet access too. If you don't have direct internet access, but you're connected to another machine that does have internet access, you can still be hacked from the outside.</p></div>		</li>

It was a huge amount of work, both to design and to deploy.  Unless you're the Iranians, or have enemies as well funded as theirs, your air gaped computers are safe.</p></div>		</li>
