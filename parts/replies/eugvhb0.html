			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to use fMRI alone to characterize functional localization. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation" target="_blank">Transcranial magnetic stimulation</a> is often used in conjunction with fMRI to much more conclusively determine functional lateralization. The gold standard is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wada_test" target="_blank">Wada test</a>, which is a direct measure of functional lateralization, rather than the indirect fMRI test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would metabolic activity not also correlate with neuronal activity? </p>
<p>I work in unrelated neuro-MR research, so my biggest problem with fMRI is the statistical methods used to analyze the images and create the fMRI signal (see the dead salmon study, along with others). This is the first I've heard of concern about it not also correlating with neuronal activity as well though. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add another layer to the others - Measuring metabolic activity doesn't necessarily tell you anything about local neuronal activity. Blood flow in the brain is regulated by astrocytes according to a whole load of non-neuronal signals that could give a false impression I imagine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it could be inhibition activity. Not engagement activity. </p>
<p>Look up what the BOLD signal is.  It isnt &quot;activation&quot;. It's only &quot;activity&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hence why I was asking why it didn't correlate with neuronal activity, like the original comment stated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a basic researcher, for me it's not necessarily that it doesn't correlate with neural activity but that it doesn't tell us much about that neural activity. I work with deep-brain recordings of neural oscillations, and the number of factors you can measure and the amount of variation within a single structure is staggering sometimes (and even with those, we still don't know if these oscillations are more directly involved in functionality, or, like BOLD, are an emergent phenomena). So for me the problem is that ok, you're proving their is a change in blood flow, but the functional correlations of that are harder to infer. But that's a problem with many neuroscience techniques.</p></div>		</li>
