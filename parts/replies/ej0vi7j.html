<p>I'll have to look into the new C# features...  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super cool! What does the y-axis in the lower image represent?</p>
<p>Also, if you look at 95.1 (?) there are these breaks that look almost like noise in the transmission, surrounded by orange and red (sorry, I don't know the right terminology). What is this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Y-axis in the lower image is time. It scrolls down continuously. Higher power is more red. </p>
<p>The &quot;breaks&quot; in the transmission are almost certainly small parts of silence. 95.1 is a classical music station. What you're seeing there is the individual parts of the FM signal: </p>
<p>at 19 kHz from the center there's a Stereo pilot tone, which signals that this station is broadcasting in stereo.</p>
<p>at 58 kHz there's the RDS information (station name, etc.).</p>
<p>These infos are visible even with no audio/modulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it is technically not possible to shift all the transmissions to peak at .4 .6 .8 etc? Because of wave lengths? </p>
<p>As far as I understood OP, he wanted to know why it is .1 .3 .5 .6 and not .2 .4 .6 .8</p>
<p>The only thing I can come up with (if the technical side is no problem) is that even numbers would mean that some stations would have whole numbers (&quot;99.0&quot; -&gt; &quot;99&quot;) and therefore an unfair advantage to stations with a .x behind? Because they would be easier to remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just a convention thing, there's no reason for it. </p>
<p>Over here in Germany (and I think most of Europe) we have FM stations on all frequencies, odd and even. They just need to be apart from each other. </p></div>		</li>
