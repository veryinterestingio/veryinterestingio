			<div class="markdown"><p>I was pleasantly surprised on rewatching the movie <em>War Games</em> as how realistic the hacking is. If the main character isn’t guessing someone’s badly chosen passwords based on knowing publicly available information about them, he’s going through a desk or flipping over a mousepad to find the note taped to the bottom with all the needed passwords on it. Came out in 1983 and every weakness he exploited is still with us because humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this would be allowable as a top level comment - but if OP (or anyone else) is interested in learning about hacking practically in a legal and fun way: check out <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/" target="_blank">CTF competitions</a>! The best way to get started is find a team with some experience that is open to newbies, or to try out beginner challenges (<a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/" target="_blank">this</a> might be a place to start) on your own. You definitely have to be willing to learn <em>a lot</em> about computers in the process though to become good at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken the show Mr. Robot is supposed to have the closest resemblance to real hacking, and mostly it's done in Unix.</p>
<p>Also I believe there are easter eggs all over for enthusiasts, like if you freeze a frame and see the IP he's hacking, you can give it a try yourself and the show's people were running some servers and stuff for people to try and get into.</p></div>		</li>
