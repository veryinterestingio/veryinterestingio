<p>You can place a magnet on your fridge and remove it with little force. While the magnet is attached to the fridge, electromagnetism keeps it in place despite the gravitational force of the entire earth acting on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is one of the four fundamental forces or interactions (the context of this question). I know you have seen that veritasium video but it's very misleading. They made a huge deal out of insisting it is &quot;not a force&quot;. What they really meant was more subtle and limited than that:</p>
<p>Motion under gravity in general relativity is inertial / force-free motion. It is not a force in the Newtonian F = ma (or x''(t) = F/m where the left hand side is the acceleration, i.e. the motion of the particle and the right hand side is the forces acting on the particle) sense. In general relativity the role of this equation is taken by the geodesic equation which has a term that corresponds to the Newtonian gravitational force but is more related to the curvature:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_in_general_relativity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_in_general_relativity</a></p>
<p>You have</p>
<p>d²x^(μ)/ds² = -Γ^(μ)αβ dx^(α)/ds dx^(β)/ds</p>
<p>or more commonly you move the term on the right hand side (the force side) to the left hand side (the .. motion side?) since it has to do with the geometry of spacetime (Γ are Christoffel symbols that are related to the metric g that tells you how to measure lengths, angles, durations etc).</p>
<p>d²x^(μ)/ds² + Γ^(μ)αβ dx^(α)/ds dx^(β)/ds = 0</p>
<p>Additionally I'm gonna quote an earlier comment of mine that explains the situation regarding gravity being still one of the four fundamental interactions (or forces), because the video has successfully made a lot of people believe that &quot;gravity not being a force&quot; somehow says we don't need a theory of quantum gravity or that it somehow &quot;rules out gravitons existing&quot;, which is not the case at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gravity is one of the four fundamental interactions. That remains true even with general relativity. In Newtonian gravity it is still a classical force, and that theory is still accurate. There is no problem calling it a force. The video you mention below made a big deal of it to confuse people by insisting so strongly on that claim, but it was more detrimental than beneficial. Finally you can write down a <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Quantum_gravity_as_a_low_energy_effective_field_theory" target="_blank">theory of gravitons</a> and it reduces to GR as well (and gives you first order quantum corrections to GR), so here you again have a similar description to the other 3 fundamental interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the video is misleading and the title is CLICKBAIT and this question keeps coming up EVERY TIME now whenever someone is asking about gravity. Great way to teach people.. Some people even come to reddit with the idea that the video says &quot;gravity doesn't exist&quot; or &quot;is an illusion&quot; which are also wrong.</p>
<p>(Even if you aren't basing your question off of that video, it's inevitable that people here will show up who have the same misunderstanding from that video so the comment is still relevant.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, but does time exist tho? Or is it an illusion? :D</p>
<p>God, how this irritates me. What I always explain to people is that physics never changes fundamentally meaning of concepts we already know. It just expands them and helps us better understand them. Time is, and always will be, thing we read on clocks. Gravity will always cause you to fall down, if you jump. But, whether we call something a force or on microscopic level an interaction in the end it is not of the utmost importance. Naming things is a human thing that just makes communication possible. If we stop calling gravity a force, absolutely nothing will happen. Just as nothing has happened since we stopped calling Pluto a planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, although Gravity is the weakest of the bunch, it apparently has the strongest manifestations apparently..</p>
<p>That's not a justified statement at all.</p>
<p>An accurate statement would be that gravity is dominant at very large scale where  very massive objects are involved.</p>
<p>That's the whole point, you need a lot of mass for gravity to matter. That's why it is considered weakest.</p></div>		</li>
