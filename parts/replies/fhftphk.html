			<div class="markdown"><p>I never experienced (noticable) symptoms of reflux before taking Omeprazole. The gastroenterologist who diagnosed me started me on both Omeprazole and a steroid inhaler (apologies, I can't recall which one atm) with instructions to swallow instead of inhaler the inhaler. He said I could try either just the inhaler or just the Omeprazole after the first 90 days of both, and if that proved effective then I didn't require both.</p>
<p>Now, if I stop the Omeprazole, I have noticeable acid reflux.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see I have a fundoplication to correct a hiatal hernia and treat acid reflux.  That was 7 years ago and I don't have the usual heartburn anymore.  However, I've been having a lot difficulty swallowing and will be setting up an appointment with a specialist to get it checked and this thread is really informative of the other conditions that can lead to the issues I'm facing.</p></div>		</li>
