			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that's important to understand is that these debts discourage war. If a country has debt to you, you're less likely to want to exterminate it because the dead don't pay. So when everyone has debt to everyone, it pushes people to solve problems without war.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really accurate though.</p>
<p>A 'country' isn't a singular entity on it's own that is 'borrowing money' in this context. Often when people (erroneously) say a &quot;country is in debt&quot; they usually* mean the government is running a deficit. Their creditors are usually not other governments (though sometimes they are).</p>
<p>* In other contexts they could mean a trade deficit (not as simple or as 1 dimensional as it seems), the total debt held by all entities (households, corporations and governments etc) in a country, or something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p> A rich tourist comes to town. He enters the only hotel, lays a 100 dollar bill on the reception counter, and goes to inspect the rooms upstairs in order to pick one.</p>
<p>The hotel proprietor takes the 100 dollar bill and runs to pay his debt to the butcher. The Butcher takes the 100 dollar bill and runs to pay his debt to the pig raiser. The pig raiser takes the 100 dollar bill and runs to pay his debt to the supplier of his feed and fuel. The supplier of feed and fuel takes the 100 dollar bill and runs to pay his debt to the town's prostitute that, in these hard times, gave her “services” on credit. The hooker runs to the hotel, and pays off her debt with the 100 dollar bill to the hotel proprietor to pay for the rooms that she rented when she brought her clients there.</p>
<p>The hotel proprietor then lays the 100 dollar bill back on the counter so that the rich tourist will not suspect anything. At that moment, the rich tourist comes down after inspecting the rooms, and takes his 100 dollar bill, after saying he did not like any of the rooms, and leaves town.</p>
<p>No one earned anything. However, the whole town is now without debt, and looks to the future with a lot of optimism.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Eh no... The hotel proprietor earned pork that he likely consumed. The pig farmer earned food and fuel for his pigs. The supplier got his rocks off. The hooker paid off her (poor) investment (to break even). </p>
<p>The currency was the placeholder for trade. In this example the trade was cyclical and the hooker broke even the most for it to all work out.  Though I suppose everyone <del>but the proprietor broke even, and he paid his debts off stolen money, so he earned the most for nothing.</del></p>
<p>Edit: The proprietor broke even too. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/glzcmd/eli5_why_is_every_country_in_debt_with_each_other/fr10la6/" target="_blank">/u/billintreefiddy made a good point</a>. He had to give back the money anyway. Everyone in this example basically shifted products and services to benefit the next in line. Everyone's product earned the same. In the real world, someone would gain from this.</p>
<p>Edit 2: And by saying in the real world, someone would gain from this, insert a financial institution. In all likelihood a bank or credit card company would finance the proprietor with a loan to buy pork and begin this chain. No businessman would offer credit without some trust to back up the debt being paid. In the real world the proprietor would be worse off than he started (maybe). Either he's $100 in the hole and still needs it to pay off his debt to the bank or he's a thief. In another scenario, the rich guy stays and &quot;stimulates&quot; the economy with his visit. Then all debts are paid. The bank profits.</p></div>		</li>
