			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. We certainly invented them, or labeled them.</p>
<p>But distance and weight are static; time is not.</p>
<p>Time is the distance between two static points.</p>
<p>If a weight changes, we can measure how long it took to change. But given a snapshot, we can only measure the static distance and weight: time does not exist in that single moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, it does not. Because, time always imply observing someone or something and comparing it. Thus we lean toward a subjective concept, I think.</p></div>		</li>
