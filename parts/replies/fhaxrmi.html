			<div class="markdown"><p>I once lived in an old house with drafty wood frame windows that the sealing 3M film did wonders for.</p>
<p>Two of the windows were right above my bed and I had no headboard.  One night during a storm a gust of wind hit that window so hard that the film ballooned out and smacked my pillow.  Strange way to wake up.</p></div>		</li>
