<p>Audio is magical and confusing enough as it is, but at least the idea of &quot;the surface is scratched to produce vibrations that perfectly match 10 sounds at once from 8 instruments and 2 voices all from one single groove&quot; is at least partially tangible to my primitive primate mind, but jesus christ, a LASER?! I can't wrap my head around that! The laser changes in intensity as it goes around that thing to make deepert or more shallow grooves? And it's precise enough to get the vibrations right? Physical sound transported into a computer can be projected via that laser to a physical surface which then can be rubbed by another physical surface to produce recorded audio?! AUDIO IS SO WEIRD I DONT GET IT</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's do some math and figure it out! Assume for sake of argument that the highest frequency were  interested in is 20 kHz, even though most musical content never goes past 2 kHz. Let's also just look at LP records (12&quot;, 33 RPM) as these seem to be pretty common still. (Please note I'm an engineer, not a vinyl expert, so some of my assumptions may be wonky).</p>
<p>Okay so at the outer edges of the record, we have a velocity of 33 RPM * 6&quot; = 198 IPM = 3.3 IPS. In order to get variations in the surface to produce a 20 kHz tone, we'd actually need at least 40 thousands crests and troughs (that's due to a result called the Shannon-Nyquist theorem on sampling). So we'd need the ability to create a feature every 3.3 IPS/40,000 = 82.5 microns. Realistically, you'd want your printers resolution to be a bit finer than that, so you could control the shape of the feature as well. </p>
<p>The best 3d printers I can find of the extrusion type (i.e. squirting melted plastic out like cheez wiz), which also is the only type I know of that sells for cheap enough to be accessible to home users, have a resolution of around a tenth of a millimeter, 0.004&quot;, or about 50 times thicker than we need. </p>
<p>Even if you play with the speeds and locations on the record to print your music, I think we have enough margin here to say &quot;no, this wouldn't work&quot; with confidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maths here sounds good but it's worth noting, frequencies as high as 22kHz can have measurable (though extremely small) impacts on the detail and quality of recorded material. There's debate that processing audio at 96kHz and above is worthwhile (I am certain of this being true for digital formats at least). </p>
<p>You can bet your ass there's going to be a mastering engineer absolutely intent on producing music to be printed onto vinyl sent out at &gt;48kHz. So the relevant maximum number of grooves may be much, much higher. </p></div>		</li>
