			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_classification" target="_blank">Viruses are classified according to how they replicate</a>, and Herpesviridae is a large family of DNA viruses including EBV and Varicella zoster virus (chickenpox). </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus" target="_blank">VZV is closely related to the herpes simplex viruses (HSV), sharing much genome homology.</a>.</p>
<p>Conversely, other viruses like HIV have very little connection to Herpesviridae - although they might use DNA at some points in replication, they're about as different as snails are from giraffes.</p></div>		</li>
