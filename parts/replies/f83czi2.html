			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually <em>kind of made sense.</em> Maybe it was the priming of reading other comments in this thread, maybe I'm actually somewhat intelligent, who knows. But now I actually know how adenosine works, so thank you!</p>
<p>And, yeah, I once stayed up for <em>roughly</em> 24 hours, and from the screwed up sense of time and the immediate falling asleep for 30 minutes to an hour after laying down to &quot;rest,&quot; it was certainly an experience. To imagine a high schooler stayed up for 11 whole days. Wow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people have naturally higher levels of adenosine (natural resistance) or your body responds to constant caffeine by adding more adenosine (you creating your own restistance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im trying to really explain like you are 5 cause this sub often reads like ask science. ....Like most things the first few times your body experiences something it doesn't know how to react to continue being normal. But then you do it a few times and your body counteracts those things (drugs, alcohol, caffeine etc etc) to try and make it seem like it is still acting normal as always. So you have to take much more to continue getting that &quot;this is not normal&quot; feeling. </p>
<p>A normal feeling in this case would be tiredness. The not normal feeling is being buzzed on coffee. Drink coffee the first time you feel crazy. Drink it the millionth time and now you are just chasing a small buzz.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For others, this wave can never hit and they can go without sleep for a ludicrous amount of time. Though, the average person should never try that (it really messes with your sense of time, seriously don't).</p>

<p>What's a ludicrous amount of time? I sleep very little due to my line of work.<br />
Any lasting medical damage, other than messing with your sense of time?</p></div>		</li>
