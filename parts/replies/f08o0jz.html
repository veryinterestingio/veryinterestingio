			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend and former housemate who sleeps like a pencil. Like dead straight arms by his side, bonus he's really skinny. It's super weird in a fantastic way.. We nicknamed it &quot;penciling&quot;. My gf and I and our housemates (guys) would go on vacation and cut costs by sharing a room and two queen beds and you'd wake up in the night and just see this straight wooden beam of a man laying there on the edge of the bed. Makes me chuckle. Good memories!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They think they do because they might wake up in a similar position as to when they fell asleep, but practically everyone moves around a great deal when they sleep.</p>
<p>In fact it was an old psychological torture method of the Stasi. You were only permitted to sleep flat on your back with your hands above the blanket, if you moved at all they would wake you up and force you to readjust. Guaranteeing nobody would get a long period of uninterrupted sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get high off your ass, Sleep for a very long time, like more than the average productive human, sleep in a shitty bed, then wake up and stretch throughly. It last for approximately 2 seconds, but thatâ€™s okay because then you just masturbate and have another 4-6 seconds of orgasm. Then you stare at yourself in the mirror and remember how miserable you are.</p></div>		</li>
