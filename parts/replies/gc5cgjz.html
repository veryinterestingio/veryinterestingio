Long Answer: NO</p>
<p>Acid reflux means that you get acid coming up even when your body isn't trying to do so.</p>
<p>That said, acid reflux is caused by the malfunctioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Astronauts have to go through a rigorous selection trial in order to become astronauts and candidates are vetted through their physical conditions (regardless of intellect). The reason is that you cannot have a medical condition in space - whose symptoms and effects while in space are unknown - when a mission is going on.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not like you can just hop back home for a doctor's visit.</p>
<p>So, no you won't get acid reflux in space due to acid reflux disease or anything similar. You might get a random or one-time event that's quite similar to the symptom of acid reflux - the acid in your throat.</p>
