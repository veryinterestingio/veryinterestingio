			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no discernable difference between two pieces of metal of the same element when you're in a vacuum. It's like play doh. You can have two separate pieces of the same color, but if you mash them together they become just one piece again. Without the protection of an oxide layer, the metals will connect due to their solid forms always wanting to connect up with their friends in that temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that connection as strong as the naturally occurring bonds in raw metals?  </p>
<p>I presume it's not as strong as forged or cast parts, because the heating and cooling creates crystalline structures.  But if I were to take a lump of iron from and asteroid and jam it into another lump of iron from an asteroid, will I get a single homogeneous lump of iron?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flow between the two pieces of metals and their ions and electrons.   </p>
<p>Think of it this way, if you took two icicles and held them together for a while they would become attached. You didn't have to do anything to fuse them together. While an over simplification, it's a little like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oxides are no longer metals; they're a sort of tarnish. Rust is an iron oxide, but no longer behaves like iron does. In a metal the electrons move quite freely between atoms in the metal, but in an oxide they're effectively captured in chemical bonds with oxygen atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxide layers are compounds of Oxygen and the metal they form on, (like aluminum oxide or iron oxide). These compounds are not going to freely transfer electrons to other compounds of the same nature because they've already formed bonds between the iron and oxygen atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experienced this recently when trying to ground a bunch of bolted together aluminum profiles.  I figured if I could ground one of the profiles the entire structure would be grounded - it didn't work.  It turns out the oxide layer on aluminum is non-conductive and in my case I had to purchase special hardware that effectively &quot;pierces&quot; this layer in order to get effective electrical conduction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends - if the pipes were pure iron and the surfaces clean of any oxides/contaminants, then yes. Alloying and oxides reduce the chance of this occurring spontaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. You would have to form/cut them in space or polish the oxide layer away first. Steel also is not very good for cold weld because of the number of elements, pure iron would be better.</p></div>		</li>
