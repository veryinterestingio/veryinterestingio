			<div class="markdown"><p>Routers are essentially really simple computers, with a CPU, RAM and Storage. The Ram and storage parts are really tiny, and most of these are passively cooled, without even a heatsink on them. </p>
<p>As explained by one of the other comments, the router is talking to multiple devices, including the ISP devices, and all of this talking is digital, I.e happens in discrete steps. Like each &quot;word&quot; in this &quot; conversation&quot; happens at definite times at the same time, synchronized on a common rhythm. When this synchronization drifts beyond a point, the conversation starts becoming meaningless(corruption). The synchronization can be lost due to a number of things, like the hardware is too hot to consistently talk, so it drops a &quot;word&quot;, or the ram and storage parts sort of brainfart out sometimes because it hasn't caught the previous word yet, when the next word comes in. When too many words are dropped, then the devices won't know what they are talking about and just stand around doing nothing.</p>
<p>When these drops and brainfarts occur on your , say laptop, it has the resources and instructions to work out what the missing words are, or atleast, ask the conversation to be repeated. But your router doesn't have the resources to even store these extra instructions, especially the cheaper ones, hence just freezes. And forgets what it's supposed to do. Like what happens to humans when too many things have to be done at the same time.</p>
<p>All network devices have a threshold for how many dropped words or brainfarts can occur. For cheaper devices, this threshold is quite low because the set of instructions( firmware) are so limited in number, and the resources are so low, that when something out of the ordinary happens, or when a jumbled set of words come in from the ISP or one of your devices, it tries to understand, but it doesn't know how to exactly unscramble them or to ask for it to be sent again. </p>
<p>When a reboot is initiated, everything is forgotten and the router starts from scratch again. And works till the threshold is reached again.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best analogy for how a reboot works I ever heard was this...</p>
<p>Imagine you're an orchestra conductor and in the middle of a piece you hear that several musicians are off... either out of tempo, out of tune or playing the wrong section of the piece. Is it easier to pick out those musicians and get them back on track or stop the entire orchestra and have them start again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's different every time. When the solution is to restart something it's because no one understands what happened and they can't be bothered to find out.  </p>
<p>There's thousands of different modes of failures, like there's thousands of diseases. In one case for example, the router might be stuck in an infinite loop, in another, it might have run out of memory, etc...</p></div>		</li>
