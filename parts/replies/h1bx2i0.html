			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bunch of cues you'd get from RWR so you know if you're being tracked by another fighter and whether or not he's trying to shoot you down.  Radars have many different modes of operations, if it's just in search mode you'd just get a little icon on your screen showing you an enemy is at your 8 o'clock with radar in search.  If it's in track mode and you're being tracked it will give you an urgent warning and may even dispense chaff and flare for you.  If you were just in track mode an and it picks up the radar from a missile it will give you the take immediate action or die tone.  </p>
<p>With heat seeing missiles, you're right.  If you don't have MWS you're taking educated guesses or relying on seeing the missile's smoke trail or rocket flare with your eyes, the missile could be coming from underneath you or behind you.  You have to have good enough situational awareness to know where the enemy was in relation to you.  With advanced fighers like the F-35 or most variants of the Flanker they have infra-red search and track (IRST) so you don't have to rely on radar which gives your position and element of surprise away.  You can have the IRST sensor look exactly where radar was looking, if radar detected something in track the IRST sensor can say focused on it and the plane it's tracking will just think radar is just in search but has no idea it's being tracked.  The pilot can then fire a heat seeking missile without the target ever realizing it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But  the bold type implies (to me) that it will pick up heat seekers. Is that so? How?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guidance radar is continuous wave, not pulse.   Pulse can be used to track but a missile can't home on a pulse signal.  These days a missile fire control system wouldn't directly track a target until the final few seconds of the engagement though.  That was generally true even in the late 80's when I was still doing SAM radar maintenance.  I'm sure modern systems are even less reliant upon direct tracking.  </p>
<p>The target would be able to detect a missile lock by determining the type of radar signals it is detecting.  A direct &quot;illumination&quot; would be continuous wave within a certain band of frequencies.  Since it would also be from an antenna pointed directly at it, the power level would be higher than the general rf signals in the area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. I worked on navel radar in the 90s. We used to have great fun illuminating fighter aircraft and then getting angry phone calls from the airforce. It was just innocent testing on our part of course but the pilots got very upset because I guess they have well honed responses to that alarm going off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because optical estimation often isn't reliable and accurate enough to plot a module intercept course.</p>
<p>Missiles don't chase targets, they work out where they're going to be and fly directly there to intercept. </p>
<p>Often they've only got a few seconds of fuel at full burn but they can accelerate much faster and harder than any craft with humans onboard. </p>
<p>So a video camera isn't accurate enough and doesn't tell the missile where the plane will be when it intercepts it. </p>
<p>Some missiles do use infra red or optical targeting in addition, however. Add that to radar and you have an even better system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine that flying faster than the speed of sound through clouds might mess with the camera a bit. I mean lidar would run into the same problem but radar doesnt depend on vision which is why they use it I'd assume</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you can search thousands of cubic miles of space in a few seconds with radar.  Depending on the jet you can detect other aircraft over 100 miles away with radar.  With radar you know where the other jet is pointed, you know it's altitude, you know how fast it's going and you can see all this no matter what the weather is.  If you throw clouds or heavy rain in the mix with video cameras or IR you're blind.  The other advantage with using radar is that you can pair it with datalink systems and you can pass along all this information to anyone on your network if you're out of missiles or your radar is pointed a different direction than your wingman's, and if you're aircraft is equipped with an interrogator you can interrogate radar returns to see if they have the same IFF codes as all the friendly forces in the area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and have software guide the rocket visually?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are modern INS guided air to ground missiles that you can essentially load a 3d model of the target on to and it will guide itself visually to the target.  It's easy to do that with a large target like a building or a cruiser that moves relatively slowly compared to another aircraft.</p></div>		</li>
