			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you elaborate? My interpretation of your answer is that &quot;some organs start their early growth along the midline of the body, and as the midline is not duplicate, they cannot be duplicate either&quot;. Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically your body has a line going through it, it starts between your hemispheres and ends in your crotch. Whatever starts growing on one side is duplicated on the other and whatever starts growing on the line stays there. It's a huge oversimplification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heart has two halves to it, is that related and one could still view it as &quot;two hearts&quot; that are just so close together they form a single organ?</p>
<p>Is there similiar symmetry in your liver and spleen by chance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve wondered this for a while and it seems like you may know the answer to this:</p>
<p>So DNA ultimately determines what our bodies look like, but does it have a separate section to describe our right and left halves for the parts of us that are symmetrical or does it have one description that is just duplicated/mirrored on each side? As in, could we theoretically alter our genes to give us 6 fingers on one hand vs 4 on the other, or are both hands developed via the same genetic code?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact - laterality is partly determined by growth factors being wafted from left to right by beating cilia (microscopic fronds) on cells in the embryo. Which means that if you have a problem with the function of cilia (e.g. in Kartagener syndrome), then the growth factor gradient doesn't get set properly - with the result that half of patients have an inverted pattern of organ laterality (situs inversus)!</p></div>		</li>

<p>FYI for anyone else who was confused by this wording: Half of Kartagener's patients, not half of all medical patients. SI is super cool, and extremely rare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I imagine you mean the stomach rotates to the <em>left</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No: the stomach begins as a paddle-shaped part of the foregut in the midline plane. It rotates to the right side of the body 90 degrees, so the front edge becomes the right edge. The back/left edge of the paddle grows faster, curving that side out, creating the fundus (deep [pouch]).</p>
<p>Edit: mismatched front/left edge (front becomes right)</p></div>		</li>
