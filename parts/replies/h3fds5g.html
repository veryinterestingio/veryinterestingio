			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of product that producers decide to create is not supply. It is the quantity supplied.</p>
<p>Supply is a measurement of how difficult or possible it is to create a product. If a producer decides to make 400 donuts instead of 200, but they are just as difficult to create, the supply has not changed at all. Only the quantity supplied.</p>
<p>Producers generally have very little control over the supply of their products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s the context of supply and demand and their relationship we’re discussing here. If someone only sells 100 donuts a day they won’t be making 200 even if they can. That would be a waste. The demand tells them what to make. If the demand then increases past 200 to a level at which they can’t produce them THEN there are issues. But in the context of what I was talking about here i assume there are no production restraints.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very few products are priced at the maximum amount people are willing to pay. Competition keeps the price as function of cost of production. Increase in demand causes prices to rise in the short term because of increase in cost of supply.</p></div>		</li>
