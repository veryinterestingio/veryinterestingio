			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone I’ve said it to, like in guild chat in discord, or friends have been all ‘wow thank you that totally worked!’ so there must be a reason. I’ll ask her if the book or w/e (or tiktok as someone said) had any more detail, but I doubt it or she’d have told me then.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edited to add: ‘I have a lot of books, I don’t remember which one it’s in.’ and ‘lol no, I don’t use tiktok’</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well idk what to tell you other than what she said, which was <em>play</em> the entire song. It’s worked for everyone I know who has tried it so far. </p>
<p>I’m sorry that your singing it to yourself isn’t helping you. Take care!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I sing the song at superfast pace in my head like a rap that sometimes does it but I've had songs stuck in my head for weeks. It's bruuuuuutal when it happens. Last one was Might Be Right by White Reaper. I don't even risk listening to it now.</p></div>		</li>
