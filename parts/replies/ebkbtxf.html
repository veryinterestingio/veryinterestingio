			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I remember reading, crying due to emotions releases a calming drug. There are different kinds of tears you cry out depending on the situation, for example when you cry because of onions it's something similar to a protective liquid instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat off topic but I was a messed up kid, lots of mental health issue growing up etc. I didn't cry at all between the ages of  14 and 22. It was awful, genuinely stressed me out. I would feel myself welling up but I wouldn't actually cry, usually I'd just have one tear come out or I'd yawn and that would be it. </p>
<p>I can cry when I need to now, and it's actually nice to be able to. It's like a relief, though it hurts my throat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right. Crying from onions or pollen is a reflex tear to protect your eyes. They are mostly just water. </p>
<p>Emotional tears rids the body of toxins and waste. It also produces an endorphin that stabilizes your mood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rather than thinking of crying in terms of psychological problems, it's probably better to think in terms of evolutionary benefits of expressing extreme feelings.  The rest of the group know you're having extreme feelings, and can assist.  It may be more beneficial for us to have separate expressions of extreme positive feelings vs. extreme negative feelings (although we already do, to an extent, in other ways, like jumping up and down and so on), but evolution just hasn't developed that in us yet.  OR it may be evolutionarily beneficial for us to convey an unclear message: &quot;I'm upset, but I might be happy OR sad.  Come find out what's up with me! Oh, and approach me gently, because this could be about anything!  (And maybe I even want to have sex with you, and help your genes survive)&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't really answer the question if you ask me, the real crux of the issue here is why is crying the way we release strong emotions? Maybe I'm just dumb, but it doesn't seem at all obvious that this would be the 'natural way'.</p></div>		</li>
