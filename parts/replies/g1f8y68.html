<p>The space station is essentially falling at the same acceleration as any other object. It just moving so fast that it misses the earth when falling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s how every orbit works; the moon, the Earth around the sun, all of ‘em. Velocity has direction and speed, and acceleration is change in velocity. For something falling straight down, the acceleration of gravity changes it’s speed. For something in orbit, gravity changes it’s direction, causing it to turn in a circle. The speed remains constant, but it’s velocity is still being changed by acceleration due to gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to really careful with your words. The instantaneous speed doesn't stay constant at all, and it depends on the configuration of the orbit. For example in an elliptical orbit the speed could vary quite significantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well acceleration is a vector, velocity is a scalar value.  So if you change direction there is acceleration whether the velocity changes or not. And since Earth won't let go the vector is continuously bending towards it, but the object is moving so fast it keeps missing the horizon.</p></div>		</li>
