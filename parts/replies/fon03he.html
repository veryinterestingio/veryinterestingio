<p>My sample size is, low- the one time I worked on set with a child, there was a third party there to &quot;parent the parent&quot; of that child, so to speak.
The strictest law(?) being the kid's 6 hour day.</p>
<p>I knew they were gonna book that kid before I knew I had the job. The kid had an amazing personality. A great example of how important casting is in production.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably the teacher, or maybe someone assigned to assist. There are enough things going on, if you've never been on a set before it's really tough to even figure out where to stand safely. All kids have a teacher on set, and if there's only one kid that teacher will often stick around on set to help out.</p>
<p>Work days are based on age. I know in the USA that most kids can only work 8 hour days, and have to have a 2-hour break in there. I'm not even sure if parental permission can override this. Toddlers have a much shorter day.</p>
<p>I didn't make it really clear above how tightly they will schedule things. For example, they might have the main actor doing a scene with a doll that can't really be seen (or even an animatronic doll that moves) for hours, then move the camera and bring in the kid. They'll base this on the kid's schedule, like if he always has a nap a certain time they might want him tired and grumpy. The actor will do as much of the scene as possible with the kid screaming at him, then may get to take a break as they try to &quot;shoot out&quot; the kid, so they get all his footage and reaction shots. They're also recording sound on all of this, so they can fill the whole scene with screaming kid even though it was a doll when you can't see the kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't worked on set, but I am a preschool teacher so I have some merit! When ASOUE began filming in 2017 Sunny's actress Presley Smith was only 8 months old. At that age until filming wrapped up when she was 2 there was very little likelihood that she had any clue what was going on even up until the very end. If she reached 3 then she may have began to understand the concept a camera, but until then children aren't able to identify themselves in pictures, only reflections. Most likely in her mind she just spent a lot of time with her mom's friends!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Michael Douglas said this about getting the young actress who played his daughter in Fatal Attraction to cry - </p>
<p>To get the desired reaction shot from Ellen during the scene where she witnesses her parents having an intense argument, Michael Douglas was behind the camera bullying her and threatening to take away the stuffed unicorn she was holding, saying, &quot;look at that stupid unicorn, I'm gonna throw it in the garbage,&quot; which is why she begins crying and hugging it tighter. After director Adrian Lyne yelled &quot;cut,&quot; Douglas immediately apologized to her, said he was only kidding, and hugged her. In an interview years later, Douglas stated, &quot;I felt pretty guilty. But you've got to do what you've got to do.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this:</p>
<p>Turns out, babies just cry a lot. It’s not that hard, if someone on set has a baby, to just bring it on one day for shooting until it, you know, starts crying. As babies tend to do. I think the line can be toed easily because even though you could argue against filming babies being upset... they are just babies. They don’t care, and they’ll probably be just fine when their tantrum is done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to be clear, is that the same parent that is collecting the giant check from the advertising/production company?  Because sometimes that might skew their impression of how their kids are treated</p></div>		</li>

<p>Check out Jenny Lewis’ song <a href="https://youtu.be/IhP_8MUS-ro" target="_blank">Rabbit Fur Coat</a>. She was a child actor and a musician now and it’s a lovely, sad song telling the story of how she was put to work at a young age to fulfill her mom’s dreams of wealth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, but there <em>are</em> child labor laws that I don't think the parent can bypass for young children. I'm not positive, but I believe production can be held criminally liable if they go past when a kid &quot;pumpkins&quot; even if the parent says it's okay.</p>
<p>It has always been treated very seriously on every production I've been on, down to the minute. I've seen an AD call cut prematurely, and hustle a kid off set to make sure he was gone, like it was an emergency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. So TIL that kids are mistreated a tiny bit to get them to cry and as long as momma don’t care about money things won’t get ugly</p></div>		</li>
