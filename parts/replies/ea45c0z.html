			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh, this is the exact argument (if you want to call it that) that I use in favor of religion. It’s by no means scientific, you obviously can’t prove or disprove it. But I think it’s a perfectly valid thought experiment that helps to take religion out of the simplistic magic man in the sky narrative to something a bit more refined and mathematically meaningful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the sentiment, but I wouldn't call it mathematical. &quot;Higher physical dimension&quot; is pretty buzzwordy and doesn't really mean much.</p>
<p>A pretty interesting sect of Christianity is Deism, which basically means God created the universe with all the matter, energy, and whatnot and &quot;programmed&quot; in the laws of physics, and has since died, or left, or ceased to exist or whatever. The point being he created everything, and then has left it alone since. </p>
<p>I'm not religious myself, but if I were I'd probably agree with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. That's a very refreshing take on religion. I'm not particularly religious myself anymore, but I would be more inclined to believe in a god that creates us in a pocket dimension apart from his own then I am willing to accept everything was created from nothing.</p></div>		</li>
