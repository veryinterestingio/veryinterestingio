			<div class="markdown"><p>For real I feel like half the answers here are reciting their college thesis. A five year old would never understand half the things said that I may as well go onto r/askscience.</p>
<p>EDIT: okay yeah I get these aren't directed towards a literal 5 year old but I still feel like people go overboard with the explanations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except this &quot;answer&quot; doesn't explain anything. It is just the question reworded and repeated in the form of a statement.</p>
<p>Why is the color white instead of something else? Why does this happen with plastic but not paper or fabric? What mechanism causes the color change at all? Is the pigment leaving the bent section, or is it something else?</p></div>		</li>
