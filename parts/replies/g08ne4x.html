			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw someone ask why JS and Boddingtons aren't nice, but can't see the comment to reply to.</p>
<p>They are absolutely fine in terms of beer. Nothing terrible, just that unless you had literally only ever drank lager in your life and these were a novelty (like they might be to some non-UK people), you'd probably find them very bland and boring. It's a bit like buying soft sliced white bread from a supermarket. It's fine, but if there's a choice I would probably not buy it when there is actually nice stuff available (and I'm not just talking about super-hoppy IPA, just literally any half-decent cask ale would be an improvement).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loads of pubs generally use a nitrogen mix as it means you can raise the keg/line pressure much higher which allows you to push the beer longer distances without over-carbonating the beer. So you can pump beer quickly from the cellar up a few levels without it coming out as froth.</p></div>		</li>
