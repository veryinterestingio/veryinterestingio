			<div class="markdown"><p>Radon is constantly leaking from the higher deposits, but there is such a small amount of it, and generally in open spaces, that is not much concern. During rain, or more specifically a low pressure system, the gas that was leaking slowly, gets pulled up by the low pressure currents and in the case there are strong winds, that pull is also stronger and sometimes the winds may spread the gas around</p>
<p>TL;DR: Difference in air pressure and wind direction help the gas to slip out of deposits and spread around</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add, while there are regional hot spots due to type of soil and rock that is in the area, there can also be large differences from one house to the next due to house construction methods, cracks in foundations and others. </p>
<p>Just because your neighbor has a high radon reading doesn't mean that you necessarily will and vice versa, but it's worth getting tested, especially if you spend a lot of time in the basement exercising which can increase your exposure due to breathing heavily.</p></div>		</li>
