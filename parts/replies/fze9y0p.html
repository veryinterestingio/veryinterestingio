			<div class="markdown"><p>The extremely thin atmosphere of Mars (around 1% of the density on Earth) means that we can generate much less lift with the same-size rotor compared to Earth.  For that reason, we needed to make the rotor unusually large compared to the rest of the helicopter, and we need to spin it as fast as we can without getting too close to the speed of sound at the blade tips. </p>
<p>We also had to make the blades extremely light and stiff to be able to safely control the helicopter in the thin atmosphere. -HFG</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see but we all know it will confront with sand storm with gigantic blade with  such a big area that will shot helicopter anywhere, how the team handle it?
I presume it will sit in shelter and gather or minimize the propeller until storm goes away
Is it right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the strongest storms observed on Mars topped out at ~100km/h, but with 1% of the atmosphere that's only equivalent to about 10km/h winds.</p>
<p>The storm that caused the evacuation in the martian would need to be like a F5 tornado in a cat5 hurricane to actually pose a real threat.</p></div>		</li>
