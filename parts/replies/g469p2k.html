<p><strong>Cretan</strong> (both Linear A and Hieroglyphics)</p>
<p><strong>Olmec</strong></p>
<p><strong>Indus Valley</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proto Elamite</strong></p>
<p>And not a language per se, but the <strong>Incan Quipu</strong> is something we can't understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is exactly this. First they found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription" target="_blank">Behistun Inscription</a> which was a single document in three languages, two of which were Old Persian and Akkadian. Old Persian had enough similarities to contemporary Persian aka Farsi that they first deciphered that part, and from there they deciphered Akkadian.</p>
<p>The Akkadians and Sumerians overlapped for sufficiently long time that there are a number of bilingual tablets available to work from to decipher Sumerian. Also they use the same cuneiform writing, making the process even easier.</p></div>		</li>
