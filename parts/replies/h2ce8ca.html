			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll see it in the direction it's coming from, you just won't see it reflected from anywhere else. I.e. it will still be equally bright in total, but instead of that light scattering through the atmosphere and reaching you from every direction at once it will all be concentrated in the one direction that the sun is from your current location.</p>
<p>Interesting fact though; it's not yellow light. In fact, the light from our sun is our definition of white light (light containing all colours we see). If sunlight was actually yellow everything in daylight would have a yellow tinge (like certain store lighting), but instead we take things outside to daylight to get a better feel for what their colours actually are.</p>
<p>The impression that the sun is yellow is mostly from the fact that when it's low in the sky it will start to appear yellow, but this is actually the same phenomenon that makes the sky turn to reds and purples at sunrise and sunset. It's caused by the angle and the amount of atmosphere the light goes through and hence would not occur in space. When the sun is overhead it's white.</p></div>		</li>
