			<div class="markdown"><p>The 2nd shot only makes your immunity improve compared to how it was in between the shots.</p>
<p>Basically each shot makes certain immune cells proliferate and differentiate. You get more and more of the cells that can specifically attack/guard against COVID, and they get better at it.</p></div>		</li>
