			<div class="markdown"><p>Many things became much more affordable.<br />
TVs, VHS, DVD, PCs,Online Streaming, clothing, footwear and consumer goods generally.<br />
Things which have been described as anaesthetic to the masses.<br />
So society felt like life was pretty good compared to the recent past.<br />
It kept the population sedated.<br />
Meanwhile, the captains of industry and politicians beholden to them by virtue of their campaign donations dismantled mechanisms which ensured the very wealthy paid their fair share.<br />
In my lifetime I've witnessed the rich pay a lower and lower proportion of tax.<br />
That means the burden of running government with all the services it provides has increasingly fallen at the feet of those who can least afford it.<br />
At the same time, the rich have leaned on those politicians to make it harder for working people to earn a living and achieve meaningful pay rises.<br />
Anyone noticed how the level of Union membership has continued to fall while effective standards of living have also fallen?<br />
Think this might be a coincidence?<br />
Who has been gradually changing the laws which make the abilities of Unions to be effective increasingly difficult?<br />
At least that's a large part of the answer.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>For 2018, households in the top 20% will have income of about $150,000 or more and 52% of total income, about the same as in 2017. But they will pay about 87% of income taxes, up from about 84% last year.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in the UK. My parents bought their placed for 30k in the mid 80's (which is about 15 months of my 2019 salary). It's worth more than 10x that now. My grandparents bought their place in the 60's for less than 10k, now its over half a million (and neither are anything hugely special - my parents have a 2 bed top floor maisonette, my grandparents have a 3 bed semi-detached house which they built an extension onto in the 90's).</p>
<p>Even in the last 10 years, the price of my parent's place has gone up by more than 60k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also here in Australia. My parents bought a house here in Melbourne in 1996 for $150k in what was a typical low/middle class suburb back then. Now the house is worth $1.3 million and the suburb is seen as exclusive and upper market. Even where I live now which is 56km from the CBD, you will struggle to find anything listed under $500k and the suburb that I live in is hardly &quot;desireable&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to add some context for non-Brits: In the UK in the 80s the government ran a programme of selling off state assets at low prices to try and encourage property ownership. Part of this was &quot;right to buy&quot; in which publically owned housing was sold to its inhabitants at about 2/3 to 1/2 of its real price, as wells as some other terms that made it even better. The result of this is that people who were earning in the 80s received huge government aid to build capital, aid that is now far less available to the young.</p></div>		</li>

14 years - that’s if the price of housing doesn’t go up - because wages are unlikely to.</p>
<p>It’s a runaway train - try catching it if your not already on it... $200,000 + for a deposit,
That’s if you have anything left after paying $500 a week rent for your 1 bedroom apartment</p></div>		</li>
