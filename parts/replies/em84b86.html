			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm... I started to reply to challenge the bit that I see you've corrected, but I think the last paragraph then needs flipped too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mixed system has lower entropy than a system where all the blue particles are bunched up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My bedroom at the start of the week - with all of the clothes bunched up (in drawers) - has <em>lower</em> entropy than it does at the end of the week when everything's much more homogeneous, things having tended towards entropy by that point, as you corrected yourself to say in the previous block. I use that as the classic high school chemistry teacher example, so I'm pretty sure that's right? </p>
<p>In that case, I can see that it follows that the homogeneity of the blue gradient painting would mean it has more entropy, but I'm not sure how that equates to having more information contained within it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I had flipped the sign in my head, classic engineer move.</p>
<p>It just depends what you mean by information. The painting muddles it up, I think.</p>
<p>For many physics disciplines, it really means &quot;what can the current state of this particle or group of particles tell us?&quot; on a particle by particle basis  (i.e. what can we measure and then infer). So a random distribution of many different particles doesn't have much &quot;valuable&quot; information, while a encountering a cloud of pure oxygen in space would be more interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see. My understanding of information was the amount of unique data points: if the oxygen atoms were all exactly the same temperate and vibrating in exactly the same directions in sync, while you could write papers and papers on the phenomenon, the measurements you could make would be algorithmically more compressible and therefore the information there, all being identical and not unique, would be less.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Entropy, in one sense (and one I prefer for basic explanations), can be thought of as an inverse measure of the likelihood of a system being in that state (thus, it decreases as the universe trends towards its most likely state over essentially infinite&quot;random&quot; interactions). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never heard of that definition--which implies that entropy <em>decreases</em>, not increases, over time. Also, I don't like the way you use the word &quot;state&quot; because it begs the question of how you measure a state, which brings us back full circle to the definition of entropy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure what you mean about state. It's a pretty universal use of the word. How you measure a particular quantity or define entropy is another matter, but the state of a system is just the state of a system. Everything about it. Regardless of how we measure, we know the trend is towards more likely states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just the way that it was implied that states have inherent likelihoods, when it's really all just relative to an arbitrary initial state. Though that was probably an unfairly narrow reading of what you wrote.</p></div>		</li>
