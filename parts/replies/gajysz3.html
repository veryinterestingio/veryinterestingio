			<div class="markdown"><p>For Hashimoto women are far more likely to get it.  The exact causes are unknown but there are thought to be genetic links (would explain mother, daughter) among other environmental factors. Testing has improved and of course if people around you are diagnosed itâ€™s something that comes to the forefront when you first see a doctor. </p>
<p>In general, autoimmune disease prevalence is trending upwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I learned about this so it may be out of date, but do you know if this is correct?  I was told that women are more likely to get all sorts of autoimmune diseases, and there was a thought that the double dose of X chromosomes was potentially to blame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what the other guy said, women in general have a much higher chance to get autoimmune disease as their immunesystem is more active, agressive and also immune cells are kept longer alive - in men testosterone kills off immune cells after a short period.</p>
<p>You can see that reflected in immune disease statistics where women can get depending on the type the disease 10%-600% more often.</p>
<p>In the flu season and in most pandemics (this one included) you can see that on the other hand female casualties are only around half of men.</p>
<p>So there are some gender related diffrences in our immune system that cause that correct impression.</p>
<p>(no sexism implied, thats just biology)</p></div>		</li>
