			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, so the populations must have been large enough for natural selection to occur at all.
Are we able to estimate population sizes by the density of fossils in a certain area?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be one way. Another way, I think, would be to base it on resources we know are available. For example, in the Morrison formation, we have rich plant life and plenty of herbivores, meaning that that environment was easily capable of providing for huge population of large fauna, like the plains of Africa. We obviously won't know the exact number, but we could take a guess that population sizes in that region would be fairly large, similar to what we see in Africa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not population count, though, right? More like vegetation biomass x can support herbivore biomass y. But the mass will be divided by stegosaurus, not zebra, to get count.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there was something like a mass death event, say a flash flood.  I think there are a few sites like that.  Then we can count about how many were killed and dumped in this pile.  Then figure out what the terrain was like.  So, there are about 100 dinos killed by this flood, and this valley has an area of 20 square kilometers that looks like it would have flooded.  So about 5 per square k on average.  Then throw other data on top of that.</p></div>		</li>
