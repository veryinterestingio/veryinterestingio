<p>Exclusive herbivores have great resistance to plant toxins, like the koala which can chow down on highly poisonous eukalyptus leaves all day long, while omnivores, like us, have moderate resistance, and carnivores have little to none.</p>

<p>So, in a manner of speaking, the carnivores are relying on the herbivores to break it down for them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is indeed a way of looking at it. In the same way you could say herbivores rely on plants to make calories from sunlight for them. It's kind of beautiful and interconnected, besides all the species running around killing each other bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually herbivores rely on bacteria in their large extensive digestive tracts to provide most of their nutrition. Bacteria break down the fibers and starches into fats for the animals to digest. Its a vital step most people leave out. That is why large herbivores have things like four stomachs or very large intestinal tracts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's effectively what carnivores do in general. All organisms need energy to survive and replicate. While there are several sources of chemical energy that contributed to early life on this planet, the primary source today and for a long time is sunlight. Plants evolved to efficiently capture this energy (primary producers). Many organisms then developed in response to consume those plants (primary consumers), and other organisms evolved to consume the consumers (secondary and tertiary consumers). Carnivores are part of that latter group.</p></div>		</li>
