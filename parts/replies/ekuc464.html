			<div class="markdown"><p>small nitpick - accelerometer will register no input when cruising at dangerous speeds. It's only changing speed that registers; in the case of a fitbit or something it's the variance in your stride (up and down bounce, back and forth arm swing) that allows detection of movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it detects very smooth (comparatively) acceleration in a straight line, with none of the up and down or side to side of human powered acceleration (walking, cycling, etc)  it can be sure you're in a vehicle.</p>
<p>While admittedly it wouldn't detect a perfectly even cruise, that's pretty rare even on a motorway - when I got cruise control I was amazed how much people's speed varied and how annoying it was if I wanted to just lock the car at 70.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting point. you've now got me wondering how useful of a signal those minute accelerations and decelerations are.</p>
<p>I suppose feeding a bunch of real world data through a machine learning algorithm would be able to pinpoint them as meaningful signals. Another option might be some sort of dead reckoning - if you accelerated so much 10 minutes ago, we assume you're still going at that speed if there's no equal and opposite acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No need for all that.  GPS can detect gross movement like driving.  Also, as you drive, you are switching from cell tower to cell tower.</p></div>		</li>
