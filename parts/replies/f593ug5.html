			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this hold true for light coming from distant stars? </p>
<p>Is the starlight we see just one single star beam that covers the whole planet cause it's traveled so far and spread so wide?</p>
<p>Or is it multiple beams interlaced but all covering a wide area and interfering with each other?</p>
<p>Physics me please!!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laser light is coherent light, meaning it’s all one wavelength and it’s all in phase (peaks and valleys of the waves all happen together).  Star light is pretty much everything laser light isn’t.  It’s a mess of all kinds of wavelengths and they’re all jumbled up.</p>
<p>Also, stars emit light in every direction, not as beams, it’s just kinda spilling out everywhere.  They don’t aim a beam, they just puke light everywhere and that light will hit whatever is between that star and infinity.</p>
<p>So the light you see from stars is just the light that just so happened to be going in the right direction to hit your eyeballs at whatever moment in time you happen to look at it.  It’s not rare for star light to hit your eyeballs without aiming because stars <em>just make that much light</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't that light just a barrage of photons?</p>
<p>Would each photon have expanded to be the size of a solar system.</p>
<p>I'm confused.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only reason having parallel light would be important is because that means it's all going in one direction so none of it is lost is a vacuum. When light goes out in all directions like from a light bulb or star, the power of the light is spread out across every single direction. The starlight you see is just the light that happened to point in your direction. Stars produce so much light that even this far away, that small angle that consists of light that just so happened to hit your eye was enough for you to see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure it's helpful to describe them as beams. Light emitted by a star is always spreading out in all directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't it emitting single photon streams in a gazillion directions all kinda lined up or is it just a random barrage like rainfall?</p></div>		</li>
