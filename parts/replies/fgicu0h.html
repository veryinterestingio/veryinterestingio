			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, same thing. Only that the glass pan is probably tempered and generally experiences less stress due to it, compared to window glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Corning changed their glass recipe a few years back; the older stuff is less likely (but still possible) to shatter in this manner.  More often than not when it does happen, it's not simply the temp difference of the counter, but likely a liquid (water/drink/oil) on the countertop which 'wicks' the heat from the glass quickly and causes the stress.  Even just a few drops is enough to cause localized stress which will cause the whole container to shatter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related, I used to work as a projectionist at those og IMAX film projectors. Those bulbs could handle INSANE heat but I would get warned a million times that if you touched the bulb even slightly, the oil from your fingers would cause heat to localize and the thing would shatter, wasting thousands of dollars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, its often why a glass breaks by even touching it when strait out of a washer. If fine enough glass, at room temperature, touching it with your body heat is enough to shatter it. Ive personally had it happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a housemate who put my glass casserole dish on the gas hob, was surprised when it broke, and did it with two more glass trays. So even heat resistant glass can have problems!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. In the lab, we check glassware that goes over direct heat for tiny scratches or cracks. Just a little damage, and even your lab grade borosilicate glassware shatters when heated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's hear resistant, but that just means it takes a steeper thermal gradient to break it. Putting a literal fire under it will definitely be enough.</p></div>		</li>
