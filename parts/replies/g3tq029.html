Not my project but I have read their paper drafts and attended their seminars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely.  </p>
<p>Most of my procrastination is preceded by thoughts of something I know I really need to do, but then I start feeling so anxious about acknowledging I will struggle to complete it, I can feel my brain take an off-ramp and just shelve it to avoid the anxiety.  </p>
<p>This gets ever-worse because the “things to do” build up into more un-finishable tasks.  </p>
<p>Sucks.</p></div>		</li>
