			<div class="markdown"><p>MRI would induce lots of current into the circuitry. They produce plenty of magnetic and electrical field energy. </p>
<p>So assuming you're able to safely get the phone within the magnetic field and remove it without damaging the phone through physical force, your phone will likely be fried. Especially if there is a scan running. </p>
<p>It's unlikely the physical sensor would break, however the other circuitry will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are no longer any components on modern phones such as HDDs which are sensitive to magnetism. Don't go waving a giant neodymium magnet around your iPod Classic, though.</p></div>		</li>
