			<div class="markdown"><p>This is Stefan: I have worked for a natural personal care company for over a decade, selling oral care, and underarm products. Most people prefer a toothpaste with flavor, or a deodorant with a fragrance. From our consumer data, adverse health effects are rare, but can occur. The most frequent issue we observed was skin irritation from deodorant use, which in some cases was due to a reaction to a fragrance. Certain fragrances have a higher incidence of such reactions.</p></div>		</li>
