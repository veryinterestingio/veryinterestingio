			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite non-technical explanation for autorotation is that <em>the blades are gliding</em>, just as an airplane will glide with the engine off. You can maintain a descent at a reasonable rate until close to the ground, then use the rotational energy of the blades to bring it to a brief halt just as you reach the ground.  </p>
<p>Of course, it's a complex skill and you have to get it right; it's an integral part of helicopter training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing he told me was that autorotation is a required proficiency in rotary wing school, and that one of his classmates executed it perfectly but with one subtle oversight.. he wasn't quite at ground level. You get exactly one chance, apparently. The skids and the pilot seat were destroyed, but the heli and pilot both completed school with minor repairs.</p>
<p>I fly RC helis. Knowing how to do one can save you a whole lot of money if your fuel or main battery runs out. Plus it's very gratifying when you can pull it off. But the word &quot;gliding&quot; is IMO very appropriate for the way the aircraft responds to the stick with no rotor power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;no rotor power&quot; isn't quite right. There's no engine power, but the air flowing up through the inside of the rotor disk drives the rotors and provides lift on the outside. You can control how fast the rotors go with their pitch. Lower pitch increases air flow up and makes them go faster and have more energy. Higher pitch makes them go slower and have less energy but slows your descent. Ideally, you autorotate from high enough and with enough airspeed to assume a steady state before nearing the ground. </p>
<p>Just before touching down (and &quot;just before&quot; is very different for a 10 ton military helicopter than for a news chopper), you increase the pitch to trade the rotational energy for addressing your descent, cushioning your landing. But if you yank up on the collective like your friend's friend, you can pop yourself back up in the air and immediately assume the aerodynamic characteristics of a refrigerator. It happens. I've seen the flattened skids. </p></div>		</li>
