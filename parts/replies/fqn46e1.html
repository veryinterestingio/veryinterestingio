			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I have been battling this for so long. I have really bad anxiety and I constantly have that feeling in my chest. Feels like a warm throbbing that pulsates through my body from my chest. It is killing me I know it. It makes me so weak all the time and it's just plain painful to constantly have it. Has most likely contributed to several side effects I'm having. I've started going to therapy and they have me on anti-anxiety/depression meds which helped it subside, but it has started to come back again these past months. It's been like this for many years and I hate it. Not sure if I'm experiencing exactly what you're talking about but to me it's a spot on description  Thanks for the question OP, and the detailed answer here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna post a similar thing. Past few weeks (flared up again, before it happened ~6 months ago reappearing every few months) I have been feeling this very often. Every 30-60 seconds I feel a light to severe “drop” near the bottom of my abdomen, whatever that feeling is called. I can even cause it to happen by thinking about something stressful. It’s like a heart palpitation but from my stomach instead. Feels like it’s definitely from anxiety. I also feel restless and just.. uneasy mentally and physically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I call that feeling my “anchor”. Stops me from going where I should. It’s triggered by emotions like stress, so accepting those and finding a way to live with them helps. </p>
<p>Boats need their anchor. Not all the time, but it has its use. It’s okay to carry it with you when you’re sailing from place to place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please, go see a cardiologist. I suffer from anxiety too, and (probably) because of it have developed a heart illness called tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Do not underestimate the toll that anxiety can take on your body - take care of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have lived a very long time with pretty severe anxiety.</p>
<p>Where you get that feeling you experience when youre swimming underwater and your completely out of breath so you come up to the surface, but you came up underneath someone on the goddamn floaty raft. That split second of complete helplessness and feeling of certain death. </p>
<p>Except the problem is, it doesnt last a split second. Youre trapped and it just doesnt go away. Then you have a full blown panic attack it feels like youre burning alive in a housefire. </p>
<p>There are some really really good medications out there that are a complete 100% rescue from those feelings. When i discovered xanax it legitimately saved my life. After using it for relief just a few times, I just could not believe something existed that could make those feelings stop completely. </p>
<p>That was the magic about it though, Just knowing that i had a tiny little pill with me in my wallet that i knew for a fact could save me should i need it, made me feel safe. I had a sense of security and a way out. I carried one with me every day for 8 years straight and only ever needed to take it a handful of times. </p>
<p>Doctors are dicks about prescribing benzos, especially if youre young. They are probably the worst medicine you could ever abuse and you have to be careful with interactions, but they are a miracle gift from the god himself if he exists. If youre not already on them I would demand them from your dr.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do apologize for that. Some of us get jaded by the people drug seeking for more and miss the people who genuinely need the rescue. For what it's worth I have pretty strong anxiety issues and strongly sympathize with those who put up with it. It's not easy and I had to put a lot of effort into myself to fight it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Xanax is definitely amazing! I was on it for a bit then I asked to be changed over to Klonopin because it lasted longer, I regret making that change though cause it takes a while for the Klonopin to take effect. I've asked my psychiatrist to switch back to Xanax but he said the clinic I go to wouldn't approve it because Xanax has a higher abuse rate than Klonopin. So instead of taking a Xanax whenever I need it, I took Klonopin every day to prevent a possible Anxiety attack which is stupid. I weaned off the Klonopin but my anxiety has been coming back every now and then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does that feeling carry on when it's not due to the initial shock? As in, still feeling physical pain due to emotional pain a few days or weeks later? Like when your heart feels like it's physically aching and then also feeling like you can't breathe properly and every breath is a struggle? </p>
<p>I get it when it's just like, you wake up and for a few minutes you've forgotten and then you remember and it's like the shock thing again. But sometimes it's not just because of random remembering, what causes when that feeling is all the time not just now and again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm spitballin' here, but it sounds like you're describing symptoms of anxiety, grief, or prolonged stress.  So the feelings could be a matter of perception to some degree, a result of over-producing stress hormones, the inhibition of neurotransmitters such as serotonin or dopamine as a psychosomatic response to trauma/distress, or a combination of these and other factors?</p></div>		</li>
