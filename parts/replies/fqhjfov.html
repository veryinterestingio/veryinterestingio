			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer.</p>
<p>If I'm doing the vectors right, the tether will feel a force towards the equator. So if the anchor point keeps it in tension pulling away from the equator, won't the satellite be left with a straight up force?</p>
<p>Or, of course, the obvious solution of matched pairs of North/South space elevators attached to a shared equatorial satellite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love it.  Unfortunately it is really hard.  Our silly globe is top &quot;heavy&quot;.  As in there isn't a whole lot of land south of the equator.</p>
<p>For example, basically all of North America would have a corresponding southern tether in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  All of Europe pairs south of Cape Town SA.</p>
<p>There are a few nice pairs.  Like Tokyo matches rather well with a location &quot;close&quot; to Adelaide Aus.  Basically only N/S pairs that finish in Australia... So Taiwan, Mainland Taiwan.</p>
<p>Perhaps super long tethers from Antarctica to areas near the North Pole (Siberia, Greenland, Canada).  Then &quot;vertical&quot; tethers along the N/S to connect the temperate regions, like an inverted menorah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A single elevator is fine, you can get the counter-force from an offset in the satellite orbit. You increase the necessary strength of the cable, however. That strength is already the biggest problem, making it worse isn't going to help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the satellite appears to orbit a point on Earth's axis some little way off from the equator.</p>
<p>Reminding me of an idea from Tom Digby: if synchronous orbit is crowded to capacity, give your new satellite an ion engine, which can put out a weak steady thrust for years; then it can hover a little way off the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then there's the political issue. Nations that would be first <del>variable</del> capable of building a space elevator have no equatorial land, so they will have to build something in the ocean, in international waters. I mean, they could try <del>leading</del> leasing some territory, but other countries might not like the deal, or political instability might make establishing the earth base there less safe than needed. Interesting stuff to think about besides the hard science issues.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A tether point in the ocean has some other advantages. It could float/move around as needed to absorb changes on the other end, as no geostationary orbit is perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arthur C Clarke had it placed on Sri Lanka, but also had Sri Lanka in (or closer to) the equator.  The reason it was picked was due to the stability of the gravity at the point.</p>
<p>Being Arthur C Clarke there must be some element or truth to this, meaning potential locations along the equator may be limited.</p>
<p>So it could be that the only places suitable could be on land, leading to the issues you describe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I read this great hard sci-fi series about the potential terraforming of Mars - their thousands-of-kilometers long carbon nanotube space elevator cable is broken by terrorist action, then gravity proceeds to catastrophically whip the cable into and around the equator of the planet, causing incredible damage.</p></div>		</li>
