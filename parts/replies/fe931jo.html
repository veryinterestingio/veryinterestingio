			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that you have to give pretense to it being &quot;decent&quot; is funny :-) </p>
<p>Most issues that movie adaptions of video games suffer from is that they try to adapt the wrong things and try to fill in with what they can create on their own. </p>
<p>I think the best way to explain this idea I have would be to explain what went wrong with game of thrones. The show runners were amazing at directing what George r r Martin had created, and the source material was more than enough to create a show with. When d&amp;d ran out of material they had to synthesize their own material, and that was a train wreck</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And you're right! But it's also very different. If we take last of us, seeing Joel experience Ellie's depression through the gameplay mechanic of press triangle to boost Ellie is more powerful of a story than if all of sudden movie Ellie had depression. </p>
<p>Pulp fiction works as a movie because it doesn't rely on one central character to move it's audience forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think with the scale and length of character development it would do better as a series. Most games just have too much to fit into one movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is awesome! What made wow an interesting experience was the overall sheer amount of everything, paired with the addictive nature of how MMOs work. A movie based around grinding dailies and shit posting in trade chat while browsing lfr would not be an interesting film</p></div>		</li>
