			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested in it at all, there's a youtube channel Project Farm that does product reviews and one thing he does with engine oils is an analysis before/after testing.  The oil lab testing breaks down what the additives are.  If you're not interested, that's fine too but I love that channel and found it interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this &quot;additive package&quot; break down over time and necessitate oil changes even when the car is not being driven? I'd always assumed that's why most people say &quot;change it at X kilometers driven or every Y months&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conventional wisdom of changing your oil every 'x' kilometers varies, depending on your driving habits and the age of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Some car experts suggest that 'change the oil every 3000 miles' is primarily for the benefit of auto shops, which get more money when you come in more often.  </p>
<p>Scientific American recommends changing the oil every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. but really, if your car is fairly new, you drive for 20 minutes or more and maintain steady speeds (not stop-and-go), you can usually get away with a longer time between changes; some synthetic oils can even last for 10,000 miles or more (though they tend to be more expensive in the long run).</p>
<p>Generally, though, changing your oil early doesn't really do much beyond provide peace-of-mind -- it won't necessarily hurt the car, but more frequent oil changes are definitely going to be harder on your wallet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a large truck fleet that never changed the engine oil. Every time the brake was applied a few cc of oil was injected into the fuel tank, calculated to equal one quart of oil every 500 miles. So at that point you would add a fresh quart, and the cycle started over. We had engines with well over 1,000,000 miles on them that had never had the oil changed. The filters were changed every 40,000 miles, and makeup oil added. The advantages were no used oil to dispose of, so no charge for hauling it away, and a gallon of oil replaced a gallon of fuel virtually free.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some additives break down with use, but not time. Soot is the primary concern in terms of wear, which is also use dependent, not time. The time recommendation is for people who only ever make short trips. Combustion products acidify oil, and short trips won't get the oil hot enough to evaporate the acid, but it is a minor concern compared to soot. Keep in mind engines are made of metal. They aren't going to just break suddenly if you wait until 3001 or 5001 miles. Personally, I don't track miles because I drive less than 10k a year. I do April and October changes. 0W or 5W in October, and 5W or 10W or 15W in April, depending on the vehicle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would figure that the heat from combustion plays a part too because it typically breaks down lubricants.</p></div>		</li>
