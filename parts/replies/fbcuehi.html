			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning Tim Dodd's video on Aerospike engines.  In this he goes into how rocket engines work and why the bell is shaped and sized the way it is, with nice animations and stuff.</p>

<p>Be warned that it is a 1 hour long video, but well worth watching.  You'll learn loads, and Tim explains stuff really really well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you're into this type of thing, then expect to spend a LOT more than an hour watching Tim Dodd.   He calls himself the Everyday Astronaut, and he's got a ton of great content.   </p>
<p>I've always had a casual interest in space, but he definitely got me hooked on everything that SpaceX, ULA, RocketLabs, etc. are all doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>correct apart from you always reduce the pressure in the gas to drive up the speed, sub or supersonic it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>At the speed of sound, you get the highest density multiplied by speed. this is why that section is the smallest, the same amount of mass needs less area to pass through.</p></div>		</li>
