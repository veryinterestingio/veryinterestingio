			<div class="markdown"><p>You're burning contacts with electric sparks.</p>
<p>That's why on/off switches often click, because the contacting phase when sparks can jump between contacts has to be minimised to avoid damage from plasma arc (tiny one, but still hot enough to damage stuff over time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what it is. Things with alot of bulk capacitance will draw alot of current when plugged in. That's why you often see sparks when you plug in a big electronic power supply. Motors are mostly ok except if there isn't enough oomph to get them spinning at a low speed setting or if there is some sore of capacitor to start the rotation that isn't in the circuit when the switch is in low speed when you first plug it in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a device is energized, current is going through it. When you pull the plug, the current doesn't stop immediately and there will be some arcing. At low power this can cause deterioration of the contacts and sparking. At higher power it can generate a big pretty light show and kill anyone in the vicinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an even worse idea to unplug high power or inductive loads while they're on, easy way to get some arcing inside the plug and vaporize part of the contacts.</p></div>		</li>
