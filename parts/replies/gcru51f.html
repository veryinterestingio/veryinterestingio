			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, doubting Pfizer's claim of having 95% efficacy just because it's not peer reviewed is... dumb? Can't find the right words.</p>
<p>I honestly have no idea about peer reviews. I kinda have an idea about how intensive drug approvals are, and doubting the results are kinda... I don't have the words for it... but yeah... just... yeah... hahaha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 95% is what Pfizer’s analysis of the data gives.  The FDA will take the raw data and perform their own analysis.    </p>
<p>No reason to doubt the Pfizer data; they know all eyes are on them so they aren’t going to take creative liberties with the data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I regularly perform peer review for a few journals. I will read the article that is being published, perhaps some of their older articles, and I might re-perform some of their analyses, but I won't recreate any of their experiments or scrutinize the nitty gritty data. Here is what I look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the results new and worth publishing?</li>
<li>Is the experimental methedology sound?</li>
<li>Do their results support their claims?</li>
<li>Are their results plausible?</li>
<li>Do their results contradict previous work, and if so is there a plausible justification?</li>
<li>Is the presentation clear to the reader?</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's about it. It's a much shorter, much more basic review than the type of intense, high-level review involved in FDA approval.</p></div>		</li>
