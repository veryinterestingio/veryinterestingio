			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best example I've read yet. Additionally, roads can come from preexisting paths. For example in the Hampton Roads, Virginia area, many of the roads that exist today were originally walking paths through the forest used by Native Americans. It was easier to clear trees to widen the road in those areas and they existed because the Native Americans knew the landscape well, which meant they were probably the most efficient routes to various areas, like fresh water or hunting. As the area became more populated and trees were cleared for farming, many roads were built in whatever convenient arrangement made sense for the farmers at the time. That's why today when you drive around in that area it feels like a toddler scribbled on a map and called it city planning. In the 1950s, they must have also hired a toddler to design the interchanges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to that, Boston had a lot of hills but they were all dug up and thrown in the harbor as infill development. A lot the streets today
were built before that and go with the original topography so when viewed today with no hills, they make no sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't find a source on the toddlers designing the interchanges. But I'm very sure of that because no intelligent adult would design something so terribly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. I live out in the countryside. Deer trails come first, then humans use a few of the more suitable deer trails, widening them a bit, then maybe later humans turn the most worthwhile paths into dirt roads a vehicle can use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>>  All these examples are modern-times City planning. In the old days (when  most current cities started) someone built a general store at a  cross-roads. </p>
<p>This may be true of American towns, but not typically European towns.</p>
<p>Many cities in France have pre-historic human presence, and generally got bigger thanks to trade or Romans deciding it was a strategic military point.</p>
<p>So the settlements evolved over very long periods of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in Roman times and even before a lot of the cities still started with a trade path going through an area but they generally relied on the land to provide the initial infrastructure. They would settle near rivers for the running water and protection. They would ideally have an initial food source until they could get farms up and running. Then they would fortify the area with wall which would bring a lot of settlement into the area because of the protection it provides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much true for almost every city that it sprouts from a bulk point or crossroads. It also followed the exact path they laid out, infrastructure as it was needed.</p>
<p>Now when feudal lords found a place that was good for defending the countryside, they'd build a fort there. Forts had to be staffed and fed, so farmers would move in or be moved in, and servants would live in quarters in the fort or build houses around it. Soldiers would have to be housed and fed as well. Pretty soon there's a sizeable population around a fort that can be traded with, and traders move in, then more and more infrastructure. It's the exact same path.</p></div>		</li>
