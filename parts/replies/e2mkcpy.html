This &quot;lying on your back&quot; thing might actually help me sleep better tonight. Thanks man!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been using SleepRight nasal aids for about four years and  highly recommend them.  They are plastic clips that grab the septum (columella) and little curved plastic &quot;wings&quot; hold your nostrils open.  </p>
<p>For about ten years before I found these I used BreatheRight (aka snore strips) which have the same effect but aren't as strong (and they also leave your nose a little sticky).</p>
<p>Either way, as someone with lifelong allergies who never had clear airways in my nose, the ability to breathe in cool &quot;crisp&quot; air through my nose and fall asleep this way, while keeping my mouth shut (no dry mouth and greatly reduced morning funk) is a gamechanger.  Even if you're stuffed up from time to time, that extra little space to let air through without a sudden stop or snort feels great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this! I just went through the same surgery and im still recovering. Every day was a struggle for me to breathe and it got to a point where i could only inhale through my mouth, no matter howmany times i blew my nose. Now pair this with asthma... Yea... A horrible struggle.</p>
<p>I went to an ENT Doctor, got surgery etc, and im definitely noticing a big change with inhaling. Im still not done with flushing everything out and my nose still hurts but i guess it'll take time. </p>
<p>Do you know if its &quot;normal&quot; for it to still hurt a week after surgery? Its the outside nostril area and inner &quot;walls&quot; for a lack of better term, aswell as the tip, lol</p>
<p>Giving you an internet fist-bump for sharing the same nasal pain, those tampons can screw off</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father was addicted to the nasal spray for most of his adult life. Now that I have become older I have realized I have the same incredibly small nasal passages. When I go to exercise I use Bronk-aid. It's a ephedrine type and it works but I hate being dependent on it.</p>
<p>I am considering having the surgery where they remove some bone structure to create a larger nasal opening. I need to research it but it seems like an alternative maybe.</p></div>		</li>
