			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadnâ€™t considered that a potential vaccine might only work temporarily. I wonder what the immunity period would have to be for them to start using it. Seems like even if it was only, say, 3 months that that would still be incredibly helpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3 months would still be pretty short.  Most licensed vaccines are going to be effective in most people for at least 5 years.  In order to get licensed for short duration it would have to be a disease that is very common(e.g. seasonal flu) or be a disease that has risk of death or disability(e.g. meningitis) for those affected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't COVID qualify under both categories? Obviously not as permanent solution, but as a stopgap measure while they work on a better vaccine? They'd be able to get far more people vaccinated for 3 months than they'd be able to get to quarantine for 3 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if its every 6 months, but only on 50% of those who get it, and there is a low, but non-zero, risk of complications?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Efficacy is the least concern, and there are surrogate markers that could be followed up on. Safety is more important and requires the larger studies, as to prove a benefit overall versus the typical deaths/injuries from COVID-19. Think about how often the flu vaccine isn't all that effective in some years, but since it is so safe the recommendation is to get a flu shot every year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Followup question then: Is SARS-CoV-2 so different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that the vaccines from those cannot be adapted for the new strain in the same way that we quickly update our influenza vaccine?</p>
<p>Based on some Googling it's unclear whether we actually have approved vaccines for the other two yet, so my question may not be relevant if we don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another related question: I'd heard that the flu vaccine was mostly ineffective because there are either multiple active strains and we don't vaccinate against them all, or we fail to correctly predict which strain will spread and just make a completely useless vaccine for a strain that didn't spread.  Is that accurate, or are there reasons why a correctly-targeted flu vaccine would be less effective than something like, say, the Polio vaccine?</p></div>		</li>
