<p>And I never said cask aging didn't leech the lignin and other things , I said that saying those are what counteract the burning sensation of the ethanol is speculation. Unless you have any peer reviewed studies you'd like to put forth to back your claims, please don't get overly defensive when someone simply states there is no evidence to back your explanation.</p></div>		</li>
