			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say 10 million years ago an intelligent species of bird or something draw cave paintings of their own. Would those paintings have survived until today if left undisturbed, or does paint naturally crumble into dust with no evidence that it ever existed after 100k years or whatever?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sites were forgotten about and abandoned for thousands of years. Most cave paintings are in very deep or hard to reach spots </p>
<p>Any site that wasn't forgotten and continued to be used would have led to factors that contribute to erosion. People would have been touching them, using fire, etc</p></div>		</li>
