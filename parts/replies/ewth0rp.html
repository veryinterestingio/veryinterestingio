			<div class="markdown"><p>This kind of reminds me of how people used to think that the uterus just floated around in the body. This moving around was what caused women to act strangely. This behaviour caused by a moving womb is the original definition of the word hysteria. And the best way to cure hysteria was by vaginal stimulation. </p>
<p>Yeah, people used to believe some crazy stuff back in the day. I don't even know why I know so much about hysteria.</p>
<p>Edit: decided to link to some Wikipedia articles on this matter</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard of wondering uterus syndrome but I always thought it was just and old timey way of saying women were crazy.  They didn’t really thing the uterus was moving, it was a euphemism, already that’s what I thought</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, they genuinely believed it. They've even done hysterectomies in some extreme cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I understood everything up to &quot;intestines can vary&quot;.  Kidding, very interesting and informative, thank you.  I'm the son of a paediatrician.  I always wish I'd asked him more about his work before he passed on.  I'm a moron by comparison.  I'm in awe of what the medical profession do for their patients each and every day.  Thank you.</p></div>		</li>
