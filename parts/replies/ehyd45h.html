			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I'm aware of. They die from it just like we do. The hibernation slows the progression of the disease, but that just explains why the disease doesn't simply die off in the winter. The big issue with bats is they tend to bite each other a lot, and there are tens of millions of bats. So, they frequently spread the disease among each other. In North America, they are basically the last vector for rabies to anything else. Wild animals in the forest are often vaccinated with treated bait balls. </p>
<p>When an animal starts to experience the symptoms of rabies, they tend to do weird things. If you see a wild animal behave strangely friendly towards you, it's actually a cause for concern. Some of the people who have been infected describe having a bat land in front of them and seem tame. </p>
<p>Essentially, the virus spreads very, very slowly through the nerves in your body up into your brain. The &quot;treatment&quot; is simply a vaccine and active antibodies. The vaccine is likely sufficient though as the original treatment was nothing else. (and a lower quality vaccine too) Everyone treated within a couple of days with the vaccine never came down with rabies. In other words, it's 100% effective. It has never failed. The key here is once you have the vaccine, your body will recognize and catch the virus traveling towards your brain and destroy it before it gets there. Once it gets to your brain, you are screwed. Modern treatments involve anti-virals and forcing comas, and they usually don't work.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like vampires/zombies.  Zombies are Haitian folklore and originally were not a contagious monsterism until  Richard Matheson's 1954 novel <em>I Am Legend</em>.</p>
<p>Vampires come from general European folklore.  Rabies was present in medieval Europe so <em>maybe</em> it inspired the folklore</p></div>		</li>
