			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of issues with producing hydrogen from water:  1) High cost and 2) The electricity often has a carbon footprint as well.  Cheap hydrogen is currently produced, for industry, by reacting water and methane.</p>
<p>Our plan is to use renewable bio-methane, which means that we produce clean hydrogen and don’t have fossil CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>In addition, using solar energy and/or other renewable energy to drive the high-temperature endothermic reaction provides much cheaper hydrogen – with half of it coming from water.  Eventually, though not right now, we’re expecting to point the technology towards co-producing hydrogen and solid carbon, which of course would eliminate emissions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use this process with organic biomethane to create clean H2 and solid carbon then would it not have a negative emissions profile?</p>
<p>If so that’s great and makes this project infinitely more relevant and interesting.</p></div>		</li>
