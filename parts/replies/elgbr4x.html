			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not, in fact, have a limiter.  Without modern medicine, it doesn't need one.  If it doesn't raise the temperature enough to stop the disease from multiplying, you are dead anyway, so it doesn't matter.  Modern medicine changes that, but the body isn't really optimized for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh thanks! Certainly learned my lesson to take anti fever meds and stay hydrated sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>Good to know if it keeps climbing fast there's nothing internal to slow it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fever will not reach a deadly level (above 107) on its own without extenuating circumstances (malignant hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, heatstroke, damage to the hypothalamus due to brain infection, etc.), so there is, in fact, a limiter. Otherwise you'd see people dropping like flies from fever-induced hyperthermia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, normally that won't happen.  You temperature will rise and it will have the desired effect of slowing the infection, so your body with stop raising the temp.  It has to be a very severe infection to keep going up and up like that.  It means the body is losing the fight and you almost certainly will die without medical intervention.  The thing to do is go to the hospital at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably should have taken action at 103 but I was like nah...just nap. Naps and ginger ale are as good as modern medicine gets, right? </p>
<p>Plus I thought the body stops itself at a certain temp, TIL it has a design flaw.</p></div>		</li>
