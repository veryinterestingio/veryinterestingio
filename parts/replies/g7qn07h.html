			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole history of this sort of thing. For instance, medieval Christianity seems to have interpreted what we'd call <em>major depression</em> as a sin, <em>akrasia</em>, lack of willpower, usually translated as &quot;sloth&quot; or &quot;lethargy&quot;. It's in the Seven Deadly Sins, along with wrath, lust, greed, and the rest of Donald Trump's personality factors.</p>
<p>Can't get out of bed? Must be the devil tempting you with the deadly sin of sloth! Now we have to haul you out of bed and make you run around the churchyard a dozen times saying prayers to drive the demon away.</p>
<p>And hey, if the physical exercise happens to help your depression ... cool, I guess?</p></div>		</li>
