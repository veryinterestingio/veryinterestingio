			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, on top of that:</p>
<p>Large parts of their empire were ruled somewhat loosely. They didn't go there and kick the old rulers out. They came in and let the old rulers stay if they cooperated, often only leaving a single overseer there.</p>
<p>They kept this system stable through fear, if the locals killed their overseer they burned the city to the ground as a punishment to keep other cities obedient.</p>
<p>The old rulers could pretty much keep doing what they did before as long they provided troops and tributes to the mongols</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this ist a great addition. Fun fact: when Charlemagne conquered the saxons, he also kept saxon nobles in charge, but integrated those in the frankish &quot;state&quot; (after he beheaded a lot of saxons, though. Fear was also part of his empire)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying they “burnt the city to the ground” is one of the greatest understatements you could make.  Like saying the Jews in the Holocaust were “removed from their homes”</p>
<p>The Mongolians butchered every.  Single.  Person.  Lined them up, and hacked them to bits in front of each other.  Then went searching the whole city looking for people they missed.  Then burnt everything and left.  THEN would come back a few days or a week later and re-storm the ruins and kill everyone that came back to look for family members, and/or those that came out of hiding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I mean the Mongolians, to my knowledge, were not big on written history, and their victims, after receiving the treatment you just described, would be in no state to hold a pen. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Were they inviting foreign journalists along for their conquests?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. The complement to this is that as time went on and sons, grandsons and great grandsons emerged - princes of the realm would often be given areas to govern. This would lead to independent but cooperating fiefdoms.</p>
<p>Example - Genghis' eldest son Jochi would die of illness in the early 1220s. His family would be given Eastern Europe and western Asia. Jochi's eldest son was Batu. The conquest of those areas would be concluded in Batu's name by early 1240s and Batu would rule his region from his capital at Sarai, where the Volga flows into the Caspian Sea. He would never return to Mongolia proper. He and his descendants would create the Khanate of the Golden Horde (coolest name in history in my view). The Golden Horde, esp in early rulers, clearly accept the rule of the Great Khan in Mongolia and later Beijing but operated autonomously in al.oat every way. Over time, these links would decay as there became more and more entities between them and the seat of the Great Khan.</p>
<p>Similar partitioning would emerge. Note that this decomposition would also lead to conflict and ultimate breakup of the empire.</p>
<p>One of the real fracture points being - the rulers of the Western third and the Golden Horde would adopt Islam. But Hulegu's destruction of Baghdad in 1258 would cause a rupture between Islamicized Mongols and others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not too long ago I learned that Mongolian people are able to eat dairy where Chinese people are frequently lactose intolerant.  Historians have argued that this was an advantage that helped Genghis Khan, soldiers could travel fast with their food source but the Chinese needed much more infrastructure and effort to transport rice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is lactose tolerance/intolerance important? I am lactose intolerant. All it means for me is getting stomach aches and watery diarrhea when I eat dairy. Other than that, I can have all the milk, cheese and ice cream I want. Lactose intolerance seems to be more of a personal comfort issue, not a world-controlling-empire issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diarrhea isn’t a big deal for you because you can just go to the tap and get some water to stay hydrated.  </p>
<p>That wasn’t a thing back then, and diarrhea when you only have the little bit of water you can carry with you in a sheep stomach is a recipe for becoming incapacitated and useless as a soldier. Diarrhea still kills thousands of people a year today, largely in underdeveloped and extremely poor areas where access to clean drinking water isn’t freely available. </p>
<p>And you can’t really run an effective army of thousands of dudes shitting themselves everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off the top of my head, I think a large part of the fall had to do with Genghis Khan having an equally competent successor. You cannot achieve the sort of results he did without being so exceptional that it's near-impossible to be succeeded by someone who can even sustain your gains, let alone build upon them. </p>
<p>There are reasons that his name has lingered so long while so many others have been lost in the mist of history. How many remember Subutei? If you do not know Subutei despite his accomplishments then you already have an inkling as to what caused the collapse. Subutei is arguably one of the greatest generals that <strong>ever</strong> lived, yet his legacy pales in comparison to Genghis Khan. That alone should tell you about what level Genghis Khan was on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world by Jack Weatherford is a very good overview with enough anecdotes and story telling flair to have it be an enjoyable read while still providing dates and lineages. The only criticism i have of it is the author really sets out to disprove the myths of the mongols being barbarians and sometimes presents a brutal system of fear and depopulation as a great administrative innovation.</p></div>		</li>
