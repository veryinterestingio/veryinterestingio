			<div class="markdown"><p>That's technically correct, but I think the core question is slightly different.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's expected that people with shared/similar ethnicity would have a single common ancestor only a few thousand years back - due to math and the extremely unlikelihood of unrelated populations, basically.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What's unexpected is that one (and only one) such common ancestor happened to be the only instance of this genetic mutation (notwithstanding additional research).</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can call it unexpected, but there are a lot of traits in humans, right? Some are common, some are not so common. </p>
<p>Similarly, some people were prolific breeders and some weren't. When you have a mutation for a new trait that coincides with a prolific breeder (or a recent progeny that's prolific), you end up with a common trait. It's just that simple.</p>
<p>So, while it <em>seems</em> odd, it's just that there happened to be high reproductive success in this particular case where a new trait arose. It's like the lottery, it's unlikely that any one individual will win, but it's not that unlikely that <em>somebody</em> will win.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's more like the same person winning the lottery twice.  The seeming unlikeliness of that causes speculation that the 2 events are not unrelated.  i.e. the blue eyes gave such a high reproductive advantage that it propagated wildly from just 1 individual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the corresponding generation that is related to everybody alive <em>in the world</em> today would be somewhere between 4000-7000 years ago. </p>

<p>Is this correct?</p>
<p>Wikipedia tells me that y-chromosal Adam and mitochondrial eve lived over 100 000 years ago. So there's no way that <em>everyone</em> in the world could trace their lineage to a single person who lived 4000-7000 years ago. </p>
<p>Have I misunderstood something?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok we wouldn't be here without the people that lived and reproduced back then. If they hadn't reproduced there wouldn't be descendants who could claim them. </p>
<p>Going back is always going to continue in a reverse bottleneck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y-chromosomal Adam is much more recent than mitochondrial Eve. And MRCA (most recent common ancestor) is even more recent and is likely only a few thousand years old. </p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that these three are not fixed individuals. They are constantly changing as family lines die out. Several thousand years in the future, the MCRA could be someone who's alive today.</p>
<p>If you go back just 10 generations or around 300 years you have a maximum possible of 1024 ancestors and for 20 generations it's more than a million (of course the actual number is much smaller). So there are lots of possible individuals from whom the common ancestor can arise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're telling me the MRCA was someone else?</p></div>		</li>
