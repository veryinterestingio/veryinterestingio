			<div class="markdown"><p>most banks provide the integration of payment gateway to client's ERP/MIS free of cost based on this &quot;float&quot;.  so over a period of time the amount of float will stabilize and the banks show them as cash deposits to lend more based on these amounts. its a win-win for the bank but a lose-lose for a customer, particularly at crunch times. </p>
<p>Regarding banks laziness to make this process faster, They can process all of these transactions and run your credit worthiness check in milliseconds, it just isn't beneficial for them. We need more customer friendly policies.</p></div>		</li>
