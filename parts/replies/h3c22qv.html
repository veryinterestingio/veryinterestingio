			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, light. This is the reason why people thought the extensive use of CGI in Alien 3 was terrible. Except Alien 3 had almost no CGI in it, what they were actually seeing was very finely hand animated puppets superimposed on the scenes. The puppet effect worked wonderfully and was very fluid, except they didn't match the lighting on the puppets to the lighting on the scenes and the lighting was a total mismatch. The animation and superimposing of the puppet was so fluid though that people assumed it must have been done by a computer.</p>
<p>And Star Wars prequels, there's a lot of shots people assume were CGI that are actually all practical, much of the movie in fact, especially Episode 1. This was less to do with light and more to do with the shots seeming impossible, people assumed it could only have been achieved with a computer, when really it was miniatures and stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, there was a video I saw once explaining that some of the defaults assumed by Blender and other software is WAAAAAAY off if you compare it to, say, the actual amount of light output by the sun. Which makes sense in a way, because the people who originally came up with these software and techniques might not have necessarily had any knowledge of how much light the sun produces. And if you adjust this value, and adjust exposure etc to compensate, you get a much more realistic render.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in game art, use these programs regularly.
Defaults of blender/maya/etc are meant for asset and anim creation, nor yet for lighting. You can reproduce the amount of lumens the sun produces, but the effect isn't obvious without a render/or game engine.
Basically, the programs were made this way intentionally.</p></div>		</li>
