			<div class="markdown"><p>I made chocolate peanut butter fudge once and as I heated the mixture, the oil separated. I didn’t realize that’s what it was and just used a paper towel to sponge it off. I inadvertently made reduced fat fudge and it tasted great!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly don’t remember- it was 20 years ago. But fudge is really easy to make. I probably just searched for a recipe on Alta Vista and made the first recipe I found. Pretty sure it was on a GeoCities website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but I remember thinking it was really good. I guess I’d have to make it both ways to compare. It also might have affected the texture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, that oil and texture of peanut butter makes it an excellent fuel source for fires. I had a 10 gallon bucket of peanut butter catch fire once. It burned for like a week.</p></div>		</li>
