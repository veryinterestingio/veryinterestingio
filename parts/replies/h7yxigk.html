<p>If we fail to reject the null-hypothesis (because the p-value wasn't small enough) you do not accept the null-hypothesis as true.
Instead, you may only conclude that the results are inconclusive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't there a way to use the same data to determine the chance that the null-hypothesis is true? Like if the p-value is greater than .95?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: no.</p>
<p>p values give you the probability you would get the data that you actually did get IF the null were true. This is, in my opinion, nearly worthless information. </p>
<p>What would often be useful is probability that there is an effect of the IV or that there is not an effect of the IV. Bayesian statistics can provide that information, however. But Bayesian stats doesn't rely on the p value of NHST.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the way most science works is through null-hypotheses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is very common in the social and life sciences. Astronomy, physics (and to a certain extent, chemistry) do not rely heavily on NHST. Calculating confidence intervals is one alternative to NHST. Also note that NHST wasn't terribly common in any of the sciences prior to 1960. A lot of good science was published in a wide range of fields before NHST became a thing.</p></div>		</li>
