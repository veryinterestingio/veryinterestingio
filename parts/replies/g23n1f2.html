			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't need software - my 40-year-old Land Rover just has gauges that are very slow to react (I think they work on a thermal / bimetallic strip effect) so all the sloshing does nothing - after all, you don't use fuel fast enough to see the needle move and if it takes 10 seconds for the needle to rise after starting / refilling it's no biggie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget back then electronics weren't as advanced or cheap, so they would take a reading and display it.  Now, they can take multiple readings over a period of time, average that number, and show you. You don't need instant reading to drive a car, just a good average number since it takes so long to empty a tank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may run on a different type of float system.  The one I commonly deal with is basically a bobber on the end of a metal coat hanger.  As fuel level rises the metal on the opposite side of the coat hanger contacts points in the pump to send the fuel level signal to the gauge.  This can be direct input in older models so you can watch the fuel level move as you accelerate brake and turn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it’s not your field but do you know anything about temperature readings in cars?</p>
<p>It’s always baffled me where the sensor would be in order to get a reliable reading of the outside temperature given there’s lots of factors that could affect said reading.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No idea if that's just heat absorption from sitting under the sun and then cooling from the wind when driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it’s the cooling (windchill) I’m curios about.</p>
<p>A cars temp sensors traveling in the winter must be affected quite considerably by windchill and just can’t understand how it takes such things into account.</p>
<p>I can’t think of a placement on the car that’s not affected by some outside influence or another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're usually located at the bottom of the front bumper in the grille or sometimes the shark fin antenna on the roof. Wind-chill only affects how fast something will cool down, blowing wind doesn't cool anything down past what the actual temperature of the air is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually in my field as well - pretty much any sensors that go on (modern) automobiles.</p>
<p>TBH, Ive never run into a stand-alone temp sensor for outside temperature and Ive seen it all. My guess is that its a basic thermistor located somewhere convenient - maybe even integrated into another, more important, sensor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had two cars with this setup, and the sensor has been located on the front fascia.  In one car it was on the driver's side, mounted in a cut-out on the bumper below the headlight. In a newer model, it was attached to the center right of the grill.</p>
<p>The sensor is reading the temperature of the air that the car is traveling through.  In some manuals, they'll even note that the temp reading won't be accurate (or updated) until the car has been traveling above a certain speed (in the case of the cars I drove, 40 MPH) for about a minute.</p>
<p>In summer months particularly, it's common for a car's temp sensor to read high, and then &quot;cool down&quot; as you start driving.  This can be because the sun was directly shining on a non-moving temp sensor, and/or the driveway or pavement the car is sitting on is radiating heat, affecting the reading.</p></div>		</li>
