			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat within planets can come from a few different sources. Earth, for example, is heated by two sources: radioactive deccay, and heat leftover from the formation of the planet. A lot of planets are likely heated in the same way. Planet formation produces a lot of heat as it's basically just smashing a lot of rocks together. It takes a long time for this heat to dissipate into space.</p>
<p>Planets and other objects could also be heated by tidal forces. For example, Io, one of Jupiter's moons, is heated by friction as it's shape constantly distorts due to Jupiter's gravity and it's elliptical orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat of a planet can be attributed to its proximity from a star or other body of heat and the core of the planet itself.</p>
<p>Edit: to answer your question on gravity, it is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by uneven distribution of mass. That’s why the planets, being such unique shapes, have varying degrees of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make your gravity answer a little simpler the more density something has, the more gravity. Example. Black holes are unfathomably dense, and have such high gravity light can’t even escape. Another example being Uranus has a lower gravity, while having 14.5 times more mass than earth. </p>
<p>There’s probably a more technical way of putting things in relation to mass/density to gravity but I don’t know that much about space. Plus the Uranus example could be an outlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The kinetic energy released during a planet's formation takes the form of heat which is largely retained.  The heat differences also cause certain parts of the planets interior to move around and convect, which creates more heat.  There is also the decay of radioactive materials within the Earth which creates heat.  This heat doesn't last forever and will continue to slowly dissipate as long as the Earth exists.</p>
<p>You are correct that energy can't be created or destroyed and the interiors of planets are no exception.  The gravitational energy being released as heat has always existed.  Before the Earth existed, it was stored as gravitational potential energy in the particles that would later become the Earth.  Ever since then, Earth has been slowly losing heat and, eventually, even planet cores will cool off.</p>
<p>EDIT: first sentence originally attributed the heat to pressure, which migmatitic below has pointed out is not a correct attribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pressure isn't the source of the energy. The energy initially exists as potential energy in a dust cloud. There is a potential relative to the center of mass. When that dust falls towards each other while forming a planet, it becomes kinetic energy. When the dust collides as the planet coalesces, the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy. A lot of the heat of our planet was this original residual heat from planetary formation.</p>
<p>But there's also a lot of radioactive materials in the core too--think about it, the densest stuff sinks to the bottom, and what's denser than uranium? So the radioactive decay produces a lot of heat--without uranium Earth would be solid or mostly solid by now, but the uranium decay keeps the mantle convecting and plate tectonics active... for now at least...</p></div>		</li>
