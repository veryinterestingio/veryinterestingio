			<div class="markdown"><p>Tarmac is used to refer to roads in other countries.  Language is weird.  In the US, we say canned food, in the UK, they say &quot;tinned food&quot; even though the cans aren't made of tin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Checking in for the UK. Much more likely to hear tarmac for a road than asphalt, very rarely hear asphalt. I had also never really considered tins not being made of tins. Beer cans are often called tinnies even though they are aluminium....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though in the US the can itself is still a &quot;tin can&quot;.  It is interesting how the English shortened it to &quot;tin&quot; and the US shortened it to &quot;can&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As u/BennyPendentes says, tarmac was originally a name for a road surfacing method.  The main surfacing method changed in the US, and local things started to be called by the new surfacing material, such as concrete.  But an airport has a unique surface of paving that is not found in any other situation, having vast amounts of paving, both for runways and parking spaces.  Everyday people (customers and staff) talk about planes that are at the airport, but currently not on the runway.  Since that conversation happens every single day, thousands of times a day, the word &quot;tarmac&quot; was kept in use as the name of the pavement.  Although &quot;tarmac&quot; used to be used for the entire vast amount of paving at the airport, when the plane is on the runway, we say it is on the runway, so tarmac began to refer only to when the plane is not on the runway.</p></div>		</li>
