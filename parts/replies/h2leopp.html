			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this in college for the football games. It was a lot of fun! There are many many cameras and you're lucky if the control room gets 2-3 good slow-mo shots from different camera angles.  I preferred getting crowd shots bc there wasn't so much pressure to keep your eye on the ball and we got some good shots of people just having fun. They usually will immediately go to a crowd shot or a shot of the coaches in anticipation of loading the replay video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I love that I can now watch NFL in HD, this also detracts so much of the game for me.  I used to play and really prefer the older style of filming from when i was a kid where they would show much more wide angle field shots.  I like watching the whole play and formation setting up, watching the play evolve, the defense reacting, the blocks downfield.  I really dont care about the QBs face when hes about to receive the  ball.  I want to see the macro plays.  They zoom in too much and make it such a production rather than allow the games mechanics to be shown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran a game cam for a hockey game once. I was second cam on the puck and crowd shots for the mega screen and I LOVED doing crowd shots. It was like &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; for me when the crowd was given different instructions (dance, wiggle, jump, etc) and of course the crowd is having fun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>crowd shots</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Australian cricket and football went through a phase where naked streakers were over represented on replays or live shots. They were then required to avoid showing any such nudity.</p>
<p>This would be the real challenge. Avoiding catching the nude streakers while still presenting something else that was eye catching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh. Look. A seagull on the opposite side of the field to the streaker...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens a lot in big football (soccer) matches. During the 2014 World Cup final, a Russian YouTuber streaked across the pitch and even tried to kiss one of the German players.</p>
<p>While this was going on, the broadcast feed very abruptly cut to a shot of the Cristo Redentor against a sunset. It was admittedly a pretty cool shot, but you can hear the commentators fumbling around trying to figure out what else to say about the shot while they drag the streaker out of the pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be a one-upper, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwmJ9O9_mLM" target="_blank">this video is far better at showing how live TV does it, taking F1 as an example</a>, because it also goes into the cross-country architecture of technology, and he does it in his usually eludicdating <em>Wendover</em>/<em>HAI</em> infotainment style</p>
<p>I'm not a big expert on football, but I've watched a few of the recent EURO2020 matches, and they said a couple of times that they have an analysis center somewhere in France where they closely examine sketchy or borderline situations, like foulplay in the penalty area, where miniscule movements mean the difference between a penalty or card (i.e. match deciding referee decisions). It's called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee" target="_blank">video assistant referee (VAR)</a>&quot;, a system introduced in steps in the 2010's, and finally implemented for the last world cup (3 years ago).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this on a video crew. We had 3-5 people working in a narrow closet. Whenever the door opened, it would smack the back of my chair. Like before we started doing the video stuff, it used to be storage for parking lot traffic cones and speed bumps or something.</p></div>		</li>
