<p>I was reading about how rice cookers work, and I could swear it said that steam, at sea level and not pressurized, can't get above 100.5 degrees Centigrade.  And this is how they work - they see the rice pot is getting above 100.5 degrees, know it can't be the steam (but instead the rice), and shut off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to your question is that the temperature steam can reach is generally dictated by the pressure it is at. In very low pressures or even vacuum, steam can form at extremely low temperatures. In very high pressures, water won't even boil at 100 C. So, in a sense, you are correct that steam won't reach above 100 C at sea level under normal circumstances. We heat the steam by restricting or containing it and it generates the pressure as a result of adding more heat (raising the temperature). </p>
<p>If you heat water to boiling and put a lid on, the steam will get hotter than 100 C because it generates its own pressure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, thanks. I guess i didn't think about what I consider to be the overall summary of your point - when we talk about heating steam, it's essentially implied that it's under some sort of pressure (contained), otherwise if it wasn't contained and subject to being under pressure it would just float away.</p></div>		</li>
