			<div class="markdown"><p>It throws me for a loop with some of my customers and their preferences. I work for a temperature monitoring company with temperature probes. </p>
<p>The customer will have all of their freezers and refrigerators monitored in Celsius but their room probes in Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Edit: Iâ€™ve been doing this job for over 15 years. I definitely prefer Celsius. You just have to jump in and use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? All the recipes we get in books and online are American so the oven is always in Ferenheit. But the weather forecast on the news is Celsius. Long distances in kilometres. Short distances in feet. Small weights in grams but heavier weights in pounds. Being Canadian is weird as hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Increasing the pressure increases the boiling point. Thatâ€™s why they bought one. </p>
<p>If you live at altitude and want to get water to 100^(o)C, then you can do so with a pressure cooker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nvm I misunderstood the context.</p>
<p>The person here lives way up in the skies that's why water boils at 94Â°C for him. Which is why he bought a pressure cooker.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who replied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. 121Â°C/250Â°F at 30 PSI. For many applications, you want that higher boiling point though, to keep moisture in.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, adding salt to water <em>barely</em> increases the boiling point. Ocean water only boils about 1Â° (either unit) hotter. The pressure though makes a big difference.</p></div>		</li>
