			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans drill anywhere they can find useful resources - we drill to look for/extract water, minerals, oil, gas, etc and also for geotechnical information (are there big crack systems below/above where we want to build something?). Or if scientists are lucky and get the grant money, for pure research!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We drill for things all the time. Any modern structure built (except maybe a single house on a small lot or something) will require drilling early on in the process. We use it for engineering purposes, research purposes, industrial purposes, etc. Keep in mind that deserts can vary wildly, they're not all Sahara's.</p></div>		</li>
