<p>What about the force causes the brain to lose consciousness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vasovagal  (VV) syncope is a reason for loss of consciousness, but not the mechanism with head injury. In VV syncope there is a depression of the heart rate and dilation of the blood vessels, which leads to a drop of blood pressure over at least several seconds. There can be different stimuli to trigger an episode, and activation of the carotid bodies (bundles of nerve cells located in the large arteries in the neck) can simulate this reaction. It takes about 6-8 seconds for loss of consciousness with absent blood flow to the brain. In head trauma, there is immediate loss of consciousness.  There are a few hypotheses, primarily centering around disturbed neurological function of the portion of the brain involved in maintaining consciousness called the reticular activation system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hate those; I'm especially prone to them.  I've got a scar on my septum from when I fainted while taking a piss and whacked my face on the rim of the toilet.  I've learned to recognise when the wrong nerves are getting tickled and to crouch low to the ground until the dizziness goes away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for you (and others) to know. This guy answer isn't exactly what you're looking for (and honestly I think it's a bit misleading). </p>
<p>Check the answer by u/Drteeth69r and others: the quick spin the head (and the effect it causes on the brain) is the major factor here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to when a car accelerates and you're pressed backward, fluid in the brain is also subject to momentum of the skull. Sudden forces can cause blood and synaptic molecules in suspension within neurons to move in ways that disrupt the bloodflow and synapses. Without consistent and stable oxygen provided by blood, and without charges from salts in synapses exchanging, the brain can become unable to maintain consciousness while emergency repairs are triggered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mouth guards are very much for dental protection. They don't do much of anything for brain injuries. While they were initially marketed to help, the forces are still transferred to the brain. Big thing is rotating the head and brain as you mentioned, which causes the brain to stretch (small amounts) enough to cause havoc (leading to symptoms such as knock out and other problematic things).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have a big bundle of nerves running through your jaw.  Without a mouth guard or with your mouth hanging open, a punch &quot;on the button&quot; is much more likely to knock your jaw to the side and impact those nerves.  Even if that doesn't trigger a knockout itself, it'll trigger jello-legs (official medical term), you'll probably drop your guard and act stupid, and promptly get knocked out by the next punch.</p></div>		</li>
