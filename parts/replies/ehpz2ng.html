			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that <em>most</em> debts are <em>not</em> the responsibility of heirs legally (in the U.S.) unless they've cosigned on it.  However, a lot of companies will try to get the heirs to agree take on the debt and if someone agrees to it, then they are responsible for it.  Bereaved/mourning people are vulnerable.  It's the social duty of friends/family to look out for the heirs and make sure that they don't get talked into taking on debts while vulnerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some states with filial responsibility laws (PA is the most notorious for this), some nursing home debts can become fully legally collectible from the children even if the kids never signed anything agreeing to be responsible for those debts. </p>
<p>Aside from that I’m not aware of any other examples. If the estate has collatoralized debts like mortgage or auto loans, you may have to agree to be liable for the debt if you want to take ownership of the property, though that’s obviously a bit different than somehow becoming liable for a debt you never agreed to in the first place. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell them to hire a lawyer.  The lawyer's fees are also usually a debt of the estate, rather than the administrator/executor.  (full disclosure: am a lawyer, my firm does probate work).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some debts though survive your death and can be passed on to your heirs. Debts like a mortgage for instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically they fall onto the estate. An estate including property is very rarely net negative value though, so normally it's worth it to take on the estate. If it is not, the heirs do not have to take on the debt, but they won't get any inheritance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming everything was above board (i.e. no fraud like was mentioned below) then that money now belongs to your son and the creditor can try to get back whatever they can from your estate.  </p>
<p>Creditors are not in the habit of giving out large unsecured loans however. The scenario you described just isn't very likely.</p></div>		</li>
