			<div class="markdown"><p>How does it treat something like .uk, .de, etc. Country specific ones? </p>
<p>With UK you also have things like .nhs.uk, .gov.uk, then for commercial you get .co.uk </p>
<p>Does it give preference to any type of .UK domain if the user is searching from the UK or does it still prefer .com, I guess .com is generic so it would still be favourable though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Search engines look at your IP and the languages your browser uses to make a guess at your location, and then try to give you the most recent results. If most people who search for &quot;beer&quot; in the UK end up going to beer.co.uk, then that's at the top of the list. If most people go to guinness.com, then that one shows at the top. </p>
<p>That's kind of small eli5 about how searches work. They record which results are the most clicked, and put them at the top of the list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the above poster has said, Google tends to favour tld's with more &quot;authority&quot;. So a few years back this meant that in the UK, a .uk or a .com were generally the two with the most authority.</p>
<p>But Google also responds and updates to trends. So when tech startups started using .io and .co started being used more too, Google started giving these tld's more authority as more &quot;legit&quot; sites used them. </p>
<p>Nowerdays, with a tonne of newer tld's like .media etc, its less of a factor in rankings. Also remember that tld is just one small aspect of how a site ranks in Google. All Google really cares about is if the site is relevant to the person searching. </p>
<p>On your question of other countries such as how .de is treated in UK Google - again its the same as above. Its super rare for a .de to have relevant content for a UK visitor, so from Google's POV chances are it's not going to be useful to a UK visitor. A com or a co.uk is more favourable.</p>
<p>But also, most .de sites are in German. So if you search for &quot;red shoes&quot; chances are that you won't find a German site with that phrase in. They would have &quot;rote Schuhe&quot; in their content instead, which wouldn't come up in your search results anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the closest eli5 answer I’ve read so far. I know we’ve strayed so far from the original concept of eli5 we can’t go back, but, I always appreciate when someone actually dumbs it down. Take my updoot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple TLDs blocked entirely in pihole because I've seen them used <em>so often</em> for phishing/malicious content and basically never seen them used legitimately. Reputation isn't just for SEO anymore!</p></div>		</li>
