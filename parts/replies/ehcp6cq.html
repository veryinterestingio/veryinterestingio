			<div class="markdown"><p>They make special mattress covers. They essentially slip on like a pillow case and then zip up. The zipper has a plastic lock that keeps them from getting out through that hole. So it’s really not that different from sleeping on a mattress with a normal mattress protector. You just put your sheets over it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not super wise to outright replace the mattress. All it takes is one of 'em to have laid an egg on your clothes and they're back again.</p>
<p>So yeah, you bag up the mattress and wait until you think they're dead, then you wait twice that long. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Malaysia for about two years. One of the apartments that I stayed in ended up getting an infestation and we ended up having to douse most of the place in this really nasty poison. Ultimately it worked out... </p>
<p>Prior to realizing we had an infestation however, I had sent a package back to the States with some beautiful carved hardwood items and some scarfs/clothing items... packaged with super cheap pillows and rags/cloths that had been floating around the apartment. </p>
<p>My friend and her family were also the lucky recipients of some Malaysian bedbugs. They spent months getting them cleared out. </p></div>		</li>

Unfortunately all these bowls of water proved attractive to mosquitos carrying malaria and yellow fever... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t listen to this guy, what you need to do is get a large dish, big enough to put your bed in (alternately, get a bed small enough to put in a medium to large dish), and <em>then</em> put your head in a bed of water and lay on the dishes. It’s simplicity in itself. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;They're easy to get rid of, just do this weird shit to your bed that nobody has ever done or move out of your house for a year. Simple.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not easy to get rid of. When my daughter was about six months old I saw a bug in her pack and play crib thing and smashed it and it popped like a grape, that was the beginning.</p>
<p>I found them everywhere that day. It took 2 years and a new apartment to finally be rid of them. We washed and double dried and then vacuum sealed every piece of clothing and bedding we thought we wouldn't need for a year. And then kept it all vacuum sealed because we couldn't get rid of them that first year.</p>
<p>Threw away all beds, and both couches. Sat on the floor and slept on an air mattress for six months. A month prior to moving we reduced all clothing to only 2 weeks worth. The rest went into vacuum bags. Did laundry literally the last day at the old apartment so the only clothes that were exposed were on our backs. </p>
<p>Moved everything into the garage of the new place didn't even go inside with old clothes on. The clothes we wore at the old apartment the day of the move got thrown out. It was hell but we are free of them.</p>
<p>P.S. spray them with rubbing alcohol and watch them shrivel and die. You then realize the bugs have driven you insane.</p></div>		</li>
