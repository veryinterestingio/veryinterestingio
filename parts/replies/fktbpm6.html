<p>If the blood collects into a pool within the body, this will not get broken down, this is called a haematoma and requires draining.</p>

<p>I thought bruises are a type of haematoma?</p>
<p>Bruises...don't require draining?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hematoma is a blood mass (haima: blood, -oma: mass) So yes bruises are hematomas, but hematomas are not limited to bruises. </p>
<p>Surgical procedures can cause hematomas which need to be drained. </p>
<p>Also,  if you smash your finger, blood may pool under your nail. You don't have to drain it,  but doing so will relieve the pressure thus easing the pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of how much blood there is and what the effect is on surrounding tissues. Macrophages are good, but they can only eat so much and there aren't infinite amounts of them (they get replaced, but also only at a certain rate).</p>
<p>A big amount of blood puts pressure on everything around it, usually things are elastic and can expand a bit, but also only so much, and then the pressure will cause further damage, that again has to be cleaned up by a system that is already overworked. Some areas of the body can't expand very far. Typical would be a large hematoma deep in the calf. The fascia are tightly wrapped around the muscles and hard. If the pressure isn't released the muscles die (the debris from that is really bad for the kidneys) ETA: do yourself a favor and don't look up compartment syndrome, the intervention for that looks grisly. In other areas even a little damage has big consequences, some tissues are more vulnerable than others. Blood clots can rip off and spread in the blood stream, causing potentially life-threatening thromboses. If bacteria get into the hematoma it's a lovely place for them to multiply quickly, and without the immune system having a chance to intervene. Not even antibiotics will help because they can't penetrate deep into the hematoma in high enough concentrations either.</p>
<p>All reasons to drain the thing and make life easier on the natural healing services of the body. But smaller hematoma are no big deal, they just hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t all have to be drained but the majority benefit from it and experience less complications, such as delayed wound healing or additional wound formation, if they are drained. The tissue death and eschar formation common following a large hematoma result in a large and often disfiguring wound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if you're a Dr and if so where you practice but UK practice is generally not to drain them automatically. Depends on size, where they are and how painful/whether causing compression/whether affecting a wound I agree but as a GP I have seen majority of patients with haematoma not have them drained after assessment by surgeons and then heal fine.</p></div>		</li>
