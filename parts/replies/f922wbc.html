			<div class="markdown"><p>You dont get fined, you get taken to court first, where no jury or judge would ever find the content creator guilty. No youtuber is ever going to have to pay 42k per video unless they really are trying to target children.</p>
<p>It’s a non issue.</p>
<p>The video would have to be manually reviewed by a human in court, before that kind of fine could be levied, where the case would be dismissed immediately as ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure you get fined first, like getting a ticket for speeding.</p>
<p>You can either pay it, suffer concequences or fight it which will be very costly and fightimg the government for something you don't neccesarily understand if you like many content creators don't make twice that a yr &amp; it's per video..</p>
<p>You're not going to fight it, but you also can't pay it plus lets be honest you did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>This will be the end of YouTube, as I could see viewership going down significantly if the content people are looking for just isn't there.</p>
<p>Make up channels &amp; political content will probably reign supreme.</p>

<p>Let's be real, there is no shortage of crafty kids,  bad kids who run rampant on the internet,  and parents who are too clueless or careless to give a damn.... it was going to happen regardless</p>
<p>The problem was that they ADMITTED to doing it,  they got caught red handed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think regardless what you mark it for if you say it's not for kids but you're making content about High School DxD which is an Anime, they could claim you're targeted children or whatever the fuck.</p>
<p>Basically that you lied when you said your content wasn't for kids &amp; come the fuck after you.</p>
<p>just know that this is the end of YouTube as we know it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YouTube handled the issue by saying they were going to have each YouTube report per channel or video whether their content was for kids or not. Then they'd use an AI to determine whether or not the video was actually for kids. If you say it's not for kids, and YouTube says it is, and they've gathered information and targeted ads on/to users from your video and they shouldn't have been, you were responsible for flagging yourself as kid targeting content or not, so YouTube says you are responsible for the fines.</p>
<p>It's... Bullshit. Especially because YouTube's AI is garbage at detecting kid targeting content. It false flags things as kids content constantly that it shouldn't.</p>
<p>The ethics of playing pass the buck where YouTube says it's the creators that are responsible and then falsely accusing those users of making YouTube do something illegal aside, YouTube is also now flagging content for kids that should <em>not</em> be showing up for kids. The point of the law is to protect kids from bad things... So YouTube's response is an AI to flag content inappropriate for kids as kids content which they could now be exposed to...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that part I just don't see how violating YouTube's terms makes you legally culpable for the data collection violation. I mean I suppose the rationalization could be that by labeling your video as not for kids you are facilitating data collection, therefore by mislabeling it as not for kids you are actively putting them into a situation in which they will have data collected; but that presupposes that you did it intentionally and also knew YouTube would collect data that violates COPPA. It's like a bar serving to a minor then saying &quot;well his friends brought him in here so it's their fault.&quot; </p>
<p>But whatever, not like anything else big tech + politics does makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
