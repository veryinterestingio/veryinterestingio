<p>(“Collide” cus I’ve heard the space between stars in the Milky Way and andromeda galaxy are so far apart they wouldn’t really affect each other)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of the expansion of the universe can be measured by something called the &quot;Hubble Constant,&quot; which is 70 (km/s)/Megaparsec. This means that two objects which are a Megaparsec (\~3.25 million light years) apart are &quot;moving away from each other&quot; at a speed of 70 km/s (and the Andromeda galaxy happens to be approximately a Megaparsec away from the Milky Way). This speed just isn't significant enough to overshadow the other speeds apparent in the universe (consider that the Earth orbits the sun at around 30 km/s, and the Solar System is orbiting the center of the galaxy at around 230 km/s).</p>
<p>EDIT: According to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2014/03/24/scientists-predict-our-galaxys-death/" target="_blank">this article by National Geographic</a>, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are moving towards each other at 402,000 km/h, or about 111 km/s, several times greater than the speed of the expansion between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, the likely conclusion so far (please dont get mad at me if I get this wildly wrong, I dont proclaim to be an expert whatsoever) is that the universe we experience is actually a projection onto a 4-dimensional sphere. If you traveled in a perfectly straight direction from the Earth without stopping, you would eventually wind up right back where you started. Just like flying around the Earth in 3D space.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Another guy used an expanding balloon as an analogy that I think sums up this idea perfectly as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe is finite then I agree that that is likely the explanation, but there doesn't seem to be a consensus as to whether the universe is finite or infinite based on what I read on Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because we cannot observe space beyond the edge of the observable  universe, it is unknown whether the size of the universe in its totality  is finite or infinite.</p>
