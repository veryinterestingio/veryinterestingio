<p>The correlational evidence for humans that protection (partial or not) is lifetime is also good.  This is why older, immuno-competent people are also the least likely to suffer from influenza.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe the old had partial immunity due to a previous seasonal flus with some similarity to the 1919 pandemic strain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immunity for the virus strains your are inoculated against stay viable for a LONG time (potentially decades), but the problem is that the influenza virus mutates very rapidly. It's the only reason it has been able to stay in circulation so long. You can look up the composition of the flu shot for a given year and compare it to the prior year. If the composition hasn't changed (which is sometimes the case), you can probably skip your flu shot. The booster will increase your antibody count though in the same way that they give you two identical shots for Hepatitis A with a time gap between them. Generally though, the viruses in circulation change all the time. So, you might have one or two of the strains be the same as last year, but the other one or two (if you get the quad) will be new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This varies by virus family. Some antibodies provide lifetime immunity (like specific influenza subtypes), others wane after decades, and some (like the cold-type viruses in the corona family) only stay maximally effective for eight months or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's late out the gate but here's a response to your response:</p>
<p>Influenza virus is unique in that it has two ways to mutate. Other viruses go though something called &quot;Genetic drift&quot;, which is essentially the normal mutation through random factors that sometimes results in a beneficial (to the virus) increase in virulence factors.<br />
Influenza also has something called &quot;Genetic shift&quot; which happens when two different influenza viruses infect the same cell, and get their specially segmented genomes mixed up inside the host. The viruses that exit have a random selection of these genome segments. This is why you have things like &quot;H1N1, H5N1, H3N2&quot;. They are just shuffled genomes of the same virus.</p>
<p>This is also the reason that there is a yearly vaccine - to defend against genetic shift. This is not to say though, that genetic drift does not also occur at the same time, which contributes to a less effective vaccine over time due to random mutations.</p>
<p>To conclude, when you get vaccinated there is a decent chance that that vaccine will be effective against that specific subtype of influenza virus (e.g. H1N1) but over time the probability of the immunity still maintaining effectiveness will decrease due to random mutations (genetic drift).</p>

<p>In other words I've gotten the flu shot for the last 15 years, does that mean I have better overall flu protection than someone who is just gotten the flu shot for the first time this year?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but more because you have flu protection from multiple flu times.  The flu vaccine is really a vaccine for a handful of the most common and expected strains that year.  It is like opening packs of collectible cards, sometimes you get duplicates, but you still keep picking up new cards and growing your collection.  They are always adding new cards too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a bad analogy. Especially if you consider that Mr Fastskimmer might end up missing every keyword relevant to the exam questions, especially if he skimmed the notes from another teacher’s class. But it’s still worth a try because it can’t hurt and will most likely help a little.</p></div>		</li>
