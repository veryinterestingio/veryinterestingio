			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something about that the sweeteners trick your body into releasing insulin when there is actually no sugar to be neutralized, so it teaches your body not to use insulin properly over time. Could be bullshit, but I read it so it HAS to be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc that was something that found in lab animals, but it did not affect humans the same way. This was from some reading I did a few years ago, who knows if it is accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there were a bunch of headlines about it a few years back. I looked up the study and it turned out that to get their feeble effect size they needed to feed the animals so much aspartame that it worked out to like a kilogram per day if you scaled up the amounts to human size. Not a kilogram of diet coke, mind you -- a kilogram of aspartame. Even so, the effect was still feeble. If there was evidence that aspartame causes diabetes, the study the press got all excited about wasn't it.</p></div>		</li>
