			<div class="markdown"><p>Receptor adaptation usually mostly recovers in about 2 days, 1 week or so to be fully gone. This is the same for most drug types, also Heroin for example. If you're leaving the stimulant for 2-3 days, there's no physical addiction left. Mind you, physical and psychological addiction are way different. I need my coffee not only for the caffeine but also because I'm used to it ;)</p>

Including the secondary effects of caffeine consumption. (Hence shaky hands probably relating to blood sugar or even exhaustion.)</p></div>		</li>
