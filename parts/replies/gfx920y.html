			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I have also seen some similar theories. The SARS-CoV2 virus has many proteins (I think 30, but Dr. Menachery can correct me if I am wrong). Many of the vaccines only contain one protein from this virus (the Spike protein) or the instructions for making the Spike protein. Some of the other proteins are thought to be responsible for altering/inhibiting your immune response, which may lead to the autoimmune reactions related to long-term COVID. Since the vaccines don't contain those additional proteins, they should not lead to the same problems. I assume that we will know if the vaccines prevent long-haul effects as the trial participants are followed further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens then with those vaccines (which aren't the ones being approved by the FDA so far, but they are also in development) which use the inactivated virus, presumably with all its proteins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a tougher question. The inactivated vaccines are not able to replicate, so whatever small amount of those proteins is injected won't be amplified (as would happen in a live-attenuated vaccine). You are correct that it could be a theoretical risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Barker - long-hauler here. </p>
<p>I'm curious if there is likely to be any metric that will identify whether long-haul symptoms are addressed by vaccines, or simply resolve on their own?</p>
<p>It's a bit of a semantic point, honestly I ask as I'm at that point where I'm starting to wonder whether &quot;long-haul&quot; means &quot;permanent haul&quot; or if we have any precedent to recognize whether the body learns to overcome the kind of response you describe, over time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t the same spike protein in other corona viruses also? If the spike protein were the culprit wouldn’t the more benign coronaviruses cause autoimmune issues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a question I have. Am talking to immunology colleagues and people who better understand autoimmunity, hypersensitivity, etc. Long-hauler syndrome effects and the wide range of COVID-19 effects bring concern for what happens not only in infection, but also multiple virus infection challenge of a body with a highly boosted immune response to S attachment protein of CoV-2. Wish we knew...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as someone suffering from long haul covid, where can i read more about autoimmunity in regards to long haul effects? sounds really interesting....</p></div>		</li>
