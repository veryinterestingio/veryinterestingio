			<div class="markdown"><p>It is and it isn't. It's a 'closed-loop' system in the fact that capillaries connect arteries to veins. The blood doesn't just go to the end of an arterial capillary and then magically end up in a vein capillary. It's just not the closed-loop that most people envision having arteries connected to veins directly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s all closed, to prevent all the stuff floating loosey-goosey inside your body. There’s just so many connections that it allows for the blood to have more than one option.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those diagrams almost everyone has seen in school are over simplified rubbish.</p>

<p>Why are they rubbish? Its a simple way of showing and for people to understand. Most people are really dumb and dont get these concepts at all even when explained, doing it this way ensures everyone understands the baseline and the details (like this thread) dont matter to 90% of people.</p>
<p>Its simplified yes, not trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The diagrams are there to teach how the circulatory system in the human body works for science classes, If you look through ELI5 and other similar question sources people asking similar questions to the OP are remarkably common and almost always boil down to that old over used incorrect diagram. If the diagram is consistently failing to do what it is supposed to do I would class it as rubbish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is not failing to do what its supposed to do, its a simple explanation that gets the point across and people remember it. Its not perfect, and its not complete its just a diagram, its whole idea its with the least info possible make people remember it.</p></div>		</li>
