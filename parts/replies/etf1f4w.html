			<div class="markdown"><p>For reader clarification, &quot;positive feedback&quot; does not mean &quot;a good thing&quot;. It means, the effects of an original change initiates more of the same change. So warming of the permafrost releases global warming gases, causing more warming, releasing more gases, more warming, more gases more.... You get it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why you see the colloquial terms &quot;vicious cycle&quot; and &quot;virtuous cycle&quot; in use, partially supplanting the use of &quot;positive feedback&quot;. Using those terms also adds a subjective connotation to the discussion - scientific writing makes it a point to remain as dispassionate as possible.</p>
<p>And we are now seeing the effects of that decision - people are not spurred to dramatic action by facts alone. To the extent there's any positive impact of anthropogenic climate change (oh look, the Northwest Passage is actually a thing) it's dwarfed by the negative repercussions (oh look, huge swaths of the planet are basically uninhabitable). I don't think it's a coincidence that people are finally agitating for significant change around the same time that science writers (at least in mass reporting) are starting to freak out.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>out of curiosity, where are you talking about? what places are uninhabitable due to climate change?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally think science needs to start being less dispassionate when discussing climate change because right now theyâ€™ve been mostly ignored for the past 50 years in terms of actually provoking climate preserving actions.  Perhaps we actually do need a few reports that discuss the higher end of warming projections in more graphic terms so that people understand that drastic change is necessary to keep even a remote chance of such devastation at bay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I will add to this.  Yes there is a lot of methane locked up in the permafrost as clathrates.  There's also a lot of organic carbon that will decompose to methane once it gets warm enough for bacterial action to take over.</p>
<p>But there's also a lot of bacteria that like to eat methane.</p>
<p>No one is certain if the rate of methane release will be faster than the rate of methane conversion by bacteria.  That's another wild card.  Once the methane is released/produced, will it make it to the upper atmosphere or will it be consumed/converted by bacteria?</p>
<p>If it's broken down by bacteria they will convert it to carbon dioxide which, while still a greenhouse gas, isn't nearly as powerful a greenhouse gas as methane.</p></div>		</li>
