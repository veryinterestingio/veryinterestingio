			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass does not increase, this is a common misconception. In SR mass is invariant, being the Lorentz   norm of the 4-momentum, all inertial frames measure the same mass for a given particle.</p>
<p>The origin of this misconception is (I assume) an attempt at making classical sense of the form of the spatial components of relativistic momentum.</p>
<p>That is to make it look more familiar to the classical p=mv</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, if I was talking about invariant mass only but relativistic mass is equivalent to relativistic energy and that does in fact increase. It seemed like a fair simplification to me.</p></div>		</li>

<li>The acceleration is 2x6.5 TeV, the two beams are accelerated at the same time.</li>
<li>Linac2 is no more, Linac4 produces H- ions @ 160 MeV, 25 mA</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Linac2 was decommissioned and dismantled a year ago. The new one is ready and is producing nominal beams. We're now tuning it :) And it's true, probably some webpages are still not up-to-date.</p></div>		</li>
