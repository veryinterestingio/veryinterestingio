			<div class="markdown"><p>Its cleaner yet somehow I'm allergic as fuck to it. I fractured 2 goddamn ribs today from unstoppable, uncontrollable, coughing fits. This is the second time I've fractured my ribs from my cold induced coughing. First time was a few years back. This sucks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me either until it happened the first time. After 5 or 6 different doctors looked at me and thought I was faking it I finally got sent to another (much better) pulmonologist they determined I fractured my ribs. She didn't even have me all the way seated when she told me I gave &quot;cough variant asthma&quot;. Its asthma only I can breathe just fine save for the out of control coughing. For me it is brought on by winter air, or even just being cold for too long in general. </p>
<p>When I saw her I couldn't hear, or breathe through my nose because my face was so swollen from 6 straight weeks of coughing. It fucks up everything about my day to day life. Even now with medication I can still cough so much I feel like I'm going to pass out from lack of oxygen. And apparently enough to fracture my ribs <em>again</em>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're probably burning more fuel in the winter, so of course you'd smell it more. Diesel isn't one of the types of things I described that would be affected by the cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who is they? 18-wheeler trucks? Do they really burn <em>that</em> much more fuel in the winter?</p>
<p>Nobody around here burns any kind of liquid fuel for domestic purposes, everything is either electric or natural gas.</p></div>		</li>
