			<div class="markdown"><p>The part about having to be labelled to including their entire contents is amazing. I've been complaining about this forever.</p>
<p>7 portions sizes in a meal meant for 1 so you need to spend an extra hour with a calculator out shopping if you're trying to find things in a certain calorie range. It's pretty obviously misleading.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Small item of whatever size that contains a total of 9 grams of fat.</p>
<p>Servings per container: 10.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Since 9/10 = 0.9 and 0.9 is less than 1 so we can round down too...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Portion size is so important. I was super morbidly obese. And I can’t tell you the time when I said things like “all I ate today was that little pizza” “my blood sugar is low I need a candy” “appetizers don’t count” my all time favorite “it’s a salad and ranch isn’t fattening”. </p>
<p>I got a gastric bypass at 36 went from 5’3 450 to 225 probably after this covid I’ll probably be a bit more. While counting calories because you have to prove you can lose weight before surgery. I was shocked and starving. I now eat out of an ice cream dish like those sauce ramekins. Portions are important but the labels are so confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in the Food Industry for about 5 years in California. Most food scientist graduates come from Cal Poly SLO and UC Davis, if you want to go down the nutritionist route, Berkeley and SFSU have decent programs. After graduating, there's a CFS degree that some people go for that's like a &quot;certification&quot; for people in the food industry. But depending where you live, you can go into many industries such as any food product you see on the shelf has a quality and R&amp;D team behind it. Agriculture industry is huge in rural areas, and R&amp;D companies flourish in the urban areas. The food industry has some cool niches (beer, milk, sport nutrition, dietary supplement) as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re best bet is a college that offers food science majors. Most large colleges have the major if they have a agricultural program. In the Midwest, Purdue, Iowa state, Nebraska, Minnesota and Wisconsin all have good programs. </p>
<p>For after college, the most common jobs are in R&amp;D labs and as quality supervisor for food production companies. The best part about this is that there jobs anywhere in the country and it’s easy enough to find a job after college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the comment below said, your best bet is a food science program (of which there are plenty off) but don't feel like that is the ONLY route. </p>
<p>I went to college for chemistry and psychology and now I'm working as a food scientist so I took a weird route but you do a lot of on the job learning and just need to have a drive to learn and be curious. If you have any specific questions, I can definitely try and answer them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend that went to UMass Amherst and majored in food sciences with a minor in chemistry. She works for a company that develops specialty foods for people with dietary restrictions, basically coming up with different ways to make foods that can't have certain ingredients taste and feel like the real thing (milk substitutes, low sugar, vegan products, etc). She works a lot with nutritionists and professional chefs to develop these products and says its a surprisingly large industry especially with more and more people aging and requiring dietary specialties. </p>
<p>I have another friend that went to UMass Boston for microbiology, he was a junior brewer and is now going for his master's with a concentration in brewery sciences down south.  He said that's a common path for people in the brewing industry unless you have more practical (self-taught home-brew experience with a business background) and of course depending on your region, you can focus on beer, wine, liquor distilling, cider, industrial methanol, etc production. </p>
<p>I myself took an intro to food science class in college - probably my top 1 or 2 favorite elective that I took! I didn't know it was really a program but had I known, I might have considered it for a major.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist, just a redditor, but most foods are good past their expiration date. My wife and I shop at a discount grocery where most things are at, near, or past expiration and they're fine mostly... dry foods are good for a long time but may loose some characteristics (softer potato chips for example) but even dairy is usually good. Meats we freeze right when we get home and they stay good longer that way. If it doesn't have visible mold and looks, smells, and tastes like it's supposed to, it's most likely fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Use By, Best By, Best Before, etc.... all of these dates are arbitrary and set by the manufacturer as the time frame for which their food product maintains its best quality. It’s not about food safety (i.e. when the food will spoil and cause infection or intoxication). This makes sense because manufacturers would want consumers to eat the food at its peak quality — best flavor, texture, quality — and thereby encourage them to continue to purchase more of that product. Per FDA, the only food item that has a real, true expiration date is infant formula. This is given a Use By/Before date because that is the date at which the nutrients in the infant formula, in its water-to-formula mix ratio, will start diminishing and no longer be true to the nutrition facts claims on its label. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all that you said, with the exception of the word &quot;arbitrary&quot;.  On new or reformulated products most of these dates are set through shelf life studies, with trained panels evaluating the product at regular intervals to determine the optimum shelf life.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually extremely conservative, where I live we have a saying translated roughly as 'best before, not deadly after'. Most foods will hold a while longer than the expiration (or show clear signs of going bad like smell/mold).</p></div>		</li>
