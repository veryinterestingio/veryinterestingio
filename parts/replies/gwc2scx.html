<p>Years ago, I was in a roll over wreck in which shattered glass pieces embedded into my scalp.  Even after 20 years, on occasion I will scratch my head, hear a pop, and a small piece of glass will come out.  My wife hates it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this.  I was smushed against my driver's side window in a truck roll and for years I had a small, enlarged spot on one eyebrow that didn't grow hair.  One day I felt something hard against my fingernail.  I went to the doctor and he said he felt something in there but it was so close to my eye he didn't feel comfortable.  One of the other doctors in the office overheard and came over- a short dumpling of a woman in her 70s- grabbed my head and tilted it up, pushed on my eyebrow and moved whatever was in there around with her finger, and said, &quot;I'll get it&quot; and told me this might hurt.  I told her to go for it and clamped my eyes shut.  She squeezed and I felt immediate relief as blood ran down my face.  She had pushed it out and opened up the scar tissue with her fingers, something the other doctor in his prime was afraid to do.  </p>
<p>I kept that piece of auto glass in a tiny bottle but since getting married and family and moves I've probably lost it.  But I kept it for years, that little reminder that I survived some nastiness and kept on going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy.
I caught my hand in a printing press about 1983 and mangled my left middle and ring fingers. The doctor was able to fix my fingers so they work and look normal at first glance (guitar playing days over sadly). My middle finger nail still grows in 4 separate slices.
Anyway sometimes I feel like I have a sliver on the side on my finger near the joint. Drove me nuts for years because I would dig out something kinda clear.
Finally figured it out a few years ago. There was a piece of nail bed that got pushed down into my finger and it grows this little strip about half a millimeter wide out the side of my finger. I have to trim it with clippers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve pruned a lot of roses in my lifetime.  Apparently I got a thorn stuck in my knee pit ( behind knee) that I never noticed.<br />
One day I saw a weird brown blob on the front of my knee next to my kneecap. I’m a little obsessive so I poked it with a needle. Out came brown goo and a bleached out thorn.  Not sure why the color got sucked out. Really freaked me out to think it traveled through my leg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried climbing a palm tree while drunk. What I didn't realize was that the &quot;fur-looking&quot; stuff around the bottom was some kind of defense mechanism and as I inevitably slid down my hands got embedded with splinters. I counted 102. </p>
<p>Im glad I took the time the next day (after questioning my voices) to pluck them all out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me. I picked up some rough lumber and was putting it in the back of my van with bare hands. The far end of it hit something  and my hand slid up a couple of inches, driving a big splinter into my finger. Fuck it hurt. I tried to grab the end with my teeth and pull it out but the end broke off. I drove home with a throbbing finger. Attempts to remove it with tweezers failed. I couldn't just cut the skin because it was too deep. Over the next few days the pain went away but there was still a small hole where it had gone in. I was forever squeezing the finger but nothing happened.  One evening I'm sitting watching TV and I squeeze my finger. The full splinter shoots out the hole like a mini switchblade. No pain just a bit of shock at what had happened. I pulled the last mm or so of the splinter out. The hole healed up after that</p></div>		</li>
