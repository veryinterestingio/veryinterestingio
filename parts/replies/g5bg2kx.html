			<div class="markdown"><p>If you mean express them as actual complete viruses, then probably not.  As the Johnson 2019 paper mentions, the majority of human endogenous retroviruses represent ancient integration events, and these viruses are most likely extinct now.  Though there are exceptions of course; HIV is a retrovirus that is quite capable of combining its DNA with ours, and is obviously still active.  However, just because they aren't active as viruses anymore, doesn't mean they are totally silent.  Several genes derived from endogenous retroviruses are active at least some of the time, including during the very earliest stages of embryonic development (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4503379/" target="_blank">Grow et al. 2015</a>).  And many such genes have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases as well (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6235/" target="_blank">Blomberg et al. 2013</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>woooof. Biologist here, but i mostly deal with amniotes and not entomology. You officially blew my mind and I'm looking forward to sitting down with the reading material you've provided.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p></div>		</li>
