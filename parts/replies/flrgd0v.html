			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so interesting. I’d love to know more. So he was only able to gesture? He couldn’t learn actual sign language like ASL? Could he read or write? As a speech pathologist, I’d love to know where the break down was. Like, was it only motor planning, or were his actual expressive language abilities impaired? It sounds like receptive language was intact. Was this an otherwise cognitively typical person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably broca's area, you can find vids on youtube of people learning to speak again after this type of brain injury. Its one of two area's that can cause distorted speech, and the most frustrating of the two because the people know exactly what they want to say but its like their body doesnt want to obey them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brocas area controls speech and Wernickes area controls mathematical calculation so maybe also the names of numbers. I had brain surgery between those areas and I lost most of my nouns. I knew the people visiting me were my roommates from college but I had to say “I...know you...are MY friends, But I ..don’t ..KNOW...your NAmes...” I cried a little bit and they all turned red and told me their names. It was so sad. Then I would save things until my best friend/roommate came at lunch time, and hold things up for her to name. Fork. Spoon. Knife. U-TEN-sils. It was very frustrating, and even after people thought I was better, I mostly just strung together SAT words - words that I had memorized in the past few years- rather than more basic English words. Native language is stored i. the left side of the brain, memorized language takes a while to move over from the right side to the left. </p>
<p>Weirdest thing was, my boss walked in while I was trying to talk to the doctors in very VERY halting english, and he greeted me in Japanese. I answered him easily and fluently. The doctor was so excited. The next day there were like 20 medical students around my bed. And he billed me $600.</p></div>		</li>
