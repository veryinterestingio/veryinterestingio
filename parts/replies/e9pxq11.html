			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there's always rock if you go deep enough, but &quot;deep enough&quot; can range from inches to hundreds of feet.  The surface of the bedrock can be pretty bumpy and in fact there may be weathered  loose chunks embedded in the soil layer right above the surface.  Or it can be smoother.  It really just depends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in Bellevue it's smooth river rocks (Bellevue area is rivers and marshlands) I never got far enough down to hit a purely stone layer but given there's no volcanic activity nearby I'd say the area is mostly sedementary stone, but again if you want to know about your area you need to be willing to put in the research. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, wind and rain erode the rocks into little grains. That gives you sand and clay. Then plants grow in it and die and decompose (get eaten by bacteria, fungus, and animals and pooped out). That gives you all the other brown crap. Dirt is all of that mixed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I grew up in middle Tennessee we had about 5 or 6 inches of dirt and below that it pretty much turned into rocky red clay. Digging holes sucked. Where I live now in a different part of the area there is a little more soil but I'm not sure how much as I've still not gone down much more than a foot or so.</p></div>		</li>
