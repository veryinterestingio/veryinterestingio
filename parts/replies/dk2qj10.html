<p>One of my questions would be, do these fonts need to be relatively large for readability? Just looking at some of the more complicated (to my untrained eye) characters, such as this one [?] in another answer, it seems to me like it'd be incredibly difficult to distinguish it from another similar character at that size. </p>
<p>Likewise, would you say that Chinese writing is significantly more compact than English?  My understanding is that each character usually denotes a single specific word, so I'd think it follows that a single sentence might only take up something like 10 characters.

<p>There are two things that help alleviate this problem. The first is that, once you are familiar with the language, you can recognize characters by their general shape, rather than having to look at all the little details.</p>
<p>In English we actually do something similar, even if you don't know it. When you read a sentence (like this one), you don't read it letter-by-letter. You're trained to recognize entire words at once.</p>
<p>The second thing that helps is: context. A character is commonly used as part of a multi-character compound. For example, 憂鬱 is a single word (&quot;melancholy&quot;), consisting of two characters. If I see &quot;憂&quot;, followed by a big messy blob of strokes, then I'll know that it must be 憂鬱 even without actually interpreting the latter character (鬱). And on a higher level, if I'm reading a word as part of a sentence, then just by reading the sentence I'll generally know what word to expect (more context).</p>

<p>It's a complicated subject, but I would say in general that Japanese can be more compact than English. And Chinese in turn can be more compact than Japanese. </p>
<p>In Chinese, a single character is equivalent to a syllable. Some argue that each character/syllable represents a word. And in the past this may have been true, but for modern Chinese it does not really hold (Google &quot;The Monosyllabic Myth&quot; if you're interested to know more). In modern Chinese, many words consist of multiple characters (often two). For example, 電腦 is a single word meaning &quot;computer&quot;. It consists of two characters: electricity (電) + brain (腦).</p>
<p>So, imagine if you were to map English to Chinese by replacing each English syllable with a Chinese character. That would come pretty close to the compactness of Chinese. This ignores the fact that an English sentence and an equivalent Chinese sentence do not always have the same amount of syllables, but whatever.</p>
<p>Japanese is a bit different. It uses a mix of character sets. A Japanese sentence will contain some Chinese characters, but it will also contain phonetic characters (kana). In Japanese, a single character does not always correspond to a syllable (as an extreme example, the character 志 may be read &quot;kokorozashi&quot;, clearly not one syllable). In general though it will be somewhere between English and Chinese in compactness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer! Definitely cleared up some of my misconceptions about these languages!</p>
<p>And how the brain recognizes words is a very good point I didn't consider.  There's some very cool research out there about the way the brain is able to identify individual words based on the general length and shape of the word and its constituent characters</p></div>		</li>

<p>Generally I would say yes. CJK fonts (especially Chinese / Japanese) need to be a little bit bigger than Latin-based language designers tend to set text. Microsoft's guidelines for font text-size a few years ago recommended CJK text be set a couple points larger than the Latin recommendation (these have since aligned at a larger size). </p>
<p>Also worth noting that CJK characters tend to be &quot;larger&quot; than Latin characters in the same font. So that also helps. </p>

<p>The lame answer is that &quot;it depends&quot;. I have this neat little book called &quot;<a href="http://stbridelibrary.bigcartel.com/product/typographia-polyglotta" target="_blank">Typographia polyglotta</a>&quot;. In that book, they took a short section of the United Nations charter, set it in English, then set the same sections in different languages to show a comparison of the length difference. In this sample, Chinese was 61% of the English text. Japanese was 115% of English. Korean was at 123%. </p>
<p>Chinese is the most dense in terms of meaning/character. Also it doesn't use spaces, hyphens, etc. which saves space. Japanese has Kanji, which are dense, but hiragana / katakana are quite low density, and are used extensively for grammatical structures. Korean doesn't use Chinese characters (adds length), uses spaces, etc., so becomes 'less dense'. </p>
<p>Anyway, really neat little book.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FWIW, I'm a German-English translator, and I base my prices on the (estimated) length of the target text. When clients want a price up front, I base it on analyses of the texts I've previously translated that indicate that the length of the German text is 118% of the English text.</p>
<p>That's based on characters. The English text invariably has more words, but fewer characters (including spaces).</p></div>		</li>

<p>A minor nitpick. The Korean alphabet, just like Chinese, uses one square to one syllable, so I don't think the length difference comes from there. I would suspect a larger factor is that Korean-native words (having different origins than Chinese) are more polysyllabic and hence take up more space than if all-Mandarin characters were used. Japanese is in fact more syllables-per-word than Korean, but it often represents a polysyllabic native word with one kanji, hence if its script is denser, I think that would be the reason why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating stuff, that more than answered my question, thanks!</p>
<p>Wish I could find a cheap copy of that book myself, I wonder how close Google translate could get to replicating it's conclusions in terms of information density.  Might be a fun experiment to try, though issues regarding font size for equivalent legibility and the like would have to be addressed</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just had this funny mental image of an enormous 100-gallon steel top hat in the center of a massive warehouse, with scaffolding and gridwork arrayed all around.  People would climb up, pull a small slip of paper out of the &quot;hat&quot; then climb back down to work on that character, rinse and repeat until complete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, I never thought about the work that goes into an Asian typeface.   </p>
<p>Maybe a bit off topic, but do have a recommendation for any Chinese foundries? I am willing to pay for good Chinese fonts, but the stuff I find on the web tend to be the most basic and traditional looking fonts - e.g very brush strokey looking ones that look like they belong on a takeout menu or typefaces used in the 70's in China.  You seem quite knowledgeable, any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
