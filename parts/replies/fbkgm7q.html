			<div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn’t for long. That’s why it’s such an effective form of reversible birth control; you go back to normal pretty quickly. Some women take a little longer to get normal-sized follicles back; that’s about it. Low estrogen really isn’t an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that causes most of these side effects is actually the &quot;first pass metabolism&quot; of estrogen. That's the phenomenon where when you take oral pills the drug has to go through the liver before going to the rest of the body. Estrogens effect on the liver causes e.g. an increase in clotting factors leading to a higher risk of stroke. Estrogen itself doesn't do this, since we don't see the effects in transdermal patches which skip the liver. </p>
<p>Also the estrogen found in birth control pills is actually very similar to testosterone in structure, which is why you see increase in heart attacks. Endogenous estrogen is cardioprotective which is why women have less heart disease than men.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. Pregnant woman are at higher clotting risk due to higher estrogen. All estrogen in the blood stream eventually sees the liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thrombotic effects are very separate from the cardio protective effects. Also ALL estradiol is structurally similar to testosterone. The enzyme Aromatase converts testosterone to estradiol in the last step of its metabolism. </p>
<p>Also the patch has just as high VTE risk at comparable doses for birth control. As far as I’m aware, the studies showing safer efficacy for transdermal are all at HRT doses.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an idea why there is idle speculation: people do not care about information.  Even if their post seem like they are asking for information, they just post to reddit to hear themselves ask questions and have many others answer without any actual information on hand. </p>
<p>Reddit would die a swift death if attention seekers used google instead.</p></div>		</li>
