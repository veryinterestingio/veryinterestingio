			<div class="markdown"><p>The ink we use actually is much thicker than the consistency of honey and needs a small dose of radiation to dry. </p>
<p>Everything comes out looking the way it dies because of a program called color match that allows the print operator to finally tune each color as its laid down. The technology is great enough that this can be done with great accuracy even while the press is running in the range of 900 feet a minute.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s coldset inks too, but they’re not as colourfast as the heatset inks. They still look as good, but the ink is much more likely to come off on your hands. But another part of the reason industrial print looks better than commercially available printers is the dpi- dots per inch- used.  Commercial printers can get up to 2400 dpi, but will likely run much lower resolutions. Like 600 dpi or so. Industrial press plates start out at 1200 dpi these days and can go up to 4000 dpi. A higher dpi count gives you a lot more control over the image you’re reproducing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when I worked in a print shop, the ink was more like screenprinting ink, it's thick enough to spread with a palette knife, like screenprinting inks, and smells 10x worse...</p></div>		</li>
