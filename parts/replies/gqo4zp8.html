			<div class="markdown"><p>I work within a related scientific field. There are two main lines of research that have been worked on for decades.</p>
<ol>
<li>Replicating photosynthesis artificially without plants. It kind of works, but is far from being economically viable. Plants are still much better at photosynthesis than chemists are. Solar cells is a more viable alternative within the foreseeable future.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_photosynthesis" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_photosynthesis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_photosynthesis</a></a></li>
<li>Improving plants so they become more efficient at photosynthesis. This has been attempted mainly through improving the enzyme RuBisCO, which is responsible for CO2 uptake in plants. RuBisCo is an unusually slow enzyme, it only takes up a handfull of CO2 molecules per second. A faster RuBisCO has been created by scientists, but it did not end up improving plant growth in practice.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuBisCO#Genetic_engineering" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuBisCO#Genetic\_engineering" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuBisCO#Genetic\_engineering</a></a><br />
Edit: I'm not super up to date with this, apparently some of the problems have now been worked out and there is a faster growing plant out there. (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6422/eaat9077" target="_blank"><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6422/eaat9077" target="_blank">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6422/eaat9077</a></a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, in conclusion, your idea was good but it is hard to get to work in a practical and especially economically viable way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not untrue, but more forgiving way to phrase this is &quot;We can, but there is a currently cheaper way to do it&quot;.<br />
In this case it is either 1. solar panels, or 2. plants. I may sound negative, but I still strongly support this research. Maybe, solar panels could also be surpassed by a new technology one day? Who knows? That's why we have science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, knowing how something works isn’t the same as being able to replicate it. At this point we have a pretty good knowledge of the human body, but we can’t just make artificial organs that are capable of replacing human organs. </p>
<p>Or things like artificial muscles. We know exactly what goes into a muscle, but to recreate it using synthetics is, currently, almost impossible; Not because we don’t know how, but because there’s nothing that we know of that’s capable of replacing actual muscle tissue on a macro scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: Whiskey. Ultrasound and (relatively) rapid temperature cycling will get you really close in a timeframe of hours. The main problem after that is filtering out a lot of noxious aromatics that would generally migrate through the cask and oxidize to ambient atmosphere, without affecting the fragrant aromatics that the cask instills.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Apparently we have artificial blood that is good enough for ad hoc use.
But except some fringe cases its just more financially sound to give a guy capri sun and chocolate for donating 500 ml's of his own blood that hes producing for free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And in this case, it turns out just planting more trees is a kickass method of reducing CO2 in the atmosphere and doesn't cost a whole lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But only if you then don't do anything with the trees.  If you turn around and burn the trees/algae/other plant-based carbon sink, then it goes back to being carbon in the atmosphere.  Even if you just cut them down and let them rot, they will eventually return carbon to the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
