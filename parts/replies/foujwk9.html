			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! There are different methods, such as in situ and/or remote observations. For instance, (1) in situ observations analyze the composition of a given object (planet, moon, asteroid, comet, etc.) at the actual object – think of the Mars rovers (Curiosity, Perseverance). (2) Remote observations are obtained from telescopic facilities, such as ground-based telescopes like the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and/or space-based facilities such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Techniques such as spectroscopy allow us to identify spectral features from their components – this is light that emit/absorb certain molecules (water, carbon monoxide, etc.) that can be detected by such instruments. -LP</p></div>		</li>
