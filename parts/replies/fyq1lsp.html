			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too literally thought this was a normal thing. Didn't realize it was a muscle I was controlling while making the strange noise in my head on command. It kinda sounds like a muffled stampede of horse or cows on dirt but at twice the speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, that's not a universal thing? I'm learning so much in this thread.</p>
<p>As for rumbling, I can kind of &quot;pulse&quot; the rumble by doing a deep click, but I get the feeling &quot;rumblers&quot; can make it sound like when I'm yawning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've honestly never met anyone who <em>couldn't</em> do it. I'm pretty confident it's one of those things that everyone can do, but it's both very hard to explain and also very hard to show someone, so people kind of just figure it out on their own and never discuss it with someone else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can, however, make tiny streams of air come out of my tear ducts if I hold my nose and blow air hard enough. I can also flex my nostrils very widely and fast, which apparently not everyone can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It's an unused and undiscussed part if our physiology. Judging by the amount of comments, I really don't think it's that unusual. It's just that people generally don't have cause to talk about it or do it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly can you do? I can make the rumble happen by yawning or making an extreme &quot;grimace&quot; face, but are you saying you can just make it rumble at will with no facial movement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if I hear something too loud or if I just want to do it for no reason. It tightens the eardrum to make the vibrations of incoming noise less effective thus reducing the volume. It’s like a rumbling noise with white noise EDIT: a word</p></div>		</li>
