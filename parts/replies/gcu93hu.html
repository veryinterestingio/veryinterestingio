			<div class="markdown"><p>100% agree. The fact that they actually expect us to pay them sometimes to publish our work. And you'd think if they're taking scientists work for free and charging people to see it then what those people are paying for is the rigourous scientific review but no, that is also done for free by scientists. Literally all they do is provide storage space for it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So wait, they have to pay to get it published and get nothing for when others pay to see it? Why bother publishing it? Is there like self publishers or anything like that at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^(it's all to do with the reputability of journals. anybody can publish in a shit journal-- in fact there are many journals that exist only to make money from publishing almost anything you give it. because of this there's a bigger impact when publishing with very picky high quality journal group such as cell or nature. having your article accepted in a high impact journal is almost like a verification badge of quality work and importance in the field.)</p></div>		</li>
