			<div class="markdown"><p>So let's assume you'd pressurize a perfectly insulated chamber by compressing it.</p>
<p>We'll assume a adiabatic system:</p>
<p>T^k * p^(1-k) = const</p>
<p>T1 = (p1/p2)^(k-1/k) * T2</p>
<p>(T1 is the end temperature here)</p>
<p>now the pressure on Mt. Everests summit is 33.7 kPa and the temperature is -36 C = 237 K on average according to Google.</p>
<p>Normal atmospheric pressure is about 100 kPa.</p>
<p>k for air is about 1.4</p>
<p>Punching in the numbers we'll get:</p>
<p>T_1 = (100/33.7)^(0.4/1.4)*237 K = 323 K or about 50C/122F</p>
<p>so yes, it'd get pretty toasty inside that chamber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then that cold air should be falling back down. It seems like the hot air should rise and cool and fall down again leaving a point where air can just no longer be (far lower than the edge of the atmosphere). Like how you have a clear line where the clouds sit or smog or something. Why can air continue to be up there if it is cold but sitting on top of hot air trying to rise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't mind abandoning the ELI5 format, we can get into this.</p>
<p>Basically, at the molecular level, thermal energy (enthalpy) presents itself in three ways, all of which are functionally kinetic energy. The molecules are physically moving more quickly. </p>
<p>The three ways in which the molecules move are:</p>
<p>entropy</p>
<p>molecules vibrating</p>
<p>molecules flying around more quickly</p>
<p>Entropy is a bit of a side track, but let's talk about it anyways, because it has a very specific technical definition in thermodynamics. It is not 'disorder in the system' or a 'tendency towards chaos', it is two forms of energy which are not available for mechanical work. The first form is vibration of atoms within a molecule (as opposed to vibration of the molecule as a whole) and rotational (the molecule is spinning in space)</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the important types of energy. The ones that are actually useful. First, vibration of the molecules. This is what we experience as 'temperature'. Here's the thing: temperature is a function of energy, mass AND VOLUME. So as the volume increases, the temperature drops, despite the molecules having the same energy!</p>
<p>Finally, the molecules flying around. This is pressure. If you have a gas in an air tight container and you heat it up, the pressure increases because the molecules have more energy, which distributes itself pretty much evenly between all the available energy storage options we've talked about here. The molecules are <em>SLAM</em> running into the walls faster! That's pressure. </p>
<p>Well, without a container, the gas wants to expand when you add thermal energy, until it has the same pressure as the surrounding air. This causes it's density to drop, which causes it to rise because of buoyancy (like a boat floating on water).</p>
<p>Now remember back to our description of the vibrating molecules, and how that relates to temperature. The temperature is a function of energy per volume, among those other factors. The energy hasn't gone anywhere, it's still in the molecule. But now the molecule is further from other similarly high energy molecules. So now the temperature has dropped. </p>
<p>Basically, what this comes down to is not that HOT air rises, but that LOW DENSITY air rises. The way you lower the density of air is to add energy, which causes the temperature to go up. So it's not being hot that causes the air to rise, but that the air being hot and the air rising are caused by the same addition of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So really the issue is with the idiom “hot air rises.” It should be “dense air sinks and temperature is irrelevant,” but that’s not catchy.</p>
<p>The less density=cold thing is evident in how when you use a propane tank or can of silly string or butane lighter, the canister gets cold as shit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very unhappy with this explanation. Rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom do not directly equate entropy, they are also  not strictly separated from translation either because they equilibrate among each other.</p>
<p>Entropy is a statistical effect from distributing molecules of an ensemble into discrete states. I'd even say that the &quot;disorder&quot; thing is more faithful to the spirit of it than what you wrote.</p>
<p><em>e</em> - to challenge your definition of entropy with a very simple question: What is the entropy of a monoatomic gas?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;hot air rises&quot; isn't exactly whats going on.</p>
<p>It's more a case of <em>dense</em> air sinks. To that end</p>

<p>So then that cold air should be falling back down.</p>

<p>This does occur to some degree.</p></div>		</li>
