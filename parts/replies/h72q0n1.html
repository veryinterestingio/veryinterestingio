			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey no problem, happy to explain! As you suspect, there are multiple ways to go about editing certain sites/sequences, and also what you want to accomplish. If you're just looking to delete or scramble information (DNA), that's not as limited by size (for example Cas9 has generated unintentional deletions millions of base-pairs in length). If you want to specifically insert or modify a sequence, that quickly becomes more challenging, and if using CRISPR based methods \~10kb seems to be the limit (for now anyway). Personally, we've inserted up to 8kb using Cas9-HR, and that worked surprisingly well.</p>
<p>In terms of editing style, there are a couple other Cas9 fusions (base-editors and prime-editing) which use a different mechanism than ours to edit either a single or up to \~50bp at a time. We plan on focusing on much larger edits (1000s of bp) for own therapeutic development which base-editors and prime are not particularly suited for.</p>
<p>Not sure if we're going to be using one or two cuts yet (personally I think it'll likely be two), but we're going to let the data guide our way!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, while you would certainly have a higher target fidelity in such a long BP stretch, do you also lose efficiency by increasing the chances for mismatches within the target area (point mutations, etc)?</p></div>		</li>
