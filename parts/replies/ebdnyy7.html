			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe my google-fu is weak, but I can't find anything that even entertains the idea of static being artificially added, yet alone whether it's true or not. It really doesn't make sense to make compression harder by adding noise - the whole point is there isn't much bandwidth to begin with!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really though, I feel like, on average the call audio quality has gone down. Between the use of crappy quality VOIP by some companies, and the quality of a cell/mobile phone audio compared to a traditional land line, I miss the audio quality toward the end of the days where everyone pretty much used a land line.</p></div>		</li>
