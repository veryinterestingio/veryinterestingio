			<div class="markdown"><p>Biomaterials for 3D printing, whether they are synthetic or bio-based, is an important and growing field of research. For tissue engineering applications, all of these approaches require the cultivation of human cells within a hydrogel matrix, and understanding the interactions at the molecular and macro-molecular scale is critical to engineering these materials. The advantage of 3D printing is that it offers the ability to create patient-specific shapes and geometries. Sculpting an ear, for example, is one approach, but customized 3D printing of an ear could be the future.</p></div>		</li>
