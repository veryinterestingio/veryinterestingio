			<div class="markdown"><p>It‘s usually 4K or 8K, depending on the theatre. But what makes the size difference is not the resolution, but the format and the difference in bitrate.</p>
<p>For a blueray, the movie will be compressed so the data can fit on the disk. The theatre will get the uncompressed file.</p>
<p>You can google video compression for examples how making the file size smaller works. Basically, you try to find patterns in the infomartion that can be described more efficiently. You also ignore small differences to make larger patterns.</p>
<p>Basically, you sacrifice some details in the information, in order to get nicer patterns, which then can be saved using less space.</p>
<p>Edit: See comments to this post for corrections of innacruacies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not 8k. </p>
<p>It’s either 2k or 4k. </p>
<p>Digital cinema (DCP) has its own packaging format and uses JPEG 2000 for compression. It’s extremely high quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theatres get compressed video, just losslessly compressed. No data is lost, but if patterns can be found in the original data they will still be used. Otherwise movies would be ludicrously large - for 4K 24fps, 10 bit colour movies you're looking at nearly 6Gbps, or 800MB/s. That's 5.4 Terabytes for a 2 hour movie, which can't be played back - HDDs have the capacity but can't read data fast enough, and SSDs are far too expensive and not typically available in such high capacities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The files the theatre gets are also compressed, just potentially at a higher quality.</p>
<p>Just for 24fps video at 1920x1080, 24-bit color you'd be looking at ~8 gigs of raw data per minute of content. So 750 gigs for a short 90-minute movie at standard/'1K' HD resolution, no audio.</p></div>		</li>

Max bitrate of 250 Mbit/s in JPEG2000</p>
<p>So a 2 hour minute movie can be UP to 225 Gigs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have already been answers but I can tell you our theater gets 2k and 4k. At the time we got our digital projectors, they were top of the line Sony projectors but I'm sure stuff has come out that is better. And yes 8k is a thing but it isn't as wide spread as it is still very expensive. But I got to see an 8k projector at a movie theater trade show.</p></div>		</li>
