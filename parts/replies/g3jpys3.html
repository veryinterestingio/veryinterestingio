			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the hairs on your head are usually in the growth phase for years at a time. But even though most are in the growth phase, about 100 are not every day so they fall out. (That's why we lose about 100 hairs a day).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so they are in their growth phase for years. You’re hair or beard is growing. The growth phase ends and the beard stops at its usual stopping point for the growth phase. If you don’t cut it, it stays in the rest period for months or years. Never getting longer. But if you shaved, you’d have another small beard in 2 weeks. Why does shaving start the growing again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you shave your leg, for example, for the first time, does it grow back to its initial length or does it get longer? I feel like other parts of my body have grown longer after shaving it for the first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shaving doesn't make your hair thicker, but it can appear to due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When people first start shaving, it's usually during puberty when your body is rapidly changing, you might shave, then see the next wave of hair is much thicker than before.  This is simply because you can get spurts of new hair growth during puberty, and is only a correlation with the fact you started shaving.</p>
</li>
<li>Hair tips are tapered to some degree, and you cut off the thinner tips when shaving, so it can make it look a bit thicker than before when they first grow back, since now the tips are all thicker hairs with a clean shaving cut, rather than a tapered end.  Eventually that effect will go away if you stop shaving.</li>
