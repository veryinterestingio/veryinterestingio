			<div class="markdown"><p>The two biggest things that kill you after being severely burned, provided you survived the actual burning, are dehydration and infection. Both occur because your skin barrier is fucked. </p>
<p>So yes, very bad. This isn't &quot;I badly need a drink of water&quot;, this is &quot;I will literally die of thirst without an IV of fluids until the scar tissue grows in.&quot; You're basically a bucket of water with a hole in the bottom with big and bad enough burns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. It’d be like walking across the desert with a single bucket of water. Except I shot a bunch of holes in the bucket right before you left. And the water also becomes poison in a short amount of time (infection). Major burns are no joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I never thought about it this way and always assumed it was just intense dehydration that was problematic with burn victims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances in burn victims is because of third space fluid shift.  Burn trauma leads to fluids moving from the blood stream into interstitial spaces, thus a blister is formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is actually something called the parkland formula which is used to calculate how much fluids to pump into a burn victim based off percentage of body burned. It is usually a shit ton of fluid since they are losing so much thru the skin.</p></div>		</li>
