			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a bundle of informations. I guess that's why 'scared the shit out of me' is a more widely used phrase than 'scared the piss out of me'. </p>
<p>In fact, I may start saying &quot;you scared the piss inside me&quot; moving forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>getting the shit scared out of you happens.  </p>
<p>my dad was radioman on B29s bombers on a bunch of combat missions during WWII (yes, i am old fart).  </p>
<p>he told about a night mission when they got 'lit up' by ground searchlights while on their bomb run.  getting lit up was sure death - there might be hundreds of planes on the mission but you were the one that could be seen, so you were <em>the</em> target for anti aircraft.  </p>
<p>also, you were all flying straight and level toward the target, to improve accuracy.  you would get passed from ground light to ground light as you flew along, so you were lit up for as long as you were making the final approach (i believe he said 15 or 20 minutes)</p>
<p>my dad said the lights lit up the interior of the plane like the sun</p>
<p>anyway, when my dad told the story he said &quot;we got lit up, and that's when you fill your pants&quot;.  knowing my dad, i'm pretty sure he was telling me that's what happened... </p>
<p>obviously, he survived.  he still doesn't know why.  he saw planes lit up before and after and none survived</p>
<p>i saw him cry only twice.  once when his father died.  the second time was when he told me of watching another plane carrying friends of his get hit and then slowly shot to pieces as it went down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People peeing themselves when scared is definitely a thing though, right? Unless movies just made that up. Can't say I've ever seen it happen personally, but pissing yourself out of fear is a pretty prevalent concept.</p></div>		</li>
