			<div class="markdown"><p>Bioluminescence is results from fluorescent proteins. This typically involves introducing a fluorescent protein into an animal using genetic engineering as was done with GloFish <a href="https://www.glofish.com/" target="_blank">https://www.glofish.com/</a> which are sold at pet stores throughout the nation. You could use homology-directed repair and editing to introduce a fluorescent protein at a specific fluorescent protein gene into the genome of an animal - making it a transgenic animal and subject to GMO regulations which are expensive as discussed earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello,
first of all, thank you for sharing information about genome editing, as a student of biotechnology I think we lack similar open discussions. I have just one remark on this answer. Bioluminescence is a separate process from biofluorescence. It is the production and emission of light by an organism, whereas fluorescence is not produced by the organism itself. I am not sure if there is any attempt to make an animal bioluminescent.</p></div>		</li>
