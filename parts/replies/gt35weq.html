Pu-238 is a non-fissile form of plutonium that has a much shorter half-life than the kind of plutonium used for nuclear fission (Pu-239), making it much hotter and usable in this kind of device. It also makes it more difficult to produce (you need to first produce Np-237 in a reactor, then put that into a reactor to make Pu-238 — it requires more steps than Pu-239, in other words), and as a result there isn't nearly as much of it as the weapons-usable type (which was produced by the ton during the Cold War).</p></div>		</li>
