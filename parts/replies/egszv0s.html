			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like the sticks you pee on are about $1.50 in bulk. Most of the dollar store ones are just the strips or need to sit in the pee anyway.</p>
<p>Honestly, I just cut the bottom off a water bottle if I need to take a test any time I'm feeling paranoid. I'm trying not to get pregnant, but my birth control means I don't have a period most of the time, so I need reassurance I'm NOT pregnant if I feel nauseous or have horrible heartburn. My husband has gotten used to finding the top half and will just yell at me to let him know I'd I need a drink or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, pregnant.</p>
<p>Heard the nurses talking about me, &quot;She just found out?&quot; &quot;Yep.&quot; &quot;Did she WANT to be pregnant?&quot; &quot;She's thrilled.&quot; &quot;Oh, thank god.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
