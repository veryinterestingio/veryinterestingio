<p>I won't comment on the behavioral aspect of 'an urge to find food', but it may be possible that mental fortitude has something to do with mental capabilities while starving.</p>
<p>If this is directed at impaired cognition due to *over consumption* of food, the jury isn't quite out (according to the source provided) on that and it would be wrong of me to speculate.</p>
<p>If considering impaired cognition due to severe *caloric deficit*, it's likely due to a lack readily available energy (energy consumption can be used to approximate the level of activity), how do you keep neuronal circuits firing when you don't have the energy available to use them( imaging a throttle system on your car engine forcing you to use 4 cylinders instead of 6 when your fuel is low). The body does transition from glycogen as a fuel to ketone bodies (and later triglycerides).</p>
<p>As for brain function decreasing, in the case of starving, it is a minimal change (initially), as the body is well adapted to starvation, and further down the line greater cognitive issues may occur, the decline is likely rapid but linear and would likely happen at distinct times representing the stages of starvation.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that when I state *starving* I mean, no food at all. Not just a minor/moderate caloric deficit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say you're 6' 270 pounds, and you go for a few months with just around 1200 calories and full micro nutrients. Would you expect to be less capable of learning while you are attempting to lose weight? Would I start to have cognitive impairment? because while I was living that life style, I didn't feel like I was in a &quot;Brain fog&quot; nor did I have difficulty remembering details or events that occurred in that time. I was unemployed, so I  wasn't really learning any new skills.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Food finding behaviors are cognitive in nature. This is something too subjective to actually be answered by research.</p>

<p>Define &quot;brain function&quot; as a measurable quantity. This is too overbroad to really investigate - different processes will start or stop or change based on the state of the organism and behaviors it's engaged in, but overall measurements are too global to give much useful information.</p>

<p>Various articles and studies show that low income individuals tend to suffer more because typically minor decisions are more crucial when you only have money for one bill or one meal.</p></div>		</li>
