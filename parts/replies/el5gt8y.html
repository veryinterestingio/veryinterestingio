			<div class="markdown"><p>I would start with CBD flower if you can get it, just because you'll notice it whether or not it works for your anxiety pretty quickly after smoking some.</p>
<p>If not, then I'd say a tincture.You want something that is full spectrum and high in other cannabanoids (or at least has them present) than just CBD. The label will def say &quot;Full Spectrum&quot;</p>
<p>If the company is on top of their shit, they'll have a QR code you can scan with your phone to bring up lab reports and see all that information. The shop might have paper copies on hand.</p>
<p>Most bottles are going to be 30ml tinctures with a 1ml dropper.</p>
<p>I would start with something between 250 and 500mg and use a dropper to two dropper fulls a day. You might try splitting up a single dropper full. Half in the morning, half at night.  It may take a day or two for you to notice much.</p>
<p>Also, for anxiety, I highly recommend pro-biotics. Most of your serotonin and GABA is stored in your gut:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can’t find a specific CBD flower I would see what kind of cartridges they have available for Vape pens. No fire necessary, self-contained, very little smell to worry about. It might be easier to find Vape cartridge that has a much higher CBD concentration then you would find in flower. You could also try CBD oil, some places sell CBD specific oil in 1:1, 10:1 and 20:1 ratios (CBD:THC).  CBD works best when combined with THC in varying amounts depending on the results you’re looking for. I’ve linked an article explaining this below, you do have to be 21 though to access the site. <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/health/why-cbd-works-better-with-thc" target="_blank">leafly: CBD w/ THC</a></p></div>		</li>
