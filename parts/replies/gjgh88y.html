<p>the process to make more permanent magnets is to melt iron and expose it to the electromagnetic field</p>

<p>You don't need to melt it, just get it above the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature" target="_blank">Curie Point</a>. For iron this is around where it starts to glow red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;batteries&quot; they had were nowhere powerful enough for electro plating, this is a myth. Even using a ton of them, the total amount of energy was way too low. They found something that looked in theory like a battery, but no one has any idea why exactly it was used for, not even sure they were used as a battery. You can read a bit on the Baghdad battery, lots of research was done on it!</p>
<p>My best guess is that it was a time traveler that tried to show them electricity, people felt a small electric shock so they killed him for witchcraft.</p></div>		</li>
