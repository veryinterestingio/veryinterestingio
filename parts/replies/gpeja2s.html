			<div class="markdown"><p>That was part of a plot from a G.I. Joe cartoon episode. Some giant blob monster thing was wreaking havoc and the Joes led it into an apple orchard and it died after eating everything in its path...trees, leaves, apples....and the key item: the deadly cyanide-laced apple seeds. I think. That was a long time ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>long story short, is cyanide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, amygdalin, which is what makes bitter almonds and drupe stones poisonous. So don't go around eating peach or apricot stones or seeds either (which is another form that &quot;B17&quot; is advertised as). Bitter almonds <em>can</em> be eaten in small amounts, but uh, unless your recipe calls for them (some cusines do actually use bitter almonds), maybe don't? </p>
<p>Also side note - when people talk about cyanide smelling like almonds...they actually mean cyanide smells like <em>bitter</em> almonds because this is what makes them smelly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. I knew about bitter almonds containing cyanide but I've happily cracked open and ate the almond like insides of apricot and cherry seeds. I like them enough that sometimes I crack open and eat the seeds that my brother hasn't eaten. No harm has come to me so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What’s interesting is that NileRed (a chemist with a YouTube channel where he does applied chemistry) wanted to try this out so he <a href="https://youtu.be/WYagO-nup6c" target="_blank">bought a bunch of butter almonds and tried to compare the smell to cyanide</a>. The “cyanide smells like bitter almonds” claim is misleading since 1) not everyone can even smell cyanide in the first place, and 2) basically nobody knows what bitter almonds are so many people immediately think if regular almonds.</p></div>		</li>
