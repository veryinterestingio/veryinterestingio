<p>How come this one is so far above that 150-200 number?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately, because it's a single object and the measurement isn't certain enough to throw everything else out. </p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/458/1/624/2622536" target="_blank">Here's the paper</a> that's the source of that high-mass number. The paper doesn't claim to have made a mass measurement in the sense that you might be thinking of. That is, they haven't weighed it directly as is possible when a star is in a binary orbit. What they do is take models of stellar evolution, which adjust for various parameters of the star like its composition, and try to fit the shape of spectral features and the brightness of the star in different band-passes to back out a mass. Statistical errors propagate the whole way through, and this particular object has a quoted error of about 45 solar masses on the low end. A <em>major</em> caveat to that (of which the authors are most definitely aware as it's inherent to the statistical treatment they're using) is that a single error bar number doesn't really capture the likelihood of the tail end of the distribution since the error distribution is decidedly non-gaussian - in other words, treating this as a normal distribution with a sigma of 45 solar masses will not give you an accurate idea of the likelihood of the tails of the distribution. You can still deal with all of this, and the authors do, I'm just mentioning it to try to give a general scope of the uncertainty for a lay reader while still explaining not to take it in the usual way that a basic stats course in university might have told you to. There's another, more pernicious issue, again that the authors are perfectly aware of and have done as much to address as is possible, which is that models like this can have severe systematic errors where it is impossible to be sure they've been fully accounted for. A good example of this is the age of star clusters, which for a little while, when estimated through similar methods as employed in this paper, gave ages for globular clusters that were older than the universe was (as more robustly measured by the Cosmic Microwave Background). Obviously, stars can't be older than the universe, so this was a Problem. That problem has since been solved, and the modelling has improved, but it's still not perfect of course.</p>
<p>The point of all this isn't that the mass quoted is a bad measure, and definitely not that the authors did a bad job (it's an excellent paper!) just that individual estimates like this have to be taken in context with everything else we know, and you can't stand too heavily on a single result with this many layers to it.</p>
<p>And it may also come down to what you consider a star - does it have to be in equilibrium? If it's possible to temporarily bring together a large amount of mass that immediately starts to blow itself apart without being in equilibrium, does that count? It's a way to get around the Eddington limit, certainly. A &quot;maximum mass&quot; only would really apply in equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>classical Eddington luminosity limit is not applicable to stars such as R136a1 that are not in hydrostatic equilibrium</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, it's very temporary that it's that massive, and it's losing mass at an astounding rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently there's something called the Hayashi limit, but that's for stable stars. A star that's not in a stable state might exceed the limit. And I think it might be hard to define. Where do you draw the line between the outer atmosphere of a hypergiant star, and the inner reaches of a nascent planetary nebula.</p>
<p>For example in the case of a star like VY Canis Majoris, one of the largest known, it has a mean density of about 6 mg/m^3 , about equivalent to Earth's atmosphere 80 km up. The outer limits of what we call the star are likely so low density we'd normally regard it as outer space.</p></div>		</li>
