			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting three things:</p>
<p>1) the ocassional relaxing of the muscles to put pressure on the spine isn't overly damaging, and doesn't have much long tern impact as long as bad posture takes a small proportion of all posture. </p>
<p>2) the muscle strength needed to keep proper posture isn't an overly difficult task for those able to do regular or maintained exercise. Proper posture is one of the first things people tend to notice after starting regular exercise snd training back muscles.</p>
<p>3) the strain needed when standing and when sitting is different. It is overall easier to hold a proper posture standing than when sitting (feel free to try it, it's often hard for even people with good posture standing to keep good posture sitting). Sitting is a somewhat new phenomenon (being uncommon before chairs, only being practiced when possible such as on dry floor, logs, rocks etc, which are uncomfortable and don't allow you to sit for too long) and so our body is less naturally able to handle muscle stress when sitting. It's why people at desk jobs tend towards bad posture over time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, if you do a lot of back and abdominal training, “good posture” is a side effect and it no longer feels as though you’re straining or actively using your muscles because they’re already built to support the body. It’s something we learn during Pilates certification. Joseph Pilates once said that you’re only as old as your spinal column.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. If you're having back problems, the tough but likely solution for most is to strengthen their weakened or tight back muscles. Sitting for 30m shouldn't give a reasonably strong adult back pain. </p>
<p>I used to have back pain every day, like it was a part of my life. But I started lifting weights last year and now I'm able to go on drives for 4-5 hours without noticing. </p>
<p>Obviously, this might be overkill but with strength training (deadlifts, squats, rows, OHP, pull ups, dips) AND good form (v important) I felt pain relief for the first time in years, in a matter of the first 6 30m sessions (2 weeks). </p>
<p>My <em>unproven theory</em> of the &quot;why&quot; is that not only do these exercises strengthen your back, they also stretch those pesky knots. And our back is such a strong muscle that you absolutely need heavy weights to assist in breaking that tension. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: as with any activity, every experience is unique - highly suggest you do your own research and/or have supervision from someone experienced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not only your back that needs to be strengthened when you have back pain, it heavily relies on also strengthening your abs/core. When people have a weak core, they tend to overcompensate by throwing the weight into their back. Think about someone with a weak core trying to pick up a somewhat heavy box. While, yes, it does take leg strength, it also takes core strength to maintain a straight back and lift upwards. If I were to say there’s one thing that you should keep strengthened, it’s definitely the core. By having a strong core, you’re less likely to have bad posture not because you have a strong back but because your core cinches your ribs together creating a strong alignment. Where you do have to strengthen your back is when you have something like a spinal deformity like kyphosis or scoliosis because the alignment of your spine is causing different muscles to be naturally stronger than others.</p></div>		</li>
