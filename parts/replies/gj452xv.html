<p>Thank you so much for this AMA! I have two questions. The first is twofold:  </p>
<p>How can someone that does not have a scientific background, or who is not well versed in virology and immunology, but does want to help convince others overcome pseudoscientific, but nonesensocal arguments? For example, it might be argued to them that the vaccine contains potassium chloride which is also used in executions. It is true, but the argument is nonesense. What would you advise to steer the conversation to something they can control?</p>

<p>Great question. It can be difficult to have conversations where there is a lot people don’t know, but know just enough to feel overconfident. </p>
<p>One thing we know from social psychology is that people value seeing themselves as both consistent and rational. And so if this person has trusted the benevolence of unknowns in medicine before – for instance when they underwent anesthetic for surgery— then what reason do they have for distrusting this case? In fact, I’d say there’s way more uncertainty around something like anesthetic, were even anesthesiologists don’t understand how drugs truly impact consciousness. </p>
<p>The nice thing about vaccines is we know the precise mechanism by which they interact, and so were more certain about how they work in something like the brain. Viruses are incredibly simple in the grand scheme of things, and so there’s far fewer unknowns here than in many other medical investigations. </p>
<p>That was a little rambling, but the idea would be to *increase* the uncertainty about things they thought they did in the past and trusted, and *decrease* the relative uncertainty of the COVID vaccine. “You trust scientists/doctors on all these complicated medical mysteries, but here’s something that’s not very mysterious at all.”</p>
<p>(Kurt Gray)</p>
<p>...and I am not more skeptical about what we really know about COVID. To butcher a quote by Einstein, it's generally true that learning more makes us know there's more we don't know, but we are pretty certain about COVID, all things considered.  We understand coronaviruses pretty well, even if there's always uncertainty at the fringes of any phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Answering your second question first: No, I'm not more skeptical. One of the things that came across in our project is really understanding the motivation of the messenger, and how critical it is for messengers to be transparent about their motivations. So even in the early stages, when PH officials were advising against mask wearing, they were doing so to preserve PPE for the frontline health care workers who needed it most. They were still advising distancing. The PH messenger could have avoided appearing inconsistent in their messages with greater transparency about why they were offering their advice. </p>
<p>On your first question, it can help to respond with the long historical role vaccines have had in keeping humans healthy, and to clearly state your &quot;why.&quot; For example, if you are getting the vaccine because you're eager to resume favorite activities, or because you want to protect family members, then say that. Activating hope and establishing yourself as someone who is unafraid and sees getting the vaccine as a normal, expected activity can help to establish as a norm for them. --Ann</p></div>		</li>
