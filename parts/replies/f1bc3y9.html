			<div class="markdown"><p>I think about this every time I go shopping for shampoo, and I keep coming back to this hair-brained idea of &quot;shampoo tankers.&quot; People buy a re-usable bottle at the store, and have it filled there by staff with the shampoo of their choosing; every week or so a tanker truck could swing by the store and top off that location's supply of soap. I think it would cut-down on plastic waste, but I hardly every put more thought into it than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that be great for a hotel? Get your reusable bottle and get to choose which shampoo or other stuff you want. Very fancy marketing - we have so many options to choose from, we love you so much we give you options! Buying in bulk is cheaper, so even having several options would offset the cost. And the bottles can be designed in a way, that can be washed in an industrial washer or at least they could be made biodegradable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, the amount of plastic waste generated by Holiday Inn, just due to those little bottles of shampoo equals about 70 tons every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of hotels are actually starting to switch to shampoo dispensers. </p>
<p>I wonder, though. What did they do before plastic? I assume people just brought their own shampoo to hotels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nope.  glass bottles.</p>
<p>but plastic came along and was cheaper, had the squeeze thing going, and weighed less (lower shipping costs)</p>
<p>the plastic bottles were marketed as being safer but i don't remember a glass shampoo bottle ever breaking</p></div>		</li>

<p>BTW, did you know that most shampoos contain 60-70% water?</p>

<p>Also, it is still a concentrate. The amount of shampoo needed is much less than most people use. We are talking about literal drops, not spoonfuls let alone handfuls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The foam is not necessary. It is nice indicator but it doesn't actually have anything to do with cleaning. There is a problem how to get the drops to spread over large enough area and it is much, much worse if it is constantly being washed away. Most often, one has to use more than would be needed... me too, i don't even have a hair and i still have to use more than the minimum amount.</p></div>		</li>
