			<div class="markdown"><p>This might sound really stupid (but I’m an MSc student in Biomed trying my best). Is there not a way scientists could genetically alter this strain to be weaker, barely cause any symptoms, and make it highly infectious so it’d spread and people would get immunity?<br />
I know vaccines are a thing but there’s so many wacko theorists that efficacy is dropping massively.<br />
Or is there too much risk it’d mutate and become deadly anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because viruses infect by entering individual cells and taking over their function in order to reproduce copies of itself, it's largely the infectious process that's the first cause of symptoms. The second cause comes from activating the immune system to fight off the infection, resulting in fever, etc. So, it's tough to make a virus be both highly infectious and also barely cause any symptoms.</p>
<p>However, there are cases, for example cowpox, a virus that causes mild symptoms in humans, but entrains the immune system to respond to itself and similar viruses in a manner that provides some protection from smallpox. However, cowpox in humans isn't as highly infectious, so it needs to be manually spread to be effective.</p>
<p>The Sabin vaccine (OPV: Oral polio vaccine) was a live vaccine for poliovirus, where the weakened poliovirus can spread from person to person. It was thought at the time that this could help extend protection to others that weren't directly vaccinated, but this turns out to be relatively infrequent in areas with good sanitation, and worse, sometimes caused severe or lasting symptoms in those vaccinated as well as secondary contacts. During the global polio eradication effort, various forms of OPV were used in early efforts, and switched to IPV (Inactive polio vaccine) in the later stages. More details on this, including the role of three strains of wild poliovirus, can be found in  <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/poliomyelitis/endgame_objective2/rationale/en/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/poliomyelitis/endgame\_objective2/rationale/en/" target="_blank">https://www.who.int/immunization/diseases/poliomyelitis/endgame\_objective2/rationale/en/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oral polio vaccine is still used in the regions where wild polio is present. It's been phased out in the first world because the risks of OPV outweigh the benefits where there is no wild polio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be ethical. It's the first thing im thinking about. Some people might still die. What youre suggesting is pretty much vaccination though, and that's why we have vaccines. Also if enough people get vaccinated, sometimes we can get second degree immunity from the feces and bodily fluids of vaccinated people. Maybe there's somebody smarter and less lazier than me that can link some articles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. I should reiterate that my post wasn’t a “let’s do it!” kind of manifesto. More of a “hmm what if”. I know it would never happen. I’m just wondering more about IF it happened would it still be able to mutate into something deadly even if it was an attenuated strain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that would carry the risk of it becoming viable again quickly. Evolution is measured in generations. In a way, pandemics are moderating the deadliness of viruses. They boom and then bust, then the more tolerable mutations survive on as tamer strains. If current events show anything, it's that pandemics are not easy to control. fighting pandemics with pandemics might still kill lots of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a vast number of possible flu strains. Both seasonal influenza and influenza pandemics were well known for centuries before 1918, but we don’t know much if anything about the strains involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there had been sporadic flu cases and even pandemics throughout history, but the 1918 one was the first global pandemic (edit: looks like I’m wrong about this part! See commenter below). It alone made the flu a ubiquitous and perennial disease. It was rare and unusual enough that doctors at the time thought it was bacterial in nature and misdiagnosed as dengue, cholera, typhoid, and meningitis.  </p>
<p>So yeah. Influenza existed, but it wasn’t really a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all true. 18th and 19th century influenza pandemics were global, and traveled almost as fast as 20th century pandemics. See <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23331022" target="_blank">The Chronicle of Influenza Epidemics</a>. (Side note, the pandemic of 1889-90 referenced there is now proposed to have been the last time an animal coronavirus jumped into humans, not actually influenza.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone had hypothetically kept some in a lab, maybe. The 1918 one was especially virulent though, and it had a perfect storm of opportunity with the war and the press embargo.</p></div>		</li>
