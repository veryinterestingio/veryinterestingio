			<div class="markdown"><p>The other option I heard and what makes sense to me is a build up of lactic acid. That's The substance that makes your muscles burn when exercising and stresses you out.</p>
<p>That's why runners will usually do a cool down run after the main event/practice, to circulate more blood and clear out most of it. It's also why when you are frequently working out, ie running every other day, you probably won't ever feel that sore even if you are pushing yourself some, because your body is getting more efficient at clearing it out and it doesn't have time to build up and cause soreness. Muscles also grow more efficient and produce less lactic acid. </p>
<p>If it were truly microtears then you'd be sore every time you go for a run or workout and that is certainly not the case. </p>
<p>I hope that was a satisfactory answer.  I didn't come up with it all myself or anecdotally either. I did use to run XC and am a climber who's really curious and kind of a research nut about stuff like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been proven it's not lactic acid. Hydrogen yes but doms most likely this theory will prove out to be accurate <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/3/212/htm" target="_blank">https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/3/212/htm</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about weight lifting? High weight low reps won't give you nearly as much lactic buildup as running but can make you alot more sore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving ourselves is a complex task, and, as other complex tasks in our systems, it involves much more than an unique molecule or unique factor, things like 'lactic build up makes us sore' or 'dopamine makes us happy' tends to be oversimplifications. There's a fine balance of feedbacks (nervs and hormones) during exercises, and the sensation of 'soreness' we feel is exactly what it is, a sensation. There are multiple factors that influence the characteristics of that feeling, and, at least for now, you should find a variety of divergent answers, it doesn't mean they are wrong, but unfortunately it's not simple :/ The best simplification i can think about is: The soreness is your neurons sensing that the muscular group was somehow stressed, the why it's sensing that may vary.</p></div>		</li>
