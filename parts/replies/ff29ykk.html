			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fundamentally true, but this can also lead people to mistakenly believe that every feature evolved “for a reason” or has some kind of evolutionary benefit. A great deal of characteristics are epiphenomena and are there “just because”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in the same way. Men having non-functional nipples for example. Or our tendency to get old and die, or our tendency to get cancer. If you define evolutionary is something that we as a species have selected for yeah, there's many traits we have that are just remnants, not necessarily something that was conducive to our genetic success</p></div>		</li>

<p>Follow up question! </p>
<p>How does our eyes scan while driving? Is it smooth or clicky? </p>
<p>Also thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think it’s a little bit of both because everything is moving when you’re driving, but you also have to lock on to certain things like signage and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mixture of both. </p>
<p>If your eyes are momentarily tracking something like a set of traffic lights or a pedestrian who is about to walk out on you, your eye motion will be smooth. </p>
<p>If you're just looking forward to see everything in front of you without the need to track a specific object, they'll be jittery. </p>
<p>I imagine the average driver swaps between these very frequently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As soon as the fly moves you'll see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>our eyeballs have different photo receptors and our brains process them differently - the ones viewing the &quot;center&quot; can see a <em>lot</em> of detail (dense) and the rest are quite inaccurate on static detail (sparse); the illusion of the entire field of view being crisp is &quot;made up&quot; by your mind. you can't put your sight on one word in this paragraph and read the whole thing, but it still looks like a paragraph of words on a website on a screen in a room (or wherever you are). the parts of your eye viewing the periphery are <em>really</em> good at seeing motion - like a fly, or a predator. think of when you look for shooting stars in the night sky: you can kinda sense when one is within your field of vision, but you don't feel like you've really seen it until you move the center of your vision (your focus) to it after detecting it in the periphery.</p></div>		</li>
