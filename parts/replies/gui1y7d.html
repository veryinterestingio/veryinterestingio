			<div class="markdown"><p>To take it out a step, there's some debate about what group seahorses + pipefish are most closely related to.  In the past, they were thought to be relatives of sticklebacks, but more recently people tend to put them with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aulostomoidei" target="_blank">trumpetfish and relatives</a>.  One potential close relative (at least the last time I checked) was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasidae" target="_blank">seamoths</a>, which are really weird little fish a bit like stubby pipefish with big pectoral fins.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sea dragon, pipefish, sticklebacks, trumpetfish, seamoths...</p>

<p>If I didn't already know seahorses exist, I'd think y'all were just making stuff up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a kind of ridiculous but typical naming scheme.  Does this fish look even <em>vaguely</em> like anything on land?  Call it &quot;Sea X&quot; or &quot;X fish&quot;.  Comes from an older view of the world where sea and land should be sort of mirror worlds of each other, just with everything in the ocean being fish-themed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can certainly make use of genetics but this is not as straightforward as 'just use the DNA', but quite complicated and depending on which parts of the DNA you look at, or which assumtions you make could end up with different answers. Not just a matter of taking a sample, sequencing it and then being completely sure what the most closely related species are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're listening to two people talk in a second language and trying to work out which of several people taught them to speak it. You have perfect information about all the characteristics of their speech, but no access to the teachers. Some of the characteristics of their speech will suggest one or the other teacher, but rarely will it be completely obvious.</p>
<p>Now imagine that you're trying to work out whether their teacher's teacher's teacher was the same person or not, based only on how they speak today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, it's a thing, but no, it doesn't really work like that.</p></div>		</li>
