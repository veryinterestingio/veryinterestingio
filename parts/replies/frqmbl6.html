			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory. But imagine you're a US-based company, and you want to open a chain in Australia. Now you'd need to set up an entirely new and separate Australia company. And a UK company, and a France company, and a Japanese company... You'd have to set up new companies for every country you do business in, which is impractical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great, you've done that. The property is now owned by a company in your country. That company is an unknown though, so they're going to have to license the original company's brand. Oh, look, the profits are all in the Cayman Islands again! You just spent millions and caused a lot of hassle for legitimate companies, spent a load of political capital, and achieved nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, companies can do this because they're given massive leeway in evaluating the price of transferred goods. Yes, there's a rule requiring that transfer prices be set as if separate firms had negotiated the price, but that's historically been extremely hard to enforce.</p>
<p>But also, it's not <em>just</em> buildings. This was a simplified ELI5 version. Oftentimes, a lot of it has to do with &quot;royalties&quot; being paid by 'Globocorp' for the ability to license intellectual property (e.g. patents) for which the rights themselves are retained by 'GLH Ltd.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You yourself can live in, say, Monaco, a country that has a 0% personal income tax.</p>
<p>So, GLH Ltd. would pay you (the owner) the money as a dividend. The money now transfers ownership from GLH Ltd. to you.</p>
<p>Normally, this would (obviously) be when you'd pay personal income tax on your income, but because Monaco has no personal income tax, this transfer of money would experience no taxes.</p></div>		</li>
