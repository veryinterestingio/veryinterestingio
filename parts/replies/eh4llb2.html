			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a clinical psychology PhD student and I've heard EMDR described at PE + magic basically saying that what works in EMDR is the exposure the rest is just window dressing or as one professor said &quot;for EMDR what works isn't new and what's new doesn't work&quot;. I know lots of people swear by it (this whole post shows that) but I want to see better trials head to head trials. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I was losing my mind! I’m reading though all the stuff in this thread supporting EDMR, and just last week I did some study and read a meta-analysis of EDMR studies. Everything concludes that EDMR is better than nothing, but no better than basic exposure techniques sans the eye movement! It blows my mind how rampant the misinformation is here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an (unsubstantiated) theory that most people react badly to the idea that one of the most evidence based ways to improve mental health is via changing either cognitions or behavior both of which require a lot of effort on the part of the patient and provider. So when the behavior/cognition change mechanism can be disguised or avoided altogether people think of it as more &quot;real medicine/science&quot; and less effort. Thus you see lots of fans of things like EMDR, TMS, and microdosing (not saying these are bad/completely ineffective just not proven superior) when the literature has shown again and again that for most people medication +/- CBT (any flavor) or CBT+/- medication  are the most effective treatments we have right now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it outperform placebo therapy? Is there such a thing? Just talking to someone casually about something unrelated to their psychology might qualify, I guess?</p>
<p>When descriptions of it come up it always sounds stunningly pseudoscientific to me, to the point that even if it does outperform placebo on some studies I'll probably remain skeptical of its effects, at least until larger scale evidence comes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you aren't interested in anecdotal evidence but I am 1000% confident that it works better than talking about unrelated things. And I'm also sure it works better (or differently, really) than the kind of talk therapy I did before I tried EMDR. That also helped, but it was only through EMDR that I had some very intense re-experiencings of certain emotions, clear insights into their roots, and a dramatic reduction in disassociative tendencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talk therapy has comparable outcomes, as the NIH review of research indicates. That is not unusual.  Meta-analyses of therapy methods indicate that almost all forms of therapy — regardless of form or philosophical background — have some positive impact.  Exceptions include specific treatments for specific disorders such as behavioral treatment for Autism. (A meta-analysis grabs all available sound research studies and combines outcomes for a kind of super analysis.)  There is no evidence that EMDR is superior to other methods of treatment, such as talk therapy.  From that perspective, if you prefer a certain form of treatment and like the outcome, that’s a good choice for you. It might not be a good choice for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From your perspective, do you think 'time' spent until remission is a valid measurement for therapies?  Considering the gaps in mental health awareness and the lack of access to mental healthcare, can/should we make our therapy treatments shorter(if it maintains efficacy) to insure more people have the opportunity?</p>
<p>The most recent example I can think of is TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) being explored with just 5 minute treatments vs the 30-40 minute treatments with no apparent loss in effectiveness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always interpreted the similarity in effectiveness between disparate forms of treatment to mean —they are all based on bullshit. We just don’t understand the human mind enough to make real theoretically-sound treatments. It’s true they work, because any intentional effort to improve a thing will usually help some, but they don’t work any better than non-evidence-based bullshit. </p>
<p>Emdr is a great example. It’s based on the outlandish theory that bilateral stimulation will help you access memories on a deeper level, and yet it performs as well as our best CBT, which is totally unrelated. That tells me CBT was never that well-founded in the first place. Just like how freud’s psychoanalytic stuff was never that well-founded either. Again, they all work, somewhat, but that doesn’t mean they’re legit. One should not be able to pick a random therapy style out of a hat and expect it to work as well as any other!</p>
<p>Edit: my training is in educational psychology, btw. There is a famous Australian researcher in education who found something similar. Jon Hattie. He says that basically all educational interventions work. That is the nature of interventions —any time you dedicate to improving something will probably have at least some effect, at least you weren’t doing nothing. So make up any theory off the top of your head, implement it, and it’ll work! </p>
<p>His point though, was that that should not be good enough for us. We should be exclusively using the best of the best interventions, not whatever feels right at the time. So his work is in helping us prioritize them based on effect size. IMO, psychology needs a John Hattie, because it is mired in random interventions that don’t partularly work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one notable advantage to EMDR over talk therapy is that the patient does not need to put their trauma into words or say it aloud to a therapists. This is important as often trauma directly effects the speech areas of the brain (brocca’s and other systems), and many people find it impossible to put their trauma into words. Focusing on the sequence of events is only useful if the trauma is connected to the event, sometimes it’s not the event that is most traumatic but the processing of events or consequences that come after. For example, a sexual assault survivor may find the process of telling her spouse and the associated emotions more traumatic than the actual rape. Furthermore, not having to talk about the trauma each step along the way, in detail, to a therapist is much less humiliating and re-traumatising. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EMDR achieves the same results as trauma-focused CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy). The implementation of a pendulum is a gimmick with no scientific basis or justification. We won't see therapists using EMDR in the future, but as of now it's more or less equally effective as other go to treatments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For PTSD, talk therapy cannot compare, it is apples and oranges (different tools). </p>
<p>For me, EMDR treated the source of the trauma (very quickly and effectively), and talk therapy was the natural successor to help me make sense of all the things I never experienced.</p>
<p>I had PTSD from a very young age (borderline mother) and never experienced childhood like most. I went through EMDR at age 38. How bizarre to be an adult and suddenly have new experiences like a young child!</p>
<p>Both are important. My talk therapist sent me to a trauma therapist (took 5 sessions over 5 weeks), then back to talk therapy weekly for two years. </p>
<p>Whether we understand EMDR is unimportant to me; what is important is that others understand it can be profoundly effective. I think we should continue to seek understanding how it works, but should not discourage it's use until we have a full understanding.</p></div>		</li>
