			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your question! Climeworks’ direct air capture machines are powered solely by renewable energy or energy-from-waste. The core element of our technology are the CO₂ collectors, which selectively capture carbon dioxide in a two-step process. </p>
<p>First, air is drawn into the collector with a fan. Carbon dioxide is captured on the surface of a highly selective filter material that sits inside the collectors. Second, after the filter material is full with carbon dioxide, the collector is closed. We increase the temperature to between 80 and 100 °C - this releases the carbon dioxide. Finally, we can collect this high-purity, high-concentration carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>One of two things happens to the Climeworks air-captured carbon dioxide: either it is returned to earth, stored safely and permanently away for millions of years; or it is upcycled into climate-friendly products, such as carbon-neutral fuels and materials, fertilizer for greenhouses, or bubbles in your fizzy drinks. </p>
<p>Our main challenge is to bring down costs. We have a detailed cost reduction road map in place and we are confident we will reach a cost level of 200-250 USD/tCO2 in 3-4 year’s time. Our long-term cost target is USD 100 per ton. The main cost drivers are a combination of capex and opex. As we begin mass production, we will be able to reduce capex costs drastically.

<p>So this is a temperature swing process and presumably a lot of the operating expense will be the energy to heat up and cool down.  Do you have a way to recover any of this energy?  Using the heat from a unit that is done baking to start heating another unit that is done collecting, for instance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey Jan, </p>
<p>Awesome work you do there! </p>
<p>Is it possible to invest small amounts in your company or even buy shares? </p>
<p>Furthermore, what kind of people/employees do you possibly need in the future? </p>
<p>I would love to work for a company that's ecological and innovative like yours and I hope a new industry will be created once carbon pricing becomes effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Jan,</p>
<p>I'm currently a monthly subscriber to Climeworks and I appreciate everything y'all are doing.</p>
<p>I thought I read somewhere that $100 a ton has already been achieved by some companies. Is this true? </p>
<p>According to Carbon Engineering one of their facilities that could sequester 1 million tons of CO2 a year would take up roughly 150-300 acres of land. Doing some calculations in order to sequester 50 gigatons a year we would need a total land area roughly the size between Maryland and West Virginia (grant it this could be spread across the globe.) Do you think this amount of space can be significantly reduced or that Carbon Engineering is overestimating the space required?</p></div>		</li>

<p>And can it be implemented on a scale comparable to the size of the problem?</p></div>		</li>
