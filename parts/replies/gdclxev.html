			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure it depends on the camera.  Older and cheaper cameras were likely 100% manual, while newer cameras (1910s/1920s) might have had a motor or a flywheel mechanism to stabilize the speed.</p>
<p>You'd need to ask in one of the cinematography subreddits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really want to know the answer to this now. I won’t bother asking, I bet those subreddits have some arcane rules about asking questions. I don’t think I want to know so badly that I’ll read a rule list. The rules and wikis don’t even show up on the new reddit theme sidebar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer I learned from Corridor Digital, where they talked about &quot;undercranking&quot;, where you intentionally film at a lower FPS (by 1-2 FPS) so your action looks a bit quicker and like the actors are more competent fighters than they are able to portray on their own.</p>
<p>The other possibility now was said to be to film at a much higher FPS, so when you take out some frames to speed it up the time difference isn't as large and it doesn't &quot;skip&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that actually never occurred to me, I figured undercranking was mostly to save money or wear &amp; tear or tearing the film from the faster mechanical motion, but I can see how it makes all scenes more lively and might be a desired attribute.</p>
<p>Anyway I know old film buffs might know for sure about the purpose of undercranking.</p>
<p>I did put undercranking in Wikipedia but it just redirects to the time-lapse article... very disappointing and unencyclopedic.</p></div>		</li>
