			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m shocked that I had to scroll this far down to find the correct answer. Muscles produce the most overall heat. </p>
<p>Just wanted to add that constriction of your blood vessels in your extremities contributes strongly to the retention of heat, which is very important in heat regulation. Sweating and relaxation of those blood vessels are important for lowering your body temperature. I know that’s not technically what was asked, but these are just as important in thermal regulation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn’t the friction of blood passing through your vascular system also produce heat? I was on blood thinners once and laid in bed wearing my winter coat under heaps of blankets with the heat cranked up in mid-July and was still cold.</p>
<p>Are the two things related?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood thinners don’t actually make your blood less viscous or reduce the friction in your circulatory system, they just reduce your body’s ability to form clots. Why were you on blood thinners? That might have more to do with the cold feeling</p></div>		</li>
