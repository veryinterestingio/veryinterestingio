			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do it religiously every night but now I use sleep sounds majority of the time.</p>
<p>Let erratic but let you just drift off without the blaring screen. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.relaxio.sleepo" target="_blank">Sleepa</a> is my personal favourite app to use which lets you adjust the sounds you want.</p>
<p>A windy winter campfire is my all time favourite</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a similar app to this.</p>
<p>My favorite was either a windy thunderstorm with the fireplace going or thunderstorm while driving.</p>
<p>I really love storms. If there's a storm outside and it's anywhere near bedtime I'm done and going to bed almost immediately. I want to catch that magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is why I sleep with the t.v. on, ive tried explaining that I just cant get out of my head when its off, it draws out my thoughts. When I was a kid, I used to go to my moms room in the middle of the night in absolute tears because I could never &quot;turn my brain off&quot; I've counted many sheep in my life lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do podcasts now because you don't have to have a light on in the room so it doesn't mess with your sleep hormone stuff as much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is a chore for me either way, if I tried watching something while sleeping to get my mind to stop wondering, I’d need to finish what I’m watching even if I’m not 100% into it, because if it’s not entertaining me my mind wonders, vicious cycle lol. Podcast are the same for me, if I fall asleep without pausing it I get anxious I won’t find where I left off.</p></div>		</li>
