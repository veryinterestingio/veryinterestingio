			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I love this. I make a huge deal in my classes about dispelling students of the notion that plants some how &quot;turn sunlight into food&quot;. I explain the process and use a metaphor of a toaster -- Carbon dioxide is bread, the chloroplast is the toaster, and glucose is the toast. The sunlight is the electricity powering the thing. I do a whole song and dance about it and then sum up by saying &quot;So plants don't make more plant out of sunlight... They make it out of air!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;plants can't just make more mass out of sunlight.  That's stupid.  They make it out of thin air&quot;</p>
<p>I actually realized that they get their mass from CO2 a few years back when I was like &quot;you can't just create atoms out of nowhere, so they can't use sunlight to make mass, because photons aren't atoms... And it's not water because there's no carbon... So they must get it from soil.  No, wait...</p>
<p>That little bit of soil isn't enough for a full sized sunflower...  So... Oh damn, do they make it out of the CO2?!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s crazy to think about it in such simple terms really! </p>
<p>All a tree does is take the carbon out of the carbon dioxide and put it in its roots and trunk etc. leaving it there is ideal, but even when we cut that tree treat it and turn it into furniture - we are actually capturing and storing some carbon from the atmosphere!</p></div>		</li>

<p>My comment only wants to encourage you not to be afraid to oversimplify. I know on reddit there is always the comment &quot;You oversimplify! That leaves out xyz, we need to talk about that&quot;. But do not worry about that comment! There are always readers who need the simplified version (first).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. ELI5 is oversimplification. You know, like you were explaining it to a five year old. That isn’t a bad thing, it gives a starting point for learning more, but they are the same thing, outside of Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a comment that sounded apologetic for oversimplifying something.</p>
<p>I wanted to stress that there is no need for that, especially not here.</p>
<p>What did you read?</p></div>		</li>
