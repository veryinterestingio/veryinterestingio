			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. </p>
<p>I have a PhD in Earth sciences (specialising in lunar geology) and this is by far the most precise and succinct way I have seen it described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One small comment for people who want to dig into the topic deeper.</p>
<p>Given that the orbit of the Moon around the Earth is elliptical, its orbiting speed is not constant. Indeed it varies significantly. Near the Earth (in perigeum) the Moon flies faster than far from the Earth.</p>
<p>But, of course, the rotational speed IS constant (at least from our point of view, it slows down over millenia, but imperceptibly to us). Moon always rotates at the same speed.</p>
<p>This difference gives birth to a phenomena called longitudinal libration. The Moon &quot;wobbles&quot; a bit from our perspective. Thus, we can see slightly more than only 50 per cent of the Moon. But our view the regions near the edges of the disc is distorted by perspective nevertheless.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That famous Wikipedia libration gif is one of my all-time favourite images, because it shows something that most people will have never themselves observed or even considered, that is still fundamental about the way our planet and its satellite behave. It's one of those thoughts that really gives me pause that no human had seen the far side of the moon EVER, <strong><em>AT ALL</em></strong>, until 1959. Literally within the lifetime of my father.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a correction. Mercury is not tidally locked it is locked in a spin-orbit resonance (which is not locked indefinitely), these are two related but different things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also add (because almost every description I read about tides misses this crucial detail) that neglecting dissipation of tidal energy in the conversation is inadequate. Gravity on its own can not cause orbital evolution of the system. You need the transfer of spin-orbit energy due to tides to be imperfect (due to dissipation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So rather than type a load of stuff and try and explain it in words <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiHFzM9anzY" target="_blank">here is a video</a> that has a nice picture and good explanation of resonances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not indefinitely persistent but can be long lived even on astronomical timescales. The reason being is resonance can only exist if the total torque in 1 cycle from the resonance is greater than the total torque in one cycle from tidal drag (essentially dissipation). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second reason is because there are other objects in the system that have a small but sustained impact on the object. Resonances are long term stable to small perturbations but may become unstable to a persistent accumulation of perturbations. In fact for Mercury, which is in a spin orbit resonance with the Sun, is regarded as marginally stable. What this means is that the timescale for Mercury to be ejected from the system (or sent into the Sun) is the same timescale as the lifetime of the system (hence marginal as it may or may not happen).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiHFzM9anzY" target="_blank">this video</a> gives a nice explanation. Although it is not overly thorough as resonances are quite a tricky subject.</p></div>		</li>
