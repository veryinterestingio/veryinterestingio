			<div class="markdown"><p>Representing clouds continues to be a challenge for climate models. Important processes in clouds occur on scales of inches and feet (or centimeters and meters if you prefer). Climate models typically have grid cells that might be 100 miles or kilometers on a side. So all of these small scale cloud processes need to be crudely represented in a model that is not explicitly representing physics at that scale. We just don’t have computers that can represent the whole world at the scale of cloud processes.  Similar problems occur in representing ecosystems.  So, in short, I would say that much of the progress is coming in improving representations of what is known as “sub-grid-scale processes”. - Ken</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you're talking about is called &quot;adaptive mesh refinement&quot; and while previous generations of climate models don't use it, it's an active area of research and one of the ways that newer generations of models can improve.</p>
<p>However, it's not easy at all to integrate AMR into existing models that are built on a fixed mesh (some of these models have code dating back to the 70s and 80s!). It's not widespread yet because of the host of implementation challenges it brings. It's an area of active research. Here are some papers on the topic:</p>

<p>sidenote: weather models are run in big &quot;ensembles&quot; where the same model, or many different models, are run many times with slightly different parameters or different starting conditions. Resolution is one of the parameters that is varied in some ensembles (multi-resolution ensemble). I think there are ways to connect multi-resolution ensemble output with adaptive mesh approaches, but I'm really really far from an expert in this area. Going into ensemble data assimilation is really opening a can of worms too big for one comment.</p>
<p>Anyway, if what I'm saying is bullshit please feel to correct me, actual climate scientists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the person you responded to but I am a scientist who deals with climate simulations from time to time.</p>
<p>One thing I have seen is nested modeling, where a large grid size is used over most of the planet and then those outputs are used as boundary conditions for a much higher resolution grid over and area or feature of interest. I assume this is what you mean by adaptive resolution, but I'm not familiar with the cosmological simulations you're referencing. In climate studies this is usually reserved for so-called &quot;mesoscale&quot; modeling, which is more regionally focused than globally focused. I've never heard of such a thing being down down the centimeter scale though, usually grid cells for mesoscale models are still tens of meters across at least.</p></div>		</li>
