			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!  I don't know.  My guess is that a cylinder is especially easy to shape using a lathe.  Lathes are easy to build and very accurate, while shaping a perfect cube requires a mill which is more complicated and difficult to align.  Also, when an object is handled, bumps and scrapes tend to cause the most damage at at the edges and corners, and a cylinder has fewer of those.</p>
<p>If anyone knows much about the design and construction of the prototype kilogram, I'd love to learn more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why the shape was chosen, but I would point out that geometrically an approximate cylinder has a lot fewer degrees of freedom than an approximate cube.</p>
<p>With the cylinder, you have radius, flatness of two faces, length, squareness of the faces with the central axis, and roundness of the cylinder.  The central axis itself serves as a very obvious reference for measuring everything else.</p>
<p>With a cube, you have squareness in 13 edges, length and width of six faces and flatness of six faces.  There is no obvious datum to refer to, so you are forced to arbitrarily pick a face and measure against that.</p>
<p>Again, I am guessing based on geometry (no expertise), but I would think that you could machine and measure the volume of the cylinder with fewer total measurements than the cube, and thus less overall uncertainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t quote me on this, but I think I read somewhere that the cylinder was chosen because ideally to preserve the mass standard for as long as possible you want a small surface-area-to-volume ratio. That would be a sphere, but a sphere is extremely inconvenient to weigh and somewhat inconvenient to store (spheres tend to roll.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be the pedant, <a href="https://youtu.be/-2ygW0fSnjg" target="_blank">you can definitely make a cube on a lathe.</a>.</p>
<p>It was only recently that I stumbled across that video otherwise I totally thought it wasn't possible. I didn't consider doing it by machining faces one at a time.</p>
<p>Maybe others find it as fascinating as I did!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's much simpler to mill and measure.</p>
<p>Let's compare milling a cube to a cylinder:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Machine accuracy: a mill must be properly trammed in on both axes, whereas a lathe simply needs to not cut a taper.  Generally speaking, it's easier to do this sort of precision work on a lathe where the cutting tool moves, rather than a mill where the work moves relative to the tool.  Cylinders cut on a lathe are a fairly clear winner here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Machine operations:  Cutting a cylinder only requires re-positioning the work once (to work on the opposite face), whereas a cube really needs 6.  This is simply more opportunity for error and more work to do.  Precision is also much better on a 4-jaw chuck compared to a mill vise; the former is inherently more symmetrical, whereas the mill vise must carefully account for clamping forces and the inevitable deflection.  Precision work-holding on a mill vise is quite complicated, and ultimately depends on the strength and design of the mill table casting.  This is all before the era of the modern Kurt vise design.</p>
</li>
<li>Inspection: Cylinders are about as simple as you get.  You measure the length and the diameter.  It's very easy to determine whether the machine cut a taper.  The faces will naturally be square so long as they are flat.  Cubes are a nightmare of ensuring each face is square to the others.  Ultimately, a cylindrical square (it sounds funny, but it's just a cylinder on it's end that gives a reliable 90 degrees to a surface plate) will be used to do this metrology anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>A further concern is the final grinding operation that provides the highest degree of precision.  I don't know too much about how this would have been done.  It seems to me that a tool-post grinder would be better for achieving the precision required than a grinding machine.  The precision of the latter depends on the accuracy of the machine ways, which must contend with the forces of gravity to avoid deflection through the range of motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For operation this accurate the tool wear is a big factor. On lathe most operations will be continuous cuts, but on cube there will be interrupted cuts which wear cutting edge extremely.</p>
<p>I still don't understand why volume or shape of a weight standard matters. Why not just make a cylinder, add a keyslot. Adjust by grinding the keyslots on the reference copies. Sure make it shiny etc. for reduced environmental reaction but why wank around with extremely exact shaping. Or was is so that definition was a geometrical shape full of certain material?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a great book called the perfectionists on the history of precision that goes into this. I do believe the using a lathe is correct- it’s actually super complicated to make something as precise as the cylinders, because length varies with temperature, etc. </p>
<p>The book is by Simon Winchester and although it sounds like the driest book ever it’s actually really good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has been bothering me... Why is it a kilogram. If we defined a unit to be equal to a lump of platinum in Paris. Why did we define the base unit as &quot;1/1000th the mass of the object?&quot; it seems like they would have made the object = 1 Gram</p>
<p>Was this experiment standardizing the value of a gram and it was easier at the time to work with a kilogram</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waaaay back during the French revolution, the original units were the meter and the gram.  But most meter-sized objects weigh many thousands of grams, so it was more convenient to choose the meter and kilogram the official reference units.  You're right, it's weird, but we're stuck with it.</p>
<p>If you don't like having a prefix stuck to your base unit of mass, there is an alternative system of units used by physicists, in which the gram is the unit of mass, and ... surprise! the centimeter! is the unit of length, because nothing is ever simple.  Because this system has smaller values, it's most often used by ... surprise! astrophysicists! measuring the biggest things in the universe.</p>
<p>The metric system is a beautiful concept, but some of the details make no sense at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see some answers that shed some light on the situation, but they miss the most important aspect of the introduction of the metric system in 1795: politics. Tl;dr at the bottom.</p>
<p>The new system was put in place in 1793 because the old one was a mess and because a somewhat important political change just had taken place. During this time the new base unit was given three names: the gravet (1 gram), the grave (1 kg) and the bar (1 Mg). These were based on a provisional value of the metre (which tured out to be .03% wrong), so when the actual metre was defined in 1795, the grave changed 0.09%, along with the temperature of water also being changed from 0 to 4 degrees Celcius (water is at its densest at this temperature).</p>
<p>Because of this, and because of the changing political climate, they decided to rename the standard mass to gram (or gramme), from greek, meaning &quot;a small mass&quot;. Now, which of the old units were they going to choose? The bar was probably too large for everyday life, so it was down to the grave or the gravet. The problem though is that &quot;grave&quot; also can mean something else, it can be translated to the English word &quot;count&quot;, ie. someone from the nobility. So if the grave represented the nobility, the gravet can therefore be said to represent the common folk.</p>
<p>So you have two masses to choose from to make you base unit from, and one literally translates to count, and is a thousand times heavier (better) than the smaller unit. In a country which just has had enough of everythig noble, the answer is pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: We didn't name a kilogram gram because France had had a revolution, and the old unit corresponding to a kg represented the noble class, while the old unit corresponding to a gram represented the working class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably at least partially an accuracy thing. If you can make it accurate to within a thousandth of a gram (it's probably a lot smaller than that) then a gram reference weight could be off by 0.001% where as that same thousandth of a gram inaccuracy is only 0.000001% at a kilo. </p></div>		</li>
