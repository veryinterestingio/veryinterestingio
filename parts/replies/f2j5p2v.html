			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 40, bought a house when I was 20, at low level trade wages. My son is starting out the same way, no way he can buy a house. Housing here is 6x more expensive than when I first bought, compared to wages which have only doubled in that time, it's basic fucking math.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And it's still rising. That 190k house was last valued at 260k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh based on my Midwestern city you can probably still buy a house in Ohio for 40k, but it'd probably need a lot of work.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm sorry to hear about Ohio's real estate  situation. In comparison, in Buffalo you can buy a fixer upper right next to downtown in a sketchy area for $50-80k or you can buy a fixer upper for $50-80k and be a half hour out in a decent area. Fully liveable houses would be in the 100s, going to 200/300 depending on the area/condition of the home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I genuinely fear for my two children (both under 5). I am actively saving now to try and pay for their university tuition up front, so they aren’t buried with loans when they graduate (if they go to uni that is). I also intend to spend any inheritance I get from my family on property to later sell to them at a discount so they can get on the property ladder without spending years saving for a deposit.</p>
<p>I’ll probably have a lot less comforts in life as a result, but I can’t bear the idea that they will have little to no leisure in their adult life because of they way the desk is stacked against them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently in the process of building my own house. I'm a bit on the older side, but my wife and I have a good job. When we bought the land, one of the requirements was that it was big enough. Reason for this is literally to be able to offer something to my daughters, because I doubt they will be able to have anything by the time they are of age.</p>
<p>I have the surface now to build a small second house (25m square) that they will be able to stay in when they grow a bit older and want to have some privacy. There's 6 years difference between them, so by the time the second one wants to move out, the first should have a bit of a head start.</p>
<p>I just hope it will be enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandfather worked at a lumber mill, of all places, and on a single income bought a house, car, couple of snowmobiles and spent his retirement traveling across North America in a RV. My father had a middle wage teacher job, and easily bought multiple houses and now owns one whose value I don't even want to think about. I have a much better job than they did, comparatively, but I have trouble paying rent on a broken down apartment and at this point I've given up and I am just looking for ways to emigrate to a better country.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same shit, new place.</p>
<p>The squeeze is on everywhere. Maybe Scandi countries are better, but have fun between October and May.</p>
<p>If you want to live in a major metro area in Europe, good luck affording a detached structure of your own, or just a row house. And note they do not have American standards of space there for the most part, so the house you end up with is going to probably be packed in with a bunch of others, be 100+ years old, and have less space than many American apartments. And it's still going to cost a ton relative to income.</p>
<p>The best bet is to move to a cheaper metro area in the US that still has decent wages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some won't stop being renters by choice. House prices in my city now exceed 30 rent years.</p>
<p>It's insane. Why would I ever buy in that market? The answer is easy of course. I should believe that housing prices will continue to rise. </p>
<p>But I'm not paying 5-8 rent months in interest every year on the loan just to make that gamble - and pay maintenance/repair on top of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here. I could easily afford a house at this point, but I have 0 desire to be locked in to a $1600-2000/mo payment for decades. I've seen years of my short adult life where work was nearly impossible to come by. What happens when that returns?</p>
<p>So I rent a cheap apartment, save the $500-1000/mo I would have spent on a mortgage, and avoid any of the responsibilities of home ownership. Who has time for managing a structure anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. If I lived in say, Melbourne, where the average house now costs over fucking $800k, there's no way I'd bother trying to get into the market. It's bad enough having to pay body corporate fees and rates where I am.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. 2011-2013ish. That's when the housing market bottomed out and if you were lucky enough to have a decent job and down payment money because you lived with your parents it was the best time to buy. I was late at 2016 but I bought a fixer upper and lived with my parents while I gutted the house. There is no way could if done this if I had a family or had to pay rent.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Millenials (once upon a time called &quot;Gen Y&quot;) are individuals born between 1982 and 2000 which makes them anywhere between 19 and 37. Gen Z which follows are individuals born after 2000 (no real ending point has been defined yet but ~2018 is a reasonable expectation) meaning the absolute oldest possible age someone from Gen Z could be is almost 19 and as young as almost 2. Assuming a fairly standard distribution of ages across that time period would give the average age around 10-11. (6th grade in the US)</p>
<p>Edit: This is according to the most long standing definitions of Millenial as defined by the guys who coined the term and by the US census bureau. There has been a push in the last few years to redifine Millenial as ending in 1995ish until 2010 whih would make Gen Z  between 9 and and 24 still giving an average age of 16 - 17</p></div>		</li>
