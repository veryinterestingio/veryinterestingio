<p>The slope is so that the snow will fall off the roof before it is too heavy and the roof caves in. The little fences stop chunks falling off in lighter snowfalls and to stop ice falling in the case of snow melting and refreezing, without them there would be a constant danger of snow and ice falling off.</p>
<p>Most houses also have a stick  attached to the wall which Indicates the safe distance you should stand away from the wall as in the case of heavy snowfall, there is still a risk of snow and ice falling down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that: in Germany there is sth. called Wohngebäudehaftpflicht which roughly translates to sth like house liability. So if you are the owner of a building you have to pay for damages it is &quot;responsible&quot; for.
Falling snow/ice is one of the things that could happen. Another example is tiles that fall from the roof through winds.
If you do have this little fence on your roof, most building liability insurances will cover damages from falling ice without questioning.</p></div>		</li>

In order to maximise living space, after that level is reached, steep roofs allow for more living space. That's what OP is referring to, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is true mathematically, but not in terms of building materials (or the cost of getting them).</p>
<p>The foundation of a house has to support the roof.  And a roof is nifty in that it spreads its load evenly around the foundation.  Even the most basic roof is somewhat like an arch.  It supports itself rather well.  If you add walls, then the foundation has to support walls, walls that can support a roof mind you, and a roof.  More height/stories?  More foundation, more wall to support wall to support roof.  It quickly becomes an exercise of diminishing returns (until you start adding in modern materials and engineering).  </p>
<p>Furthermore a vertical wall isn't terrible stable.  Adding more walls to buttress certainly helps, but you end up with smaller and more divided livable area interior.  Big Cathedrals get around this by throwing up flying buttress outside.  But Churches of that era owned all kinds of land.</p>
<p>Lastly, and back to the materials point, walls are relatively 'expensive'.  Build a log cabin and you'll quickly find that a single log is heavy, difficult to shape/fit precisely, and doesn't add much to size of the cabin.  To put it simply, you need <em>lots</em> of logs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a roof is much cheaper.  Trickier maybe in the details of construction.  But lighter and takes much less material.</p>
<hr />
<p>A really easy way to think of it is, what would you take camping?  A tent?  Dome or A frame, they are basically all roof.  Only staked down these days to prevent them from blowing away.  Or a kiosk style portable tent?  With the heavy frame just to get that roof up high.  Yeah, youre going to want to have a couple of people just to take that on a hike.</p>
<hr />
<p>A lot of these considerations are obviated by modern materials and design.  But there is a <strong>lot</strong> of traditional design momentum behind the way we view houses.  It is a simple fact that many people that are taking out a 25+year mortgage don't want their investment/home/family nest to be a concrete pill box.</p>
<p>Edit: Ty for the gold stranger.  If you care to do more (or future you) donate time/money to habitat for humanity.  It will help people and you can learn a bit about how homes are put together (it can be a selfish reason too, such knowledge isn't a waste if you ever need to do some light home repairs of your own!).</p></div>		</li>
