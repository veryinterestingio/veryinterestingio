			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick FYI (not contridictory to your statement.. more an append adding to) .  Canyons underwater are called &quot;Submarine Canyons&quot;.  The largest and deepest submarine canyon ever discovered is in the middle of the Bering Sea called the Zhemchug Canyon. It is deeper than the Grand Canyon (1.83 km deep) at 2.6km deep. Zhemchug Canyon is the largest submarine canyon in the world, based on drainage area (11,350 km2) and volume (5800 km3).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that analysis.</p>
<p>But I have more to add to it. It pretty much goes that a steep mountain is never more than about 500 meters higher than its neighbors. The reason is that the unconfined strength of the bottom exposed rock at the bottom is the limiting cause. When the rock at the bottom of a cliff shatters outward, the rocks above it also shatter and collapse, and we have a rock-fall. If that rock were confined, it could support more weight. The mitigating feature of under sea, is that felsic rocks which typically weigh 2.8 gm/cc only weigh 1.8 gm/cc when in water due to buoyancy. But when you're talking unlithified sediments in the continental slope, then you get into special magick, in that environment, even a slope of less than 1 degree can have a slide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I had no idea that underwater landslides could happen with such a shallow gradient. That's wild. I guess it has something to do with water lubricating the sediment layers?</p>
<p>One assumption I made is that the angle of repose is steeper if you have lower gravity, and that adding buoyancy is similar to lowering gravity. Ignoring the complications water lubrication, is that even true for sand on other lower gravity planets? </p>
<p>It's complicated! I found <a href="https://throughthesandglass.typepad.com/through_the_sandglass/2012/05/reposing-differently-on-mars.html" target="_blank">this</a> blog post about the angle of repose under 1/10th g, simulated in a hyperbolic plane. It turns out that while the <em>static</em> angle of repose is steeper with lower g, the <em>dynamic</em> angle of repose shallower. So on Mars you get <em>both</em> dunes with steeper faces <em>and</em> landslides along a shallower gradient than Earth. Weird!</p>
<p>None of this matters much for my original comment, which assumes that you're digging your canyon into bedrock.</p></div>		</li>
