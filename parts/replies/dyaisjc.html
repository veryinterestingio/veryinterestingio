			<div class="markdown"><p>I live a 2 and a half minute walk from work. I literally wake up, get out of bed, shower and brush my teeth, put clothes on and go straight to work. </p>
<p>Every day.. every single fucking day, people think I’m hungover because I still have that sleepy groggy look while at work. I have to explain to new people that I’m not hungover, I just literally woke up 10 minutes ago.</p>
<p>Edit: the benefit to this is that once people know, I can go into work hungover and people won’t know the difference ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea you can tell the morning people from the not morning people. We work rotating 6-6 shifts. When it's 6am I look like I'm hungover because I literally rolled out of bed and came to work 15 minutes prior. Then the older guys come in looking like they've been up since 3am and are already on their 3rd coffee of the day. They just won't. stop. talking.</p></div>		</li>
