			<div class="markdown"><p>A few errors here. The kidneys are not responsible for detecting hypertonicity (e.g. as might occur after a salty snack). The kidneys are responsible for regulating blood volume, and will only induce thirst (via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) in the case of low blood volume. </p>
<p>Osmometric thirst (e.g. due to salty snacks) is controlled by sensory organs in the brain itself, which detect blood osmolarity by measuring osmotic pressure (this is different from baroreceptors!) across the osmoreceptor cells' membranes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I’ll amend my post. I wasn’t amazing on this topic at uni so feedback is great!
Didn’t add the part about aldersterone, angiotensin and renin feedback loop seeing as it doesn’t feel very eli5, and I don’t remember that part well enough to make it eli5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha thanks. Ultimately it’s a complex process and it’d be better suited to ELI10 lol. The less it’s explained the more questions you leave but the more it’s explained the more complicated it gets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also receptors in the brain that detect salt concentration (central osmoreceptors) that trigger a thirst response and release of ADH (hormone that helps retain water in the kidneys)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good add! I forgot about ADH/vasopressin. I nearly got there when I talked the kidneys holding onto more water.
Totally unaware about the osmoreceptors, although they sound vaguely familiar.</p></div>		</li>
