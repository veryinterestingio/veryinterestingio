			<div class="markdown"><p>Rivers were drastically rerouted as well. A few million years ago, most of the midwest was instead drained by a major river, the Teays, that flowed across north central Indiana, southeast through Ohio state, to West Virginia roughly where the Kanawaha river is today. Its no coincidence that the Ohio River runs along the southern edge of glaciation. As glaciers advanced then retreated all that water needed and outlet and found one in what was, prior to that point a modest sized river that mostly drained parts of Tennessee and Kentucky. In fact, even headwaters that were never a previous part of any midwestern drainage basin began to find outlets to this much expanded Ohio River. The areas around Pittsburgh and the Allegheny river found themselves first cut off from the Great Lakes, then later, as the ice age ended, needing an outlet and eventually found one by turning minor branches of the Teahys into the upper Ohio river.</p>
<p>In the mountainous West Virginia section of the Ohio river drainage basin there were similar processes to what was happening with glacial lakes in the PNW that OP refers, albeit on a smaller scale due to the topography. As ice and water accumulated in the hills and valleys, the old rivers and streams could become blocked and these natural dams would overflow or sometimes outright break and, over time, the result was new valleys. The end result was the northern and central areas of the state ended up with a few new rivers (though not the New River specifically, which is, ironically, an ancient river just outside the impacted glaciated area) in one valley and overtop the next hill, a second, older valley, remnants of the old Teahys river system or those rivers that flowed through Pittsburgh to Lake Erie. You can even fairly easily trace this yourself with a satellite or topographic map because an interstate (I-79) was built along nearly the entire length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who grew up in the finger lakes region and doesnâ€™t know local history in the west, I would have asked the opposite question: why did glaciers make such an impact in the northeast US, but not the west.  </p>
<p>Excellent topic, thanks everyone, lots of good stuff to learn</p></div>		</li>
