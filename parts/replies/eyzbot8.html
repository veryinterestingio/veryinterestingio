			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a molecular biologist - not to be arrogant, but pretty much every other answer on this post is wrong. The answer, as far as we know, is no. We can use viruses in medicine, either to make vaccines or in gene therapies - but that's not their natural behaviour, and they don't spread through populations. You could argue that the act of developing immunity to a virus could be a net benefit (like how immunity to cowpox conferred immunity to smallpox), but that is not really due to the actions of the virus itself. You could again argue that viruses have played an important role in evolution by allowing genomic rearrangements and horizontal gene transfer - again, not an immediate effect of the virus, and not likely good for the individual. Most of the other answers refer to these, but to call these processes a direct beneficial effect of a virus is misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting counterpoint, I hadn't considered phage. I interpreted the question as asking whether there was something with a direct positive effect. I'm also not sure if I would say that phage spread through a human population, and I'm not convinced that they're key to human immunity. But yeah, thanks - good point, you could probably argue that phage fit the bill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is a valid question but... What about mitochondria?
Edit: I can't see the replies under this for some reason. I brought up mitochondria because they have a different DNA and it is believed they were a different independent living being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mitochondria are thought to have been a bacteria, not a virus. I’m not aware of any evidence suggesting mitochondria initially “invaded” the original host, so it would not be a negative that turned into a positive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how direct you want the answer to be. Viruses of pathogenic bacteria come to mind. Also, human mutualistic bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that cultural evolution is a valid one here. Ideology, customs and behaviour spread between humans like a virus especially in more recent times with vastly increased connectivity. If you'd like to read further, Richard Dawkins comments on the &quot;cultural meme&quot; and wikipedia on the origin of the word meme is very interesting!!
Although as a side note we are also VERY aware that this type of spread may not always be positive.
From an evolutionary biologist! :)</p></div>		</li>
