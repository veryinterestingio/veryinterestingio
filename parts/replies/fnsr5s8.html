			<div class="markdown"><p>Full disclosure: Not my particular area of expertise. </p>
<p>Everything you think and feel is actually a bunch of chemicals doing their thing in your brain. You've probably heard of ones like serotonin and dopamine. Well, we have lots of different ones for all sorts of different things. Certain ailments, like narcolepsy and addison's, are the result of people not producing enough of the specific chemicals that tell us to wake up or be energetic in certain ways. </p>
<p>Narcolepsy seems to be a loss of production of orexin/hypocretin, which tells our body to make more energy. That's why cataplexy, getting suddenly exhausted after being highly emotional, happens so often with it. Unlike many other sleep disorders, narcolepsy is about energy, not just tiredness and being awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The exact cause and mechanisms behind narcolepsy are still a mystery. The other reply here mentions one of the common explanations, but its definitely a strange concept. </p>
<p>Essentially, your body and mind are like any other machine. They have processes that keep them running. these processes need to be told when to start and when to stop.   </p>
<p>Being awake takes a lot of work, and when the body normally decides &quot;hey its sleepy time&quot; it starts a chain reaction that will eventually lead to you falling asleep. In the 'normal' brain this is usually felt as 'my eyes are heavy, time to lay down!&quot;   </p>
<p>Essentially what happens with narcolepsy, is this chain reaction is not properly configured in the brains wiring. And instead of a smooth transition from awake to asleep, the brain misfires and goes right into the sleep time.   </p>
<p>The best analogy i can think of is computer code, if you have a perfectly working set of a code and the remove a few parenthesis, the whole thing falls apart and results in an error and crashes the whole system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello. I'm a PhD student researching circadian rhythms and I'm hoping we can talk about the &quot;brain region&quot; aspect of this a little bit more. Maybe no one except for me was thinking about this, and it absolutely leaves ELI5 territory, but it feels like two processes are being conflated in your idea of human brain timekeeping. </p>
<p>My central question is: are you talking about the <em>human perception of time</em> or the <em>biological encoding of time</em> and do you know they're related? </p>
<p>Some people here are asking questions about the &quot;brain clock&quot;. That title is rightfully given to the &quot;suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus&quot;(The SCN). This region directs the circadian changes in your physiology both inside and outside of your brain. It doesn't matter if you are awake, asleep, happy, sad, paying attention, etc. The SCN keeps on ticking regardless. The rate of this kind of time perception is partially maintained by processes inside individual cells. Each cell has proteins that break down and are remade over 24h. This is by far the closest thing to a clock that humans naturally have. (If anyone has questions about biological clocks, please ask, I love talking to people about them!)</p>
<p>But if we want to talk about <em>time perception</em> we're talking about something entirely different, and something I know much less about. It's also something scientists in general know a lot less about, and it is still argued about. This brain region v. that brain region. No brain region at all, something related to the speed of synaptic communication. Or perhaps an underlying neural network connecting several vastly separate areas. I'm sure a lot of people have stronger arguments for these possibilities than I do, but suffice it to say, this isn't settled science.</p>
<p>Finally, these two things (biological timekeeping and human time perception) are related. If you put someone into a place with no light, their biological timekeeping mechanism in the SCN breaks (lmk if you want more detail). When you do this, time perception also breaks. One of the most famous examples is Stephania Follini. She stayed in a dark cave as part of an experiment. She stayed for four months, but the day she came out, she thought that only two months had passed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you tell more about breaking the SCN, and your last paragraph in general?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely :)</p>
<p>So the SCNs job is to integrate information from a few different sources, use them to make decisions about the circadian rhythm, and then send that information out to other parts of the brain and body. As I said earlier, each individual cell has its own clock. But if all the cells were separate - like if you grew them in a petri dish - they would all end up starting at different times. If they did that inside your body, you'd end up having no rhythm at all.</p>
<p>The SCN can take information from individual cellular clocks and send signals to &quot;reset&quot; them, so that they will all agree on the time. Perhaps even more importantly, it takes information from the environment and uses that to &quot;reset&quot; the clocks. The strongest signal to reset it is light. That's why the shift between Daylight Savings Time and Standard Time sucks, the time you have to get up and go to work has shifted <em>in respect to the light cycle</em>. </p>
<p>If you put someone in constant darkness, the light &quot;reset&quot; is eliminated. There are some other, weaker but still important, ways to reset it (eating, exercising, sleeping, socializing), but in circadian research these things are usually done whenever the subject feels like it, so it stops being a truly external cue. At this point maybe you're wondering &quot;Doesn't the clock keep ticking anyway...?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, it does! But biology is imperfect. Most humans have a clock that's a little bit longer than 24h, so without cues, they will gradually shift later. (Mice usually have one that's a little bit shorter than 24h, so they shift earlier.) But gradually, different organs can start to shift in different ways. Light is part of what makes the SCN do its job, and without it, you've got clock chaos. </p>
<p>The same series of events can take place when you get travel-induced jetlag. If you do shift work, or look at a screen late at night (currently guilty lol) or do many other very normal modern behaviors, you can be &quot;breaking your clock&quot;. The effects of this are devastating, and if you're on Reddit there's a 99% chance that circadian disruption has played some role in your life. Depression, anxiety, ADHD, obesity, diabetes, memory loss, cancer, infertility, violence, suicide... you can't even talk about the effects without sounding like a conspiracy theorist (lmk if you want citations, I'm ranting now but can link things tomorrow haha).</p>
<p>Anyway, the link between the &quot;broken biological clock&quot; and problems with time perception is something I've only learned about tangentially, but I hope will have more research. There was a really cool study in the 80's where they put people in a situation with no circadian cues and then asked them to press a button when a certain amount of time went by. If you asked them to indicate when 1h had passed, everyone estimates longer than 1h, but the amount longer than 1h was <em>directly correlated</em> with the length of their behavioral cycle. Basically (although not this exact) everyone feels like there are 24h in their &quot;day&quot; but the &quot;hours&quot; they experience can be different lengths. On the other hand, if you ask people to indicate short amounts of time (10s-120s) they are equally distributed between under-estimation and over-estimation, and have no correlation with an individual's circadian rhythms. So, we almost certainly have two separate processes to encode the feeling of &quot;seconds-level&quot; and &quot;hour-level&quot; time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats super cool we have an actual mechanism for tracking time built into us. Why do some people keep a better natural track of time than others? Do some people have a better supply of those 24 hour proteins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not generally an issue of supply. There are some disorders that can make the proteins the wrong shape, or make them dissolve too quickly or too slowly. But these are pretty rare, and don't account for differences in the general population. </p>
<p>If you say someone has a &quot;better&quot; sense of time than someone else, I think there are a few different things you might mean? Like someone who is chronically late, that's a personality or cultural trait. Someone who is more aware of their surroundings and notices the angle of the sun or people's behaviors, again has a talent unrelated to circadian rhythms. </p>
<p>If you're talking about someone who has a natural sense of when to wake up, eat, and sleep, that person probably has a more regular schedule. Then it can be a chicken-and-the-egg kind of question, was their circadian clock &quot;louder&quot; to start out with, or did they do a better job of &quot;listening&quot; to it? </p>
<p>A lot of questions about individual differences in our clocks are still unanswered. Small mutations in parts of the clock can explain some things. Others can be better explained by looking at behavior. But because we're humans, things get complicated, <em>fast</em>. </p>
<p>If you're depressed, your hormones and behavior can conspire against you to break your clock. If you eat late at night, you're less likely to have normal sleep cycles, and therefore less likely to wake up or &quot;feel awake&quot; when you should. </p>
<p>This is barely touching your question, honestly, because there's definitely going to be influences of other totally unrelated hormones, neurotransmitters, personality, whether you drank a cup of coffee...</p></div>		</li>
