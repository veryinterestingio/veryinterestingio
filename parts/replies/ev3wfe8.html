The guys at Exxon <em>understand</em> the energy business, so they get appointed the run the Energy department, e.g. But that doesn’t mean they’ll run it in the best interest of The People.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The President(or any politician) only says Yes/No and does budget approval. The project planning and risk analysis is done by NASA before they propose the project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. It might be inefficient to change plans so often, but it's not like a President has demanded NASA to land a man on Jupiter which would be extremely dangerous because, well, it's made of gas. NASA presents the feasible options, and the President makes a decision based on those options.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only partially correct.  The US had plans for the Moon since before Mercury and Gemini which came before Apollo even; (and NACA/NASA has its origins as far back as 1946.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which succeeded in landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972. First conceived during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person Project Mercury which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to the national goal set by President John F. Kennedy of &quot;landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth&quot; in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo. Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eisenhower had already decided we wanted to go to the moon before Kennedy ever affirmed it.  Mercury first flew in September of 1959 which set the stage for the development of the Apollo missions.</p>
<p>Kennedy took to the program but as far as cabinets are concerned it was Eisenhower's who deserves the most credit for the US's ability to compete early in the Space Race of the 1960's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the big deal with Kennedy's speech wasn't to state that we were going to the moon, but that the target was now &quot;before the end of this decade&quot; which now meant that it had to be done in seven years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t believe this to be correct. I am under the impression that Trump wants to go to Mars and not the moon. He has repeatedly asked NASA why they need to go to the moon instead of going directly to mars.
The president do not control the budget, so basically have no say in where they are aiming for.</p></div>		</li>
