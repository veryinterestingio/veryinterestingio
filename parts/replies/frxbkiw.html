			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on... Dove is a syndet bar. Some people think the tight rubbery feeling a traditional soap causes is due to a difference in the ph of the soap and skin. Syndet bars is processed differently resulting in a bar that has a different ph than a traditional soap. A syndet bar will have a closer ph to human skin. Usually they're marketed as a cleansing bar. I think Aveeno, Cerave, Cetaphil, Vichy, La Roche Posay, Drunk elephant  also make them.</p></div>		</li>
