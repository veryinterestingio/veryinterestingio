			<div class="markdown"><p>So to my understanding there's two aspects of &quot;clean coal&quot; that need to happen for it actually to be clean... they actual do scrub it and remove impurities so it burns cleaner, but also isn't the biggest aspect having carbon capture? From what I've read, there's only one coal power plant in the US that does carbon capture and it's in Texas, so clean coal is a bit of a myth in that only one plant has really implemented it out of hundreds.</p>
<p>So is the acid rain part mostly removed by other standard practices and we just don't implement carbon capture across the board?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clean coal is also a myth in that even with scrubbers and other pollution controls for harmful pollutants, a “clean” coal power plant is still a significant source of harmful air pollutants like deadly fine particulates and mercury. They just can’t (or won’t) install sufficient controls to eliminate the emissions or even really get them below natural gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Acid Rain' is mostly caused by excess acidity. Rain is usually slightly acid due to CO2 causing acid. The problem was other atmospheric contaminates cause more acid in rain. So Carbon capture would not, in and of itself help much. It may inadvertently help if the process also captures other gases that cause acid rain. </p>
<p>What is more important is using sources of coal that are low in sulfur. There are different grades of coal. Using those with low sulfur puts fewer tons of sulfur in the air and thus cause less acid rain. Same for other fuels. A large amount of money is spent by petroleum companies cleaning sulfur out of oil so they can sell it. They regularly are lobbying against low sulfur standards. </p>
<p>Then there is also nitrous oxides. That deals with combustion temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;clean coal&quot; is used to talk about minimizing all forms of emissions, so you are correct.  Before climate change concerns got so important, though, metals, acid-forming gases, and particulates were seen as the major pollution problem from using coal for electricity generation.  Modern use of the term actually emphasizes carbon emissions reduction through the various solutions that you mention. </p>
<p>However, I am old and really only meant the term in the context of the question (which is what we used to think about when we talked about &quot;clean&quot; coal): The destruction from the acid, the poisoning of soils by metals, and the smell and dirt were what we worried about.  </p>
<p>That is, CO2 wasn't seen as a pollutant until climate change became such an obvious concern, which really is only in the past 20-25 years.  I am sure you have heard some people claim that CO2 isn't a pollutant.  It wasn't all that long ago that we all thought that way.  Didn't even think about CO2, really.  Times change.  You are right though, clean coal is a lot more than I meant by it when I used the term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really getting worse in China? I read they are closing down the majority of their coal plants and have already built so many nuclear plants and installed so much green energy methods that they are much better than the US when it comes to pollution generated per kWh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be out of date on that.  It used to be pretty severe, only a few years ago. They have the money and the governmental willpower, and the problem was pretty obvious, so it wouldn't surprise me if you are right.  I do not know for certain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few things. One is population density which means higher energy demands and more fossil fuel use. Another is that prevailing winds bring pollution from the west to the east. And, this one I am not as sure of, I would guess that renewable are less viable there or more difficult to implement. Out west, there are huge swaths of country that is relatively cheap. Lots of sun, space, and wind. Some places, the only thing keeping traditional power alive is supply and demand mismatch, not that there is a lack of capacity, just a lack of storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ask because I like in the northeast. I can attest to the final point that it’s difficult to implement. It’s cities and suburbs. If you live in a more rural part of these states, it’s mountains and forests. Much less “open” space like they had in the Midwest</p></div>		</li>
