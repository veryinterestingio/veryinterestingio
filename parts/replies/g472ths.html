			<div class="markdown"><p>No other reason. You don't <em>have</em> to denature alcohol intended for cleaning, but it would be much more expensive if you didn't due to the taxes on alcohol fit for human consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For starters I'm not sure why it's called 'denatured' alcohol, because you're not doing anything to the actual alcohol molecule.  They just throw in additives to make it taste REALLY bad.  The idea that denatured alcohol is toxic is a holdover from the prohibition era where Feds spiked industrial alcohol with shit like benzene.  Methanol (mentioned in the comment below), in particular, tastes the same as ethanol so people drinking it would just die after a bout of horrible symptoms.  And since the main reason for denaturing alcohol is to dissuade people from drinking it, not kill them, it makes more sense to prevent people from wanting to swallow it to begin with, as opposed to ensuring someone who does drink it has a bad time.  Now this doesn't mean the additives aren't toxic to some degree, just that they won't kill you.  </p>
<p>Also, to answer u/pepito_pepito, the additives don't have antibacterial properties.  The alcohol is concentrated enough to kill bacteria without much help.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can't legally poison something just to &quot;discourage&quot; drinking it and so tax evasion.</p>
<p>It's like having the punishment for tax evasion on alcohol being death penalty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US denatured alcohol definitely still has methanol sometimes. I work in a lab and we buy denatured alcohol for cleaning the benches and biosafety cabinets. It's like 2% methanol or something. Don't drink it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question. Ive always heard that the feeling of &quot;drunkness&quot; was due to your bodies reaction to mild poisoning. Kind of like how a runny nose isn't directly cause by the sickness, but instead is your bodies natural way of fighting it. Have i been wrong about this and if not, what makes methanol different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hold on, isn't methanol a different product of distillation? Afaik it's the reason why it's extremely dangerous to drink home made distilled spirits since when you're distilling you will extract different kinds of alcohol, depending on the temperature reached: in my language we refer to it as the &quot;head&quot; (beginning of the distillation, when temperature is not really on point), &quot;body&quot; (right temperature, you get ethanol which is safe to drink) and &quot;tail&quot; (same as head). Methanol is obtained during the head or tail of distillation and it's poisonous, even a small amount will lead to blindness and kidney failure, while ethanol is just mildly intoxicating (normal booze, it makes you drunk but it's not lethal unless you abuse).</p>
<p>With homemade distillation you can't be sure that the tools used (like thermometer and other stuff) are perfectly calibrated and you might miss the exact point between head, body and tail and let some methanol into the beverage, so isn't 100% safe to drink.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a lie. You can't legally add poison on stuff that you clean your hands with - and then eat a sandwich.</p>
<p>That's how a lot of methanol ended up in the recalled hand-sanitizer products, because people don't know what they are doing.</p>
<p>The methanol addition should be used only for cars, not humans.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ethanol that is sold for cleaning has been denatured, i.e. made poisonous to drink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for the non americans, this may not be the case in your country. some countries use benzene and pyridine to denature alcohol while others use 5% methanol.</p>
<p>Australia sells methylated spirits that just contains a bittering agent. A metho cocktail will taste horrendous, and you will feel the hangover in the morning, but it is not poisonous like similar products in other countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and back in march that became a very big thing because lots of articles in english were all .</p>
<p>&quot;Don't use metho as hand sanitiser, you will get sick&quot; </p>
<p>Because some denaturing agents can be absorbed through the skin and make you quite ill. So the advice to not use it as hand sanny is only relevant in some countries.</p></div>		</li>
