			<div class="markdown"><p>So when the file is &quot;truly gone&quot;, where does it go? If you throw away a real physical file, it is never truly gone. Just moved somewhere else. Even if it goes to the dump, it may get shredded up, etc. But still those particles exist right? </p>
<p>Am I thinking about computer files too deeply here? Ha!</p></div>		</li>

In an SSD, they're &quot;some electrons in this arrangement&quot; and &quot;Some electrons in that arrangement&quot;. Rewriting the space to store a different file is just rearranging the magnetic/electric bits.</p>

<p>Amazing. I understand it perfectly now. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To change the example from a whiteboard (where you get eraser crumbs) I would say a hard drive (and even SSDs) with their 1's and 0's are more like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B7K54P7" target="_blank">one of these things we all know and love</a>.  </p>
<p>Either a pin is pushed in, or it's not. It takes effort to move the pins back and forth. Which is why when things are &quot;deleted&quot; the drive doesn't actual reset the states unless you go and &quot;zero out&quot; (erase) the drive, which would be like reseting all the pins back to one side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would almost add to this, I would treat each bit on the drive as a light switch. All the switches are still set to the old file's spots, but when the new file takes over, the switches all get changed to that file's spots. Since the old file was never more than positions of switches, there technically isn't something that was &quot;thrown out&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of hard drives and files in quite such a literal sense.  It's just data.  1s and 0s.  </p>
<p>Think of it this way.  Let's say you have a hard drive that's really tiny like a Tic Tac Toe board and can store only 9 bits of data.  Like this:</p>
<p>OOO<br />
OOO<br />
OOO</p>
<p>The hard drive is empty, because there's no data stored there yet, but technically it's also full because it's all Os which is technically data.  But the computer keeps track of the &quot;moves&quot; and since nobody has moved yet it's empty.</p>
<p>So now let's say you create the file &quot;XOX&quot;.  The computer may store it in the top row like this:</p>
<p>XOX<br />
OOO<br />
OOO</p>
<p>Now your file takes up 3 bits.  Those sectors are &quot;full&quot; and your hard drive is 33% &quot;full&quot;.  Now you create a new file, just 2 Xs.  That's stored in the second row.  Now your hard drive looks like this:</p>
<p>XOX<br />
XXO<br />
OOO</p>
<p>Now you decide you don't need that first &quot;XOX&quot; file anymore, so you delete it.  Nothing actually happens to the data on the drive, but the computer knows it can reuse those bits in the future.  Until that data is overwritten this file can be easily recovered.</p>
<p>So now it's say you create a new &quot;XX&quot; file.  That top row is available, so the computer puts it there.  And we get:</p>
<p>XXX<br />
XXO<br />
OOO</p>
<p>That third X in the top row is just leftover data from that original &quot;XOX&quot; file.  It's technically an available bit, so if you create a new file that's 1 bit long—either an X or an O—it can put it there.</p>
<p>All erasing a file does is tell the computer to forget which bits are used to store it.  Future files may or may not overwrite all or parts of the old &quot;deleted&quot; files.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks I appreciate the response. I have a very rudimentary understanding of this. On this thread a user said info is stored as 1s &amp; 0s which are just encoded magnetic/electric arrangements. How do these arrangements look like when the drive is truely empty, as opposed to containing information? Is there an magnetic/electric arrangement at all?</p></div>		</li>
