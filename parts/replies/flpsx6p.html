			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick Google search resulted in this. It would appear speedy reactions such as releasing a baseball, or an example the following article gives a sprinter jumping off blocks to a starter pistol is 150~ Miliseconds. A little more poking and I'm sure you'd find that if you have enough muscle memory practice these times may be reduced further in the best at said particular activity. </p>
<p>I'm also willing to bet this has less to do with the time it takes to travel and more about the time it takes the brain to process and send the signal. The actual travel time would be hard to measure even as it's an electrical impulse and they travel at pretty fast speeds. I.e think about how fast your mouse moves after you move the mouse. The actual nueral signals would travel at similar speeds. From my understanding at least.  So I'd be more then willing to bet that the difference in signal travel time on a whale vs human is neglagable at best.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s off by an order of magnitude. There are click test web pages that measure reaction time: when you see an indicator on the screen change, you click your mouse. Reaction time is usually around 25-35 ms, and that includes the whole nervous system loop from the time the photons hit your retina to the time your finger clicks the mouse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even close. A quarter second might be close for an unmyalinated neuron (I’ve forgotten exactly how quick those are), but motor neurons transmit around 120 m/s. I’ve got about a meter long arm, so it takes about 1/120th of a second for me. There is coordination that occurs, but not at that great of scale.</p></div>		</li>
