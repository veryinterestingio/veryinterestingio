			<div class="markdown"><p>Current thinking is that coriolis force on your inner ear will make you nauseaous if the radius of your space station is too small/if it rotates rapidly enough. Small g differences at head/feet aren't much of a problem compared to that. </p>
<p>EDIT: This seems to no longer be supported by evidence, see link below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would have to be a pretty small radius to begin with. For a 100m radius, a 1.5m man would only experience around 3% difference. </p>
<p>Thinking of a roundabout, I don't notice less force on one side of my body than the other, and that's way more than 3% difference. </p>
<p>I've never been in a roundabout for days though so who knows.  Interesting idea!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Potentially, but it's probably still way better for you than zero gravity (assuming a &quot;normal&quot; fake gravity around 1G and a halfway decent radius).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>however, if you were in a box, floating in space, and that box was put under acceleration of 9.8m/s/s, there are no experiments you could run to determine if you were in a gravitational field or an accelerating box.  I find this to be interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are experiments you could perform to tell the difference, but only because most gravitational fields are not flat.  In the gravity of a planet or anything else, gravity points towards the center of mass, which will be a slightly different angle from opposite sides of the room.  In an accelerating box, the &quot;gravity&quot; vectors are parallel.</p>
<p>Additionally gravity will vary by height on a planet, but not in the accelerating box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this doesn't work in a box accelerating in a straight line, it is easy to imagine an experiment that reveals the nature of the rotating one discussed with space stations. Simply observe the motion of an object passing through it.</p>
<p>For example if a ball flies through such a ring it wouldn't get pulled toward the walls. Instead it would just fly through on its original path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would not, at least not inside the box. There, everything would behave exactly the same. It's only if you could look outside of the box that you would notice the sky looking weird, with most light coming from directly overhead. Length contraction and time dilation are what is meant by &quot;relativistic effects&quot;, and they apply only to, well, different frames, moving ... <em>relative</em> ... to one another. Hence &quot;relativistic&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that gif ignoring the fact that the ball still has momentum?</p>
<p>If I'm driving down the road and drop a ball out of the window of my car, the ball is still traveling forward at the same speed as the car the moment it's released.</p>
<p>That gif shows the ball traveling straight down as though it has lost all forward momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that gif isn't representing the example the dude was talking about.</p>
<p>You should have the ball start moving in a straight line that is tangent to the initial circle defined by its distance from the center of the spaceship.</p>
<p>An observer on the ship will see the ball &quot;falling&quot; because its distance from the center of the ship is going to increase due to its initial tangential velocity.</p>
<p>To determine if the ball is going to land at his feet, we need to determine if by the time the ship has rotated by a certain angle, the free moving rock will have moved by the same angle.</p>
<p>Now, since the angular momentum of the rock is bound to be conserved during its &quot;fall&quot; (more like a straight inertial trajectory if viewed from the outside), but its distance from the center of the spaceship is increasing (you can calculate angular momentum in respect to any given point, we choose the center of rotation of the ship because we're interested in those angles), so its angular velocity will have to decrease (ideally when it goes to infinite distance it will have infinitesimal angular velocity, since a straight line is bound to go over a maximum of 180 degrees in respect to any given point during its [-infinite, +infinite] path).</p>
<p>Since the rock's angular velocity will decrease over time during its fall, it wil touch the outer bound of the spaceship (the percevied floor) at a lesser angle than the one reached by you who's angular velocity was constantly equal to the one of the spaceship. </p>
<p>In few words, it will land &quot;behind you&quot; (if you were looking in the direction of rotation I mean).</p>
<p>Edit: sorry for bad English, I'm Italian lol</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PogGlyy.png" target="_blank">I've drawn a little thing</a> to better explain what I'm talking about. If you let a rock go out of the rotating disk while you still sit on it, you'll see the rock go away from you. But if you wait until you've done half a turn around the center of the disk, you'll see that the rock couldn't make that half turn around the spaceship at all. You can make multiple turns around the center, but the rock won't ever make even a quarter of a turn even in a billion years because it's moving on a straight line.</p>
<p>The moment you let the rock go, you and it are going at the same angular velocity, but as soon as it starts moving in a straight line, its angular velocity is decreasing in a hyperbolic fashion (product of distance and angular velocity remains constant).</p></div>		</li>
