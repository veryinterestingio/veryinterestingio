			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound design. Power tools are loud because they don't need to be quiet, but also because people expect them to be loud. Like a vacuum, we have the technology to make them quieter, but if they become quieter people are less likely to trust the tool works properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my time in the 90s studying mechanical engineering I remember some research about handheld kitchen mixers. Basically they built quiet ones and equipped half of the batch with some artificial noise and had a consumer panel test both types. The loud ones were rated of better quality by the panel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also - ventilation is important for power tools. Soundproofing often means less air-flow, which would lead to overheating.   </p>
<p>Not to mention power tools are often hand-held. Every once counts when you're lugging that cordless drill around, and adding a few centimeters of soundproofing makes said tool much bulkier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It sure would be funny having silent tools... I had a kitchen installed and the workers came with really super quiet tools... My own drills are all loud af.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is a good point, it's not the full picture.  My electric motorcycle (Zero SR/F) has an electric motor that's <a href="https://www.motorcycle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/022519-2019-Zero-SR-F-ZERO_SRF_FACTORYTOUR_RIDE075.jpg" target="_blank">not shielded for noise at all</a>, and it's still quieter than the rubber belt that it drives.  Granted, it's only capable of about 82 kW though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you strip all of that away and run the bare EV motor on a table, it will still be extremely quiet. 50kW machine tool spindles spinning at 30k RPM are near silent on the high end equipment.  </p>
<p>The reason is basically as simple as: power tool motors - even in &quot;expensive&quot; power tools, are built poorly and cheaply, with loose tolerance and unsophisticated control electronics  which can create audible resonances and torque spikes and such throughout the rotation of the rotor.</p>
<p>There is no reason why a brushless motor sized for a drill couldn't run almost completely silently, gearing aside. Except for cost. Take a look at the cost of motors from Maxon or Faulhaber. Those are extremely high quality motors that can run for decades, and do it silently. Same with quality servo motors. But one of those motors (without the drive) will cost more than a nice cordless drill, and the batteries to run it, and a case to hold it all.</p>
<p>Another example: cold saws are extremely quiet and can be safely run without ear protection. OTOH a Dewalt chop-saw will deafen literally half your neighborhood. One is on sale at Home Depot for $150. The other costs $4000. </p>
<p>TL;DR: It's cheap and not enough people care enough to pay for it.</p></div>		</li>
