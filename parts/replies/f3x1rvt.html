			<div class="markdown"><p>With regard to the measles vaccine, the vast majority of people seem to be protected long term, probably for life. There are a few people who appear to have waning immunity but risk factors for that waning are not clear.  What is clear is that if we have high immunization coverage, even if immunity waned in a few, they would not get measles because if the herd immunity levels in the population are achieved, those who are susceptible would be protected because they are not exposed. There is no harm in getting a measles vaccine for someone who has previously been vaccinated. If they are immune to measles, the immune system will kill the vaccine virus and nothing will happen. If they are susceptible to measles, they should develop an immune response although there may be side effects similar to a person being vaccinated for the 1st time. But the side effects are very minor compared with the effects of being infected with the wild measles virus.  - Walt Orenstein, MD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subsequent question on this: I was fully immunized as a kid, but I have been concerned about waning immunity since a lot of outbreaks have happened in my area recently (Pacific Northwest). I'm sure my insurance won't cover a titer, so I have been thinking about just going in and getting an immunization to be on the safe side. My concern is that I'll be &quot;taking a dose away&quot; from someone needs it for certain (e.g., a child who hasn't had their full round of immunizations yet). What is the current status of MMR supply? Would I be contributing to a supply problem by getting the immunization without knowing for sure if I actually need it?</p>
