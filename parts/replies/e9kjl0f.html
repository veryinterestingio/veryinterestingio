It could be an unnecessary step in certain circumstances, especially if you are writing compiler in an environment as primitive as when the first compiler is written. In fact Java compiler doesn't output assembly anyway and that is a modern language example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can. It may not be desirable as it might make the compiler too large, too arch-specific, and is too restrictive in terms of performance. Splitting the toolchain into compiler/linker/assembler/etc allows for more flexibility during development.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Java is a bit weird because it spits out interpreted code for its own virtual machine. The interpreted code looks like machine code, but the machine is the JVM.</p>
<p>Of course, once loaded, Java may decide to compile the interpreted code into machine instructions, the so-called JIT compiler for speed of execution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because even just among the x86 instruction set of opcodes there can be a variety of different ways to do the same thing with various levels of efficiency.  Different architectures will likely do things in slightly different ways or perhaps just have to wait an extra clock cycle here or there for an ALU to finish an operation. The point of higher level languages is to completely shove all that shit into a magical black box a programmer cam ignore.</p></div>		</li>
