			<div class="markdown"><p>The tire exhibits <em>rotational</em> force. The front of the tire is pushing down, but the back of the tire is lifting up. </p>
<p>Think of when you drive through mud, how your tires spray it up on to the side of your car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I thought this was only during slippage, or when the tire slides along the ground. Isnâ€™t tire contact normally static friction, where it exerts a downward and backward force?</p>
<p>I guess maybe the pothole being uneven terrain, the tire loses contact, and maybe some amount of the loose concrete sticks between the treads of the tire, and gets lifted out. That makes sense. Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. The rotation he's describing is static force. However, when the tire is &quot;slipping&quot; this can still shoot the broken asphalt out of the hole. Imagine if there was a single isolated rock on the road, and the car goes over it. The rock will get pushed back rather than the car move forward. Depending on the slope of the wall, the rock can get lifted up out of the pothole.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually goes the other way. The base material under the pavement gets eroded away and the unsupported pavement falls into the void. </p></div>		</li>
