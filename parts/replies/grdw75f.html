<p>According to Pogonoski, &quot;the heron possibly survived, it didn't look too inconvenienced, but would depend on how well the wound healed and if it was able to avoid an infection.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible, doesn't mean  probable. More likely the eel died faster since it has more strict requirement of where it lands for it's survival. Would any animal survive a perforation through their abdomen? Doubt it. Sounds like a slow painful death to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>birds generally don't show vulnerabilities because that makes them targets for predators and even harassment by their own kind. we had one of our six chickens take ill and all the other birds ganged up on her. and they're usually very sweet birds. now that she's better they like her again. fuckin dinosaurs.</p></div>		</li>
