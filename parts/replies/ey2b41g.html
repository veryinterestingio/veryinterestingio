<p>But all the patents and branding for the iPhone is owned by another Apple's company in some tax haven country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone should sue Apple for false advertising for saying &quot;Designed by Apple in California&quot; when clearly the intellectual property is registered not in CA but in TaxHavenCountry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that US GAAP, which all US publicly traded companies must follow, requires companies to report accounting metrics from their assets and liabilities that are in other countries. Can any accountant shed some light on this? I know I was reading a 10K from Target that reported Canadian metrics as well as US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Publicly traded companies prepare consolidated financial statements that show the aggregate of income, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity of the parent company (usually the one based in the US) and all the subsidiaries it controls in and out of the US. Usually the effect of inter-entity transactions (ie say between the parent company and the subsidiary company) is eliminated so what you usually see on say an annual report/10k is the aggregate of all transactions between the corporate group and entities external to that group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a company like amazon. They consistently did not turn a profit for years, but their market share and global influence are powerful enough to convince shareholders that the company is growing and will pay out for them in the long run.</p>
<p>So while profits might be low, that could be attributed to the company making a lot of money in sales revenue but then investing all of that money in new projects, facilities, etc.</p></div>		</li>
