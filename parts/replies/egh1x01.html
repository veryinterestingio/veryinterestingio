			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel bad for my son, but I think he just has bad genetics :(At a parent-teacher moment they first asked if he gamed too much?Did he get enough sleep?Did he get a recent bloodcheck?How is nutrition?Does he go outside enough?Does he get enough exercise?Is bedtime too late?Because he has blue circles under his eyes the entire time.We made bedtime half hour early, we got him a new matras, he has thicker curtains to block sound but we already live in a quiet street, he does sports every day during lunchbreak.  My husband and I are vegans, so there are a lot of vegetables, legumes, nuts, beans, and our son gets meat.  Our house-doctor doesn't do a bloodcheck &quot;on a child that is energetic behaving&quot;.It's just not fun for him that people think he's very unhealthy just because of dark circles.<br />
He does have very pale skin tough, the slightly ginger hair, pale skin, freckles kind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, my family has the same Issue. Whatever it is about our Y chromosome I don’t know but my grandpa, dad, my brothers and me all have bags under our eyes, no matter how much we sleep. All the women in our family? Can go 4 days without sleep and still nothing. I’m thankful for everything else my Y chromosome gave me but god damn, people always ask me why I look like I haven’t slept in days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter has dark bags under her eyes,  same as me (f) we're but tanned brunettes.  </p>
<p>Turns out it's her asthma and the fact that she's got swollen adenoids, so the slightly lower lung capacity has caused the eye bags. (I'm asthmatic too fwiw) she's on a better preventor now and I'm seeing the improvement.  Gladly as she gets questioned about her sleep a lot </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use a mask filled with gel here.  Like a carnival mask with gel inside.<br />
This is placed in the fridge, and in the morning during breakfast, we put it on our eyes (it has little holes in it).  The cold does help a bit with the swelling and circles, as it contracts the blood vessels.  After that we use an eye cream for the dark circles.  This routine does help.  They never fully go away, and my son doesn't like the cold mask so he hardly ever uses it.  But I do, and the difference became quite clear to me when I saw old foto's and compared them to now.<br />
Maybe this advice can help you too?</p></div>		</li>
