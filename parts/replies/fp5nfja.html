			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like revisiting the ideas in Blink. Blink was all about the power of making quick decisions based on implicit information, for example assessing the outcome of a relationship by microexpression. It gave a favorable impression of microexpressions in my opinion. The scientists who created the facial expression coding system actually inspired Lie To Me.</p></div>		</li>
