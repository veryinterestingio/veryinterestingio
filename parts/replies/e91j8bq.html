			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the glowing of white clothes in blacklight has anything to do with the used detergents but rather with the fact that the color white reflects most wavelengths, including ultraviolet.</p>
<p>Most colors won't glow much in blacklight because they don't reflect UV </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was reflecting UV you wouldn't see any glow since the light would still be UV. The glow you are seeing is fluorescence - light being absorbed and re-emitted as a different wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do a demo with my class when we get to our light unit. Try buying name brand detergent and dollar store detergent, it’s not super consistent but you’ll find that only some brands add these bluing agents. And under black light it makes a huge difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why most detergents are colored blue or blue/green? Or do consumers just like that color for soap so marketing says make it blue. I feel so cheap and dirty!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still, I've seen plenty of white things glow under blacklight that dont get added chemicals. It may affect how much, but it is not the reason. </p></div>		</li>
