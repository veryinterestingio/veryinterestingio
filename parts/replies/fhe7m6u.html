<p>Single-serve coffee containers  </p>
<p>have been a thing for a while and I believe have become more popular over the last decade or so as several companies developed new containers and machines.</p>

<p>I had forgotten about espresso pods to be fair.</p>
<p>However, I was thinking more about brew-in-the-cup bags that you find more for tea (I guess the closest equivalent is instant coffee granules??) rather than something that needs to be placed in a coffee machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keurig has a single coffee maker that is extremely popular (at least in the USA).  It indeed has one powder pack of coffee, and it poors the hot water through the bag into the cup.  </p>
<p>Granted that is slightly different than putting the power pack into the cup itself.</p>
<p>Good point about instant coffee,  there already is a solution for 'brew in your cup' coffee that power bag coffee would have to compete with.  Perhaps the question should be 'why doesn't tea come in instant tea granules?'</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every coffee store around has ones designed for single serve pour-over bags.</p>
<p>Little cardboard handles that hug the side of the cups and a (usually) thin-mesh bag to pour water in.</p>

<p>First Google image result, shows the bag and pour pretty easily.</p></div>		</li>
