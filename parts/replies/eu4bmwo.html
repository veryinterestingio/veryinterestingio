			<div class="markdown"><p>As discussed below, alligators definitely eat the birds if given the opportunity. I’ve heard the mutualism between nesting wading birds and alligators described this way (by Lucas Nell) and I think it’s a perfect description: “Nesting above an alligator is less like having a bodyguard and more like having a psychopath in your yard to keep out catburglars”. Also, I mentioned it below but I’ll say it again here just in case--alligators and wading birds have found a way to use each other to their own advantage and that is what constitutes the mutualism. Both species benefit from associating with one another overall, and even though there may be casualties from alligators occasionally eating a stray wading bird the benefits of reduced nest predation (which is by far the biggest contributor of nest failure/abandonment in wading birds) outweighs that risk. So yes, I would say it is still mutualistic.</p></div>		</li>
