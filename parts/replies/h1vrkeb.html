			<div class="markdown"><p>So are conventionally dull materials smooth in liquid form because they lack the bonds that might lock them into an irregular/bumpy pattern? And objects that are shiny even in solid state just happen to form bonds that render nice smooth smooth surfaces?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you've got it. Liquids comprise of freely moving atoms/ molecules. And surface tension (caused by a net attraction normal to the surface) tends the cause the liquid to form fairly smooth interfaces.</p>
<p>Solids that are shiny can be crystalline and therefore form fairly regular and smooth surfaces. But even amorphous solids can be shiny (e.g. plastics).</p>
<p>In the end though it's about the surface roughness. Reflection will always occur at an interface to varying extents. It's just about whether or not it's diffuse or specular reflection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool thanks! So for things like vanta black that are supposed to be almost completely non reflective, does the material absorb the photons rather than reflect them? </p>
<p>Because isn’t color a result of only a specific wavelength being reflected while the rest are absorbed by the material? If so, then how can black things be shiny and reflective if black just means absorption of all the visible light wavelengths?</p>
<p>OMG WAIT. Is that why we perceive “shiny” as white? Like on a shiny black car, the “color” of the shine is rendered as white to our brains right? So is shine just the specific angle at which all wavelengths of the light are reflected back to our retinas? And thus the actual strip of shine looks white? And all the other angles (areas on the material we are viewing) don’t have the correct orientation and thus are able to absorb all the wavelengths except for the color of the material?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite examples is solder (gently lead based silver is easier for this). </p>
<p>As the solder joint cools, if it is disturbed, it turns dull. If it’s made at the right temperature and cools properly, it remains shiny. But not quite at shiny as in the liquid form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also why most conventionally dull materials can be sanded/polished to a shine.  Most metals can be made to be mirror like, any non-porous thing can for the most part.  You can make some of those porous things shiny by using something to get the surface more uniform, like stains and oils on wood.  Shine = uniformity</p></div>		</li>
