			<div class="markdown"><p>Chimpanzees do indeed have <a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/154053/original/image-20170124-16070-v8lwj1.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip" target="_blank">much larger testicles</a> proportionally than other apes.  For some time, this has been theorized to be tied to their mating system, which tends to be fairly promiscuous compared to their relatives; e.g., see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/293055a0" target="_blank">Harcourt et al. 1981</a> for some discussion on this.  It's hard to say for sure if this is related to the loss of the Y chromosome gene mentioned above, but it certainly could be (though this is also something of a chicken and egg problem, since either could have evolved first).</p>
<p>As a general rule, Y chromosomes (or to be even more broad, whichever sex chromosome is less common, such as the W chromosome in birds) tend to degenerate over evolutionary time, and this isn't necessarily related to sexual dimorphism or really any phenotypic features at all.  There are a few factors which are potential explanations for this phenomenon (see <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2000.0717" target="_blank">Charlesworth and Charlesworth 2000</a> for a nice review), but in general they all have to do with the fact that the Y chromosome does not undergo recombination, and has a lower population size than all other chromosomes (1/4 that of autosomes).  </p>
<p>It's now widely accepted that the sex chromosomes of placental mammals evolved from an initial pair of autosomes, with the Y <a href="https://marlin-prod.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/3e779b0a-af7e-4f32-b843-c5f14599bc5d/gr1.jpg" target="_blank">gradually becoming more and more reduced</a> as it became increasingly distinct from the X (figure from <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(06)00241-8#%20" target="_blank">Graves 2006</a>).  However, there are several known cases where large-scale chromosomal mutations have occurred that (at least temporarily) change this pattern.  In <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/2011_Muntjak-5.jpg/1280px-2011_Muntjak-5.jpg" target="_blank">black muntjac</a>, an autosome has fused with the sex chromosomes, creating a so-called neo-Y which is much larger than in other mammals.  And just as predicted by theory, this &quot;reset&quot; Y chromosome, which is less than a million years old, has already started accumulating mutations much faster than its counterpart (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2481430/" target="_blank">Zhou et al., 2008</a>).  A similar situation has also been observed in African pygmy mice (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:CHRO.0000034098.09885.e6" target="_blank">Veyrunes et al. 2004</a>).  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barbara_Bentz/publication/321135433/figure/fig1/AS:561729865695232@1510938244386/Neo-sex-chromosome-evolution-The-predicted-stages-of-heteromorphic-differentiation-are.png" target="_blank">This diagram</a> depicts how this is generally imagined to happen.  So while major changes to the Y chromosome like this could certainly have some implications for traits that are sexually dimorphic, I don't think we can say they definitively have to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I was hoping there might be some trend involving how y chromosomes evolve over time and also how the number of chromosomes ends up changing.</p>

<p>Is this the perception? Evolutionary genomics seems a million times more interesting to me than morphological differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For laymen, morphology sounds cooler because it's more tangible. Speaking from personal experience, it's easier to write grant proposals when you can reference physical structures that people can see than genomic data that exists on microscopic levels and in computer sequence files.</p></div>		</li>
