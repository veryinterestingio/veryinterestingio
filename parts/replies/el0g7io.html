			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also pass an electric current through water and capture the bubbles coming off each electrode. All of the gas from one electrode will be Hydrogen gas and all of the gas from the other electrode will be oxygen gas. Comparing the mass or volume of each (for constant temp and pressure) and you will have a 1 to 2 relationship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why you use gas volumes instead, which DOES reflect mole ratios. You do get a 1:2 oxygen: hydrogen relationship for the gas volumes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That process tells us the ratio of two hydrogen per oxygen, but can it distinguish H2O from H4O2?
Iâ€™m guessing 2 mole of H and 1 mole of O would make 1 mole of H2O but only 1/2 mole of H4O2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could probably determine that through application of Avogadro's Law which says that the volume of a gas depends only on the number of particles. So gaseous H20 would have twice the volume of gaseous H4O2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could in principle tell these apart using measurements of gas volume. One volume of water, heated to become steam, would decompose into one volume of H2 and half a volume of O2, rather than two volumes and one volume respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's hard to isolate just one atom of anything.  Everything in chemistry exists in scales of Avogadro's number (6 x 10^23 ).  One water molecule is such an infinitesimal amount.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Capturing 3 atoms exactly, holding just those 3, and bringing them together at the same time is a lot more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, if you have a lab capable of isolating and manipulating individual atoms. There are several research labs on the planet with the capability.  Not many can do it, but yes, it can be done.</p></div>		</li>
