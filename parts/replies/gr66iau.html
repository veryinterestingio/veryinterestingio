			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! When I was in grad school I worked a lot with E. coli and yeast. Yeast (candida albicans) mutate so quickly so you really have to keep diluting throughout longer growth processes or start fresh from a freezer stock (a known strain that has been genotyped) so that you don’t mess up your experiments with strains that arise that are different to your original strain. Even if you grow yeast on an agar plate and store the plate with the yeast colonies in the fridge, you still can’t use the colonies from that plate past a week since they continue to, albeit slowly, divide and mutate.</p></div>		</li>
