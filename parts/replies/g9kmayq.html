<p>You're wearing a mask, not exhaling into a balloon. There is no space for anything to accumulate. Perhaps a couple of milliliters of space where the mask isn't pressed too tightly against your skin? </p>

<p>That's what I also immediately thought after thinking about it. It seems so obvious!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I’ve found is that is if my breathing is shallow I end up getting hotter than if I breathe deeper. My intuition here is that I’m re-breathing a fixed volume of air and that deeper breathing decreases the ratio of the re-breathed air to fresh air.  So yeah, I can imagine that for people panting through their mouth that ratio is much less favorable whether it’s looking at heat or CO2.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Definitely - but that's, as you rightly pointed out, due to <em>shallow breathing</em> in any situation. Masks only factor into this for <em>very</em> frail people or people with pre-existing respiratory problems which might prevent them from being able to put up the additional effort of breathing through fabric or filters.</p></div>		</li>
