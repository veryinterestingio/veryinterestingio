			<div class="markdown"><p>Wtf, I went on holiday a few years ago where it was ~45C during the day and it was crazy.. walking outside is like opening an oven door, sweat starts to drip the second you step out.. </p>
<p>I relied on the ac like crazy, luckily there was ac absolutely everywhere, from corner shops to even small bus stops were air conditioned</p></div>		</li>
