<p>Radio waves are oftentimes blocked/scrambled by metallic frames</p>

<p>This is a whole another concept and has to do with electromagnetism and induction rather than physical collisions like with alpha particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's photons instead of atoms, with a more pronounced wave behaviour, but it's still also particles travelling through matter and hitting individual atoms. Each photon absorbed will excite a single atom (well, can be multiple ones, but still discrete)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can't &quot;absorb&quot; photons though, have to jump back to the wave side of things for that. it makes my head hurt</p>
<p>edit: i know it's common to talk about photons as both particles and waves, but to me the word implies focusing on the particle nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's the same concept.  Physical collisions with alpha particles are also electromagnetic.  Physical collisions are nothing but protons repelling other protons with electromagnetic force.</p></div>		</li>
