			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my big gripe about when people complain about the hyperspace kamikaze in The Last Jedi. They say that a relativistic collision with anything at any fraction of the speed of light would inherently be able to destroy a planet, and so it introduces some unprecedented scale of destruction to the Star Wars universe that &quot;breaks it.&quot;</p>
<p>But... the whole point of hyperspace is that it cheats the very same rules of relativity that make travel at/beyond the speed of light impossible in the first place. If it breaks those rules, it inherently <em>cannot</em> also follow them. That means any event involving hyperspace isn't relativistic; it's purely fictional, so it only behaves as the fiction in which it exists depicts.</p>
<p>That fiction depicts a 3km ship damaging (not even destroying) a 60km ship, which is vastly less than anything on a relativistic scale, and that 1:20 ratio is pretty much just in line with conventional munitions... so it's actually nothing special or particularly powerful at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it would ultimately be if the mirror is reflecting whatever you are able to &quot;see&quot; then yes. It would be entirely dependent on OP's specified settings. If it were completely dark but you could see IR or perhaps some totally magical wavelength and the mirror could reflect it. Then yes you should be able to see your relfection in the dark.</p></div>		</li>
