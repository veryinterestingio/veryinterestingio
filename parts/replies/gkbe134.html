<p>If, on the other hand, you found a company that buys a bunch of storefronts across different cities and then connects a bunch of cottage bakers in those areas using the Internet in order to stock those stores with bakery products, that's a startup.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, I worked for an incubator on the tech side. One of the startups was connecting people who grow veggies at home or in community gardens.</p>
<p>The problem gardeners have is they have a lot of stuff come in at once, so it's nothing for a long time then it's too much of the same thing to consume. So this app allowed people to connect and swap, or trade product for preservation services (some people like canning, making preserves, fermenting, etc., so you could send them your tomato haul and they'd keep 10% and turn the rest into jam or whatever).</p>
<p>They picked up cottage bakers, home cheese makers, etc. A lot of things don't really make sense to do at personal scale and it's very little extra effort to step up a bit, but most food hobbyists also don't want to go full commercial scale, and farmer's markets are too much work.</p>
<p>It was a cool idea but they couldn't make it work. I just threw in storefronts in the example, that wasn't part of it (some folks in the app could earn credits to spend by transporting the stuff).</p>
<p>If you can make it work you're welcome to it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe formally, but what the word connotes is different than what it denotes.</p>
<p>A winery doesn't start producing fruit for 3–5 years but most people don't think about that as a startup (though I guess, technically, it is).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, successful startups create net profits for investors. If you invest in old, dying companies that are put out of business by said startups, then yes, you lose money. But the people (angel investors, VCs, public investors) who invest in the startup make lots of money. If you believe capitalism (market economies) generally creates net value for people, then yes, more competition in the form of new startups is a good thing for the stock market.</p></div>		</li>
