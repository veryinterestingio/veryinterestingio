			<div class="markdown"><p>The square-cube law, roughly:</p>
<p>Muscle force is based on the cross-sectional area (length squared) while mass is based on the total volume (length cubed).</p>
<p>As you get bigger, you generate less force per unit volume, because mass goes up much faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His arm might be 10 times longer but the volume of his arm will be more than 10 times more in volume meaning the mass would be more than 10 times larger. This would require more than 10 times the power. For example if a cube is twice as long as another, it’s volume is 8 times larger. The cube would be twice as long in length but 8 times heavier. This is the Square-Cube Law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expecting scalar growth of speed is unrealistic. If that were the case. You'd expect ants to move like they were glaciers when in reality they don't. For the most part, creatures have similar top speeds of individual parts, largely due to biological limitations such as tendon tensile strength, and as elsewhere mentioned, cube square law for energy needed to move.</p></div>		</li>
