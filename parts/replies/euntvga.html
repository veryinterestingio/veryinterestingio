			<div class="markdown"><p>If your metabolism is burning more energy than you are getting from your food, then yes... targeted fat loss doesn't work.  I can do all the sit-ups and crunches that I want and I won't lose my gut if I can't achieve a caloric deficit.</p>
<p>So yes, as long as you have a calorie deficit, you will lose the butt... unfortunately you kind of have to lose all of the rest of the fat before your butt will be completely gone.</p>
<p>Make sure that your workout is pushing you to your limit to maximize your metabolism for the rest of the day and watch out for those pesky carbohydrates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For burning fat I believe its better to work out longer with a mild intensity than to push yourself to the limit. I had it explained to me by my cousin who is a biochemist so my explanation might be a bit off. If you push yourself the energy demand per second is higher than what can be gained from converting fat to energy, this will result in glucose being converted to provide enough energy per second. If you work out with a mild intensity its possible to convert fat to energy and provide enough energy per second. Many sport apps with heart rate monitors will tell in what range you're working out, burning fat or VO2 max for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One interesting thing to keep in mind... the fat that you lose leaves as water and CO2... so you are literally sweating, urinating, and exhaling your fat.  When you burn fat, it turns into 6 parts CO2 and 1 part H2O by mass.  So if you get your metabolism worked up during a daily workout, that fat continues to leave you while you're going about your daily business... including sleeping.  I dare say many people lose the majority of their burned fat in their sleep if they can keep to a good workout and diet routine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isnâ€™t exactly true. Your body stores fat on a first in and last out principal. Your body prefers to store fat around your center of mass and vital organ. This makes movement and retaining body heat easier. Your center of mass around your belly and hips has more alpha 2 receptors that prevent fat loss than other areas.
Activation of the alpha1 and beta-receptors is lipolytic (causes fat breakdown) while activation of the alpha 2 receptor is anti-lipolytic (blunts fat breakdown). Stubborn fat areas have a high density of alpha 2 receptors, making it harder for fat breakdown to occur in that area.</p></div>		</li>
