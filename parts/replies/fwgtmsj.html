			<div class="markdown"><p>As a patient, I can only hope research will discover more about the brain chemicals in my lifetime. I have used all of the most effective antidepressants that there are for 30 years, and I still struggle to get my nose above water line everyday. Even with all purported knowledge about psychiatric disorders, I have the feeling doctors are still working in a dimly-lit room.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But the more truthful answer would include an explanation of how depression is not just chemical imbalances. Even if you perfectly manage those neurotransmitters, whatever the fuck that would even mean, there are still types of depression that have nothing to do with brain chemistry or which we should not try to negate because they are philosophical, existential or rational... <strong>or healthy</strong>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This ultimately a philosophical difference; there is no such thing as a cognitive phenomena that aren’t descriptions of chemical transactions. What it is to be conscious is simply to have a brain moving information around.</p>
<p>I’m not saying depression and any mental phenomenon at all aren’t usefully discussed at higher-order levels. I am saying that the proximal cause is and can only be neurochemical. </p>
<p>That there might be <em>therapeutic</em> approaches that obviate this fact is something I am eminently sympathetic to. It’s just a different conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, and if you want to know <em>why</em> the “chemical imbalance” model of depression became so popular there is a great book called <em>Mind Fixers</em> that came out last year that has a few chapters on this very subject. Essentially, pharmaceutical companies extrapolated data from limited studies on the behavior of serotonin <em>in vitro</em> and in some animals to justify some clinical trials for drugs, and to market new drugs for treating depression. They wanted to sell a product, and mood enhancers were a massive money-maker for them. The initial studies weren’t bad science, but they didn’t demonstrate that serotonin, or any one chemical, causes depression.</p>
<p>While it’s true that increases serotonin levels can have a mood-lifting effect on some people, there is no evidence that serotonin deficiencies <em>cause</em> depression. That would be like claiming that because ice cream gives you pleasure, you must have an ice cream deficiency. The science of the brain is almost impossibly complex, and we are still basically in the dark on the mechanisms of emotion. Anti-depressants can treat mood disorders symptomatically, but we have no idea if they are actually getting at the root cause of those disorders.</p>
<p>TLDR; Big Pharma wanted to simplify complex, incomplete science to sell pills. The fact that these pills work to enhance mood does not mean they are correcting a chemical imbalance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My therapist described SSRIs being something of a mental health version of cough syrup. It might make you feel better, but won't necessarily address the underlying problem. But, like cough syrup can get you to a level where you're not coughing uncontrollably and can maybe do something else about it, SSRIs can get you to that level mentally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s my personal experience with SSRIs.  It was enough to pull my baseline mood from deeply depressed to neutral, and I was able to make positive changes in my life that I didn’t feel capable of making before. And once those changes were made, I didn’t need the SSRIs anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my wife’s anecdotal experience. The SSRI she takes has allowed her on a day to day basis to deal with and push past anxieties which previously had crippled her. Missed engagements, inability to make simple decisions, intense regret about social interactions she did have in retrospect, all of which fed into a downward spiral which led into more anxiety. It was a cycle she really struggled to break causing her to want to do things like just abandon friendships as opposed to resolve them, avoid family, and generally miss out on life.</p>
<p>Talk therapy is an integral part of the treatment and probably has carried most of the “weight” in helping her improve, but the Prozac absolutely had a therapeutic effect. It allowed her to manage her anxiety and “push through”, successfully going out and maintaining social engagements and responsibilities and, consequently, making her anxiety (and shame) much more manageable so it could be positively addressed through talk therapy.</p>
<p>It’s possible that talk therapy alone over time might have been sufficient, but breaking the cycle/spiral effect certainly appeared to accelerate her treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on an SSRI for a while, and it helped (probably just placebo effect and feeling good to be doing something). </p>
<p>For me, the only real treatment (prevention really) for depression is running. I have to do cardio, and consistently. But obviously when I was depressed, I couldn’t get into an exercise routine. The SSRI got me stabilized, then running actually made things better. I also find that I am depressed when I am overweight, so running attacks that aspect too. I don’t have to be skinny to be happy, I just have to not be fat. </p>
<p>I think people who are just hoping for a single thing like a pill to make things better are going to be disappointed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that really is a bit of an over simplification. there are certainly some studies demonstrating that a decrease in seretonin is heavily associated with depression. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, antidepressants do do something. But we don't really understand what makes depression happen, and can only really treat symptoms with what we know will counter them. Think of it like being given hand warmers in cold weather. The hand warmers aren't doing anything about the root of coldness, ie the weather, but they're certainly affecting the temperature of your fingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessairly.</p>
<p>SSRI antidepressants, for example, increase the amount of available serotonin in the brain. This helps the symptoms of depression for many people. However, that doesn't mean it's treating the cause. We just don't know what causes depression.</p>
<p>An analogy might make it clearer. Imagine someone breaks their leg and is given morphine for the pain. The morphine helps reduce the pain, but it doesn't cure the broken leg. The morphine isn't a placebo, but it's also not doing anything to address the cause of the problem.The pain wasn't caused by morphine deficiency in the first place. In this analogy, broken leg = cause of depression, morphine = antidepressant, and pain = symptoms of depression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this. Inflammation has been noted to play a significant role in the onset and maintenance of depression. There are now blood tests which can detect inflammatory markers in the blood which can provide some physical indication of the major depressive disorder. This is still extremely new and there have been challenges to this hypothesis. But depression is most likely a combination of genetics and environmental factors interacting. </p>
<p>And SSRI treatments which are the current goto depression treatments have been shown to be only effective for 51% of patients when reviewing data from clinical trials that don't get published suggesting that much more than serotonin is at play.</p></div>		</li>
