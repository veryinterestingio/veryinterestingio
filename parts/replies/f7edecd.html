			<div class="markdown"><p>Notably there's a significant gradient toward lower (less energetic) and circular (as opposed to elliptical) orbits because the collisions are inelastic and eccentricity exacerbates the orbital energy loss of these collisions. Put another way, when one collision pushes an object into a more energetic orbit, that object is just getting set up to bleed more energy from the orbital system on its next collision.</p></div>		</li>
