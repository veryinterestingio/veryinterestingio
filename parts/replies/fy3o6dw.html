			<div class="markdown"><p>An important thing you forgot to mention though, regular high blood pressure causes stress on your arteries and it has nowhere to go. When exercising and you “get the pump” your muscles swell up with extra intake of blood. So, there’s not as much pressure on your organs/arteries because there’s less volume of blood present there at any given moment because it’s in the muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to hijack one of the top comments to make a note that I haven’t seen anyone comment here yet. </p>
<p>You might be asking “well jeez, if the heart has to work harder during exercise AND hypertension, and it gets stronger in exercise, why doesn’t it get stronger in hypertension?”</p>
<p>Well the answer is that it does. However, the mechanism by which the heart grows is different for each. </p>
<p>The ELI5 explanation: in exercise, the heart grows from the outside, out: think a balloon that gets thicker on the outside and is better able to squeeze the volume of fluid inside it.
Sometimes with prolonged hypertension (and other disease states) the heart grows but <em>from the inside</em>. Meaning instead of growing from the outside walls of the balloon, it grows from the inside walls. This can result in a smaller amount of fluid being able to fit in to the heart (balloon). <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2015/01/15/11/18/hb7_hypertrophic-8col.jpg" target="_blank">see this picture to understand. </a></p>
<p>This is a simplified explanation, and is not true in all cases of hypertension. However, I wanted to add this in case someone was wondering the functional differences in why the heart getting stronger in one case is good (exercise) and why a similar strain on the heart in hypertension doesn’t produce a similar result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do people with high blood pressure exercise? Or does it just increase the risks or injury if they do workout?  </p>
<p>Also for the person who got down to 37, even 27bpm, is that actually safe? Would having your average heart rate being significantly lower harm you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People with high blood pressure should absolutely exercise, but should inquire with their physician about what is safe for them. If your hypertension is the result of an underlying heart condition, it may not be safe to engage in strenuous exercise. The doctor may also want to bring your blood pressure down with medication prior to you starting an exercise plan.</p>
<p>I think the safety is sort of debatable. The man I noted is certainly not the norm and I won't claim to know what his health status is, aside from pointing out that he seems not to have any symptoms of having a low heart rate (bradycardia). If a sedentary person had a heart rate that low, it would absolutely be dangerous. They would have inadequate blood flow throughout the body, including to the brain, which would make them feel miserable if not threaten their life.</p></div>		</li>
