			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another example exponential growth that I learned in grade school.  Which would you rather have?  A shiny new dime given to you every day for a month (say September) or a penny on the first day, 2 cents on the second day, 4 cents on the third day, continuing to double the amount each day for the rest of the month.  In the first case, you wind up with $3.00.  In the second case, you have millions.</p></div>		</li>
