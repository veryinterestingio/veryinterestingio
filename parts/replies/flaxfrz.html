			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a slew of supplements that helped my overall health for a while (I think nac was one) unfortunately, vitamins aren't covered here because they're otc so paying close to or sometimes over $100/month on supplements isnt something sustainable. (I should state I have malabsorption issues thanks to gi tract problems so instead of taking a multivitamin I had to actually sit down with a nutritionist and they wrote out their recommended supplements) Medications can help, but ultimately most mental disorders also require therapy and actively using healthy coping skills, making better thought choices, etc to maximize the potential quality of life changes that the medication can offer.</p>
<p>For anyone experiencing a lot of anxiety or anxiety related disorders PLEASE take gut health seriously. Anxiety disorders and gi problems are notoriously comorbid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dont want to self diagnose here but what i go through is eerily simmilar to what you described here. I love the 'pain' feeling i get from picking scabs and i dont stop untill i bleed or 'ive not picked at my nail correctly' otherwize. I also pull my hair when slightly anxious, bored, sad or angry. i pull it, wrap it around my fingers, rub it into a ball between my palms, then snap it in half. if i dont do it in this order, i HAVE to re do it untill i feel 'complete' kind of thing. i.e, if i accidently drop and loose the ball of hair, wrinse and repeat untill i do the steps correct.y</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey that definitely sounds like it falls under the BFRB category somewhere...Many dermatologists and therapists will offer those &quot;ranking&quot; tests to score you for BFRB's. OCD and BFRB's are notably similar and have high comorbidity. It gets easier, I promise.</p></div>		</li>
