			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me od how there's a cave in East Africa. Deep within in there's a lot of salt. Elephant herds push into it to mine the salt to get their fix. It's also the cave where it is believed the Marburg virus originated from.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually how salt deposits were sometimes found in the past: people noticed wild animals enjoying the water from a small spring outlet much more than all other (and often bigger or easier to obtain) sources of water. Well, that's because the small natural spring washed out some of the salt and brought it to the ground.</p>
<p>There's a small salt mine in the Swiss Alps (at Bex) that is still in working order but originated just like that. I think it was the first salt deposit found in Switzerland, but nowadays most salt comes from two other, larger mines. But the salt mine at Bex makes for interesting sightseeing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Long ago I watched a documentary about salt, I think it was some place in New York with crazy roads that make no sence, but they were old paths animals had used to get to the salt mine. My Google fu is not strong and I cannot find it now, but I always thought that was neat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me wonder, if we didn't add salt to our food, would we enjoy just drinking saltwater to make up for the deficiency? Because normally saltwater is extremely unpalatable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saltwater is palatable. Just not the saltwater found in the seas/oceans, because it contains too much salt. I imagine the salty water the animals found, where the &quot;salt mine leaked&quot;, was probably much less salty and we could probably consume that.</p>
<p>And we basically do each time we eat broth, like many simple soups and including most ramen. Sure, they contain other ingredients, but you're essentially slurping salted water.</p></div>		</li>
