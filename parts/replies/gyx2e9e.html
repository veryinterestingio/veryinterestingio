<p>This is what makes that hissing sound as the water heats up, and why the sound dies down right before it starts fully boiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: cavitation is used in cleaning medical tools as the process use the kinetic energy to dislodge blood from hard to reach spots. Athough this is done ultrasonically instead of boiling water. The machines that do this make the same sounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is! </p>
<p>Water is highly compress by the propeller blade pushing the boat forward. As the water reaches the end of the blade, the pressure can drop so low that the water basically boils at 60F. So it forms those little bubbles, which then collapse back into liquid with a little &quot;pop&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the opposite! </p>
<p>Oxygen and nitrogen dissolve into the synovial fluid between your joints. When you crack your knuckles, you're actually applying an increase in the pressure of the fluid that the gases are forced out. Over the next 20 minutes, they dissolve back into the fluid, which is why you can't crack your knuckles again right away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can boil chicken and other meats. It's not very good, but you can eat it. Safe temperature for chicken is 165F (74C).</p>
<p>I wonder how much stirring water would actually help since you already have convective currents from the temperature differential. It certainly wouldn't hurt, but I'm not sure how effective it is or isn't. It would be an interesting experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely this.   When I'm at work bringing a 60 gallon tilt kettle to a boil, I stir that shit and it definitely makes a difference.  It also brings more water into direct contact with the ring of steam heating element, which helps.  If only i had one at home..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did a little experiment way back in science class in school: thermometer in water that's being boiled. No stirring &gt; now stir. Read out the graph. </p>
<p>Even stirring once made a small, but noticable difference. </p>
<p>I wouldn't encourage people to constantly stir a pot of water. But I do usually give the kettle a quick toss after a few minutes, or one quick stir for the water in the pot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Safe temperature is far lower. 130F is safe and kills salmonella and E. coli. over time. At 165 it takes 7 seconds. At 135 it takes about 30 min. 130 is something like 60 min but not positive. </p>
<p>The problem is that chicken isn't very palatable at lower temps. Breast is rubbery at that temp and dark is bloody. Breast/white meat is better cooked to 145 or 150 and is overcooked at 165, as far as texture goes.</p>
<p>There is little reason other than texture to cook chicken to 165F as long as you can hold it at that lower temp for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're close, but if we're getting technical: at 165 it's instant, 140 takes not quite 30 minutes, and at 135 it takes over an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tip: you can cook chicken for dogs MUCH faster in the microwave. That's what I do for mine and she loves it!</p>
<p>A couple of minutes in there and it's ready. Add in potatoes or whatever veggies you like and cook for a couple more minutes and you'll have your dogs meal made to order in under 15 minutes.  I do this daily twice a day.</p></div>		</li>
