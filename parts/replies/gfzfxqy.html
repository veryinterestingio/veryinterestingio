			<div class="markdown"><p>If a kidney recipient eventually dies due to the kidney being attacked too aggressively, can the kidney be re-planted back into the original living donor, would it will be welcomed back?</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the replies, I just found that someone asked the same ELI5 7 years ago; medical journals say essentially the same thing.</p>

<p>I can't imagine it would be in good shape. Like getting your toys back from a younger sibling. Those things are gone, man.</p></div>		</li>

Also the testicles and central nervous system are immunological sanctuaries. But you can’t transplant something into the brain or the testicle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me smile. My mom died almost 8 years ago and my sister and I chose to donate any organs they could use. Sadly because of the circumstances all they could use was tissue for burn victims and her eyes. I don't remember if anything else was useful. Anyways my mom's mom was blind and to know that someone else is able to see because of my family is the only happy part of my mom's passing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm, that could be great news. I have somewhat advanced dilated cardiomyopathy and am on Entresto as a last resort. It's been helping but the dr. said in no uncertain terms that I'm at the end of the line for all conventional therapies (meds + pacemaker), and if I go downhill at this point it's transplant city!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially. One other approach that was being looked at by one of my University supervisors was trying to remove the cells from transplanted tissue so it didn't cause a response from the immune system and then try and repopulate the &quot;scaffold&quot; material with the recipients own cells. The problem with stuff like this really is either growing the tissue correctly, or not damaging the underlying structure when removing harmful materials.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no &quot;adapting&quot;, the cells in the organ don't change their DNA or makeup in any way, so basically they'll live and divide and function based on the DNA that they have (which is, the donor's DNA).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some (possibly all) transplanted organs undergo changes to match the host's body; a process called allogeneic chimerism.</p>
<p>Not only does the organ change to match the host, the host changes to match the organ too. The changes can be both genetic and structural. If you place a male liver into a female host, for example, the liver will develop an entirely new macrophage system within a few months, matching the female DNA of the host. </p>
<p>This isn't always a good thing because transplanted organs can develop inherited diseases from the host (the same genetic defect that probably caused a new organ to be necessary in the first place).</p></div>		</li>
