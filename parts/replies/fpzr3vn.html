			<div class="markdown"><p>To develop on this - a gas cloud that ignites immediately is likely to cause a flash fire resulting in superficial burns. If the cloud spreads into a congested area and then ignites it will cause a much more powerful explosion (e.g. Buncefield) resulting in a shock wave, and shrapnel. So, the same gas cloud can cause 1, 2 and 4 depending on where it's released and when it ignites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Igniting rapidly expanding gas is the basis of thermobaric weapons (fuel-air bombs), which the parent comment did not mention:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon</a></p>
<p>This type of weapon causes a massive air based shockwave which creates a vacuum. Air then violently rushes into the vacuum, which can cause massive lung damage. This type of weapon can be used against fortified targets, killing everyone inside a bunker without penetrating it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency study,[15] &quot;the effect of an FAE explosion within confined spaces is immense. Those near the ignition point are obliterated. Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, and thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.&quot; Another Defense Intelligence Agency document speculates that, because the &quot;shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue ... it is possible that victims of FAEs are not rendered unconscious by the blast, but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate&quot;.[16]</p>

<p>So how does obliteration of a body occur? I mean, what's happening and why? Is there any way to know if it's painful?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, first thing I thought of was FOAB wasn't in there, but neither was MOAB, really (both concussive and thermal). MOAB (Massive Ordinance, Air Blast, aka Mother of All Bombs) is a non-nuclear device that destroys cave systems and about 5 miles of terrain. FOAB, or Father of All Bombs, is a thermobaric device Russians say is 4x more powerful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why if you light a pile of gun powder in open air, it just sparks and fizzles harmlessly. But if pack gun powder tightly in a sealed container, like a bullet shell or musket barrel, the tiny sparks and fizzles have nowhere to go, so the pressure builds and it explodes, launching the bullet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. Black powder is a low explosive, meaning that the front of combustion moves through the material at a sub-sonic speed. It doesn't combust fast enough to cause a detonation, deflagrating instead. Since the front travels at sub-sonic speeds, it will <em>never</em> cause a shockwave by itself. However, if enough is used to propel an object past the speed of sound, such as a bullet, <em>that object</em> will cause a shockwave.</p>
<p>Flash powder, the primary chemical used in fireworks to make them actually pop (as opposed to launching them,) is a high explosive. If you fill a firework with black powder, it will (probably) just make a pop and push out the end caps. If you take a big enough tube and put a pile of flash powder in it, you don't even need endcaps on it. It will still detonate and shred the tube to pieces. The combustion front moves at a supersonic speed, and will cause a shockwave <em>almost</em> every time.</p>
<p>What the comment you were replying to was talking about is for a totally different reason. Those gasses need oxygen to burn, and it's not stored in them like it is in black or flash powder. Since chemical reactions happen most efficiently at certain ratios of reactants, they'll have different properties at different ratios. For example, the ideal ratio of air to gasoline vapor in internal combustion engines is 14.7:1.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've personally experienced this. Propane burner on my smoker went out. I noticed when I went to check and without thinking,just fired up my lighter. Big scary woosh noise,melted mustache,half gone eyebrows and a tiny burn no worse than a bad sunburn on one side of my nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: a long long time ago I was unhappy and lying on the floor next to an open butane gas bottle that had been gushing gas in a small room for about 30 minutes or something. Without getting into legal problems, I can affirm that the spark came from roughly between my fingers. There was a big woosh, and the wall next to my nose dissappeared, giving me a view of the lounge, and the curtains and bed caught fire, eventually taking that half of the aprtment with them. I hung around for a bit but not too long. The only thing that happened to me was a scratch on my naked ass from plaster falling on it from the ceiling, and the invoice to fix the place. It was totalled through temprature, smoke and firebrigade damage, but structurally sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading about the 5psi overpressure rule - any shockwave that causes at least a 5psi pressure difference between the outside and inside of the body is almost certainly fatal due to lung damage. When you consider 5psi in a bike tyre, it's nothing, but apparently it's fatal in an explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot more surface area on your body, and a lot more energy if you have a wave of 5 psi coming at you. You're probably over 8x60 inches, so you have over a ton of force being applied to you in a wave.  Ouch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the overpressure so much that matters, which is why divers don't die when they're at double plus atmospheric pressure. The issue is that the 5psi wave is basically a solid wall or air, moving at you at 160mph, and kills in the same way that jumping off a bridge into water will kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Divers don't experience overpressure.  Overpressure is a measure of the difference in pressure across a shock wave.   For a diver there is no pressure difference across their body, the pressure inside their bodies is the same as outside.  Overpressure is deadly because of the time scale it happens at.  It is literally squeezing your organs an popping them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason that's true is because of the compressibility of air vs wet tissue.</p>
<p>5psi transferred through your body (think ballistics gel) with an air cavity in the center of it means that the difference in compressibility between your lung air space and your much denser tissue creates a sharp divide where air and tissue intersect; spaces like the alveoli of your lungs, which are essentially just a ton of air/tissue surface area.</p>
<p>Think of a stack of layered plastic wrap or something with an air bubble in between the stack; as the shockwave passes through, it separates the closest layer of the wrap from the rest of the stack.</p>
<p>That separation in biological terms means fluid between the top layer and the rest of the stack/tissue, and that fluid prevents gas exchange.</p>
<p>There are similar concussive effects on the skull/brain, but lung damage is likely at quite a bit lower overpressure than brain damage because of the aforementioned air cavities.</p></div>		</li>
