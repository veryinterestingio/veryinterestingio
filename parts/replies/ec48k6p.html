			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll admit that was partially a guess, but just from observation. Small weightlifters are very, very lean but it's impossible to be that lean as you go up in size. Something like a 7% difference in bodyfat in combination with the square-cube law would be enough to match the numbers, which seems reasonable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's not really the case you can definitely be as lean at 105kg assuming they're maybe a bit taller, just look at bodybuilders. If these guys at the top of the game in weight lifting are at 15% BF then it's because that's been shown to be the most optimal for them. Not because they can't get down to 8% and have more muscle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that they're bigger, but i would have thought they'd still keep their body fat in check to stay within their weight class. The only place where it wouldn't matter is the top weight class. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could in part be for insulation. Though that's entirely speculation on my part. <a href="https://youtu.be/MUWUHf-rzks" target="_blank">Kurzgasagt has a great video about the thermodynamics of shrinking or growing various animals.</a> And humans would get colder the smaller we become. That might also explain why men and women get hot or cold easier/harder. And evolutionarily shorter stature might also necessitate developing a better fat storage system. We do know that some forms of obesity can be linked to genetics.</p>
<p>Again though, this is me speculating so take what I say worth a grain of salt since I don't have any research or references to back me up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Similar to the point about pull-ups, Olympic lifters still need to move most of their own bodyweight, even though only the weight on the bar is measured. It's probably about <a href="https://exrx.net/WeightTraining/Bodyweight" target="_blank">77%</a> of bodyweight, seeing as how a snatch or clean-and-jerk moves the same body segments as a squat.</p>
</li>
<li>Heavy lifters with low BF, e.g. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dmitry+klokov&amp;tbm=isch" target="_blank">Dmitry Klokov</a> must necessarily be taller since the amount of muscle that a person can gain without putting on fat as well depends on the size of their frame, and longer limbs = worse leverages.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also assume that height is a factor. A lighter weightlifter will probably be shorter, AND have shorter arms, so the amount of work (weight times height if I recall my physics correctly) is significantly less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leverages definitely play a role, and height has a lot of influence on leverages. I'm not sure how large the effect may be in comparison to something like the square-cube law, and it probably depends on the specific lift. The square-cube law is extremely general, so just the fact that it fits the data to within ~10% is pretty impressive</p></div>		</li>
