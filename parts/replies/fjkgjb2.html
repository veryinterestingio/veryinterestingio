<p>If you're talking about stage hypnotism, it's not actual mind control. A hypnotist can't get you to do anything you don't want to do, and it's more about the social pressure of responding to commands that aren't causing any direct harm. So a hypnotist might be able to get you to cluck like a chicken for fun, but they'll never be able to make you jump off a bridge.</p>

<p>Yup.  I've been hypnotized three times by comedian/hypnotists.  It's fun, but it's hard to describe.  It's not like I'm not aware of what's happening and have no control.  It's just that I really, really, reallllllly want to play along, and have no concerns about looking like a fool in front of a room full of strangers.   </p>
<p>It's &quot;real&quot; in that it definitely has an effect, but it's not mind control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I've been hypnotized twice.  </p>
<p>Once on stage in my HS, which didn't seem to do much, but I think he knew that and gave me a very simple thing to do, and sent me back to the audience.  He whispered it to me.  When he said some sort of trigger word, I was supposed to jump up, turn my invisible cape, say &quot;I'm Batman&quot;, and run out the door.  I knew I was supposed to do it, but after a while I had completely forgotten, and when he said the key word I was in the middle of conversation, so I barely heard it.  Sure enough, I jumped up, did the thing, and my  buddy had no idea, so he was confused af.  It had some effect on me, but the ones that stayed on stage did much more ridiculous things.</p>
<p>The second time was my psych professor.  After going over hypnosis in class he asked for volunteers.  He &quot;put me under&quot; and I was about to call his bluff, as we was yammering on about nonsense, he suggested to me something about middle names and how its easy to forget them, and just kept going on and on, and eventually had me say may full name.  I could not for the life of me remember my middle name.  It's hard to describe, but you know that feeling where something is on the tip of your tongue, and it's bothering you so much.   It felt just like that multiplied by 10.  Almost like there was a foggy glass barrier in my mind and my middle name was in large don't behind it, I could see it's there, but I just couldn't see it clearly and it was kind of maddening.</p>
<p>So to all of those that day it's complete bs, I disagree based on personal experience, but it's not magic either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my experience with a stage hypnotist. My train of thought and decisions were definitely my own, but by the time you make it to the final group of people for the show you just go with it. I ended up chatting with the hypnotist at the bar afterward and she was an open book about the stage show. All she has to do is identify the people willing to be silly on stage and provide enough showmanship to make your decision to participate almost inevitable.</p></div>		</li>
