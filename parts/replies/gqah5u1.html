			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. Gestation times depend on more than anatomy. Resource availability and quality, safety (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wildebeest" target="_blank">blue wildebeest</a> is able to stand and walk within minutes of birth, because they need to outrun predators almost immediately), community (a strong support system allows more time for juvenile development), litter size, and more all affect how precocious an animal is at birth. It's a complex interplay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we had our first child, we were told by nurses and birthing-class instructors that they refer to the first three months of a baby's life as &quot;the fourth trimester.&quot; It's an in-joke or meme to these folks.</p>
<p>But the implication is that a baby needs about three more months before it's not in constant critical danger of dying. They can't even regulate their own body temperature.</p>
<p>You're supposed to swaddle your baby and let it sleep in a completely empty crib so it didn't suffocate on blankets. For 6 months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a horse or deer pops out and it's pretty much ready to go.</p>
<p>I've had two infants (who are thankfully 2 awesome kids) and it was the most intense and stressful experience of my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you know how most mammals come out and can walk within a couple hours and coherent communication is not so far behind. That's how long it would take. Today a baby can start walking at about a year old (any ya there are some early walkers at a couple months). I hesitate to say an extra year because human baby development has also evolved to accommodate that they get jetted out prematurely. So it's possible things would go differently and faster if they were allowed to gestate for longer in the womb.</p></div>		</li>
