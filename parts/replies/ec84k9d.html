			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, sorry.  I just happen to like Likehouse.  I even was up in Sandpoint Idaho once and visited their factory!  They had a &quot;tour&quot; which, it turned out, was a room with a window into the factory, that's it.  But to be honest I'm a blue cheese cultist and that's the dressing of theirs that I like.  As a lesser ranch afficionado, I must defer to you my good sir.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to say this! I also enjoy Litehouse. Funny enough it doesn't taste exactly like restaurant ranch but it is definitely closer than most. Litehouse happens to be a little sweeter and has chunks of veggies like celery.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I work in a kitchen at large business HQ, roughly 1000 people on campus. We go thru Ranch like water. It's Hidden Valley packets and you just follow the recipe. IMO it's not as good as Litehouse, it ok, but maybe that's the Idaho in me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have to agree. I tried every ranch at the store looking for the restaurant taste. Had to make it myself. Litehouse tasted like wishbone. Not too good especially for the price. </p></div>		</li>
