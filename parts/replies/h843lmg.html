			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas heat is much more common the further north you live in the U.S.  Remember, it's a big country so what's true in one state may not be true in another. </p>
<p>We have natural gas for the furnace, water heater, fireplace and grill.  It's so nice to have gas always available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Central Ky checking in here. A lot of the more developed parts of the state has natural gas lines, but many of the outlying areas don't. </p>
<p>My house has a gas water heater and fireplace as well as a heat pump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps that Norway has basically infinite access to hydro power.  The USA is basically a desert.  Quebec and BC have lots of waterfalls.  I believe Canada has the most fresh water in the world.  </p>
<p>North America doesn’t have east to west and vice versa electrical distribution yet.  This is what Berkshire Hathaway energy is developing right now, but it’s a 20-30 year project.  Also, you get large losses moving power across large distances etc.</p>
<p>So heat pumps vs gas does not always financially make sense.  AC/heat pumps creates havoc on grids.  Also, electrical failures in cold places means no heat.</p>
<p>I like heat pumps, but for the world to move to them, we need the infrastructure to support them/cheaper to operate.</p>
<p>A 97% efficient gas furnace + insulation can actually have a lower carbon footprint in many areas.  It depends on the infrastructure in each location.</p>
<p>People think this is a policy problem, but it’s actually a large scale engineering/natural resource problem.</p></div>		</li>
