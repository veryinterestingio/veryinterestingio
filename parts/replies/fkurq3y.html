			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of the story about rabbits in Australia that are immune to myxomatosis. They were introduced for food and are invasive so they decided to opt to spread the disease through the population killing off 99.8% of the population. That last 0.2% were immune to the disease and the population boomed again.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then we made RHDV, which is still effective, and now we're constantly working on new strains of the virus to keep up with the immunity treadmill. It keeps populations low enough that they're easier to manage through conventional means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. We're using biological warfare to keep rabbit populations low? Is there no concern that the virus strains will mutate to have unexpected effects like transmission to humans or other mammal species? And how is this different in terms of risk compared to something like a gene-drive (I've gotten the impression the scientific community considers releasing a gene drive without studies would be irresponsible)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it really is so, tbh. A third world country like the one I live in, even dying from a bad case of influenza is really niche. </p>
<p>However, you can bet your entire bank balance that if you contract the HIV here, you're going down in flames. Immune Systems are really dependent on what you survived, basically. Granted, COVID is a new virus, but I'm certain almost everyone here will be able to shrug it off, unless if they're immunocompromised. Some are more resilient than others, because previously an entire generation nearly got wiped out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very likely.</p>
<p>Even weirder, there are some viruses that entered the lysogenic cycle, mutated, and lost the ability to exit the lysogenic cycle, leaving &quot;fossils&quot; behind in our DNA. Up to several percent of our DNA may be leftovers of ancient viruses.</p>
<p>(only certain kinds of viruses can do this though)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this, some diseases, like coronavirus, or influenza, or ebola, etc: they find reservoir in other animals</p>
<p>so even if a disease were theoretically (i say theoretically because in practice it is never true) wiped out from a species completely, the reservoir of that disease in other animals means cross-species transmission can still potentially take place and start the infection all over again</p>
<p>to build upon /u/passthedrugs 's bubonic plague example: prairie dogs are a reservoir for that in north america. even if no one is out there playing with prairie dogs risking getting bitten and infected a flea can make a jump onto you and bite you. your cat or dog can go after a prairie dog and bring it home to you</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/transmission/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/plague/transmission/index.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists think that plague bacteria circulate at low rates within populations of certain rodents without causing excessive rodent die-off. These infected animals and their fleas serve as long-term reservoirs for the bacteria. This is called the enzootic cycle.</p>
<p>Occasionally, other species become infected, causing an outbreak among animals, called an epizootic. Humans are usually more at risk during, or shortly after, a plague epizootic. Scientific studies have suggested that epizootics in the southwestern United States are more likely during cooler summers that follow wet winters. Epizootics are most likely in areas with multiple types of rodents living in high densities and in diverse habitats.</p>
<p>In parts of the developing world, plague can sometimes occur in urban areas with dense rat infestations. The last urban outbreak of rat-associated plague in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924-1925.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly this, bubonic plague can be mostly handled with modern medicine</p>
<p>i only used it as an example in regards to the topic at hand: a disease we think about as completely wiped out... except it is not, it is still out there amongst the rodents, probably forever, ready to come back to us at any time</p></div>		</li>
