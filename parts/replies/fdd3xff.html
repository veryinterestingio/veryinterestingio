			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it's applicable, but at least in Moscow, the 'stray' dogs that famously ride the Metro are actually all one (or a few?) packs, and have more or less formed their own sustainable population. Released/abandoned pets usually don't have the survival skills to make it long-term, and either end up living off of kindly strangers or dying. I imagine a similar dynamic is at play with stray populations in other cities, except maybe Istanbul, which has a pretty unique stray cat culture.</p></div>		</li>
