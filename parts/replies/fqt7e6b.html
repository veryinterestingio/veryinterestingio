			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. For you teeth it sure as hell is not good. Also constantly having the body creating insulin to deal with the constant new addition of glucose is probably the reason for many modern diseases, as this is something that never happened when we were hunter gatherers. </p>
<p>Intermittent fasting has made me feel better, but anything goes as long as you don't eat too much or too little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your own article discusses how hard thinking causes only a negligible increase in calorie expenditure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You will in fact burn more energy during an intense cognitive task than you would vegging out watching Oprah or whatever,” he says. But in the context of the average person’s overall energy expenditure, the difference in calorie burn from one mental task to another is a tiny amount, he adds.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not the calorie burn, its the energy stores.  there's not much spare glucose so its easy enough to burn to the existing stores over a couple hours (definitely not under an hour), even thought the total calorie count is only slightly higher at the end of the day.  But its definitely important to understand that mental engagement is not just things people would think of as &quot;complex&quot;.  Jogging will involve a good bit of brain power, just like calculus.  You need to percieve your surroundings, scan for surface texture, judge distances to obstacles, and all kinds of other things that require brain power.  And with the added benefit of burning additional working your muscles while jogging as well.</p>
<p>Essentially the brain is working hard all day, no matter what you're doing,  except maybe sleeping or really slow TV.  Outside of that, you're probably mentally engaged somehow which means there won't be much of a calorie difference at the end of the day.  But you usually are engaged and disengaged frequently, with things like TV - bathroom breaks, etc, compared to doing a 3 hour calculus test, or coding for 6 hours at a time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If this is the case, than surely brain energy expenditures don't explain feeling tired after doing difficult mental thinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean yeah, the mental effort of whatever you're doing even if it's complex math and you're concentrating as hard as you can pales in comparison to the rest of the stuff a brain needs to do constantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>calculate depth data from eye images, identify objects and faces, their positions, sizes and orientations in the world, align seen world with internal movement tracking from ear accelerometers and movement kinematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>merge audio signals from both ears to form 3D positional audio for all kinds of sources</p>
</li>
<li>subconsciously maintain the entire body even at rest - breathing, blinking, balance, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>And after all it always needs to use energy to keep all of its neurons alive, it's not like it can just turn off a few percent if they're not needed. So yeah, no wonder it's not that different.</p></div>		</li>
