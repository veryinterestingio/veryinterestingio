			<div class="markdown"><p>They are continuously ordering, installing, and replacing failed hard drives. Backblaze has a great ongoing blog series on their hard drive reliability, and they're a tiny fraction of Google: <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-hard-drive-stats-q2-2020/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-hard-drive-stats-q2-2020/" target="_blank">https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-hard-drive-stats-q2-2020/</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very hard to know.  There are over 20 production google / alphabet / youtube data centers, each with many thousands of spinning hard drives and SSDs.  Some storage is configured for local and/or remote redundancy.  New storage devices are brought online every day and old hard drives fail or are replaced.  </p>
<p>Then you can add in google's CDN, google transfer appliances, and non-prod data centers.  By the time you count what is actually deployed, it's already out of date.  </p>
<p>They could make an estimate at a point in time, but that information would be confidential and proprietary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now this one isn't really taking up a ton of storage. They store the video/tv shows once, and then your account gets a pointer to what you 'store', a small piece of data that says LAGreggM has 'recorded' Keeping up with the Kardashians and they're currently watching Season 5 episode 4 7:55:32</p>
<p>Source: built a very similar system for a different streaming service</p>
<p>Of course having to store the episodes in the first place does take up space, but not everyone gets a copy, so it's not as bad as what you'd think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and then that particular episode (because it's usually just one big video file) gets redistributed out to edge nodes near the customers which have that show &quot;downloaded&quot;, so that if you and Sally Sue down the road saved the same episode of Desperate Housewives it's very possible to be watching the same file on the same server in your city. CDNs are a hella neat thing.</p></div>		</li>
