			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that this is a common misconception. Just because we can't directly recycle formed thermoset plastics back into another formed thermoset plastic part doesn't mean that they can't be used as something else. </p>
<p>Were we to take a serious look at how else we could use the material in a different form, I think that we could find a use and &quot;recycle&quot; it. If budget or practicability weren't concerns, than we would clearly find a use for it: cut the material into tiny strips and weave cowboy hats for frogs or something. </p>
<p>Even inside of plastic forming, there are uses for <a href="https://www.plasticstoday.com/recycling/yes-thermoset-resins-can-be-recycled/25571967424816" target="_blank">thermoset plastics that have been ground into powder</a></p>
<p>Edit: Misconception was probably a poor choice of words, since OP was talking about constituent elements and I was thinking of recycling/repurposing in general. Sorry for that, and not trying to be inflammatory. It just bugs me that we pitch an insane volume of single use plastics, ocean buddies are eating a ton of it, and that koalas and kangaroos are on fire. </p>
<p>Carry on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're ignoring the energy and environmental cost of cutting that material, forming it into a new product, packaging that product, and distributing that product. Just because it CAN be turned into a new product doesn't mean it's the best thing for the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree.Cowboy hats for frogs are a horrible idea! I think that the challenge isn't in recycling the material, but rather in finding creative uses for something that is otherwise discarded and can be used more effectively to replace something else that is produced from raw resources. </p>
<p>Simply grinding up a product that isn't recyclable to use as less expensive filler for molded parts seems to somewhat fit that bill. I'm sure that more creative minds can imagine even more creative uses than my 30 second Google search to find better uses at a lower environmental impact. </p>
<p>It just bothers me a little that everyone is ok pitching thermoset plastics because some dude said &quot;They can't be recycled&quot;. Let's think deeper than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make some good points, but I think what iamnurd's said makes perfect sense. Who says we can't come up with innovative ways to reuse specific types of refuse material and profit? We already do! And regarding the environment, the alternative to reinvesting some energy on the same mererials twice is much better than just scraping it and starting from raw material in a lot of cases. Think of how we already reuse car tires in kid play grounds,  plastic water bottles into carpet fiber, plastics and other refuse into carpet pad etc.  While the energy and cost to the environment are not zero to remake the product, there is still worth to many materials long after their first and second uses. We just need to be creative in how we use it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's the misconception? Even thermoplastic polymers, let alone thermosets, cannot be turned back into a feedstock of close-to-&quot;virgin&quot; quality the way glass and metal can. </p>
<p>Sure, you can turn a chunk of thermoset plastic into something else, but that something else will typically be of much lower value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cowboy hats isn't scalable. Turning all plastic into something useful like diesel or oil that is then with additives to make plastic pellets again. The process as you see is one step extra than taking raw oil so it's more expensive, if the government puts it's finger on the scale here more recycled plastic would be used.</p>
<p>Beyond that you can make pseudo wood by mixing it with wood pulp.</p>
<p>Beyond that the best re-use of it is to burn it in special (cement) incinerators, that produces energy and removes the plastic out of the environment with no additional CO2 cost while also reducing CO2 from the fuel being replaced with plastic. Even better would be if we could do this and capture the CO2 at the end to form amonia to be used in agriculture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately everytime we try to put a cost impact commensurate with environmental impact, it gets shot down or gutted for being too expensive. Bit ironic. Though it would theoretically make the economics more favorable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: how recyclable is cloth (other than the obvious donating clothes), and is it worth it? It always upset me seeing thrown out clothes thinking they could be turned into new pairs of clothes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK discarded clothes that are not horribly stained or torn get cut and made into rags (wipers) whereas the stuff that is in worse condition might get shredded and used as fill or additives for paper-making.</p>
<p>I can recommend the book <em>Junkyard Planet</em> if you're interested in this stuff. The author (Minter) has another book out which I haven't yet read.</p></div>		</li>
