<p>I woke up one morning shaking and really groggy. I knew something was off. I went to the emergency and my vitals were all over the place. The doctor was smart to do a full blood test and it was actually a phosphorus deficiency. She said in 20+ years she had never seen that. </p>

They gave me a drink with a mega dose of it and told me to eat lots of high-potassium fruits and vegetables for a few days. It caused all sorts of weird issues including muscle twitches and weird heart rhythms. Took several months before everything cleared up and now I make sure to eat tons of potassium just in case lol.</p>

<p>Eat normally (&quot;balanced diet&quot;, occasional treat, not all junk food, etc. etc.) and every nutrient is in your food enough for you to live perfectly healthily.  The fact that you need only mg of vitamins tells you this - it's not used much and is in your blood, but you're consuming kgs of food every week so it's comparatively miniscule.  It's &quot;necessary&quot; but it's present in your body through incidental means anyway (your food isn't scientifically sterile and only has vitamin X in it) and your body has stores because it *is* vital.  Just don't let those stores deplete, but that can take weeks or months.</p>
<p>It really comes from &quot;recommended daily allowance&quot; which is a simplified stat to try to be indicative, not definitive, for an average over a long period, not a particular day.  You can't say &quot;50kg of fat per year&quot;, because people will read it to mean they can eat nothing then have 50kg of far over one week and kill themselves.  But similarly, you can't say &quot;5mg of Vitamin X per day&quot;, because it's a running average and you can go days / weeks without any at all.  The latter is safer to state, and it's easier to know what you eat per day, than per year.</p>
<p>Eat vaguely normally, avoid malnutrition (sorry, but a vitamin deficiency is basically indicative of malnutrition or a serious medical issue - taking supplements is like hiring an exercise bot to do your push ups for you rather than just doing some push ups), and you'll live as long as anyone else will.</p>
<p>And, no, taking more of them won't make you &quot;healthier&quot; any more than breathing more oxygen will.  And, yes, taking more of them than recommended can actually have detrimental effects in some instances.</p>
<p>Eat, drink, don't be an idiot.  You'll live into your 90's and beyond, barring anything else getting in the way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To elaborate on this, I remember learning in health class that there are two kinds of vitamins:  Water-soluble and fat-soluble.  Water-soluble vitamins easily dissolve in water, so if you eat too much of them your body will just pee out the excess.  Fat-soluble vitamins don't dissolve in water, so it takes much longer for the body to get rid of.</p>
<p>Vitamin C and all of the B vitamins are water-soluble, so it's rather difficult (though not impossible) to eat too much of them.  Vitamins A, D, E, and K are all fat-soluble, and can easily cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervitaminosis" target="_blank">Hyperviatminosis</a> if you eat too much too quickly.  For example, it's a somewhat well-known factoid that polar bear livers are toxic to humans due to the large amounts of Vitamin A in them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin as a term is also somewhat misleading to layperson. It sounds like they are a family of compounds that are only slightly different from each other. Vitamins of different classes are vastly different compounds. Vitamin A is a group of esters with long unsaturated carbon chain that can have rings. Vitamin Bs are a group of compounds that do not even share much similarity chemically but that they can are all water soluble and do stuff for cell metabolism. Vitamin C is ascorbic acid. That's it. Vitamin D is a family of compounds that are somewhat similar, so is E and K own families and while they are all fat soluble, they are chemically very different types of compounds.</p>
<p>It's like telling people that ships, rocket, cars, bicycles, toboggan and airplanes are all vehicles, in that they can all move and carry a person from point A to B, and then people thought that they are all like cars, just with different wheels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If anyone takes vitamin supplements and got worried when reading this, don't. You can't get hypervitaminosis &quot;easily&quot;, you'd have to be taking like 100 vitamin pills every day for that to happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have life-long deficiency of vit D, likely some absorption problem or something similar (never found the root cause, but maybe I should try that). Anyway, taking a vit D capsule always made me feel awesome an hour or two later - my body was finally getting what it had been missing for decades.</p>
<p>The only thing that fixed it was taking 3000 IU every single fucking day like it's a religious duty. That's on top of what I get normally from food.</p>
<p>BTW, don't take random shit &quot;just in case&quot;. Have tests done by doctors, and do what they say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Up to 200,000-400,000 IU are actually safe loading doses, but it's based on starting plasma levels and body weight. A non-deficient person should have less, and a deficient person who's smaller should have less. So a healthy person with a tiny child's body getting even the 600k IU just once is probably quite harmful.</p>
<p>The 5,000-10,000 IU supplements that most people take are actually not meant for every day maintenence. Various country's guidelines recommend 600-1000 IU per day if you don't have a deficiency. Although your friend taking vitamin k2 with it is doing that part right, hopefully they aren't taking 10,000 IU per day indefinitely as that will eventually build to toxic levels. </p>
<p>I'm more surprised the Vitamin D was the issue instead of the usual Iron poisoning kids often get from multivitamins.</p></div>		</li>
