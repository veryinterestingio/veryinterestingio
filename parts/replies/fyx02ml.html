			<div class="markdown"><p>While 100% accurate, it is important to note that changes in hospitalizations lag 2-3 weeks behind tests, and deaths lag an additional 1-2 weeks behind that, so comparing cases to deaths on a day by day basis, as the white house has been doing, is highly misleading.</p>
<p>By the time deaths start to increase, you have a four week backlog of people who will eventually die, regardless of how we adjust public policy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evidence that we've lowered the death rate is mixed.</p>
<p>Early on tests were going to very sick people who, given that they were already very sick, were more likely to die. Additionally, the age groups being tested are vastly different now, with younger people making up a larger portion of the tested and positive populations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's a good measure, with massive age stratification in death percentage your data is going to be skewed toward the age of those most likely to get sick. For example right now we're seeing younger people getting Covid in this peak and as a result our excess death data is way down from its own peak despite our Covid numbers doubling.</p></div>		</li>
