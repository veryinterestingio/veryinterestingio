			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the fact that larger animals like cattle expend a lot more energy simply to maintain their massive bodies and take about 3 years to reach maturity for slaughter.  In contrast, a chicken doesn't have to expend energy lumbering around with 2000 pounds of itself and reaches maturity in eight weeks.  The result is that they require much less feed, are less inefficient to farm per pound of meat, and the process produces much less greenhouse gas emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's accounted for in the 10 calories to 1 ratio. The ratio is lower for animals like chickens or fish who don't expend as much energy and reach maturity sooner.</p></div>		</li>

2000 pounds is a massively overfed beef.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those calories come from feedstock which we wouldn't be producing if it weren't for the livestock. Instead of feedstock which, as you point out, humans wouldn't eat, we would plant vegetables and grains.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was true 50 or so years ago. But today, a lot of these calories are added via soy and corn.</p></div>		</li>
