			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit too simplified perhaps. Two glucoses together are not considered starch. Maltose, (two alpha-1,4 linked glucoses) still tastes sweet and certainly doesn't replicate the properties of starch. Three glucoses (maltotriose) still has some sweetness, though it drops off rapidly at this point. When you are in the 3-20 or so glucoses long these are oligosaccharides known as maltodextrins. They are rapidly broken down into glucose by salivary amylase, but on their own are only slightly sweet to flavorless. They also have physical properties (and uses in food) that are distinct from starch. Its really only when you get beyond that length that you are really talking about starch.</p></div>		</li>

The lactaid milk will have the lactose broken down into glucose and galactose and will taste noticeably sweeter because you've went from a disaccharide to two monosaccharides</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have to hold it in your mouth for a good bit longer than you normally would for it to be noticeable and it helps to keep everything moving to ensure the newly liberated sugars hit your taste buds.</p>
<p>Chew a saltine cracker for a good five minutes without swallowing.  It'll start to taste sweet well before the 5 minute mark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's actually a way that indiginous tribes in peru used to make a type of beer called Chicha they would sit and chew starchy corn and then spit it into a container. The salivary amylase would break the starches down into simple  sugars and then they would be fermented by wild yeast and bacteria and then they would drink it.</p></div>		</li>
