Not only are they already carrying a small electronic device that was specifically designed to capture and transmit audio, but they both pay a monthly fee and participate in a daily ritual to keep said device in an active state.</p>
<p>Edit: I give up. There are people in this thread that are either completely missing the point or are genuinely unable to process the logic involved in this example. Either way... there's nothing beneficial to add.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I once attended a Richard Stallman speech and it included an angry rant during the book signing about how he was upset people were using debit cards. As part of the rant, he pulled out an ancient Nokia phone and demonstrated that he removes the battery unless he is expecting a call or about to make one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stallman is way too rigid in his ideology. The world needs people like that, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not stupid, I leave my phone at home when Im driving around to do illegal shit</p>
<p>Anyways, the answer is obvious. Everyone speeds and does illegal shit when driving. Get pulled over doing 20 over the limit? Now the cop is going to use your own footage against you, and also see that you were doing 40 over the limit before he even caught you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or even if you're doing something totally legal that you don't necessarily want evidence of. Visiting a secret lover or something.</p></div>		</li>
