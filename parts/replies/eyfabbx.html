			<div class="markdown"><p>In basic terms you could end up with a similar situation but in different parts of the spine. There is also a chance that if the pillow we large enough it could impact the lumbar spine, lower back. This may also affect the hips.</p>
<p>When I was in school one of my classmates was constantly complaining about having a rib out. We came to the conclusion that her sleeping position was likely the culprit. She typically layed on her stomach with her head to turned to the side, let's say she's turned her head to the right in this example, while bringing her right arm up above her head and right leg bent at the hip and knee up toward her chest. This position generally requires rotation of the spine. That rotation was part of what caused her rib to keep misaligning. I realize that doesn't address your question but is another example of sleep position and it's possible impact.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, laying on my back with no pillow helps to align my neck to a neutral position, but on the other hand it causes my lower back to be overly curved- I need a stack of pillows below my knees to have a truely neutral spine position!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used a very flat pillow, or even a folded up towel, to keep my head/spine level. It helped me a bit with some pain.  Using nothing forced my neck to tilt back a little too much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it just depends on the person. Generally speaking it is a neutral position. However if you consider an elderly person who spent their years in their garden they may have developed what look like a &quot;hunch back&quot; or exaggerated and permanent curve of the spine. This person would not benefit from laying on their back without a pillow. This is why I like to recommend consulting a chiropractor and figuring out what's best for you personally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you can say that laying on your back without a pillow will put your neck in a neutral position. This may be the case for many or even most people, but I have a developed back from strength training and lying on my back without a pillow definitely puts my neck into extension.</p>
<p>If the goal is to keep the spine neutral at various points, no position will be a one-size-fits-all solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is why you may have noticed that throughout my other comments I put in such an effort to not make definitive statements.</p>
<p>We can also call this the difference between a structural and functional change. Yours sounds like a functional change, meaning due to your training your body has developed in a way that needs a different type of sorry I'm order to remain neutral. A structural change would be a curve in the spine that basically looks like a &quot;hunch back&quot; formed over many years of bending forward.</p>
<p>No one position will be a one-size-fits-all is exactly right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any advice for guys like me that have more developed upper backs? I used to be able to sleep on my back with no discomfort. Now I feel some soreness despite paying close attention to pillow height and keeping my neck neutral. Even when my neck is ostensibly neutral, this puts some pressure on the back of my head.</p>
<p>I recently found this video and it cites a study that suggest that side sleeping may be better for optimal glymphatic function during sleep. Another study suggests that side sleeping is natural for tribal peoples. Side sleeping for me is also a problem because of wide shoulders also due to upper body development. If I switch to side sleeping, and use a pillow to keep my neck laterally, would this be optimal? Or does side sleeping present other issues lower down in the spine?</p></div>		</li>
