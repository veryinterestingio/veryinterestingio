			<div class="markdown"><p>It‚Äôs not actually your eyes that do the ‚Äúseeing,‚Äù it‚Äôs your brain.
The physical eyeballs are for sensory input only. Like cameras, the light comes in through the aperture lens and travels to the back surface of the eye. Instead of film to capture the image, specialized cells called rods and cones (at the back of the eye) register the light as it hits them and sends that information on to the visual cortex in the brain, an area that receives and translates those signals. converting them into what we perceive as images.
Your brain is creating a real-time but indirect representation of the information coming into the eye. It‚Äôs tempting to think of that as a ‚Äúprojection ‚Äù of the image on to the brain, but the light itself doesn‚Äôt go through to the visual cortex, just the information. More like a digital signal. And there are physically different locations in the visual cortex that work on different aspects of the constructed image. Color, line, shape and movement are all processed separately in different areas, then merged together by the brain for your ‚Äúviewing‚Äù enjoyment!
Your brain is capable of doing the brain-only part when your visualizing or dreaming, it doesn‚Äôt require physical input from the eyeballs at all. It‚Äôs not as vivid of course as the ‚Äúreal‚Äù stimuli, but it can be real enough to be very convincing in dreams and hallucination. Hallucinations, by the way, are a good example of ‚Äúseeing things‚Äù that aren't being presented to the eyeball because the brain chemistry is being altered by drugs or mental illness
So a person could go blind in one of two ways, there could be damage to the eyeballs from injury or disease, which would prevent the light signals from getting transferred to the brain, or there could be damage to the visual cortex that would prevent the signals (from healthy eyeballs) from being properly translated into visual images.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed! Eyes are just a way for our biological systems to convert light into electrical impulses for our brains to perceive as colors and shapes. In the same way, your nose's olfactory cells are just a way for biology to convert molecular SHAPE into electrical impulses for our brains. Nerve cells in our fingers convert pressure and heat to electricity, our inner ear bones convert pressure waves to electricity, and so on. Everything needs to be converted to electrical impulses which allow our nerves to conduct those signals to our brain (nerves are specially designed just for this purpose - to transport potential energy changes from one part of our bodies to another). Specifically, with your eyes it's even weirder because your brain does not receive impulses that cover the full view, there's a part of your visual field that's blacked out because the light from that part of the visual field is projected at the spot the optic nerve meets the retina - and therefore does not stimulate rods/cones. Your brain uses a combination of pattern recognition and other tricks to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; so to speak so that you &quot;perceive&quot; an uninterrupted scene. Perceive is the keyword - note that it's not the same as what real-world objects have stimulated the retina.</p>
<p>If I implied that you needed eyes to imagine things, that wasn't my intention :)</p>
<p>The purpose (but not the only one) of your eyes with respect to the above is to provide past visual stimuli to assist in the brain's natural mental image construction processes. In other words, provide your brain with some previous pattern of electrical impulses that have already been defined to be a TV - so that you will stimulate those same nerves in order to generate the image in your mind's eye when asked.</p></div>		</li>
