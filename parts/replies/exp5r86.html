			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheres are not solid objects and still would produce drag from the interaction of the particles swirling around the atmosphere at a different rate than the orbiting body. The earths atmosphere moves at a different rate than earth rotates and is not uniform with latitude (Coriolis effect) The only way around that is to remove the atmospheres or make them so thin it doesnâ€™t matter on astronomical time frames.</p></div>		</li>

<p>is the sum total of the movement of earths atmosphere something other than zero with respect to earth? ie is there an underlying uniform movement in some direction?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ther's a software package for modeling these interactions: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258736842_BINSTAR_A_new_binary_stellar_evolution_code_Tidal_interactions" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258736842\_BINSTAR\_A\_new\_binary\_stellar\_evolution\_code\_Tidal\_interactions" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258736842\_BINSTAR\_A\_new\_binary\_stellar\_evolution\_code\_Tidal\_interactions</a></a> ... <a href="http://www.astro.ulb.ac.be/~siess/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.BINSTAR" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.astro.ulb.ac.be/\~siess/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.BINSTAR" target="_blank">http://www.astro.ulb.ac.be/\~siess/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.BINSTAR</a></a> ... but probably to really do anything with this one would need to get in touch with the researchers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without thorougly thinking it through yet I would guess that if both objects, planet and moon - or two twin planets, have gravitationally locked periods of rotation there should not be any atmospheric drag, since the entire atmosphere(s) should be moving with the planets.</p></div>		</li>
