<p>It becomes sort of muscle memory.</p>
<p>Its the same with stand up comedians, they test their jokes over small venues and if its a hit, they include it in their specials.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is even true for rappers who &quot;free style&quot; (improvise). They often have written out and memorized some rap. And when asked to free style on the radio, they just repeat what they memorized. Otherwise they would have to come up with rhyming words on the spot. Which many can't because writing a single song can often takes a couple of hours or longer.</p>
<p>The same applies for standup comedians dealing with hecklers. And improvise on the spot. They've throughout their career being heckled many times. So, they know exactly how to respond. I remember a standup comedian even saying that sometimes his delivery for his routine sucked, but that he had told that joke so many times that he still would manage to make the crowd laugh. Even though he was criticizing himself in his head for the delivery.</p></div>		</li>
