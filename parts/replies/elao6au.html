			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think this is true. I know Mandarin and bits of other dialects and there are phrases in one dialect that are simply not used in other dialects. I can’t imagine that all words can be understood. </p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Taiwan and China are still trying to figure out the flag and army bit (whether or not they are one country or two), in Taiwanese there’s a common phrase ‘pai se’ that is not entirely translatable to English but means a mix of “excuse me” and “I’m grateful”. In Mandarin the translation would be “bu hao yi si”. It’s not even the same number of words. </p>
<p>Taiwanese: 歹勢 (which Google can not translate)
Chinese: 不好意思</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be so... Admittedly I don't speak or read Chinese, so I wouldn't know about certain phrases or terms only one language uses... Its all chinese to me! ;D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but if people write to each other, they would develop a consensus, so they would avoid using words that each other doesn't know. People need to make compromises to understand each other.</p></div>		</li>
