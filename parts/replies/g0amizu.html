			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know, it's just something I kinda always knew. I was into tech from an early age, so maybe that makes a difference. But I know that unplugging, waiting a little/pressing the power button on a PC, and then starting the device up helps the software to flush some stored bullshit it gathers while being on. </p>
<p>I imagine it like a sewage-pipe, being clean at first, but over time dirt etc. accumulates and makes the drain worse. So you have to flush it or w/e and after that it will work nicely again.</p>
<p>You wouldn't believe me when some friends and family come to me for a little tech help and they complain about their mobilephone being super slow and I just turn it off, wait a little, turn it on again and that's it. </p>
<p>Many phones are turned on for days, weeks and even months without a single restart. Imagine all the dirt that accumulates in the software sewer.</p>
<p>I'm not a pro at all, but I hope I could give you some eli5-level insight :). Have a great day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok not to ask an even dumber question, but just to clarify: so this post is about products with computers specifically like phones and PCs? like this doesn’t apply to lamps or blenders, etc?</p>
<p>Also, is the unplugging tip different than just turning something off and back on again? Because I’ve definitely heard of that one before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just for <em>smart</em> devices, something like a blender or lamp doesn't have to do calculations where numbers can get messed up over time.</p>
<p>And yes, it's a little different to just turning something off and on again, although that helps out aswell. </p>
<p>Like others have said, there is always a little bit of electricity left in the system when turned off and sometimes you have to let all the electricity out to flush the memory of devices.</p>
<p>I am not a professional though. And with modern mobile phones for example, I don't even know how how you would get all the energy out of the system, without being able to remove the battery. I think software companies are constantly improving this issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many newer devices don't actually turn off when you press the power button. They go into standby mode which keeps certain things functioning.</p>
<p>My soundbar does this so I can control it using an app on my my phone. Last week sound over hdmi stopped working even after turning it &quot;off&quot; and on again. Pulling the power fixed it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's different per device. Once swapped the battery of my phone (when that was still a thing), it was without battery for like a full 2-3 seconds and after closing the back case I was pleased to see that it was still running! Saved me a minute since that phone booted really slow.</p></div>		</li>
