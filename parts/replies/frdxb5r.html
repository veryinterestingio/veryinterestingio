			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope you reconsider:</p>
<p>All things that are still alive while typically eaten, if not killed (often heat) beforehand.</p>
<p>some Vegetables (especially roots like onions, carrots, parsnip, everything that sprouts when left alone). also a lot of green leaves (on burgers) are still somewhat alive, as they last much longer raw, then when you cook them, because they actively defend themselves against spoiling, using up their energy.</p>
<p>all Fruits (apples, oranges, Berries, Bananas(that is why they ripe at home)  tomatoes on burgers)</p>
<p>Eggs (although not fertilized. Ever noticed that uncooled and unwashed eggs have an unusually long shelf life of easily more than a month?)</p>
<p>Seeds (sunflower, almonds, flax, chia, etc. - they all sprout when put in water)</p>
<p>Bonus fact: cut raw potatoes increase!! their Vitamin C content by actively producing it, do defend against oxidation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm very interested in your claim that raw potatoes produce vitamin c when cut to prevent oxidation. While this does make some logical sense, I can't find any info on that on Google. Do you have a source for that claim? I'd like to read more about it.</p></div>		</li>
