<p>They are less likely to over/under cook, leave portions sitting out due to poor timing, forget to stir while watching tv, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first started cooking at home years ago, it was comical how bad my timing was. I used to really struggle to make more than one dish at a time. It stressed me out and I'd panic and get flustered. Prep used to take forever, and I hadn't learned to do prep first. Cold food was served a lot. I'm better now with experience, but thinking back is kinda embarrassing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get around that problem by only cooking one dish at a time!</p>
<p>But actually though, even in professional kitchens, a single employee is generally focused on their specialized jobs, they're not going to be doing everything all by themselves like you would at home</p></div>		</li>
