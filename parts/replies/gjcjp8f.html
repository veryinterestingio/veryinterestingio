			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd venture that what a lot of people intuit about 'electricity' isn't the electrons themselves, but the other emergent properties about electron movement that they actually interact with, like the potential and the current(voltage and amperage). I understand this sounds like sophistry, but I feel like most of these answers, breaking down electricity to the individual charges, is setting people up to think that &quot;electricity&quot; is just electrostatics. </p>
<p>The reality is, we first discovered electricity by measuring current and potential, that is, by studying the dynamics of fairly large movements of charges. Then later we realized that there exists a certain mathematical constant for charge, which we call the electron, that is also shared with the proton(and later, the positron and antiproton). </p>
<p>I feel like the natural progression for &quot;how we discovered the actual physical processes&quot; is a bit more intuitive when learning, because that's part of the reason we learned it that way. We studied the things that made intuitive sense, and iterated on them until we got to where we are now, even though it seems like things now are very abstract and esoteric(see, The Standard Model, and how many people actually understand it, and I'm not even going to count myself among them)/ </p>
<p>Anyway, I don't dislike your explanation, but I felt the need to say this in this thread, and hope that people would read it to perhaps incorporate it themselves if they agreed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you to a point that learning things the way we learned historically may be best (biology/anatomy, learn the outside before learning the inside, mathematics, gotta add before multiply) but that inherently teaches about electricity wrong. Electricity IS the movement of electrons and what they affect is so many things. By teaching what they affect first and then teaching its just a bunch of angry pixies moving around cause they want to, it's confusing.</p>
<p>By teaching that electrons WANT to move towards a state of equilibrium and low energy it explains things like why magnets &quot;won't&quot; bounce when they hit unlike to other rocks, it helps understand why high amperage will kill you faster than high voltage (imagine being run over by 100 people in one swoop vs 100 propel one at a time, you can more easily brace/protect against one at a time by curling into a ball but 20,000 pounds of human stompage kills you quick)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you can teach it in an intuitive way without lying. I used the words potential and current, which are the actual words we use to describe electrical phenomena, that have their basis in actual science. We can teach things in the pathway forged by history, but using the language that is based in the lessons we've learned since then. </p>
<p>There's a reason why most physics courses require kinematics before electricity and magnetism, and that's because you can start teaching people about energy with kinematics, and with energy you can teach about potential. With electricity, electric potential <em>is</em> voltage. Current <em>is</em> charge movement in a unit time, just like a flow velocity. </p>
<p>My point here is, we can use the correct terminology, but still teach from a phenomenological perspective(here, we see something happening. What is that thing that is happening? Let's analyze it, measure it, make predictions, and then see what happens when we make those predictions). Presuming that a <em>quanta of charge</em> exists is outside of that phenomenological experience. When you do a statics demonstration, we witness a buildup and discharge of <em>charge</em> but there is nothing about that that is understood to be quantized. You should build up to the idea that it is quantized through phenomenological methods, and you can, by doing the experiments that were historically done that show how we broke down the details we understand about charge. </p>
<p>This sets up the actual scientific method much more clearly in a student's mind. We didn't start by just knowing things. We witnessed things, and we broke down the problem in a way that allowed us to see deeper into the problem at hand.</p></div>		</li>
