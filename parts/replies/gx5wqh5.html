			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a cool question about how the structure of individual trees grow and change over time. I'd say it totally depends on both the species of tree and how it is competing with other members of its community, as well as characteristics of its physical habitat. Trees respond in different ways to their environment, which means that some trees can show different growth forms depending on their circumstances. An oak tree growing on someone's open lawn may grow wider, with a large crown, whereas the same oak growing in a closed canopy forest will grow tall to out-compete others for light. In mountain environments with high wind exposure, some trees remain short and compact, whereas the same species may grow taller with more branches at a wind-sheltered site nearby. - Paul Montesano</p></div>		</li>
