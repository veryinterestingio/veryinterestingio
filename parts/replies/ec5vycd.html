			<div class="markdown"><p>They say that <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/role/staff-contractors/" target="_blank">over 300 people</a> work for them, which means the average wage is around 114k USD. Glassdoor says that software engineers there earn between 95k and 122k, so that seems to match my back of the envelope math. Glassdoor also says that that salary is on the lower side in that field.  </p>
<p>Maybe the pay for employees still feels excessive for a nonprofit, but given what Wikipedia/Wikimedia is (the 5th highest trafficked website globally for the year 2018), they are competing for the same employees that Google, Facebook, Reddit, Netflix, Amazon, etc are chasing after.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. They probably pay less, but people are willing to take pay cuts to avoid working for a soulless corporate monster.  Everyone has a price however, so Wikipedia needs to pay enough so that Google and company can't cherry pick the most brilliant engineers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another point: Why should employees at nonprofits earn less than employees at for-profits?  Nonprofit simply means that money raised by the organisation must be spent on improving the organisation and not lining the pockets of third parties. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want good services from good non-profits, it should not be considered taboo to pay good salaries to their employees. It's absolutely right that the people at Wikipedia get paid their due, their free product is one of the best things in the human experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great point but it does seem like the tendency is that part of the &quot;pay&quot; for working a nonprofit job is the good feeling employees have about the mission they serve. That means they often accept lower pay, whether or not they &quot;should&quot;. I've seen this mentality in pay and work personally while working in childcare settings and it drove me out of the field.</p>
<p>I like how you think, but in my experience of the world people accept lower pay when they are &quot;serving a greater cause&quot; which means they tend to get given a lower pay. It's not the best cycle, but it seems to happen.</p>
<p>I wish I had real sources to cite instead of pure anecdote. I don't even know what terms I'd use to start a search though!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, they cost 40-60% of many operations that involve people. </p></div>		</li>
