			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also, and I'm sure the commentor above well appreciates this, a unusual arrangement called a &quot;flying freehold&quot;.</p>
<p>A flying freehold is where part of your property overhangs another.  For example, there is a theatre in London (the Fortune Theatre) built right next to a church where part of the church building intrudes into the theatre above ground level (it's a corridor of the church, and there are theatre stalls beneath it).  So rather than a simple boundary on a map, the theatre and church each own different overlapping chunks of the space above the ground.</p>
<p>The counterpart &quot;creeping freehold&quot; is when you have the same arrangement underground.  For example, where your cellar extends underneath your neighbour's property.</p>
<p>Both are potentially problems.  Changes/repairs to either property will often necessitate access to the other, and there are issues regarding responsibility for maintenance, etc.  It's like a massively more complex and problematic partition wall.  Having a flying/creeping freehold can be an issue when it comes to matters like mortgages and insurance - although a novelty it is 100% not a desirable thing to have.</p></div>		</li>
