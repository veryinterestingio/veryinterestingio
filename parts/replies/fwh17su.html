			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you use the electricity from the solar panels to power a giant laser that just beams excess energy off into space?</p>
<p>On a similar note, could you do something like that to cool a satellite?</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear, since comments keep offering more efficient options, I'm not looking for a practical solution, or the most efficient. I'm asking if it theoretically would be <em>possible</em>. I fully realize that it would be impractical for a number of reasons, not least of which is efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking into geoengineering options. According to <a href="https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/9/5539/2009/acp-9-5539-2009.pdf" target="_blank">this study on different options:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate geoengineering is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of CO2 emissions, rather than as an alternative to it. Strong mitigation could achieve the equivalent of up to −4 W m−2 radiative forcing on the century timescale, relative to a worst case scenario for rising CO2. However, to tackle the remaining 3 W m−2 , which are likely even in a best case scenario of strongly mitigated CO2, a number of geoengineering options show promise. Some shortwave geoengineering measures, most promisingly stratospheric aerosol injections, have the potential to roughly cancel mitigated CO2 radiative forcing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I always wondered with these solutions (knowing only the general physics behind and not really the math details), wouldn't those shade elements not act as a solar vessel and be eventually either thrown into Earth's or some other unpredictable way, or just slowly dissolve? I mean, they can't possibly just absorb radiation non-stop forever and not be affected in any way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:</p>
<p>While it is true that in the end everything becomes heat, we can try to slow down this process. This is simply done by converting the oil into chemical bonds and store it somewhere were it can't escape easily. If we do this with CO^2 and manage to create oil, this amounts to literally pumping the oil back into the earth. And this would definitely cool the planet.</p>
<p>Now, this of course goes slightly against the question itself which argued for the net-effect of solar-cells itself. as we now don't have to worry about the heat dissipation of the converted part of the photon energy, we are now left with four effects: first the portion of the light that is converted into heat at the surface, second the portion of the remaining reflected light that scatters into heat while bouncing through the atmosphere third the heat generated by the chemical-bonding procedure and fourth the portion of energy that we store. </p>
<p>I am not sure we have enough information to answer this question because it hinges a lot on the heat generated by the transformation process. if that is low efficiency we will easily produce MORE heat than a dark surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean this is really the issue. The amount of energy we receive from the sun dwarfs everything else. It is in fact part of the problem. There is an upper limit to how much heat the earth can lose to the vacuum of space through radiation. In order to cool the earth we would need to absorb/generate less heat than we can effectively loose to the universe. Otherwise we get a runaway greenhouse effect. Like Venus.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>What? No, that doesn't seem right. Earth loses energy according to the Stefan-Boltzman law: sigma*T^(4) </p>
<p>There is no upper bound to this. In fact the energy emitted depends on the 4th power of the temperature. So a small increase in temperature will lead to a larger increase in emitted temperature. In fact this is a negative feedback loop since it cools down the planet faster, the hotter it gets. It's called Planck Feedback.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>no the runnaway greenhouse effect occurs when a positive feedback loop goes out of control and starts to dominate all other effects. But we are not in danger of that happening. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1593" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1593</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they mean the earth only emits so much heat for a given temperature (then there's a lower bound as well; it's the same number). So if we want to lose heat energy, the earth's temperature has to rise.</p>
<p>We're probably not going to become Venus but there's still the risk of some feedback effects (polar ice melts, oceans reflect less heat, earth warms up more than we expect).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really... at any given time there is an EXACT amount of energy that WILL be lost to space through radiation and that is determined by different physical properties of the planet... including how hot it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to cool the earth we would need to absorb/generate less heat than we can effectively loose to the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but what we really want is an equilibrium point that we are comfortable with. The system will always find a point of balance since the rate of energy loss to space increases with increased temperature... what we are doing with greenhouse gas emissions is raising the temperature of that point of balance.</p></div>		</li>
