			<div class="markdown"><p>I will have to try! Fat lessens tannin/bitterness, as well, so it’s not surprising it works so harmoniously. I’m a sommelier, so trying to think about balancing different flavors is my favorite part of my job. And this sure does sound delicious!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting thought. Our sensory systems are geared up to detect change, so there may be something rewarding about switching the stimulus. That will happen further upstream though.</p>
<p>However, this is more to do with specific satiety, I think. Our hunger and appetite are closely linked with our sensory system. When you start to get full on something savoury, those messages of satiety are partly made up of input from salt and umami sensory pathways. If you stop that input (by switching to something sweet), you won't feel as full. Yay, dessert stomach!</p>
<p>It doesn't last though. The sensory stuff is a small part of satiety. You can enjoy a few bites of dessert on a full stomach before your brain realises you're still full.</p>
<p>I know this is not exactly what you asked, but I think it's probably similar mechanisms.</p></div>		</li>
