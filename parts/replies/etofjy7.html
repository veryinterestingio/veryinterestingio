			<div class="markdown"><p>I have book that talks about how really empty space is - the author says something like &quot;fill up a shoebox with sand - that's about the same number of grains of sand as there are stars in our galaxy. Now go into space, and spread the contents of the shoebox between the earth and the moon, 250,000 miles. The sand will be spread out at the same density of stars in out galaxy&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
