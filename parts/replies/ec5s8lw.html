			<div class="markdown"><p>Not very far.</p>
<p>Most likely less than a millimeter. Electrons don't move very fast. Even with DC the electrons will not move fast. But thankfully as said, it's the movement of electrons that is important. And the movement of electrons propagates pretty fast, allowing you to flip a switch and immediatly have a lightbulb light up.</p>
<p>This inpulse will be close to lightspeed.</p>
<p>Imagine an electron being put into one side of a wire, and another electron immediatly popping out of the other side. It is also one of those things that can be somewhat accurately described with a waterhose that is already filled with water. If you let let more water flow in on one side, it water will come out on the other side immediatly. That's not the water you just put into the hose. That water will now slowly travel along to the other side as you pump more water into the hose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electron drift is apparently way less than 1 mm/s in copper wire, so 60hz means (on a human scale), it practically doesn't.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, in this wire the electrons are flowing at the rate of 23 μm/s. At 60 Hz alternating current, this means that within half a cycle the electrons drift less than 0.2 μm. In other words, electrons flowing across the contact point in a switch will never actually leave the switch. </p>
