			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always referred to it as &quot;hall of mirrors&quot;. I vaguely remember someone in the early 2000s calling it that and it stuck with me. They may not have even been talking about the same thing though.</p>
<p>Edit: I actually remember now. When I played Jedi Knight 2 and 3 (this probably applied to any Quake 3-derivative engine), if you ended up far enough outside the game map that you completely exited the brush bounding box of the map, you'd end up with what looked just like the effect you're asking about. People in the community referred to it as the &quot;hall of mirrors&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was going to be my suggestion too. Except this one was meant to happen. Although I wonder if they made the animation look that way by accident by redrawing the moving card without updating the background and were all like “well yeah, that’s awesome, leave it”.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's reasonably likely. There's lots of &quot;bugs&quot; in games that got sold as a features. </p>
<p>Like that one time where exiting a game would cause some error to appear on the screen, so the programmers changed the error message to &quot;thank you for playing [game].&quot;</p>
<p>And that's by far not the only example.</p></div>		</li>
