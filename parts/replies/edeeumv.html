<p>On one hand, yes - you often see income per capita used as a proxy for quality of life. That said, without social welfare programs or a robust community culture, I wonder how income distributed to workers ever reaches non working population. Depending a countries economic model, income per working person would be a just as (if not more) relevant measure</p>

<p>It usually reaches them through the nuclear family. It goes to the spouse and children of the workers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Often when people are looking at average income they are using it to gain some measure of quality of life for the overall population</p>

<p>Which is incredibly coarse of course.  </p>
<p>For example the USA has a roughly 20% higher GDP per capita than Denmark, but it actually has the same GDP per hour worked. So people choose leisure over generating more economic activity. And this is before accounting for things like healthcare spending, which are far more efficient in Denmark.  </p>
<p>Plus, averages of course are distorted by outliers. Looking at better statistics for quality of life is really important. A simple start would be to look at the median income instead...</p></div>		</li>
