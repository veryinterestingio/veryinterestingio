<p>So he's saying CO2 reduces at 2.5% per year, not methane...but I definitely wouldn't trust that number. It's from a lone fossil fuel geochemist doing idle calculations in excel outside of any peer-reviewed sources, with seemingly little understanding of climate science.</p>
<p>I'd much sooner trust <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-residence-time.htm" target="_blank">a source like this</a>, which summarizes the wealth of actual climate science literature pretty clearly. Even though residence times for an individual molecule is actually pretty short (a few years), that's mostly a useless number if you're actually wondering about the perturbation response time, since the vast majority of CO2 molecules are simply exchanged from oceanic outgassing. What ends up being far more relevant is the timescale of oceanic circulation to expose a new top layer of ocean that isn't CO2 saturated. In other words, if we stopped all CO2 emission tomorrow, how long would it take the atmosphere to return to pre-industrial levels?</p>
<p>That number is closer to a few hundred years.</p></div>		</li>
