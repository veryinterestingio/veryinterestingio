Is the new one stretchable at first, or does it have expansion joints?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The soft new exoskeleton gets &quot;pumped up&quot; by the animal's body fluids before it hardens. A butterfly emerging from it's chrysalis and pumping its wings out is a really visually obvious example of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new one is actually bunched up and wrinkled a little bit underneath the former cuticle, because it's bigger than the old one - so the animal can grow. After emerging from the former exoskeleton, the larger new one has to be stretched and smoothed out, as well as cured into a harder form.</p></div>		</li>
