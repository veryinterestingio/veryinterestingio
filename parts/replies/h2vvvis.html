			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of cold denaturing proteins. Cold reduces enzyme activity because there's less energy, but when you return the enzyme solution to an optimum temperature, the enzyme solution will work at its normal rate.</p>
<p>Heat denatures enzymes because the energy causes hydrogen and ionic bonds to break. What would be the mechanism for cold to denature proteins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not denature, but still likely forced into a conformation that fails to function.  I'm actually curious about how these effects might play out in a longer term outside of the expansion of freezing.</p>
<p>Our general thinking about proteins is that they're fairly solid objects - but this is a bias in how we study proteins.  Many absolutely critical proteins are unstructured or have unstructured regions that are critical to fundamental biological processes.  We study (and understand) proteins that are 'frozen' (CryoEM, Crystallography), so we tend to think that freezing them shouldn't harm them.  But for many proteins, freezing it into a specific conformation will make it unable to undergo any conformational changes, thus unable to achieve any work or function.  I could imagine that having some subset of proteins operational and pushing through processes while another set are locked in time and unable to keep up might cause all sorts of long-term failures to the cell.  But that's mostly just a curious thought experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean while this is correct I think it would is just as simple as saying when water freezes it expands and forms ice crystals causing cells to rupture and die, resulting in the pain/injury and followed by a prompt inflammation response to clear up the cellular debris. It's possible to freeze down cells etc provided they are stored in a hypertonic solution e.g 10% DMSO and recover fine without mass disruption to the proteins you are describing here, so while you are correct I would be confident in saying that the damage is fully due to cell death caused by water crystals and expansion due to the rapid freeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice crystals definitely play a role. But freezing cells and regrowing from a frozen cell stock is not perfect. Many cells do not make it and those that do usually require an incubation period to heal after thawing. With how important temperature is in mediating biomolecular interactions, I so not think it's safe to assume the only mechanism of action during freezing is membrane distortion via expansion. </p>
<p>Not to mention all the changes in ionic strength and intracellular concentrations as water freezes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh of course it's not perfect, but if done correctly with DMSO gently working with cells and slowly freezing with isopropanol and good technique when recovering the cells I would say you'll only lose a small number of cells. Of course there will be biomolecular interactions affected but the question was freezer Burns. the burning sensation will be the death of cells due to sudden decrease of temperature resulting in the bursting of the cells followed by the subsequent inflammatory response to the cell death which would be similar to that of a heat burn. Of course temperature effects biochemical interactions which will effect cells and change them morphologically etc but it would not be so detrimental to result in a freezer burn which was the op's question. I mean for example bacteria with cell walls are more hardy to lower temperatures due to the cell wall helping prevent the cells bursting and of course other factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume the hypertonic solution is to draw water out of the cell, but are they still viable after thawing? Wouldnâ€™t there still be enough water content to form ice crystals even when you turn the poor cell into a raisin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah draws the water out, causing the membrane to shrivel like a raisin (love the analogy), see the ice crystals are a problem, though when water freezes it also expands which is the major problem for causing cell lysis it's almost like a balloon, for example I had a glass bottle in the freeze filled with water to let it cool quickly I was meant to bring it out before it froze I forgot came back to freezer next day the water froze expanded and shattered my glass bottle, now the volume of water original did not stress the bottle but cause water expands when frozen it took up a greater area inside my bottle and caused it to shatter. For the sharpness imagine a balloon if you poke it when it's full it'll pop easier if it's less full you really need to apply some force to cause a hole.</p></div>		</li>
