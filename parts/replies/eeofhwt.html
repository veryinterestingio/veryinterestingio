			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve often thought about this, but I don’t think the cycle would work well for a 24 hour day, meaning the work week becomes all sorts of messed up. I would probably need to be awake for 20 hours after 7-8 hours sleep before I hit the stage where I could just lay down and instantly sleep, but then I’d need to be up just a few hours later. That means that the next night, I’d be more tired earlier. It’s annoying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe your genetics are coded for you to physically exert yourself more than you actually are? Maybe your body don’t need 7-8 hours of sleep, but only 6 at your current level of exertion? I’m, again, just speculating of course. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah nah that’s a good perspective actually! Maybe I should be doing more, I can get on board with that! Although I feel like my last few hours of the day aren’t that productive. Little sluggish. That would probably mean that’s when I should be going to sleep, but I don’t know if that quote aligns with the idea of just drifting off to sleep naturally. </p></div>		</li>
