			<div class="markdown"><p>The IC50 (concentration at which there is half maximum blocking of effects) for blocking GABA is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2175694/" target="_blank">0.36 mM(millimolars)</a>. This is about as much as 70 grams of Caffeine suspended in 1 liter of water.</p>
<p>While I can't find a 1:1 comparison, the binding affinity of Caffeine for the Adenosine (A2A) receptor is at 2.4Î¼M(nanomolars). Since a lower number is better, that makes the Adenosine binding of Caffeine <strong><em>150 times stronger than that to GABA</em></strong>.</p>
<p>So GABA-related effects will not be relevant until you overdose, when it can cause convulsions (like other GABA blockers).</p></div>		</li>
