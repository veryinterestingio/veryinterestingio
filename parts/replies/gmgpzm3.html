			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't what OP is talking about. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@24.9258291,12.5891446,3999m/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">here</a> is a view of some saharan sand dunes. Zoom out from here a <em>lot</em> and you'll start to notice some of the features OP means, all of which are geological features on which the dunes sit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wonderful! The key word I was missing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg_(landform)" target="_blank">erg or sand sea</a>. There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erg_(landform)#/media/File:Linear_Dunes,_Namib_Sand_Sea.jpg" target="_blank">fractal structure</a> to ergs which Google Earth didn't show in enough contrast when I zoomed in.</p></div>		</li>
