			<div class="markdown"><p>The moment of suddenly realizing you were on autopilot/dissociating after coming out of a stressful situation is so jarring. I felt so relieved the first time I learned there was a word for that feeling, just to know it's a common enough feeling to have a name. Before that I used to think of it as the Colorform feeling (like the classic toy  with reusable vinyl stickers and different backgrounds). Stuck to the scene but not really a part of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should really be mentioned in the manual for the human body. It's a useful function, but can freak people out. It's also a skill/talent, not everyone can dissociate equally well. So not everyone will understand what you're talking about. Mindfulness mediation aims to train the mind out of the habit (or at least get the ability under conscious control), but seriously? Being fully awake for every moment of another useless work meeting sounds more like torture than enlightenment. Spacing out can be a blessing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally when you're practicing mindfullness, you'd be noting/focusing on the positive sensations related to the work meeting (even if it's as simple as breathing, or the fact that you don't have to actually do anything), rather than spacing out and letting the mind continue to subconsciously deepen its negative thought patterns. It's also possible to choose to be mindful of the negative aspects of whatever you're doing, and it will make you constantly miserable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy cow. I hadn't thought of Colorforms in years. I had the Kiss set and the Star Trek (TOS) set. Do they still make those? (Apologies for the off topic comment, but this gave me an incredible sense of nostalgia.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might have fun looking into the &quot;default network&quot; of the brain (for information overload on it: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811106/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811106/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811106/</a></a> ) It's what gets active in those boring moments AND when trying to remember something. If you've ever tried to fall asleep and just couldn't shake the embarrassing memory of the silly thing you did in 3rd grade, that's default network at work too. It's a weird thing.</p></div>		</li>
