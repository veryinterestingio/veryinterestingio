			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing question! I was *just* talking about this literally at a meeting this morning with other faculty at UofT. We want to do this for Canada, who is in more or less a similar situation.</p>
<p>I think it boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Education, education, education! At all levels from kindergarden to continuous education and workforce development.</li>
<li>Funding science (both basic and applied)</li>
<li>Creating the appropriate innovation ecosystems, such as the boom in AI- and quantum-based startups in Toronto.</li>
<li>Having an open borders, open socially and inclusive society such as Canada. Immigrants with the right talents should be welcome.</li>
<li>But all is built from the bottom-up as well, if you are in a developing country, you can do your own by helping build the local ecosystem. Efforts such as RIIAA in Mexico (<a href="https://riiaa.org/" target="_blank"><a href="https://riiaa.org/" target="_blank">https://riiaa.org/</a></a>) are fantastic examples of great things to do. Clubes de Ciencia (<a href="https://www.clubesdeciencia.org/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.clubesdeciencia.org/" target="_blank">https://www.clubesdeciencia.org/</a></a>) is also a fantastic organization started by Adrian Jinich and Benjamin Sanchez amongst other great people.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I hope to see you again in this yearâ€™s RIIAA!</p>
<p>Also, I overheard last year in RIIAA that you were planning to launch an AI/ML/Data Science school in Mexico, how is that going?</p>
<p>Can you share some thoughts of a school model that can work in such a technological/social/economical environment such as Mexico that needs to educate a highly skilled workforce?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was not a school, we were discussing an institute. I think the  Mexicans picked up on it but I was too busy to contribute effectively.</p>
<p>With regard to your question see the bullet points in the previous question. They were intended to answer what you are asking again.</p></div>		</li>
