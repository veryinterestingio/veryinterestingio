			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Centeal Oregon. Lots of wildfires around here. I was pretty much thinking what you said, but I'm wondering if it has to do with light passing through particles differently, similar to a sunset, or if its because smoke is really more brown than grey so when placed as a filter over the sun we see it's &quot;true&quot; color?  When I have a camp fire the smoke appears to be gray or white,  very similar in color to clouds of water vapor.</p>
<p>Edited to word slightly better.</p></div>		</li>
