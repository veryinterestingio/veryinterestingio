			<div class="markdown"><p>If that lineage went extinct, then it (fossils) will likely remain the only method for gathering information.  They won't have a genetic trace distance enough to reconstruct a definite species.</p>
<p>In the instances of interbreeding so-called &quot;ghost lineages&quot; can be detected, but determining anything more is like trying to tell what someone looked like based on the fragrance of perfume or cologne they left in the room three days before you arrived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the concept of your suggestion but there are some real information theory and physics problems in recovering information from species with no remains. Time travel and simulation become the most plausible methods pretty quickly. One might be impossible and the other creates a library of babel scenario.</p></div>		</li>
