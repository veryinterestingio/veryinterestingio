His constant wearing of earplugs combined with very little time off and all those sweaty rooms resulted in a fungal infection. Man had white fluff coming out of his ears...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an unexplained reflux to whenever anyone/thing touches my ears. I haven't stuck a cotton swab there for over 10 years. I just get a bit of crusty stuff on the outside that I scratch off as a nervous tick. A GP did an ear exam once and told me I have the cleanest ears he's seen in a while.</p>
<p>I also have low self esteem, so it's a 50/50 that he was sarcastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was probably telling the truth. It turns out not using cotton swabs in your ears is the way to go.  The crusty stuff means your ears are efficient at self cleaning, as they should be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a facial nerve that’s quite close to the surface of the skin within the ear canal. When touched it can cause a cough or gag reflex- like any reflex, some people are more sensitive to it than others! If can be very off putting when getting ears cleaned or having impressions made. </p>
<p>Definitely don’t want to stick q-tips in there! Like other posters have said, it messes up your body’s natural disposal system by pushing the wax too far back in the ear canal and it won’t naturally slough out as your skin cells shed off and out of the ear canal.</p>
<p>Side note: it’s not likely your GP was being sarcastic. I do lots of ear exams, and I always expect to see ear wax- it’s natural and healthy for it to be present- so I’m surprised if someone’s ears are 100% devoid of wax AND they tell me they don’t clean their ears.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although if your ear overproduces earwax it can sometimes get pushed further back into the ear by that. One of the most common causes is irritation. Usually by sticking something in your ear.</p>
<p>Don't stick things in your ears folks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting thing about tinnitus is that it's actually more of a psychological phenomenon than physiological -- not to say there aren't physiological causes like certain drugs, eighth cranial nerve tumor (which is curable by removing the tumor) -- so it's REALLY difficult to ascertain the true origin of it. I did some tinnitus counseling when I worked in the clinic and the true &quot;cure&quot; is to teach your brain to ignore it, for which there are many various therapies that take this approach (<a href="https://www.hear-it.org/Tinnitus-Retraining-Therapy" target="_blank">Tinnitus Retraining Therapy</a> being one). For the most part, tinnitus seems to be a glitch in our auditory system that can arise for many reasons and is difficult to [put back in the bottle once it's out. Having Meniere's disease and congenital hearing loss myself, I deal with some crazy tinnitus on a daily basis, and what gets me through the day is the cognitive-behavioral approach that taught my subconscious not to freak about it.</p></div>		</li>
