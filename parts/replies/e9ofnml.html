<blockquote>
<p>So,  σ_H2 σ_Q2 ≥ (〈[Ĥ,ˆQ]〉/(2i))2
However because &quot;i ħ ∂Ψ/∂t = ĤΨ&quot;, it follows that &quot;d〈Q〉/dt = i ħ 〈[Ĥ,ˆQ]〉 + 〈∂ˆQ/∂t〉&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What intermediate steps/knowledge are required to understand that those first two imply the latter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid that just wiki link gave me 500 new questions.. I can't even match all of the variables/notation to what's mentioned in that wiki, let alone comprehend what it's actually doing. Do you know of a way to become able to decipher this? Even entry level QM books seem to go off the notation/jargon deep end really quickly</p>
<p>Wiki's like that get bonus points for statements like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Heisenberg picture, the derivation is trivial.</p>
<p>the Hamiltonian is simply</p>
<p>Although, at first glance, it might appear that the Ehrenfest theorem is saying that</p>
