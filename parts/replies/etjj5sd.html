<p>It already occurs in our atmosphere at <em>low</em> densities, specifically at heights above 100 km (the turbopause). Above this height, atmospheric turbulence (specifically eddy diffusion) is too weak to keep the atmospheric constituents well mixed, and molecular diffusion forces take over to separate out constituents by density in the heterosphere.</p></div>		</li>
