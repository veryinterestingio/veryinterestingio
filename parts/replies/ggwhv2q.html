			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on a paraphrased definition of a &quot;burn:&quot;</p>
<p>an injury characterized by a painful reddening and swelling of the skin (first-degree burn ), damage extending into the skin, usually with blistering (second-degree burn ), or destruction of the skin and flesh extending into the deeper tissue with loss of pain receptors (third-degree burn ).</p>
<p>That can be caused by fire, chemicals, freezing, electricity, radiation, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but it's a definition that doesn't answer the question.  The word burn is derived from Old English birnan, to be consumed by fire. The question essentially asked why the conventional word for skin being consumed by fire was also used to designate when skin was also damaged by other means. An argument by definition is not quite enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever been burned by chemicals or the cold? It FEELS like burning with fire. Sometimes linguistics follows our sensory perceptions. Onomotapeoias are an example of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because languages take shortcuts, nobody would use a different word because burn (by fire) is so much more common than the others and as the people you replied to said, its the same effect. Basically it works so why figure out something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because, as it was already said, the damage done to the skin is roughly the same no matter what caused it, so why make a new word for it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are now using these terms. Degrees are not used in a hospital setting anymore. The switch to more descriptive terms is to help identify the injuries that will require surgical intervention as far as I am aware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack on to this, there is also 4th, 5th, and 6th degree burns.</p>
<p>4th degree burns are down to the fat, 5th degree burns are done to the muscle, and 6th degree burns are down to the bone. </p>
<p>You don't hear about these degrees often because it's usually, &quot;his car caught on fire and he burned to death,&quot; and not, &quot;he suffered 6th degree burns over 100% of his body.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: It appears that the information I've shared may not be 100% accurate. I'm not a medical professional, so please don't take my word at face value. Some other people who actually have training and experience on the subject have commented with some useful information. I suggest looking into it to be more informed before accepting what I said to be true. </p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is completely untrue. A 3rd degree burn will absolutely affect fat and probably muscle. <em>Some</em> textbooks will mention &quot;4th-degree&quot; burns to distinguish further types of damage. 5th and 6th aren't a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping someone would post this.  I don't know why people are constantly trying to talk about some super secret extra bonus degrees of burn, but every time they get mentioned some know nothing know-it-all will claim something about degrees beyond fourth.</p>
<p>Fourth degree burns have been more widely added and accepted now, because with our medical treatment improving, there is differences in treatment between third and fourth degree that did not exist when the original 3 degrees were defined.  Medically it is useful to differentiate whether a burn has charred and killed skin to its full thickness but muscle is only lighty damaged, or whether the muscle too had suffered the same level of trauma.</p>
<p>So depending on when and where you got your training, third degree may have been the highest, but more and more the fourth degree has become an accepted medical term rather than just a vague idea.   I imagine as our ability to treat burns increases, we may some day classify them even further, but for now, as you said, its just the four.</p></div>		</li>
