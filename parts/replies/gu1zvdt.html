			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, herbs are exclusively leaves, with a very few exceptions (rosemary stems being one). </p>
<p>Spices are basically anything else used in cooking in supplementary amounts derived from plants. Roots, bark, stems (generally), berries (pepper is the dried berry), seeds, flowers, etc.</p>
<p>Some plants will produce multiple different spices and/or herbs. Coriander is the seed of the Cilantro plant, for instance, while the leaves of the marsh mallow plant can be used for gumbo flavoring and thickening while the roots and stems can be stewed down to make marshmallows. (Generally not any more, because artificial gelatin is so much easier, but once upon a time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stems of plants like parsley and cilantro are often used along with the leaves, so I might amend this to say that woodier stems which are often dried before being ground or grated would be classified as spices, while more flexible stems used along with the leaves are still considered herbs. So a stem can be either depending on the plant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  but most people (in the US, anyway) will refer to the leaves as “cilantro,” which is the Spanish name, because the plant is so heavily associated with Mexican cooking, while calling the seeds “coriander.”</p></div>		</li>
