			<div class="markdown"><p>The inertia of tradition, I'd wager. You're right, it would probably be &quot;easy&quot; to just space sockets out a little further, but consider that there's a ton of things on the market, a ton of knowledge and building codes and such that turn on the current way sockets are constructed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, very sensible. Rather than changing the design of sockets, the practical solution is to place more sockets in living spaces. I believe many regional codes in the US require outlets every 5 or 6 feet nowadays.</p>
<p>ETA: a lot of people corrected me in comments so I want to clarify here as there are too many comments to go through: the US NEC requires a receptacle every 12 feet in living areas (always within 6 feet, hence my mistake), and every 4 feet in kitchen. </p>
<p>Those of you saying it would be easier to change the design of a receptacle rather than requiring them in all new buildings have a point, but remember that with permitting processes already in place for new buildings, it’s already within the government’s purview to enhance receptacle frequency in buildings. Requiring a new receptacle design would be regulating a market in a new way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd call that &quot;standardisation&quot;, but basically I'm sure you're right.</p>
<p>The problem is that standardisation has quite a few advantages, such as those you've mentioned, and bucking the standard when one's established isn't often an obvious route to go, unless your product has clear advantages (or unless you have a degree of market dominance, obviously, but that's not the case here). There's likely nothing to stop a company manufacturing wider-spaced sockets, but they'd also need to manufacture other stuff, such as the pattern boxes to go with them. Unless the product took off in a big way, they would be niche products, in a market where there are lots of competitors producing at economies-of-scale prices, so they'd need to be either low-enough quality to be able to churn them out cheaply, or expensive compared to the standard ones. And you also have to ask just how big the problem actually is, and how big a demand there could actually be by consequence - and be cynical about overestimating while you're asking. So whilst I have no doubt that there's at least a potential business model there for someone to do it, and there's probably a company out there in China doing it right now, I doubt there's any great incentive there for it either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some do that. I've seen many transformer blocks that have the prongs in line with the main body of the block. You plug them in, and the block sticks out to the side, and doesn't block the adjacent socket. It's an easy, simple solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the thread, there's an image of the GFCI duplex outlet designed to mount horizontally. The sockets are side-by-side instead of on top-and-bottom. This works for the type of wall-wart that blocks the lower socket, but not so much for the wall-warts described in my first paragraph.</p>
<p>It's really annoying when you have a bunch of wall-warts to plug in that are designed to fix the problem, and a power strip that rotates the sockets in order to fix the problem, and the combination of the two keeps the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You only really need it if you have a power strip. But if you have a power strip, you're likely plugging in stationary equipment, for which this isnt an issue since their AC to DC conversion happens inside the box. As such, you only need this for the occasional device which has a 5V power supply, and those are becoming increasingly rare as everyone switches to various USB standards</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: To clarify, here in Australia 99% of outlets are designed horizontally, so if the bulky part of a plug was above or below the plug (instead of jutting out to the side), the problem would be solved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So frustrating! In America, it's the opposite. Outlets are usually placed vertically (whether on the wall or a power strip), and oversized plugs usually hang downwards. If only we could swap designs of one of the two so it's not vertical-vertical or horizontal-horizontal.</p>
<p>The only items to commonly use horizontal plugs I've seen are phone chargers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most places have the outlets on the walls, often behind furniture. If they are the way you say to be, then they could easily require double the depth from the wall to be usable. It is a lot easier to resolve it by rotating the prong placement on the outlets by 45°, making it a lot less likely for these plugs to collide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I'm not talking about making them thicker relative to the wall. The terminology is difficult because we're talking 3 dimensions...</p>
<p>When you're looking at an outlet, let's say the outlets to the left and right are East and West. Most of the troublesome chargers I've used have had their bulky bits on either the East or West of the prongs, but I am suggesting moving them to the North or South. If I understand you correctly, you thought I meant to stack the bulky bit vertically i.e. away from the wall, but hopefully now you understand that that's not what I meant.</p></div>		</li>
