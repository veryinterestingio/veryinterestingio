			<div class="markdown"><p>High HDL is actually protective. It's bad total cholesterol/HDL and triglycerides/HDL ratios which are indicative of metabolic syndrome and thus increased heart disease risk. Insulin resistance should be taken into account as well, as it is also a big precursor to heart disease.</p>
<p>High LDL without the context of these other markers is just a recipe for overprescription of statins.</p>
<p>In fact higher LDL later in life is protective against infections and dementia.</p>
<p>The next step in risk assessment after all these blood markers suggest a risk for heart disease is to get a CAC score. Only then do you know you should prescribe statins against the <em>acute</em> risks and should implement dietary and lifestyle interventions to try and lower the CAC score, so the acute risks subside and you can wane off the statins. But try fixing the recommendations when there are so many invested players in this game.</p>
<p>Science is shifting towards oxidized LDL and small dense LDL being complicit in atherosclerosis. Not your general LDL which you need for normal cell maintenance and energy distribution. It is no wonder a lot of people who are prescribed statins wind up going off the drug for muscle pains and fatigue problems. The pharmaceutical industry lobbies against CAC recommendations, in fear it is gonna break up the overprescription scam they've got going.</p></div>		</li>
