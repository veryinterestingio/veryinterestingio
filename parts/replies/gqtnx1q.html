			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like we have solids, liquids, and gases with atoms/molecules, we can have these different states with more exotic materials as well.  These states are called phases, and it goes way beyond just the normal 3 I listed above.  One way to think about this is just how all the particles arrange themselves - different configurations would be a different phase.</p>
<p>If we have a bunch of nuclear matter (protons, neutrons, quarks), what kind of states will it settle into?  There are a few different ones, and we call them nuclear pasta.  Apparently the geometry of the different phases look like different types of pasta...</p>
<p>So it’s basically like if you took a liquid and squeezed it, you get a solid.  So if you take a bunch of protons and neutrons and squeeze them, what happens?  Different configurations, just like there are a ton of different phases of ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In neutron stars we have a layer of iron crust on the surface. Tightly packed iron. Nearer the core it’s pure neutronium. It’s so tightly squeezed that the electrons have been forced into the protons to form neutrons, and every possible spot is full of neutrons. Before we get down to that point though there’s the nuclear pasta, rather than filling every single available position and just being one large solid mass of neutrons, they link together in clumps and shapes called nuclear pasta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a general phenomenon that you see across just about all length scales, and that is the formation of structure. Whenever you have an attractive force competing with a repulsive force, one of the possible results of the competition is for pieces of stuff to organize themselves in patterns (bands, layers, droplets, or similar objects) with a characteristic length scale. See <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~andelman/reprints/059_Science_1995_267_476.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for a classic reference.</p>
<p>Nuclear pasta is the result of the competition between the repulsive electromagnetic force, and the attractive nuclear force. Between the outer crust of a neutron star and whatever happens in its core, there should be a region where nuclear matter organizes itself into patterns just like so many other physical systems do. For comical reasons these patterns are named after pasta: when conditions are such that you get droplets of nuclear matter in the void, you get the &quot;gnocchi&quot; phase. As you compress it further, droplets become larger and longer, like strands (spaghetti), then merge into layers (lasagna), strand-shaped holes in a mass of nuclear matter (antispaghetti), and more-or-less-spherical holes in a mass of nuclear matter (anti-gnocchi). Beyond there it's solid nuclear matter all the way down.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a much better analogy than the crystal is phase separation. As a polymers gal, the first thing i thought of when I read the 'nuclear pasta' paper was that all of the shapes are incredibly similar to the morphologies of immiscible polymer blends. What's cool about this is that those shapes naturally arise from thermodynamics and kinetics, and so if you think about it, there is no reason why the spaghetti shape would ever NOT form, as long as protons and neutrons follow thermodynamic rules.</p></div>		</li>
