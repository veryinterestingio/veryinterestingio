			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this how a dog or cat's hearing compares to a human's as well? I definitely feel like my cat hears much better than I do. We can rattle her laser toy in the living room and she'll hear that quiet little sound over the surround sound tv (turned fairly loud, dad has bad tinnitus) from anywhere in the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats and bats have larger cones bouncing sound Into their ears.  It's kind of like when you cup your ear when trying to hear something quiet or far away. </p>
<p>Which definitely helps you hear fainter things from further away.  Their ears simply collect more sound. But the actual ear drum itself isn't producing louder volume proportional to the same about of sound pressure.  So if you made a construction paper cat ear and attached it to your own ear.  You would be hearing things at the same volume as your cat.  </p>
<p>Once again.  Clinking metal makes a lot more sound than you hear.  Not because of it being quiet.  But because of its being high frequency.<br />
You cat doesn't come running because she hears the same rattle you are hearing.  She comes running because she hears the high frequency sounds it makes that you don't hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may ask: why do we have such a complex shape to our ears if a simple cone is better ? And what part is mostly responsible for hearing more frequencies : the brain, the eardrum or the ear shape ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this point. Cats ears are basically on a swivel too. They can rotate them almost 180 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the concept of the larger cones of the ears to collect more sound be roughly equivalent to the size of a mirror in a telescope collecting more light? The larger the mirror, the more light collected, the better the image quality and the more you can see...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my assumtion was right: it does not hurt the dog to listen to loud music in the car.</p>
<p>Im obviosly not talking about murdering my own eardrums level of volume. But a decent, enjoyable volume</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have tried to look at our dogs throughout the years, while playing loud music. Again, not uncomfortably loud.</p>
<p>And our dogs have always layed relaxed in the backseat. Chilling. No sign of them being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>EDIT: i always heard people say &quot;dont play loud music with dogs in the car&quot;, and i got curious, tested a little. Paying attention to the dogs of course.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Does it? CD-quality audio is sampled at 44 kHz, which means it can only reproduce sounds up to 22 kHz, which is about the limit of human hearing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, entirely. I don't know why this is the top answer in this thread, this is just factually incorrect. Animals DO have more sensitivity to higher frequencies (human hearing tops out at around 20,000 Hz, whereas dogs can go up to 40,000), but they also have significantly more sensitive hearing in respect to decibel levels, with some animal biologists saying that dogs can hear sounds as low as -20 decibels, i.e. sounds 100 times softer than a human can detect, within frequency ranges that a human <strong>could</strong> detect if the sound was simply louder. Reasons for this include greater concentration or size of hair cells in the ear, more sensitive membrane tissue in the eardrum, shorter ear canals, and differently developed temporal lobes in the brain, among other reasons. That someone gave a reward to this answer is beyond stupid, given that it's just not accurate.</p></div>		</li>
