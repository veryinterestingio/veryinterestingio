<p>It is compared to most of Canada that's at the same latitude. Brussels and Winnipeg are at about the same latitude (Brussels slightly more northerly), but Brussels is about <em>17.4°C</em> warmer in January, as measured by the average daily high. If you measure by average daily <em>low</em>, the difference goes up to <em>22.8°C</em>.</p>
<p>That dwarfs the difference between Brussels and actual southern Europe locations. Brussels vs Rome difference is 6.5°C by daily highs and just <em>0.7°C</em> by daily lows. Brussels is <em>way</em> more like Rome in terms of temperature than it is to Canada.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: Looking again, that difference between Brussels and Winnipig is <em>also</em> bigger between the difference between summer and winter in Brussels, just to put that into context. That difference is just 17.4°C by highs and 12.9°C by lows.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree that OP exaggerated a but you realize that it barely snows at all in the winter in Southern Belgium (or let's say in Paris which is at more or less the same latitude), while Montréal or Toronto which are much further South get tons of snow right?</p></div>		</li>
