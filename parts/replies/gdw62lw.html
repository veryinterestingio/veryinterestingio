			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost anything is <em>possible</em> given enough time and money, but gas-peaker power is already uneconomical; what would be the purpose of going to hydrogen at perhaps 10x the cost?</p>
<p>Hydrogen has some potential as an alternative &quot;fuel&quot; for flight and long-haul transport, to supplant or replace diesel- and similar fossil fuel, but so far, generation isn't the least bit scalable.   </p>
<p>How would you make enough for a power plant, and again, why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The why is energy storage. When renewables over produce, use electrolysis to produce hydrogen from water. When demand exceeds renewables, bring it back with hydrogen. Obviously no economic assessment here, but the logic is sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can produce hydrogen during the day with solar and burn it at night. However there must be a major issue with this because no one has successfully done it at large scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen is a viable fuel for travel because it contains a great deal of energy at low volume and mass.</p>
<p>In fixed-location systems, you don't care about size or weight. You focus on the more important aspects such as efficiency, power, and system cost. Hydrogen's efficiency is so far off that it's laughable.</p>
<p>Eventually the existing plants will decay past their viable repair cost and hopefully be replaced with systems that don't contribute to climate change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because hydrogen is no where near as cost effective.  You lose too much energy during conversions, and you need to use an expensive platinum catalyst.  Too much extra cost when natural gas is extremely cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Issue isn't capacity it's storage. If you can hit 100% you don't really need more generators you need something to ensure you have power when the green energy isn't working. Oil is super good for that cause we have a fuck ton of it and can burn it whenever</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outside of Fairbanks, AK is a place called Chena Hot springs. For years, they ran a diesel generator which was incredibly expensive. I think it was about 15 years ago, they tried something new. The water temperature there is about 150f, which isn't high enough to produce steam, but it is high enough to make r134 refrigerant boil. They have a heat exchanger that runs hot spring water over the refrigerant, mailing it boil. The pressure turns a generator. The spent gas is then condensed with cold-ass surface water. They went from burning over a million dollars in diesel a year to seelling their extra, completely environmentally friendly electricity to the airforce base.</p>
<p>That's pretty awesome.</p></div>		</li>
