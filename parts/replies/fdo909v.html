			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that simple. In the short-term, no. Opioid receptors are first &quot;internalised&quot; (the cell draws them inside). This protects from over-stimulation of the receptor altering the system too far at any one time, after which they will be returned to the surface. When this occurs chronically and repeatedly, the cell will start to adapt by shifting some of these receptors off to be &quot;lysed&quot; (destroyed). Lysing of receptors (of all proteins, in fact) is occurring all the time, as the cell regularly replaces parts (in a similar way to how your body is endlessly repairing itself).</p>
<p>So the cell is also manufacturing new opioid receptors. This manufacturing will also be decreased if the stimulation is <strong>chronic</strong>, requiring a greater proportion of the pool of remaining receptors to be excited to stimulate the response (and of course, having less receptors available, the internalisation also stops the response faster as less receptors need to be internalised to block it).</p>
<p>Likewise, the body's natural production of endorphins (your endogenous opioids) will decline to also prevent over-stimulation of the receptors.</p>
<p><strong>SO...</strong> If opioid use is short term (where receptors are being internalised, but not downregulated), it could be reversed within hours. If a small amount of downregulation occurs, the system will sense overstimulation is no longer occurring, and upregulate to counter balance, so days (to weeks) to reverse. The exact amounts are going to be so dependent on the length of time and how repeated the dosing, along with your own physiology, that its impossible to be precise. There may be mild effects on mood and dulled sensory perception (or over-sensation of pain) during that time.</p>
<p>Now, opioid receptors are a particularly weird one in terms of function, because it is predominately an &quot;inhibitory&quot; mechanism - it prevents other neurotransmitters from being released or exciting their target neurons - on top of some activating of its own sensory activity on other neurons. So the effect of any one molecule of an opioid will have a totally different outcome depending where the opioid receptor is that its acting on.</p>
<p><strong>SO..</strong>. (I'm really building up to this, aren't I) ....If you reach extensive downregulation (through chronic, repeated dosing for a long period), you get far greater downregulation in both the sensory aspects, as well as its inhibitory aspects. If you stop taking the opioid, the system goes haywire, as there is no opioid hitting what few receptors are left - so it stops activating the sensory and mood-altering neurons the opioid was activating, and it stops down-regulating the release of other neurotransmitters (so increases the amount of other neurotransmitters) which also affect mood, but leads to other symptoms like &quot;the shakes&quot;, associated with withdrawal. It will take weeks for the body to regulate these systems to anything approaching your basal state. And swings in mood, perception and body control will occur throughout this period, as the bodies regulatory mechanisms adapt, over-correct, and re-adapt.</p>
<p>There is argument that afterwards, the system remains in a &quot;primed&quot; state, and if an opioid is begun again, will downregulate etc quicker (ie relapse with drug taking) but it is incredibly hard to differentiate the physiology from the psychology in this situation, so I'll leave that to addiction research specialists.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Whether the person will be &quot;less stimulated&quot; when they're not high will depend on where they are in that downregulation process (receptors are internalising vs downregulating vs neurotransmitter control is altered).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for the extensive answer :-)<br />
EDIT: a friend of mine is smoking weed daily for years. Last year he was 6 month sober and then when he began to smoke again he said after the second day it was basically back to normal so like he just casually smokes an amount i would probably die from lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends a bit on the xenobiotic, but a surprisingly large amount of those are cut down by an enzyme (specifically, cytochrome P450 2D6) which varies considerably between individuals, efficiency and amount being considered. This would likely be the main factor differentiating comedown effects and duration. I am under the impression that most recreational drugs have an average comedown period of about two weeks or so, and half-life considered, pareto principle applies very much here, so most of the cooldown, endochemically, is usually dealt within the first few days. This is a gross generalisation, though, and should absolutely NOT be taken as canon. There's a lot of variation in half-life between substances, from few hours with 4-AcO-DMT to tranquillisers ramping up to 100hrs - and these are to my knowledge factored by the amount and efficacy of aforementioned cytochrome.  </p>
<p>That's why you get lethal overdoses from the first go in one hand, and Keith Richards sniffing Bolivia dry on the other.   </p>
<p>As for the levels of stimulation, however, that's far too subjective to be conclusively answered with my limited understanding, and has a lot of other factors affecting as well, ranging from social to economical and everything in between, including physical activity, sex life and overall motivation. While objectively, it's pretty clear that doing a line of speed makes short(er) work of your leg day elevation, how noticeable this is varies individually to an extent impossible to reasonably measure here.   </p>
<p>As an anecdote, I can offer this: Personally, I can do few years of amphetamines and walk out of it without noticing any ill effects at all. This is not to say there aren't any, might be that I was a bit more drowsy, a little less inclined or disinterested in sex for a limited time, but not on a scale that would've interfered with any of my normal activities noticeably. And I know people who are terrified of that same stuff because the comedown lasts for days and shakes them up something fierce. One even cut his wrists.   </p>
<p>Incidentally, for the exact same reason, I avoid alcohol. So when I said &quot;considerable variation&quot;, I really meant it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I was led to believe that it was the opposite, and that opioid tolerance was a result of the brain creating more receptors, thus taking more drug to create the same response level.  But after reading your comment and reading some, it seems I have been corrected.  I don't know where I got that from but thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Each receptor when activated can contribute a tiny bit to the neuron reaching its firing threshold and stimulating an action potential. More receptors means more chances to reach that threshold. By reducing the numbers of receptors on the cell surface, the neuron makes reaching the threshold for firing an action potential harder. a larger percent of the available receptors have to be active at the same time, and then have to be active longer to trigger the response.</p></div>		</li>
