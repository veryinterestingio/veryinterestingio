			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a different case than the clonally transmissible cancer seen in Tasmanian devils. HPV is a virus, that happens to cause cancer (Onco-virus). But the vector of infection is still a virus.</p>
<p>In the case of clonally transmissible cancer, the vector of infection is the tumor itself. Unlike HPV, the cancerous cells directly jump from one host to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionarily, lizards and humans are pretty much equally complex. The reason the lizards are showing evolutionary changes after such a short time is because they have short intervals between generations. Humans would show similarly show changes after that many generations, but for us 50-60 generations is 1000+ years.</p></div>		</li>
