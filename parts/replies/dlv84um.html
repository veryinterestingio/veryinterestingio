			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded. One evening, I had a random, sharp pain in my side a few inches below my armpit. I thought &quot;oh I'll sleep it off.&quot; </p>
<p>I woke up with the pain being more severe, and by the time I got to the hospital more than 24 hours later, my lung was totally collapsed. ? </p>
<p>Get persistent sharp pain checked out!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They said it was because I'm &quot;tall and skinny&quot; and I was like ???? I'm thin sure but only 5'6&quot; and they were like &quot;...tall and and skinny enough.&quot; It was a &quot;spontaneous&quot; pneumothorax which means they really don't know why they happen besides that there was a bleb and it ruptured. </p>
<p>Thankfully a CT scan revealed no more blebs! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit luck, I guess? It was a &quot;spontaneous pneumothorax&quot; which means they don't have a good explanation besides I was &quot;tall and skinny enough&quot; (I'm only 5'6&quot; so ...OKAY). I had a bleb that ruptured and that did it. </p>
<p>Usually pneumothoraxes are more trauma-related, like gun shot or knife fight. The nurses asked if I had fallen off a horse or down some stairs and I was like ???? No, I was watching tv and felt it like I said ten times already. Since it was a children's hospital I think they wanted to be certain it wasn't abuse-related and that's why they asked about a ton of strange scenarios. </p>
<p>My only guess was that when I tried picking up my ~40lb dog earlier in the day and he wiggled against me might have ruptured the bleb, but I didn't tell anyone until years later because I didn't want my parents to be mad at my dog since it was my fault anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have a chronic hiccuping issue and it is actually because my ribs are fucked up (I had no idea, but a bunch of my ribs on my right side are displaced) which has been irritating my sympathetic system and phrenic nerve and causes me to hiccup once every few hours as well as having digestive problems (this nerve is also responsible for your G.I tract) and increasing my anxiety symptoms (my body is being irritated into a fight or flight response constantly). I have been treated by one of my osteopath professors for a few months now (just once a month) and have been having less frequent hiccups and my digestive problems are clearing and my anxiety problems have reduced significantly.  I never would have known or had this addressed  if I hadn't decided to go to school for Osteopathy. </p></div>		</li>
