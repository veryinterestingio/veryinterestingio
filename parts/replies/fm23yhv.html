			<div class="markdown"><p>Vocabulary in general works like this, I think.</p>
<p>If you see a word you've learned before, you'll probably remember what it means. Especially for somewhat ordinary words.</p>
<p>But it's much more common to forget a particular word when you have a meaning in mind. Even simple words sometimes.</p>
<p>So when you're trying to speak a second language that you're not fluent in, you're always in that mode of trying to find the right word for something. It's harder.</p>
<p>But when you hear the words in that language, you're more likely to remember their meanings, and you have context to guide you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not well, but basic needs yes. For example, i live in Czechia nearby Poland. If i go there to shop and say what i need in Czech, they will understand me and i will understand them speaking Polish.</p>
<p>Of course it doesn't work all the time, sometimes you need to choose different words.</p>
<p>My co-worker was polish and we could communicate easily as most of <em>terminus technicus</em> are the same, just with different inflection.</p>
<p>There is even new language called Interslavic language. It is constructed so people speaking any slavic language (maybe except Bulgarian) can understand it, and they really do.</p></div>		</li>
