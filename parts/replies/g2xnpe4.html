			<div class="markdown"><p>Other than better materials/manufacturing, one of the big ones is heat mitigation. Heat is one of the biggest killers of lithium ion batteries.</p>
<p>One only needs to look at the Nissan Leaf as a perfect example. The Nissan Leaf was originally designed without a battery cooling system (IIRC they now have passive cooling), and people that live in hot climates saw extremely quick capacity degradation. It also says in the user manual to not use DC fast charging often and to not plug it up just after driving it hard/fast. Consequently many batteries see a 20+% degradation in less than 100k miles.</p>
<p>Conversely, cars like the Chevy Volt and Tesla Model S (and pretty much every other EV on the market) use a liquid cooling loop through the battery, and have many examples of cars going 300k+ miles with little to zero degradation. By little to zero I mean Teslas see slight degradation because they don't have a buffer-meaning all of the battery is usable. So if the car comes with a 60 kWh battery you get to use all 60 kWh. Chevy on the other hand builds their cars with a slight buffer. The Volt for example originally came with a 13 kWh battery, but only about 10.5 was available for use. So some of that 13 kWh may have degraded in 300k miles, but as long as it's less than 2.5 kWh (~20%) the user will still see that it's getting 100% of its rated range.</p>
<p>Tesla is having a &quot;battery day&quot; event here in a few weeks where they're supposed to unveil some new battery tech. Primary rumor going around is that it's going to be the &quot;million mile&quot; battery. Which they aren't going to be able to do with cooling alone (they already have a very effective thermal management system), so it'll have to be either new chemistry, new manufacturing technique, or both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of unanswered questions in this area. It's also where my understanding starts to get hazy. As for now, I think the best advice would be to avoid charge/discharge cycles in extreme conditions. Take the case off if your phone gets hot, don't charge it in the hot sun, avoid running the battery very low before charging, avoid using lots of simultaneous heavy apps that drain the battery quickly, etc. Charge/discharge slowly when you can and try and keep everything good and cool.</p></div>		</li>
