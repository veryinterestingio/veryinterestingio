			<div class="markdown"><p>The pre-revolutionary colonies had a handful of experiments with fiat currency, all of which ended up with sharp inflation. This is the reason why the founding fathers (who were of the monied, pre-revolutionary colonies) were so strongly opposed to it.</p>
<p>That said, &quot;doing so would facilitate more equal distribution of wealth down into the working classes&quot; is false, except in the sense that inflation tends to impoverish everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good bet is that when paper is substituted in for a precious metal, the currency spends more easily, which benefits the purchasing class more than the merchant class.  A merchant wants to know he is getting a one ounce gold coin vs a note representing the value of a one ounce gold coin, because it is much harder to forge and has a steadier overall presence. Stable prices and values of currency favor those that possess the bulk of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe, but this was waaay before the days of fiat currency, so those notes should have been exchangeable for gold anyways.... right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in the time in question, it would have been far simpler to create a forged note than fake a coin made of precious metal.</p>
<p>And depreciated value in currency is not specific to fiat currency. In the US, a silver standard was advocated to replace the gold standard by those interested in granting increased spending power to lower/middle class people. Still a precious metal as the basis for valuation, but a less valuable metal.</p></div>		</li>
