			<div class="markdown"><p>And we might think of it as different Rule Memes in the pool being subjected to an Evolution where the most logical and fun rules survive. For instance, the mutation &quot;Touching the opponents king with your left hand immediately wins the game&quot; would die off instantly, if anyone was drunk enough to even try it. Whereas other rule changes make so much immediate sense that they can become viral, reproducing from chess player to chess player.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking to myself the other day about this. The idea of castling seems so absurd. Like I don't know how somebody could have thought of it, and made it legally widespread. Somebody said to another person before a chess game, &quot;let's add this move, where the king and rook can switch places.&quot; And somehow it became widespread. It still boggles my mind. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought we all learned this growing up and playing board games with friends? If someone proposed a special &quot;house&quot; rule, people generally accepted it if it made sense, or accepted it if the majority did. No need for any governing body LMFAO lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this makes me wonder if in the early days of chess, it was like fantasy football is now where literally every single fucking league has its own set of rules and they tremendously impact strategy and the first conversation in any new player entering the game is a long explanation of all the wack ass variations they play here...  </p>
<p>maybe one day it will distill into one set of rules that are adopted universally as 'this makes sense'  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Think of Monopoly. A lot of people play it unofficial rules (like putting money in a pile for Free Parking) and not playing with the official rules (auctioning off property if the person landing on a square doesn’t purchase it). </p>
<p>I’ve never played using the official rules, but it should be a quick game lasting less than an hour, rather than a slow paced game lasting hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With Monopoly there's also the &quot;missing the point&quot; so to speak which triggers the &quot;house rules&quot;. It's a game about monopolies, and isn't <em>supposed</em> to be fun for the players not in the lead.  Ut in trying to make it &quot;more fun&quot;, the extra cash flow in fact does the opposite by needlessly prolonging the game and turning it from &quot;not fun because I'm losing, but it'll be over next round&quot; into &quot;not fun because I'm losing and the game will take 2 hours&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who is absolutely insistent auctioning off properties is not an official rule. He's basing this mostly off the fact that he played a version of monopoly on some console (PS1, I think) and it didn't have auctioning. Neither one of us actually owns a physical Monopoly game to check, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit -  Relevant section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever you land on an unowned property you may buy that property from the Bank at its printed price. You receive the Title Deed card showing ownership; place it face up in front of you. <strong>If you do not wish to buy the property, the Banker sells it at auction to the highest bidder.</strong> The buyer pays the Bank the amount of the bid in cash and receives the Title Deed card for that property. Any player, including the one who declined the option to buy it at the printed price, may bid. Bidding may start at any price </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have such a bullshit Uno story. I was a teacher and playing Uno with a group of high school students. I yelled “Uno” when I had one card left: I fucking won the game. And two of the students I’m playing with yell “Uno Out!!” I’m like “what?” And they tell me I didn’t yell “Uno out!” When I put my last card down so I didn’t win and now I have to draw three cards. </p>
<p>Me, being super competitive and not having any of that bullshit looked up the official rules and there’s no mention of this “Uno out!” absurdity. I thought the kids were punking me so I asked around the school and all of the students played the game this way. It’s complete and total bullshit and I demand some fucking justice. </p></div>		</li>
