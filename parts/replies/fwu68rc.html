			<div class="markdown"><p>Classical musicians will practice something for months, play it a handful of times, and may not play that same piece again for years, if ever. They might be working on several projects at once with the same mindset (learning for now, and to forget later)—accompanying another instrument or voice, chamber music, large orchestra, small orchestra, even working in conjunction with theater, ballet, etc. all at once, so it’s not like they’re even working on one thing at a time. Music doesn’t pay super well, so they tend to take on what they can juggle. </p>
<p>Rock bands—again, they play the same stuff over and over. Even cover bands have their sets planned out and may add or take away occasionally, but won’t make big changes over the course of years. </p>
<p>Completely agree and think you really hit the nail on the head; just throwing out some additional context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad is a professional classical musician and typically has this as his workload: two symphony orchestras, a quartet, weddings and other gigs, private lessons, acting as a judge for student pieces and competitions both group and individual, and an associate professorship.</p>
<p>He typically gets a piece of music, practices the harder more technical pieces at home for maybe 2-3 weeks, and the typical concert rhythm is rehearsal, rehearsal, performance then new music and rehearsal, rehearsal, performance until the concert season is over. He’s been doing this for decades and still relies on the sheet music for the exact reasons mentioned I so many of these posts: time, memory, diversity, complexity, workload, and constant change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't really the case with professional orchestras. They get their music a few a weeks beforehand, get a couple rehearsals together, then perform. Rinse and repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the librarian will usual drop the music for a concert into their mail boxes 2 week before a show.</p>
<p>they arent practicing for months.</p>
<p>you can tell who the talented ones are by how long a book is in their mailbox before they pick it up.</p>
<p>pops shows the number of full mail boxes the day before the show is a laugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has played in an orchestra and marching band, I can say that you can learn most music by heart from rock and almost any genre. Fuck trying to learn classical music by heart. It's written in utter complexity and there are times when you change keys and other minute details that you absolutely have to have the music in front of you to play it. I've played everything from heard it through the grapevine on through overture of 1812. In classic music there's also parts in every single piece that your instrument has a break and you have to count measures to pick up. Combine that with most of the time getting a piece a week or two from the time you play it in a professional setting and you absolutely cannot learn it unless you dedicated most of your free time to learning it by heart. It just isn't worth it when you can have the sheet music in front of you.</p></div>		</li>
