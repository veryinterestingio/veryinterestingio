<p>When a compound kills 99% of a given organism's colonies, it is said to be bactericidal/virucidal.  That is, whatever remains is not likely to thrive in the given environment.  Eventually those colonies wane for one reason or another, be it further adaptation of the immune system or simply an inability to outcompete other organisms/structures for survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have only heard the term bacteriostatic used in relation to reducing the speed at which bacteria reproduce. For example, ribosome inhibitors such as aminoglycosides and macrolides, which stall protein synthesis, making it hard for the bacterium to manufacture critical proteins, including but not limited to cell wall materials. Without this growth, division is inhibited to some degree.</p>
<p>Cell wall agents (like penicillins and the like) instead block off the laying down of new cell wall material, but don’t interfere with the production of the proteins, so at the time of division (or sooner) the wall fails and the contents spill out. These are considered bacteriocidal.</p>
<p>There are others of course with different mechanisms. Quinolones for example, working intranuclearly to inhibit DNA activities are sorta both, and folic acid inhibitors like sufonamides which are bacteriostatic, are two examples.</p>
<p>This differentiation often leads to conversations about whether it is counterproductive to co-administer a bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal agent as the bacteriostatic agent delays the effect of the cell wall agent. It might be important to mix for bacteria that kick out toxins, or those that are so deadly or harmful that you’re looking for any advantage you can get. Necrotizing fasciitis comes to mind.</p>
<p>No idea about viruses, though…</p></div>		</li>
