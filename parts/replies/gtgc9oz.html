			<div class="markdown"><p>Best response which fits the sub</p>
<p>Edit: yall gotta chill, I know it doesn’t mention tension and all that, and it’s only partially correct. It’s a good answer because that’s the reason, as in, it’s short,  easy to read since it only partially answers the question and extremely easy to understand. Which truly fits the sub.</p>
<p>Because then, you’ll have to be explaining tension, so that people can “relate” and “see” and truly understand it is another task. You can’t just say tension and not explain what tension IS first for people. Which is a long answer, so I think by eliminating the word tension, it became the best response as it’s extremely easy to understand without applying much.</p>
<p>Not everyone is a physics student or remembers what tension is when it’s been like years since high school for most people here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s only half an answer. I’m sure a 5 year old would understand it but it doesn’t really answer the question. They should mention how the balloon rubber stretching is what’s pushing back on you blowing. With the same amount of air blown, the rubber needs to be stretched more when there’s no air in it.</p>
<p>The ELI10 version would be showing how as you add more volume to a sphere, the surface area doesn’t increase proportionally. At higher volumes, the same amount of air blown into the balloon won’t increase the surface area as much as when the balloon is deflated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, I myself am a physics student. But it’s unnecessarily descriptive, that’s why. This explanation, it partially answers it without making it descriptive and easier to read.  It’s a good TRADE.</p>
<p>You’re forgetting the fact that most people here are like 25-40 who don’t remember what it is, and a good chunk of them are bad at physics. That’s why</p>
<p>Thats why, you’ll have to explain tension first then this. Compared to that, most would prefer this one. And maybe skip that explanation too.</p>
<p>Edit: grammatical error</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although the more the rubber is stretched the harder it is to stretch it at about 1.5 times the original radius it gets easier to inflate.

<p>Unless  OP states otherwise, assume no knowledge beyond a typical secondary  education program. Avoid unexplained technical terms. Don't condescend;  &quot;like I'm five&quot; is a figure of speech meaning &quot;keep it clear and  simple.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They key is that, while the volume increase is the same, what makes blowing hard is stretching out the balloon material itself, and the surface area increases less and less per volume the larger the balloon gets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Think about the first breath you put into a balloon vs the last and how much it grows with the fist breath compared to the last. Its volume will increase by the same amount but its diameter won't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but in terms of volume it grows by the same amount each time. But your comment about the diameter is cool. Way above my head.</p></div>		</li>
