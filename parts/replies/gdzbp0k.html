			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone else said, you're thinking of drinking water here.</p>
<p>Dehydrated: cells shrivel up and you get a headache</p>
<p>Overhydrated: osmosis happens. water goes into cells because it's trying to create a balance between the concentrations of particles inside your cells vs. outside your cells. the water does not stop coming in. your cells fucking explode</p>
<p>It is very fortunate you are wrong, or else recreational swimming would get a whole lot more dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a healthy human body has a very good mechanism of disposing excess water. You have to drink a bazillion glass of water a day to cause problems like brain uncal herniation or increased intracranial pressure. Slightly overhydrated is always better than dehydration. Unless if you have kidney or heart problem</p></div>		</li>
