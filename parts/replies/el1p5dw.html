<p>The biological species concept idea that a species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and make fertile offspring.  We also know that some species can interbreed and make offspring that is not fertile like horses and donkeys making mules.</p>
<p>There are obviously species that can no longer interbreed and make offspring as well.</p>
<p>Between being the same species with fertile offspring and being different species that make mules, there is a lot of in between.  Organisms in closely related species can make fertile offspring.  The flow of genes is called introgression.</p>

<p>All the species of wolf (as opposed to fox like)like canids (dingos, coyotes, wolves, African dogs)can interbreed and make viable offspring.  </p>
<p>As an aside, as a microbiologist, the biological species concept is worthless as it only applies to eukaryotes that have sex.</p></div>		</li>
