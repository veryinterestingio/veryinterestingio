			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Primary polycythemia vera is a mutation (typically in a gene called JAK2) that causes the bone marrow to make red blood cells without requiring any input from the hormone erythropoietin. In fact, when I suspect this diagnosis, I'll test EPO and it will come back low, as the kidneys are like &quot;whoa whoa, stop, too much blood!&quot; And consequently try to cut back on EPO production to try to help, but in primary polycythemia vera, its ability to regulate the process of red blood cell production is lost.</p>
<p>The major complications of this are clotting due to the increased viscosity, and then as clotting factors are used up, many patients actually get bleeding complications too. Interestingly enough, our firstline treatment for this is literally therapeutic phlebotomy- I stick them with a needle and draw off some of the blood. Some of my patients will do this on a schedule (ie every couple of weeks) until our other medications begin to really work!</p></div>		</li>

<p>OMG. What do you do with the extra blood?  Is it usable for transfusion, or does the mutation disqualify it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We unfortunately dispose of it as biohazardous waste. The mutation quite frankly don't impact its ability to be usable blood - it still works exactly right in being able to transport oxygen! But there are quite strict criteria for blood donations, and the mutation does disqualify these patients from donation, so they won't accept it here in the US!  It's a shame because my patients are full of so much extra blood, I wish I could do something useful with it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First line would be a cytoreductive agent like hydroxyurea, which I typically start as soon as I confirm a diagnosis, but it will impact all the cells produced by bone marrow potentially (white blood cells for fighting infection, platelets for forming clots to prevent bleeding) so some patients don't tolerate it well. If you are JAK2 positive, there are targeted drugs towards this mutation, most notably ruxolitinib (also called jakafi) which I've had great success with! There are also less commonly used drugs, like interferon, or if you don't have a JAK2 mutation, there may be other targetable mutations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People with chronic lung issues have a low amount of oxygen in the blood, stimulating the blood marrow to produce blood cell excessively and increasing the blood viscosity due to the amount of cells. This is called polycythemia and may lead to a number of issues.</p></div>		</li>
