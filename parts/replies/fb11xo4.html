<p>concentration of sperm cells in the semen can decrease, while the same amount of semen roughly could be released several times a day, each time only releasing part of a reserve that has been there maturing for a while. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sperm matures in the epididymis, and a vasectomy cuts the vas deferens which is what links the epididymis to the path out.
A vasectomy will stop sperm from leaving the epididymis and what happens is after sperm are there for too long and become to old (and no longer functional) they are broken down to make room for new ones. Basically this cycle of new sperm cells being produced then broken down to make room repeats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the sperm is just absorbed into the body as per usual. Nothing biologically altering happens in a vasectomy. It's basically just telling your body &quot;sorry, the road is closed, come back later.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
