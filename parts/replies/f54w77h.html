			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget population growth which increased demand for real estate and the concentration of jobs in cities further increased demand in urban and suburban areas. Since space is finite and demand grew so too did prices. If you want a house in a rural area far away from many job you can still find plenty of inventory that is very cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^^^ this is why u/mogulman31a 's &quot;its the generation after WWII&quot; explanation also applies to other places besides the US. Economically the generation after a giant world war is going to have a ton of opportunity. The costs of war (ex: death, loss of businesses) were paid by their parents. Then, as the boomers age up and have kids, all those economic niches that were open for boomers have been filled by boomers, the boomers never had a huge deathtoll in a war like Europe did. It makes sense that population and housing demand would go up as wars and giant deathtolls go down</p></div>		</li>

In Europe and North America population growth has been driven by immigration as local fertility rates have dropped</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the Boomer generation owning property o0n a single income whilst millennials cannot is not an American thing.  It is the same in Australia, UK, Canada etc..  Their Boomer generation is about 10 - 15 years younger than the US because of what you mention but, they have still landed in the same situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so USA specific it only applies to USA.</p>
<p>I mean it even ignores why places like Germany and France have become so expensive land wise. (places destroyed by the war, which have other reasons for being expensive this answer doesn't cover). Where the older generation could also afford homes.</p>
<p>Yet it also ignores all the places where land is still cheap.</p>
<p>The answer is more complicated and dynamic that people might think, but it all boils down to supply and demand; of course there's more demand for land, but the world is finite, and there's more people; the supply is constant, the demand only grows. When demand is so high (more people) and supply so low (habitable land is finite), prices skyrocket with the population; housing bubbles happen, and this is a worldwide phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boomers are also living a lot longer. I would assume that also means that they are generally keeping their properties off the market of a longer period of time, which I would also assume means that the supply needs are mostly being met by new construction which also tends to move slow. Also, the 08' crash completely gutted the new hom construction industry. It has come back, but I'd wager that the spec house builder market is still playing catch up, and they're all probably still gun shy. Most people I know that we're in that industry in 08' went bankrupt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not true, once adjusted for infant mortality the expectancy hasnt changed much in a long time, even back in 1700s people regularly lived into their late 70s early 80s but the odds of making it out of childhood have gone up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is very America specific, because I dont know the details of other areas as well. But generally the cause is the same, the world developed at different rates. Those that developed earliest post WWII saw the highest highs in terms of quality of life. And as the rest of the world catches up those early industrializedcountries regress. At the end the world economy  really no different than America's unstable and ready to or already crumbling.</p></div>		</li>
