			<div class="markdown"><p>The shortest distance between two points is a line even in noneuclidean geometry. You just have to change what “lines” and “points” mean so they make sense in context. For example, in spherical geometry the equivalent statement is “the shortest path between two points along the surface of a sphere is part of a great circle”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd kinda disagree. You have to be careful with the terminology for this exact reason. <em>Local</em> length minimizing curves are geodesics, sure, but the catch is that a specific geodesic may not be the shortest distance between two points.</p>
<p>All a geodesic tells you is that if you were to move a bit towards your end point, look around for a second, and then move in what you <em>think</em> is the shortest path, and repeat you'd trace a geodesic. Nothing in that process guarantees length minimization. It just so happens that lines and great circles are, in fact, geodesic curves on their respective surfaces. but it's still important to know that there are 2 possible &quot;straight lines&quot; on the surface of a sphere since you could walk either forwards or backwards in a great circle and end up at the same point eventually.</p>
<p>This sort of description of geodesics as straight line equivalents ends up being a bit misleading once you get to much more complicated geometry as it is entirely possible to have many very similar geodesics leading to the same point, each with entirely different curves, but only a select few of them can possibly <em>globally</em> minimize the distance. It happens that there is only a single geodesic in euclidean space so it must be the length minimizing geodesic.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry, I know this is pedantic! But I think it's important that people know that the straight line geodesic in euclidean space is pretty uncommon, all things considered. There are very few embedded spaces where there is only one possible geodesic that happens to minimize distance.</p></div>		</li>
