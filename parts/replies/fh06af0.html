			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps.  I always thought it was on account of the fact that the air space might allow the bullet to change direction slightly, thereby changing the angle of impact on the second layer from perpendicular to some angle slightly less than 90 degrees, and that even a small deviation from perpendicular takes away a lot of force, forcing the bullet into a ricochet rather than a protrusion.  You might see a similar reduction in force between a head on car crash and one that has a slight angle of deflection.  But I'm just speculating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what EmirFassad was describing in the post you're replying to. The projectile loses energy while passing through the first plate, deflecting the trajectory and leading to an off-angle impact with the inner surface. This is a well understood property of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_armour" target="_blank">spaced armour</a> and is used in MBT designs today -- most notably the [Leopard 2's hollow cheek armor]( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuI6UttC5wU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuI6UttC5wU</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to ask a question connected to that with a knowledge of basic physics.
All the time I have been thinking about this matter in a way similar to how light works in certain mediums in regular situations.</p>
<p>So when you look through a drinking glass, what you see underneath is moved in a certain direction. Adding water or different medium will switch if even further, and adding another glass will move it even further.
Based on basic physics, if I replace water with another substance with different properties, light will flow differently.
So theoretically, using a medium that moves light in an opposite direction will have an opposite impact on it compared to regular air.
If we base bullet physics on similar rules, doesnt it pretty much explain it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is the mechanism for the spaced armour of the leopard 2A5 MBT the wedge shape at the front is just a thin steel sheet that deflects armour piercing rods so they hit the main turret armour broadside,</p>
<p>however the airgap between the first layer of armour and the main armour must be longer than the projectile because if it is too short the outer layer holds on to the projectile and will guide it into a head on hit,</p>
<p>this effect allows newer long rod penetraters to defeat the spaced armour at points where the gap is too small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern APFSDS long â€“ rod penetrator tank main gun projectiles are more like arrows than bullets, very long, extremely high sectional density, extremely high velocity. </p>
<p>Thin layers of external spaced armor are not likely to deflect them, or affect their penetrating performance much, if at all.</p>
<p>It is much more likely that a thin exterior panel is designed to defeat HESH or shaped charge warheads instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be part of it certainly.  The first layer is penetrated, but that has no direct effect on the second layer an inch away, so it's still intact when the bullet reaches it.  With a laminate, as soon as the bullet hits the first layer, those forces are going to be felt by the other two layers even before the bullet has reached them.  It was a very curious thing to show military personnel who couldn't believe that replacing the Kevlar layer with air made the panel <em>more</em> ballistic resistant.  They thought it was some kind of trick as did I at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Differing impedance causes some of the energy to reflect and a compliant gap allows it to be absorbed instead of transmitted.  Similarly, two thin sheets of drywall sandwiching silicone makes better sound damping than thicker drywall directly attached to framing.</p></div>		</li>
