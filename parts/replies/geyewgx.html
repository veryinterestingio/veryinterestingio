<p>While you never will need another hepatitis A or Measles vaccination.</p>

<p>There is a very specific, time limited exception to this: the current MMR vaccine schedule calls for two, initial one as a toddler then one after roughly age 5.  But this was not always he case: when the combined MMR vaccine was first introduced, the original schedule only called for a single shot.  So depending on your birth year, location, and a few other factors you may have only had one shot if you were born in the right time period (edit: may have been wrong on the exact time period).  You may need a second shot to achieve full immunity.  </p>
<p>You can check your records to see if you got two shots or you can test for it (though its not free unless you convince a doctor to mark it medically necessary, which would likely require a nearby outbreak).  There was a US outbreak near me, so I had myself tested even though it was super unlikely I was exposed.  My test revealed I did not need a second shot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This reminded me of the best article I've read on this about covid, which is titled <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/covid-19-immunity-is-the-pandemics-central-mystery/614956/" target="_blank">Immunology Is Where Intuition Goes to Die</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting that. It was highly informative and a good reminder that the majority of people have not been infected. Everyone needs to stay vigilant for the near future. I would rather fight the virus by washing hands, social distancing and mask wearing than leaving it to my immune system.</p></div>		</li>
