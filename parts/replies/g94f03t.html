			<div class="markdown"><p>I am kind of the opposite. I pretty much feel like I could sleep at any time of the day or night. I have the sleeping habits of a teenager when I don't have to be awake for work , for example. Like last night, I went to sleep around 2am and woke up around 230pm and its now 730pm and I am already looking forward to going to bed.</p>
<p>I think I may have a medical issue. Or I'm just super, super lazy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depression can also cause fatigue, but I think you'd realize if you were depressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine and alcohol both effect your sleep also. People who drink both or either regularly tend to have sleep issues.  </p>
<p>Caffeine definitely has that happen to me on days where I go overboard.. I have started trying to not have caffeine 8 hours before I go to bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely gonna vary from person to person, but if I'm asleep for 9 hours, I'm quite dehydrated at that point. I'll feel groggy until I get at least 32oz of water in me. </p>
<p>Even if that's not why I'm feeling sleepy, there's no downside from drinking water first thing in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One possibility is sleep apnea.  With sleep apnea, the longer you sleep, the longer you spend with reduced blood oxygen, the shittier you feel and the harder you are to wake up.  You may take a while to feel back to normal in the morning, too.  This was me, a short nap would feel great but a long sleep would leave me grumpy.  It took two very loud alarms to wake me up for work each morning.</p>
<p>Once I had my sleep apnea corrected with a CPAP machine, it fixed all that.  Naps still feel great, but an 8 hour sleep also feels great, my gentle little phone alarm wakes me up, and I'm usually up in minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any symptoms of sleep apnea and I've been like this my entire life, my father and a few on his side of the family are all night owls and have no problems waking up around this sort of time after... I assume it's just genetic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No idea..  If the other symptoms don't sound like you, then that's probably not it.  Maybe it'll help someone else reading the thread though!</p></div>		</li>
