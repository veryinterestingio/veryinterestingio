			<div class="markdown"><p>I am pretty sure if you took the 27 million tonnes of nutrients that come directly from the Sahara away, the rainforest would not survive. In fact, nutrients are in short supply in amazonian soils, thus the forest depends on the nutrients brought in by the wind to survive. NASA released an entire study on it: <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL063040" target="_blank"><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL063040" target="_blank">https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL063040</a></a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are misunderstanding what people mean when they say that nutrients are in short supply in Amazonian soils (or other rainforest soils, for that matter).</p>
<p>It is not that the rainforest happens to emerge in a nutrient poor region and needs an external inflow of nutrients in order to survive.</p>
<p>Rather,  because water and sunlight are so abundant, mineral nutrients become the limiting factor on how much life can grow. As a result, the rainforest grows until it hits that limit - which is when the nutrients in the soil are basically all absorbed and all meaningful nutrients are in the bodies of living plants. At this stage, new plants cannot grow until an existing plant dies and decomposes, releasing its nutrients back into the soil.</p>
<p>This dynamic would still hold true if the amount of nutrients were much higher, and it would also hold true if the amount were much lower. The thing that changes is how tall and dense the forest can grow before it hits that limit. </p>
<p>If the nutrients from the Sahara were not present (which is a massive amount), the Amazon would probably not be as tall or as dense, but it would still be a massive rain-forest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I humbly disagree. While that definition of x-limited is correct, it doesn’t mean that the addition of x will just scale up production. Take HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll) areas of the ocean for example. They are very low productivity zones with respect to phytoplankton and are arguably deserts. They’re also iron-limited zones because of a lack of aeolian winds (e.g. the sandstorms of the Sahara). If you add iron (as humans do in various Iron Fertilization experiments) HNLC zones explode with planktonic blooms.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see then that with a lack of Saharan winds, the Amazon would be a deadzone. The species would also probably change to things that require less nutrients so it probably wouldn’t be a sparse rainforest.</p></div>		</li>
