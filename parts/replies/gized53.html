<p>so by the time the rotation signal has been transmitted atom-to-atom from the inside to the outside, it's been over 4 hours, and the inner edge of the record has rotated tens of thousands of times. If the inner edge has rotated far more than the outer edge, you are tearing apart your record. It's not rotating uniformly - it's breaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this why objects &quot;explode&quot; when you rotate them really fast? Like those slomo guys videos of exploding a record or an apple by rotating them too fast?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a different effect. As the object rotates, there is (in its rotating reference frame) a centrifugal force that is pulling all of the bits of it outwards. This centrifugal force creates a stress in the material, which has to be resisted by the material's tensile strength, which is proportional to the square of the radius and the square of the angular velocity, and also to the density of the disk.</p>
<p>In fact, it turns out that for a thin-walled ring or cylinder, this proportionality is an exact equality - so you can get the maximum tangential speed at which one can spin by taking the tensile strength of the material, and dividing it by its density!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In practice many of the objects broken in the those high speed videos break before their maximum tensile strength because of imbalanced forces from them being imperfect cylinders.  This causes vibrations and is why you see the wobbling in the high speed videos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why did I learn in high school that centrifugal force doesn't exist, but now I see it all over the place on Reddit? I was taught that what we call centrifugal force is just the inertia/momentum of the rotating object and that centripetal force is equivalent to normal force in the rotational context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in practice the object will break way before the speed of light even becomes an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The things they spin are not nearly large enough for the affect described above. In this case, the material simply isn't strong enough to handle the pull of centripetal force. In smaller things, i you were to make the disc out of a stronger material you could spin it much faster. But in the case above of an extremely large disc, no material could be strong enough to withstand the forces discussed. Those same forces are technically present in the small disc, but probably at such a small level that they are negligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still essentially the same effect. A disk will break apart when the stresses in the material are too great to hold it together, whether it's spinning at relativistic or classical speeds. The only difference is that calculating the stresses is different for an object that is big enough/spinning fast enough for relativistic effects to matter compared to one that can be accurately described with purely Newtonian physics.</p>
<p>OP used the example of a really large disc, and it's true that for one that's big enough no material could be strong enough to withstand the necessary forces. But we could also be talking about a really tiny disk spinning super fast, and the exact same thing would be true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It takes an infinite amount of energy</p>

<p>To spin a record like the slomo guys did to the speed of light you need more energy than it takes to get a rocket up into space.</p>

<p>Infinitely more</p>

<p>Light is one of the few things able to travel at that speed cause it practically has zero mass.</p>

<p>It has zero mass. Things with mass cannot travel at the speed of light at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So basically you need to burn more than 684 million gallon of fuel to get something weighing 1 Kg to move at the speed of light, for a single second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would need to burn an infinite amount of fuel</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I may have made some calculation errors along the way, but the general gist is that there is no way that they spun that record even near the speed of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The error you're making is using linear acceleration, but at all speeds are actually fractions of <em>c</em>. Speed only <em>seems</em> to increase linearly at non-relativistic speeds. In simpler terms: adding speed using simple addition only works at our very slow speeds we encounter everyday.</p>
<p>EDIT: for example, if you are driving at half the speed of light (0.5<em>c</em> ), and then you double your speed, you are not travelling at the speed of light, you are now traveling at 3/4ths the speed of light (0.75<em>c</em>), and if you double it again, now you're traveling at 7/8ths (0.875<em>c</em>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Yeah but what if you sped it up really slowly...&quot;</p>
<p>As the outer edge gets closer to lightspeed, due to relativity, it also gets heavier, so the force required to spin it faster rises; even putting aside the issue of material strength, at the speed of light the force required would be infinite, and so no matter what turning force we applied, it wouldn't be enough to get it to lightspeed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does not. Relativistic mass is an archaic concept that just leads to confusion, it's not used in physics any more.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>No, material strength is the key point. No matter how strong it is - any value you like - it will rip if you keep adding energy to it, and it will rip before reaching the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, strength and its rigidity. If someone now said &quot;what if we had an absolutely rigid material&quot;, they'd essentially be saying &quot;what if some material could travel faster than light&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to ask &quot;well, what if you used a set of gears to multiply the speeds&quot; (like the opposite of those machine art projects where the final gear won't rotate for 10,000 years), as an extension of the thought experiment, but the same issue of energy requirement would obviously apply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always hate those set ups. They usually make a claim at the speed the final gear is moving at. But in actuality, there is space between each gear and they need to move that slight distance before they engage.   </p>
<p>There is an upper limit on gearing this way. After a point, you're just adding metal/plastic to the end and claiming it will probably eventually move. But if you measured it, it isn't moving at all.   </p>
<p>Which is kind of the same thing here. Things break down at the extremes because you have to factor in things normally seen as negligibly insignificant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things don't get infinitely heavy at the speed of light. You need to pump more and more energy into a thing to get faster and faster as you get closer to c - this way, you can think as it is becoming &quot;heavier&quot; (as heavy things require more energy to accelerate them) but in reality, they aren't actually getting heavier, but they act like (from our point of view) as if they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to go a level deeper, here I am talking about &quot;heavy&quot; in the sense of inertia - the force needed to make it go faster. As others point out, there isn't REALLY an increasing mass, but if you're cranking that handle to try and spin your record, it'll feel like there was!</p></div>		</li>
