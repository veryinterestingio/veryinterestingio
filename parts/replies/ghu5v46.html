<p>This is simply not true. That's exactly how it's done. Modern chess engines do not use the space of time between moves to deduce cheating, you're making that up. It has a lot more to do with probabilities of making moves and how popular chess engines score possible moves. An AI chess player will be intelligent but predictable unless some randomness is intentionally programmed, while humans are far less predictable even at Grandmaster levels. All this data can be analyzed alone or compared against a database of known games and the system's best guess will usually be correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re misunderstanding what OP said.</p>
<p>This is how human reviewers catch cheaters; there’s no reason it will take humans 2 seconds every move to find obvious moves in endgames, for example, but it will take cheaters 2 seconds every move to input the opponent’s move, check what the computer recommends and play the recommended move. To automate some of this detection work, an AI can be implemented to detect obvious 2 second move structures can flag out cheaters and save on manpower to manually review cheating reports.</p></div>		</li>
