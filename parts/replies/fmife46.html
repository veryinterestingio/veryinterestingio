			<div class="markdown"><p>One can't infect without the other. An empty virus has no infectious material (RNA), and RNA has no way to enter the cell without a virus.</p>
<p>Most methods of decontamination attack either the capsid (soap for exemple breaks it appart) or the RNA (UV light).</p>
<p>The catch is UV light is a terrible way to kill off the virus and i don't understand why everyone is going crazy for it. It has terrible penetration, (dirty surfaces won't be irradiated properly or evenly, and then you have to redo the process with the surface under the dirty) it's easy to block, and you need to do QC tests on it often.</p>
<p>When its not a perishable item just put it away for 5-7 days and it'll be a lot less stressful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! </p>
<p>A week or so ago (what is time?) our neighbor dropped off a bottle of whiskey cause he'd gone to the liquor store. I washed the bottle with soap and water for 20 seconds. It felt insane but short of having stored it somewhere were it wouldn't touch anything else for several days (hard in a small kitchen)...seems right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup people dont understand that it lacks penetration. It works better on surfaces that are smooth but not really on porous materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey you mention it light, would you happen to know if neutrons or any particular radiation would be better? There’s this thing called a fusor, and it’s a fancy lightbulb that might be able to put out better radiation. Some old guy thought it was neat and they didn’t build one good enough to be a power plant.
Can we use this to sterilize a large batch of masks or filters?
