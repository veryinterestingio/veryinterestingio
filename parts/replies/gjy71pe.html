			<div class="markdown"><p>To borrow from another explanation in this thread: how does a grape inside a bowl “know” it is inside a bowl? The fact is the grape doesn’t know and it doesn’t need to know. The grape just sits in a place where all forces acting on it are in equilibrium, and changing the position of the grape requires work. So it will remain in the bowl until someone puts in the work to get it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, not dumb.  I'll try to ELI5 it best I can, but it might be more of an ELI15.  So first off, atoms obviously do not have feelings, and they don't have intent, either.  They move randomly, and basically bounce around until they find a suitable partner.  A suitable partner is basically another element that's a satisfactory match, and in general the best match available (otherwise it'll tend to migrate to the better match when it gets near that).  What makes a good match?  Well, all atoms have protons, neutrons, and electrons (except hydrogen, certain isotopes, and some ions, but we'll talk about &quot;normal&quot; atoms for now).  Every atom's goal is to be stable, and that has to do with balance in the outermost (a.k.a valence) shell of electrons.  There are three basic ways to achieve balance: fill the shell completely, fill it halfway, or empty it completely so the full shell below it is now the outer shell.  So the result is kind of like this: let's say you, me, and some third person are in a room and we each have some apples.  You have nine, I have one, and the other person has five.  Our goal is to either have zero, five, or ten apples.  You and I are going to match up and trade apples, third person is content not getting involved, and now we're &quot;part of something else,&quot; as you said.</p>
<p>Is everything not just a giant atomic field?  Yeah, it kinda is, kinda isn't.  Now that we've got basic interaction out of the way we can get into this one.  First off, keep in mind, not everything is connected in the sense you're thinking; there's a whole lotta vacuumy nothingness out there in space.  Second, there's the matter of physical chemistry and the behaviour of material in the solid state.  Certain compounds arrange in certain patterns, others arrange in others.  To grossly simplify this, think of the tile in your bathroom.  Imagine trying to tile the floor with half of those and half of some totally different shape tile.  Certain combinations might work, a lot wouldn't, so some tiles could end up as part of the system that is your bathroom, while others just wouldn't mesh.</p>
<p>Finally, objects are discrete to us, but atoms, too, are always discrete (and also not....hold on).  The basic electron stuff we covered up front is an important concept to remember.  The atoms are only ever sharing or trading electrons, and it is through that interaction that they bond, but they're not like....welded together or technically even touching.  </p>
<p>As a closing note, though, in a way, nothing is exactly discrete, everything's just kinda sorta all part of one big thing, and nothing's really separate.  This is a quantum physics concept-- certain subatomic particles (the tiny things that make up atoms) are literally in every location in the universe simultaneously while unobserved.  We talk about where things &quot;are&quot; solely based on the area that thing is <em>most likely</em> to be, not where it definitely is, because it's never definitely anywhere except when you, or a machine, are literally looking at it.  Weird right?  At the quantum level it's kind of like if you were told to drive from your house around and back to your house.  You have options, and no matter what one you choose you'll end up in the same spot, so who cares?  You could get in your car, drive up and down the driveway, and call it a day.  You could drive to California, Texas, Brazil, and come back home.  If I'm not watching, I have no way on Earth of knowing whether you're in China or sleeping in your car in the driveway, and because if you're a particle you're operating at quantum speeds and properties, and can move in any direction, and have no sentience, you literally are in your driveway, China, the moon, the sun, et cetera all at once.  So in the end, we are all connected to everything in one big quantum sandbox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add this as well: <a href="https://youtu.be/4m5JnJBq2AU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/4m5JnJBq2AU</a></p>
<p>The video I've linked shows a concept called Brownian motion in simple terms.  This should highlight fairly well my first point about atoms essentially moving at random until they make contact with a suitable partner.  In this example, they use things much larger than atoms, but it's all the same idea.  If it's matter, it does this, period.  It's happening to you right now, too, it's just that you're a little big for air molecules to move you much, and you're, you know, alive and making conscious decisions about where to move and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone who's read down this far, I'll add two other things that I think are important to know based on all this.</p>
<p>First, while the smallest particles move super-fast, and while science says that they have a probability of being anywhere until observed, it's worth noting that despite this, you've yet to spontaneously disintegrate or walk through a wall or whatever.  This is due to probability, and most importantly due to interactions with other matter.  The more parts you involve the lower the chances of all of them being outside of their sum location of highest probability.  You're trillions of these interactions, so you tend to be where you're expected (and expecting!) to be.</p>
<p>The other thing is that the majority of this stuff is only happening because of the differences between elements and their &quot;desire&quot; to fill their outer shell.  If this were not the case, everything in the universe would randomly Brownian-spread out to an infinite distance and eventually everything would be so far from everything else that you could say &quot;nothing is connected to anything else&quot; and be 99.9999999% not lying.  It would help if everything was the same element, too, like all heliums or whatever so that mass isn't a factor.  But uh, safe to say you won't see that in your lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a quantum physics explanation you could say that every particle is a wave that extends through the whole universe. But obviously the probability of existence is infinitely high in this one small spot. The reason why certain atoms stick together is because there are electrons that they share that have fallen into deep probability pits inbetween each other. Multiply this dependance in various forms over trillions of atoms you have a system which rather wants to be together than apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a great clarification.  One thing I'd add though is that the way I tend to think of it is that we're much more talking about the probability of a <em>type</em> of particle being in a certain place and far less about a specific one.  Like if we took an electron and named that specific electron &quot;Timothy,&quot; we're not really saying that there's a near infinite likelihood that Timothy is in the orbital, just that someone who is for all intents and purposes the same as Timothy is in that space X at time T.  But that's moving away from ELI5 territory a bit.  Either way, great point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>isnt there some theory that all the electrons in the universe are actually the same electron which is just moving backwards and forwards in time in one giant tangled knot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Richard Feynman invented &quot;Feynman diagrams&quot;, a way to draw with lines and vertices a shorthand for complicated collections of integrals used to calculate how much a given interaction contributes to a simpler version.</p>
<p>In these diagrams, lines are particles and vertices are the 'points' they interact in. And laying things out this way made it REALLY obvious that, say, a positron - an anti-electron - behaved EXACTLY as though it were a normal electron, but moving backwards in time.</p>
<p>So if you're only looking at diagrams that don't include weak-force interactions - so that the electron can't get changed into a neutrino, or vice versa - you can trace an electron line that comes in at one place, past all the places where it interacts with a photon or something, sometimes the line will be going backwards in time and sometimes forwards, until it comes out another side of the diagram.</p>
<p>Which led to the hypothesis &quot;...maybe, over the life of the universe, all these electron lines connect up, maybe in the far past or the far future, so that they're all one long incredibly tangled line?&quot;</p>
<p>Which has some issues. First, for this to work, either time has to loop back on itself, or somewhere else there has to be a lot of antimatter, cuz around here there's bazillions of electrons all going forward in time, and relatively no positrons.</p>
<p>Second, the weak force makes this need to change to &quot;sometimes the electron is a neutrino&quot;, as noted above. And third, something called &quot;neutrino oscillation&quot; means you have to add &quot;the neutrino can be one of three different 'generation' types&quot;, which means that the electron could sometimes also be a muon or tauon, the second- and third-generation equivalents. And by this time it's not such an elegant, pretty hypothesis, oh well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what you're driving at here is the concept of quantum entanglement, which is actually sort of ELI5-able.  It's not that all electrons are the same electron, but rather that in a simple example two entangled electrons are carrying out equal but opposite functions.  So if the system of the two, let's say, adds up to zero spin, one is putting positive one-half spin in and one is taking negative one-half spin out.  They're the same insofar as while there are certainly two of them, until we measure what one's up to, they're indistinguishable from each other.  As soon as we do take a look, though, they become discrete and opposite, and are no longer entangled.  If we were in a quantum room full of jellybeans and one of us had the job of throwing beans out of one window and the other had the job of taking the same number of beans in through another window, the room would always have the same number of beans, and it's impossible to know which of us is the bean-thrower and which is the bean-taker until someone peeks in the room.  Furthermore, necessarily, if someone peeks in and finds me throwing beans, then at that moment you <em>must</em> be the one taking beans in.  Note at this point I never said one of us is always the one throwing and one is always adding, just that at any given point one of us is adding and one is throwing.  Nobody knows which, as long as the room has a constant number of beans and we're not being watched.  When we become observed and therefore discrete, I essentially make you what you are and vice versa, but until then we're not really separate people, we're just two identical, interchangable parts of one system.</p>
<p>I'll edit this to add: while it's not the same thing, what helps this be more digestible is that we do forms of this all the time with other stuff, physicists or not.  For example, if we got married, and our combined money added up to one million dollars, people would say &quot;oh, the Smiths are millionaires!&quot; We're both seen as millionaires, but in reality, one of us is a million dollars in debt and the other has two million dollars.  Who's who?  Doesn't matter until we get divorced.  The moment we do, if you're the rich one, then I must be the poor one.</p></div>		</li>
