<p>The primary reason why planets have atmosphere is because they have Volcanism that replenishes atmosphere. Magnetic Field or not, all planets lose atmosphere slowly primarily due to pressure driven winds (not gravity and temperature/velocity distribution curves of molecules, although that does play a role). Atmosphere loss must be balanced out by atmosphere gain somehow.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Secondly, the primary mechanism for solar winds stripping atmosphere is that UV light ionizes the molecule, which then can be electrically repulsed by the charged particles in the solar wind (not unlike a rail gun). Physical momentum transfer by ramming is a thing, but also far slower than the ionization/colombic repulsion method as you have far smaller interaction cross sections. Magnetic fields protect a planet by deflecting these charged particles first, vastly slowing this process down. This is also why CO2 is hard to eject, because it doesn't ionize easily with UV light, and thus doesn't get kicked out as easily.</p>

<p>Sorry for lack of sources, I left Academia years ago, and this is what I remembered from a combination of my own research, and yelling at people on the internet.  </p>
<p>EDIT: </p>
<p>Some background reading that describes the processes of atmosphere loss, and how a Magnetic Field interacts with it: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, less than a kg per second for the entire planet? That's really impressive to me for some reason. Was curious about Earth and according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.[1] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller</p>
<p>The MAVEN mission has also explored the current rate of atmospheric escape of Mars. Jeans escape plays an important role in the continued escape of hydrogen on Mars, contributing to a loss rate that varies between 160 - 1800 g/s.[15] Oxygen loss is dominated by suprathermal methods: photochemical (~ 1300 g/s), charge exchange (~ 130 g/s), and sputtering (~ 80 g/s) escape combine for a total loss rate of ~ 1500 g/s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Earth potentially has the highest atmospheric escape of the three planets, but we obviously have a lot going on to make up for that pitiful loss. Interesting to see a number on a human scale when dealing with geologic/solar processes. To put it in perspective, earth gains between 5 and 300 metric tons of space dust <em>daily</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth (and Venus, but not Mars to any significant degree) also replenishes its atmosphere through outgassing caused by geological activity and some other mechanisms. If anyone ever tries to explain why some planets' atmospheres are different from others without mentioning atmospheric replenishment then they are almost certainly wrong! All planets lose some of their atmosphere to space over time, so to have a stable atmosphere over billions of years requires some way of replenishing what is lost. That's the biggest reason why Earth and Venus have atmospheres and Mars doesn't!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a day and a second are pretty different. There are 86400 \~ 10\^5 seconds in a day. So 1 kg / s works out to \~ 100 tons / day -- roughly the same as the space dust gains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I correct in my understanding that the real question is not why Venus still has a thick atmosphere, but why Mars has lost so much of its atmosphere?</p>
<p>Furthermore, one criticism against terraforming Mars is that any created atmosphere would have been blown away by the Sun. If these induced magnetospheres are good enough, would it render that criticism moot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither question is fully settled in the field, but if you accept that solar wind driven escape was the primary process removing the Martian atmosphere, it becomes rather difficult to explain the Venusian atmosphere.</p>
<p>It has recently become clear that other escape processes are more active than the solar wind at Mars. In particular so-called photochemical escape seems to have removed much more atmosphere than the solar wind.</p>
<p><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JA023525" target="_blank">Lillis et al., (2017) Photochemical escape of oxygen from Mars: First results from MAVEN in situ data, <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em>, <strong>122</strong>, 3, doi:10.1002/2016JA023525</a>.</p>
<p>The rate of escape is still only on the order of about 1 kg/s in the present, at that rate even the tenuous present-day atmosphere would take over a billion years to remove. Any terraforming process would have to supply atmospheric gasses at rates thousands or millions times higher to be achievable on human time-scales. Atmospheric escape rates are then barely a round-off error. There's a slightly greater concern with the loss of water due to its dissociation in the upper atmosphere and the subsequent thermal escape of hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would giving Mars an extra thick ozone layer solves this?</p></div>		</li>
