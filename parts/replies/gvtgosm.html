			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to throw in there that cell size, and regeneration of the parasite matters here. As the responder already said, &quot;size matters&quot;, and your immune system has a much easier time dealing with an invasion on the cellular level, versus a worm that can regenerate itself. </p>
<p>Ex: hydrochloric acid on aluminum foil will destroy the thin foil in seconds, but on a block of aluminum, barely scratch the surface.</p>
<p>In the case of an intestinal worm, your body might be able to attack it's outer layers fairly quickly, but it will regenerate from the inside out, shed, and replace those dead cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked under a classically trained chef and we would all eat garlic every day for all the benefits and antimicrobial properties for dealing with raw food. He maintained that I didnt have to join the ritual, he didn't understand how much I love garlic</p></div>		</li>
