<p>3 billion, not 3 million. It's 6000 times larger.</p>
<p>The longest chromosome has 250 million base pairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your last paragraph - we also have to think about modifications to DNA. DNA not only consists of four bases (A, T, G &amp; C) but a myriad of modifications that gives more context to the information. There are modifications that are associated with actively transcribed genes and &quot;silent&quot; genes. So that gives an additional layer of control. I doubt a cell would know what to do if you would stick a whole unmodified genome in there without additional &quot;helpers&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok this brings up my question of &quot;how DNA functions&quot; . I know about (A, T, G and C) and how it tells the body &quot;this and that&quot; but it was explained to me as &quot;like coding a computer&quot; where some (A, T, G, C) are like the 0s and 1s of coding and a pair of G,C are kind of like &quot;Off&quot; and &quot;On&quot;. Not saying that as a hard rule but just in comparison. <em>This is my question</em> - is that even somewhat close? Or can there be an entire length, per say, that would 'equal a 0' and then the next A/T would be the one? Or is it THE WHOLE STRAND that has very specific directions, more like a blueprint with construction? Or is the second part of my question like the chromosome is the blueprint and the DNA in there is the 0s and 1s? {I hope this makes sense. I work in construction but the human body fascinates me, so I don't know biology jargon}</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK. So DNA is a doublestranded helix (you've probably seen cartoons of it) and each base of one strand interacts with another. Both strands are complement to each other - one has an A the other has a T. Interactions are only possible between A and T and G and C (there are a few chemicals that can mimick some bases but that is not important for this). The machinery in the cell recognizes certain sequences that mark the start of a gene. For example the start codon is always ATG. To make sure that no random ATGs are by mistake recognized as start codon there have to be some other motifs in the right distance as well. You can imagine it like sitting down in your favourite chair in front of the TV with the remote, a beer and chips at the right distance. If there are no snacks you get up and grab some. ðŸ˜Š
And as others have pointed out DNA is stored by wrapping it around proteins called histones. Which genes to express at what time is a tightly regulated process. For proteins to &quot;read&quot; the sequence of DNA it has to be unwound from the histone proteins. Some genes also exist in several copies. When the whole concept of DNA as a storage molecule for genetic information was new we thought that we can just start at one end of the chromosome and turn each gene &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; until we come to the end. Unfortunately it's much more complicated than that
I hope that answers your questions a little bit. If you have more just ask!</p></div>		</li>
