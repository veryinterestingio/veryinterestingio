			<div class="markdown"><p>If we assume most things develop due to an evolutionary advantage then one of the reasons for this is because so much of the human brain development is environment dependent - which is why we are adaptable as a species. We are capable of complex cognitive development which enables things like language development and social intelligence, originating in our prefrontal cortex which mostly grows postbatally to age 18montgs-3years and the way it grows is very much dependent on baby’s interactions and immediate environment. I always think it allows for more individuality and fast tracked evolution - you have the inherited genetic material of your parents/ancestors and you also have all the immediate info needed to survive optimally. We could have more self-sufficient newborns but then we sacrifice a percentage of our intelligence. In our current state higher cognitive function trumps simply being able to walk straight away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not scholar in this but I would assume this occurs because a large portion of human fetal development is spent on the brain. Of course take what I say with a grain of salt, it’s speculation on my part</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured the same. So long spent developing the platform for our amazing self aware, adaptable brain n half the population doesn’t even use that part, was my exact thought, tbh lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was interesting, thanks! There is also a great deal of variation within the same ethnic groups, when it comes to gestational length. Anecdotally, I've had friends and relatives of various races deliver on both the low and high ends, with some people managing both ends with different pregnancies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Previously, the children would likely never make it out of their mother, and both would unfortunately die. This would remove both instances of the large head genes, so long as the father didn't manage to find another wife with a larger birth canal. Now mother and child go on to spread large head genes, but short women are also able to date tall guys so it evens out... so long as everyone is nice to Obstetricians.</p></div>		</li>
