			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The best thing for insta relief from a hangover is a sports drink of some kind. Gatorade, Powerade, Pedialyte coconut water. Anything that's hydrating and full of electrolytes. It won't cure you, but it will provide maximum relief quicker than anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only time I've needed to go to the extreme of using pedialyte was during a bout with C. Difficile and was losing some serious fluids due to 8-12 bowel movements a day for part of it. The really salty flavor took some getting used to but I think it did a lot of good.</p></div>		</li>
