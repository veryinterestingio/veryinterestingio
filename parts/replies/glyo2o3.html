<p>But this is also true for ideas - they can be reproduced via communication in a manner not unlike genes.</p>

<p>Which is why Dawkins termed them.... memes.</p>
<p>Yes, Reddit, the ability to communicate memes was the launching point for what it means to be a modern human. We did it!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kind of like the Shakers- they promoted chaste marriage and opposed reproduction. They died out, and the only thing left of Shakers is a style of furniture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is certainly largely true, but also not <em>necessarily</em> the case. If ideas spread from person to person via contact, we can model them like viruses. As you say, most viruses end up selecting themselves for non-lethality - because killing your host tends to be a bad way to survive. But even a lethal virus can survive in populations for quite a long time, as long as it kills you slowly enough to allow <em>other</em> people to have reproduced in the meantime.</p>
<p>In the context of religion (itself a fantastically good idea at reproducing), celibate orders of monks and so forth have persisted in societies for quite a number of generations - because there was enough influx of people from <em>other</em>, non-celibate families, for the idea of celibacy to never run out of new 'converts'.</p>
<p>But, crucially, such an idea can only ever infect a <em>portion</em> of the civilization.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although the concept does seem to be on the decline. </p>
<p>And presumably, it would be a long time for an idea that produced a small disadvantage in reproduction to show up as a known bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think there's still one or two left.</p>
<p>Edit: Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Membership to the community is still open, and occasionally &quot;novices&quot; explore joining the society.</p>
<p>With Carr's death, Sister June Carpenter and Brother Arnold Hadd remained.[17] The Spring/Summer 2019 issue of The Clarion, the Shakers' newsletter, makes reference to an additional Shaker in the community, Brother Andrew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it looks like they're still gaining members.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first paragraph is straight out of <em>The Selfish Gene</em> by Richard Dawkins, and ideas, like genes, are called memes (yes thats were internet memes come from). Good answer mate</p></div>		</li>
