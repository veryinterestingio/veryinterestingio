			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a interesting read! But I don't think my question was clear:</p>
<p>Why *those* names in particular?</p>
<p>I understand the etymology of distinctly Muslim &amp; SubSaharan African names (they come from Islam &amp; SubSaharan Africa, duh). But where does &quot;Devonte&quot; come from? Or the convention to begin names with La or D'? </p>
<p>These parents didn't just choose random names. These names, while new, had lots of similarities to one another. This implies they have shared roots and/or influences. What are those roots/influences?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you won’t find a lot else. First off, it’s a culture developed by people whose roots were removed from them through slavery, so African Americans don’t have the same kind of distinct cultural connections to their countries of origin. African Americans developed their own vibrant culture that ties in some ways to that shared experience. Similarities in those names can arise from cultures like New Orleans culture and spread through the African American culture without all people with those kinds of names necessarily coming from NOLA. In fact, due to the French and Spanish laws the culture of New Orleans allowed for more of a high standing for the free black population, which may be a reason that some African American names borrow syllables from the French roots.</p>
<p>So I would say that Devonte and LaKeshia probably don’t have old world origins of any kind. They were probably developed by combining pieces of other names to create something distinct, which then became popular. Considering most of the names you bring up seem to pop up most in the late 20th century I would call it a modern invention. Inventing names like that has become common in the US anyway. I don’t think Jayden or Braydon or Brantley necessarily have old world origins either.</p></div>		</li>
