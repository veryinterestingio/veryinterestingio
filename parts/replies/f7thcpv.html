			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that while space is quite large, with space junk we are mostly talking about a quite finite amount of space. Basically a hollow spherical area around the earth with sufficient depth to cover the range of most satellites and staging orbits and so on. </p>
<p>And that's potentially interacting with other space junk or spacecraft, satellites, all of which occupy the same finite bit of space around the earth while moving really fast because that's how orbits work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that information. On the other hand, how are they going to clean the debris? Is the principle similar to that of a magnetic crane used in junkyard? If so, won't it make the vehicle collecting the debris heavier and alter it's path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to tell, until something is practical.  Most of the ideas I've seen involve grabbing trash with a big bag or an arm.  The goal would be to slowly make the contraption heavier and slower until it falls into the ocean as a meteor.  Then you send up another trash contraption, et cetera.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like grabbing would be the easy part. How do you keep making new intercepts at a low enough speed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the implementation.
One big problem is that you can not simply collect the trash by crashing into it. This would result in much more and smaller debris, which is again harder to track and more debris means more possibilities of an unwanted collision. </p>
<p>The (IMHO) most reasonable approach is to catch the junk similar how you would dock to a space station:
Approach it in such a way that the difference in velocity is minimal and you are as close as possible. Then you may catch it (robotic arms or net).</p>
<p>But here the problem is, to be able to get an other piece of debris, you would need to change your orbit (which can cost massive amounts of fuel). So depending on the situation it may be the easiest solution to use one satellite for one piece of debris and the let them deorbit deliberately (eigher with propulsion or for lower orbits with atmospheric drag)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about some sort of anti-magnetism device? Push the debris lower in the gravity well and let earths atmosphere do its thing</p>
<p>My issue with collection is that you run the risk of the collection device accidentally colliding with the debris, resulting in more debris or even worse some sort of cascade
But also I know nothing about astrophysics beyond a casual interest so this might not be good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Issue is that bullets are slower then most of the junk running around. You'd have to match the speed of the junk and try to collect it. Rinse and repeate. The expense on energy and acceleration is too much for anything usefull. </p>
<p>Magnates are only useful with metals. Scoopes are more likely. And super expensive. Ideas about robots designed to nudge large debrits into atmosphere are more likely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That all depends on how many more orbiting satellites India plans on destroying.</p></div>		</li>
