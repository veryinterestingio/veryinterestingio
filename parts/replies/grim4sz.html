<p>Not being facetious here. I want to be a thorium fan, but that's what I heard from a pretty smart dude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, irradiating thorium-232 with neutrons will produce protactinium-233. But &quot;bitch to deal with&quot; in what way? The concern that I'm aware of with the protactinium-233 is that it can be separated from spent fuel, in order to divert uranium-233 for weapons.</p>
<p>Both fuel cycles produce fissile material which can potentially be diverted, so the idea that one or the other will be immune to that is a myth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it emits at some seriously high energies and huge Sv/kg?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is all true for unused uranium fuel as well. It's <em>after</em> the fuel has been exposed to the large neutron fluences that it becomes much more dangerous. And that's true for both uranium and thorium fuel cycles.</p>
<p>The waste from a closed fuel cycle will generally be less of an issue than open cycles, because you can burn up TRUs, and transmute fission products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in context of what I'm asking for, would it be possible for, let's say thorium-based MSR to accept waste from a typical light-water reactor to start cycles?</p>
<p>If yes, how much much of that waste could be reused?</p>

<p>All of the fissile components of the spent fuel. So any uranium-235 that still remains, as well as fissile transuranics that were produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What degree of processing would that take? What general handling steps would it take to use actual spent fuel from an existing reactor for this kind of thing? Iâ€™m just curious what level of risk that adds relative to the currently popular schemes.</p></div>		</li>
