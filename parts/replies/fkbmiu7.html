			<div class="markdown"><p>This is way, way more aggressive than the standard toolkit. In normal times, the Fed is happy with giving cheaper or more expensive lending to banks, and let that trickle down to the rest of the economy through the banking system. If the bank has to pay more to borrow from the fed, it will want you to pay it more to borrow from it, and so on. </p>
<p>This allows the fed to directly affect asset prices and have much more immediate impact</p></div>		</li>
