			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't? Your phone barely uses any power at all when you're not touching it. It all gets drained when you're actively using it, mostly because of the screen. A background process and the power draw of a microphone are all that's required for voice assistants. That draw is negligible. That's what I said in my previous comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is about how it is possible to have the phone react to voice with so little power draw. Given that voice recognition is a quite energy demanding task, that is a valid question.</p></div>		</li>
