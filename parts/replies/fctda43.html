			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't help that Australia proper is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/AustralianPlate.png" target="_blank">sitting pretty well near the middle of a <em>much</em> larger plate</a>. Most action that plate gets is underwater. For comparison, the Kiwis are right on the plate boundary, as is New Guinea.</p>
<p>And it won't be smashing into anything big any time soon. Maybe it'll get squished between North America and Eurasia at some point, but that's far enough in the future that predicting gets <em>really</em> fuzzy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great representation of this my Dad always points out is all our mountains in Aus are very rounded from wind being so old, in contrast to West NA where they are sheer and sharp and were formed more recently, geologically speaking.</p>
<p>I've been up many of the West Coast NA mountains and they are SO much more dramatic. Going To The Sun Road up Glacier National Park and then all the craziness between Golden and Banff. Such an amazing effect.</p>
<p>Growing up in Aus every mountain looks like an oversize hill haha</p>
<p>Edit: can forget Tetons and Oregon Coast!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great example of this is the McDonnell ranges in central Australia. These mountains are over 1 billion years old and have weathered down from around 5000 metres to little more than hills now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just worn away over time by weathering and by the once lush forests and grasslands. Australia was once a forest wonderland, hence why we have so much coal now. Catch-22 a little however, since the country is geologically stable - the forests didn't have to worry about volcanoes, but they eventually &quot;ate&quot; away at their own nutrient source. (hope you don't mind the personification, I'm assuming I'm still ELI5)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But when forests decompose, wouldn’t that release all the nutrients?</p>
<p>Topsoil getting blown into the sea is really the only mechanism I can think of which semi-permanently removes nutrients from a continent.</p></div>		</li>
