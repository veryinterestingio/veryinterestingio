			<div class="markdown"><p>Both types of quartz rely on iron (and possibly manganese for their colour). It is thought amethyst's colour might also require irradiation by low levels of radiation from the surrounding rock. Synthetic amethyst is created by doping quartz with iron and then exposing it to very high levels of radiation.</p>
<p>As you say, citrine is created when amethyst is heated to further oxidise the iron ions. It first passes through a mottled purply-orange colour crystal called ametrine before turning bright yellow or orange. Low-quality, pale amethyst can be turned into more valuable citrine by heating. It's worth looking out for any mention of heat treatment when buying gem stones as it implies the colours are not entirely natural.</p>
