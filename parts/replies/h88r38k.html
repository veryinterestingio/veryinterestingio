			<div class="markdown"><p>We should mention that these are still early times and that there are at least a few viral diseases that get worse once the immune response weakens.  I know this was a much bigger worry last year and that the data collected so far has not shown this feared progression.</p>
<p>The truth is that Covid is still too new to know anything for certain about how things will develop long-term, and I think that's important to remember.  Some places and people are overreacting to the fear-mongering and, in a well-meaning attempt to calm people down and get us on the right track, are overplaying what we know and making long-term claims before we have enough data.</p>
<p>But let me end and say that the hard facts we do know support you and the trend that the subsequent infections tend to be less severe.  I'm starting to feel cautiously optimistic that we may have gotten really lucky by getting the least bad of all the possible bad viruses that could have spread around the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like at this point, your 2nd paragraph this is just fear mongering. The data is only positive. Let's not assume it will change. Imagine we were talking about the vax instead, exact same arguments could be made</p></div>		</li>
