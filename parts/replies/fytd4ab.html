			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, he was an interesting guy, he was an excellent scientist who believed in creationism but not biblical literalism.  His arguments against evolution seem to have been a matter of (misinterpreted) scientific evidence, rather than unshakeable religious faith.  Check that link I posted for a short biography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Young Earth creationism is a newish thing and a distinctly American Protestant thing. </p>
<p>Yes, very long ago people did believe that but they had zero frame of reference. so what you think of as young Earth creationism is actually a very New movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear about Kelvin’s approach though, it was so young compared to Earth’s true age much more due to the fact that he failed to account for mantle convection, rather than failing to account for radioactivity. </p>
<p>Radioactivity seems to take the sole place of the missing puzzle piece in many people’s accounts of Kelvin’s error - probably because it could be used in a different way to calculate the actual age of Earth materials. I know you mentioned both radioactivity <em>and</em> convection, but it can’t be stressed how important convection over radioactivity is in the sort of calculation Kelvin was making. If we modify his approach to include just radioactivity, the calculated age of the earth would still be in the same (incorrect) ball park. </p>
<p>There was even a contemporary scientist making this observation about how convection would significantly change the result (before radioactivity had ever been discovered). As to why he was not listened to, despite publishing in <em>Nature</em>, that’s a little tricker to go through in a quick reddit post, but there’s a good <a href="https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/17/1/pdf/i1052-5173-17-1-4.pdf" target="_blank">summary of the whole thing here.</a></p></div>		</li>
