<p>The Earth's atmosphere <em>does</em> separate out by molecular weight in the heterosphere, located at 100 km altitude and above. For Venus, that height is closer to 130 km and above.</p>

<p>That big blue spike of O, around twice as high as the green line of O2 is... well, made from O2. This isn't any evidence of stratification, it's evidence of a lot of unfiltered UV at the height the ISS orbits.</p>
<p>At 100 km, however, it's as close as damn it to identical to sea-level. There's a very small contribution from dissociated atomic species and... that's it.</p>
<p>Here's your graph rendered in a way most browsers can view the axes:

</blockquote>
<p>For the separation between molecular vs. atomic oxygen or molecular vs atomic nitrogen? Sure. </p>
<p>For the separation by weight of atomic hydrogen, helium, and atomic oxygen, though? Those are not separating out due to photodissociation.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Agreed, because eddy diffusion is a much stronger effect than molecular diffusion between 0-100 km altitude. Those two are approximately equal at the <a href="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Turbopause" target="_blank">turbopause</a> located around 100 km, and above that height molecular diffusion takes over.</p>

<p>Hmm, my link worked in RES, but your link doesn't seem to. Well, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mPK1KQN.jpg" target="_blank">here it is</a> flattened for all to enjoy.</p></div>		</li>
