			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes definitely burping. The vast majority of methane from ruminants (castle and sheep <em>et al</em>) is produced by gut bacteria and burped out. This is all part of the process of breaking their feed down into usable food.  (They have four stomachs for this purpose). Different feeds produce different amounts of methane.</p></div>		</li>
