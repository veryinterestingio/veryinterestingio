			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand, they have to be pretty close. Certain mutations have a larger impact on priming than others, so there's a bit of a random chance, however, even one single nucleotide mutation should cause a substantial drop in test sensitivity. I imagine that the particular primer sequence and the particular mutation are both factors in how much of an impact there is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but there's a pretty good chance that the reduction in sensitivity would result in false negatives.</p></div>		</li>
