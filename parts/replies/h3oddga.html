			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not accurate. Washing off toddler writing off a wall counts are running, according to my wrist tracker. However walking holding said toddler by hand doesn't count as walking at all, as my hand doesn't move.  </p>
<p>The phone ones are also not very accurate - my phone counts about 40% less steps than my husband's phone (we can go for a walk togeather and end with vastly different count upon return) - even though it should be based on distance covered.  </p>
<p>It's a nice gadget but not much more than that.</p></div>		</li>
