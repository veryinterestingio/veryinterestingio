			<div class="markdown"><p>With that logic though, how is this different from cardiovascular exercise? You start to secrete more &quot;fight or flight&quot; hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline when you exercise, which has a similar vasoconstrictive effect to the drugs.<br />
I would suggest that the difference here is that nicotine is doing this for a <strong>long</strong> period of time which makes it unhealthy due to the reasons you mentioned.<br />
Also, the many chemicals and toxins that are consumed at the same time as the nicotine have a big role to play here too, and this does not happen during exercise.<br />
(These chemicals are able to damage your blood vessels which can lead to vascular disease (e.g strokes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a side note here: I used Nictine as the example, due to the increasing number of studies published recently on how nicotine can be good for people. They never mention cardiovascular advantages so it got me thiking. Still, the last part of your comment is pretty realive there are clean ways of getting nicotine for example: as a gum or patch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you able to share these studies?  </p>
<p>Regardless of the other chemicals you're ingesting, nicotine alone has been shown to constrict your blood vessels and put unnecessary strain on your heart. This is fundamentally different to exercise because exercise is typically transient. However, for completion sake... in theory you absolutely can harm your body by exercising too much (partly due to the excessive vasoconstriction and prolonged strain on the heart).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, oxygen often will be replaced at normal rate to meet the demand of our body overall while heart is pumping harder thru smaller veins. In my anecdotal experience, it is this &quot;mismatch&quot; in the &quot;mode&quot; our different organs are where couple are working overtime while some are almost shut off, muscles are tensed but not moving. Metabolism just does not work in the way it is suppose to and heart gets deprived of nutrients and oxygen. That is what if feels like, at least..</p></div>		</li>
