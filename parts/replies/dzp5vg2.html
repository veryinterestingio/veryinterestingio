			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question. One unique feature of smell is that it doesn't go through the same gateway structure as other senses, such as hearing and vision. The olfactory cortex has a more direct path to the prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for memory retrieval. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the cologne is just a marker. It helps bind context to memory. Just makes memory retrieval a bit easier. Doesn’t guarantee it but helps bond. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually use this as a technique to remember data during tests. I sometimes cannot remember the exact name of something, so instead of trying to &quot;brute force&quot; the memory; I relax, close my eyes and try to remember the moment when I was studying that thing. It usually allows me to remember quite a lot of things that otherwise would only create a huge frustration and anxiety if I thought about for too long during a test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I typically have a hard time recalling the simplest and most recent things. If I forcibly call up a memory it’s like all the lil Spongebob’s in my brain start losing their shit ransacking my memory file cabinets and yelling at each other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a great short term memory. But I think it's weird and I can't explain it. In high school, I always studied with music playing in the background. Come test time, seeing the question triggered me to remember back to the place I was studying and hearing the song that was playing at that moment. Then in my mind, I would fast forward through the song until my audio memory of the song matched my visual memory of what I was reading and SNAP! I could see the answer in my mind. </p>
<p>My long term memory, on the other hand, is not so great. I remember silly little details but not so much the whole picture. I wish I had the Marylu Henner photographic memory. My short term memory gets me by in the moment... great for taking tests! But I feel it's the long term memory that sets you up for success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's weird for me is that I can't study with music at all because I cannot read with music playing. Perhaps being a classically trained musician and having to constantly analyze music has caused me to focus on music I'm hearing too much to even think about language. Doubly so if the music has lyrics itself because it's like trying to comprehend two separate sentences at once, with the music being &quot;louder&quot; in my mind because of the melody.</p>
<p>That's only my own theory though. I can't actually be sure because I've been a musician as far back as I can remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting - this is exactly why they recommend you not study with music, because the music won't be there in the exam! Not that there's any evidence that it has an effect. But you've obviously found a way around that anyway!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a personal hobby where my goal is to understand my memory better. I got myself a polaroid camera to get pictures of moments I want to remember, making a description of the picture and just slide it in the book. Every year I grab the book and try to remember all the moments I've put in the book before opening it.  Funny thing is that I remember the major moments like a weeding but the small ones I never can't remember until I look at a picture of it. But when I do I instantly remember everything. I noticed also that my memory works better when I need to remember something. First time sharing the weird me so pls no hate.</p></div>		</li>
