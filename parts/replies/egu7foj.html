If it falls too low the sea water can't sink properly when it gets cold for it's return trip to warmer latitudes. No return flow means the gulf stream ceases and things things get much colder around Europe. At least thats the theory, hopefully it never gets tested in a real world situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two can go hand in hand, even beyond Ice sheets reflecting alot of sunlight. </p>
<p>The general idea is that a global warming event can melt ice and free cold fresh water that is then dumped in the warm/cold sea water conveyor belt like current that moves warm/cold currents globaly, maintaining climate temperatures around the world. This belt plays a huge role in our Global climate, more so than land temperature and sunlight, maintaining warm, moderate and cool water temperatures worldwide. Cold, fresh water sinks and the warmer sea water rises, cooling the belt down and effectively shutting down the circulation.</p>
<p>This is how we believe the last Ice Age started, There was a lake (Lake Agasasiz) roughly twice the size of the Caspian sea where the The Great Lakes(ish), Canada and Minnesota are. When the Earth began to warm coming out of a previous Ice Age it weakened the Ice walls containing the large lake of fresh water. When the Ice wall that seperated the lake from the sea broke, it dumped the entire lake into the ocean and shut down the warm current circulation I spoke of, plunging most of the world back into an Ice Age</p>
<p>Now there isn't a Lake the size of Agassiz anymore to cause such an event, but there is other ways it could occur. One is the Greenland Ice Sheet which stores plenty of frozen fresh water, it is already fragile of sorts and if it was to melt then it is in as good as a place as Lake Asasszi was to shut down the current circulation of our oceans again.</p>
<p>TL:DR Temperature rises can free fresh cold water to be dumped into the sea. It slows down the movement of warm sea water around the Earth and Global temperatures then drop dramiticly due to the warm sea water now struggling to move between the North and South to maintain warm, cold and moderate water temperatures, causing an Ice Age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, ice age or so they said.</p>
<p>There is a theory, not fully proved that a global warming period could trigger an ice age (not like ice and stuff, just a serious drop in average temperature which could impact animal and vegetal life in a significant way).</p>
<p>There is a period of 1200 years, around 12900 until 11700, called Younger Dryas in which the northern hemisphere saw a global temperature drop by 10 degrees Celsius, apparently caused just by a changed flow, in a glacial lake.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a theory, you could read more here:</p>
