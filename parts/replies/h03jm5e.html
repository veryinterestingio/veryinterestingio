			<div class="markdown"><p>And to build on this - and /u/cdb03b's answer - there wasn't a lot of other math available:</p>
<p>- Geometry was fairly well advanced, but you don't need numbers or place-value for what they were doing.<br />
- Algebra, while they had the basics, it wasn't much more. The idea of variables and equations that would become Al Jabr wouldn't be developed until the 800s. With the exception of the idea of squaring (which is taught in the US to kids around 12-13), by 10 the average student in a developed country knows more algebra than even the most knowledgeable Roman mathematician.<br />
- Every other branch of mathematics came later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I keep saying, as a mathematician, &quot;arithmetic&quot; is a very basic, dull, simple and tiny part of mathematics.  It's just one area.  Sure, it's fundamental, but that doesn't mean it's actually necessary past a certain point.</p>
<p>The majority of my degree, I barely used arithmetic at all, and what I did was incidental rather than crucial.</p>
<p>3x + 2x might require you to know 3+2 but that's about it.  Everything else you do beyond that in mathematics basically doesn't use numbers in any more complicated a way.</p>
<p>I'm actually terrible at arithmetic.  I work it out from first principles if I'm asked a difficult problem.  I can just do that quicker, even trying half-a-dozen ways, than most people can figure it out on paper or by memorisation (don't forget, the time required in memorisation in the first place has to be factored into this).</p>
<p>But 99.9% of everything mathematical that I've ever done, I could do in binary, roman numerals or any number base of choice and it would make little difference to the maths, my understanding of it, or the result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting because I don’t really understand what mathematicians do!! Can you give some real world examples of things that you would work on? Who asks you to do the work and why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arithmetic is actually just as hard as any (axiomatic) mathematics since by Gödel encoding any statement can be reduced to a statement in arithmetic. </p>
<p>Arithmetic is more interesting than most mathematicians give it credit for. Especially intuitionistic arithmetic... ;p</p></div>		</li>

<p>not really any worse than memorizing times tables (which you don’t have to do for multiplying Roman numbers)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you elaborate? How do you multiply Roman numbers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose I have V times XI. You don’t need to know that’s LV, just write down V copies of everything in the second number, then group. </p>
<p>So V times XI is XXXXXIIIII is (XXXXX)(IIIII) is LV. </p>
<p>XII times XII is:
XXXXXXXXXXIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIXIIXII is
XXXXXXXXXXXXIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII is
CXX XX IIII
CXXXXIIII = 144</p>
<p>It’s basically the same as adding…since Roman numerals don’t have places, you just get a soup of symbols. Combine as needed, no explicit carrying or anything needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, how does this handle IV or IX? IV times IX gets IXIXIXIX, but how do you keep track of the Is in the middle compared to IV times XI = XIXIXIXI? I mean with a smaller example you can just keep the relative places in mind and get IIIIXXXX = 40 - 4, but that still seems like I'm relying on my understanding of arabic numerals and converting back and forth, and if I had something like XLIX times LXXIV that seems like it's going to lead to a big freakin' mess. </p>
<p>I mean, 49 times 74 in arabic numerals still needs a little bit of patience and grouping, but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiplication is always repetitive adding. You can also add 100 1's and get to our symbol for... 100. It just ALSO tells you the positions.   </p>
<p>There's nothing &quot;Easier&quot; about the Roman system.</p></div>		</li>
