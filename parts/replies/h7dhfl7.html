2) it's not recommend to mix ibuprofen and aspirin because of thinning of the blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ibuprofen also inhibits prostaglandin formation. This is very helpful for females who suffer from menstrual cramps as Ibuprofen more or less stops cramps before they start since the majority of cramps are caused by prostaglandins. Instead of only treating pain, Ibuprofen gets to the root cause of cramps.</p>
<p>Females that have a regular cycle can actually start taking Ibuprofen a couple of days before their period so they never get cramps or they're drastically reduced. </p>
<p>Follow the directions on the box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thrilled if this info is helpful as that's why I posted it, but this has been common knowledge (at least among those in the medical field) for probably 40 years. </p>
<p>Inquire with your own physician at your next doctor's appointment. It's nothing new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why? Do you know of any biological males who suffer from menstrual cramps?</p>
<p>Normally, I don't believe in putting people in boxes or slapping a label on them, but in the field of medicine it's important. There are defining characteristics between sexes and races when it comes to health.</p>
<p>For example...</p>
<p>Sickle cell will affect blacks more than any other race.</p>
<p>Tay Sachs disease affects Jewish people.</p>
<p>Thalassemia's tend to affect mostly people of Mediterranean origin.</p>
<p>Prostate issues are experienced by males.</p>
<p>Menstrual cramping issues are experienced by females.</p>
<p>If a male comes into an emergency room and is experiencing pain in the lower right quadrant, appendicitis would be suspected.
However, if a female came in experiencing the exact same pain she would also need to be screened for an ectopic pregnancy.</p>
<p>Differences such as these are important in making a correct diagnosis and can save time and save lives.</p></div>		</li>
