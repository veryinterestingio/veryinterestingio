			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, however it's important to not devalue reducing your vices. For things like eating healthier and cutting consumption of alcohol it's absolutely awesome to simply reduce it at first. </p>
<p>One reason that so many people fall back into their vices is going from a very unhealthy lifestyle to immediately trying to live how their goal lifestyle lives. If your goal is to only eat home cooked meals and drink no alcohol, that progression will absolutely take months of effort and preparation, changing it overnight is the wrong approach for the vast majority of people. Although it's great to have a long streak without a vice, that's not the starting point for quitting something, the starting point should be a small change that's doable. If you smoke 15 cigarettes a day, try smoking only 12 per day for a week. Then 9, reducing it slowly. </p>
<p>The same goes for beginning to exercise too, too much too early is detrimental. You cant change a habit overnight and you cant create an entirely new big habit overnight either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally true. I wouldn’t have phrased it that way if they didn’t ask the question like they did. They wanted to know why the milestones were so important, as opposed to just general statements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, I think it's important to discuss both aspects - why something is seen one way, but also why it may be an incomplete perspective on an issue. Your comment answered his question very well, i just wanted to add the caveat in case OP had misconceptions that it is required to go all or nothing when changing vices</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP chose a poor example to illustrate the question. The question is about <em>streaks</em>.</p>
<p>An apples to apples comparison would be a 6-month streak of no fast food VERSUS a 7-month period in which 3 months were no fast food, one month with the same amount of fast food consumption as before this exercise, and then another 3 months with zero fast food. </p>
<p>So the question remains. Why is the former more satisfying than the latter, even if they’re pretty much the same amount of fast food consumption?</p>
<p>I think an explanation is that we see each “good” day as multiplicative rather than additive. We don’t take each day one at a time, except when we’re bad. Then it’s just “let me have a cheat day” and then hope that tomorrow is better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moderation is better than abstinence. Saying &quot;I havent had junk food for a week/month, I can have some tomorrow&quot; is meaningful, it means you are controlling it and are keeping it to a healthy level. However when you have a problem with any type of vice it is difficult to step back into moderation, so it is more effective to completely drop it and avoid temptation altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I didn’t mean to say moderation was not a good thing, just that more general statements don’t quite reveal as much or have the same significance in the context that was being asked about.</p></div>		</li>
