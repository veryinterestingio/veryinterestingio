			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation I've heard generally is like this:</p>
<p>Memories are essentially a neural pathway, a connected group of neurons. When your brain looks for a pathway, it shuts down a bunch of them to make the search more efficient. No need to search the &quot;types of cars&quot; pathways when what you're searching for is an actors name. </p>
<p>When something is on the tip of your tongue, your brain has mistakenly shut down the correct pathway, or part of it. You may be able to get really close to completing the path, but a critical collection of neurons has been shut off for efficiency sake.</p>
<p>When you give up and stop searching, all your neurons get tuned back on like normal. The neurons close to the previously blocked ones are still a bit excited, and they finally connect the full unblocked path and suddenly you remember the thing you were trying to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is, unless you're trying to think of famous movie star Chad Mustang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of memory recollection as a search engine. Each query is encoded in a mesh of data points that are mapped to eachother through a set of conditions, generally this is done via the magnitude of searches of that query. When you put something into google for instance, SEO evaluates the relevance of that search with something called a “website score”, which basically measures how often and long users visit the webpage that contains your search term. </p>
<p>When you recollect information in your mind you give a query to your mind to find relevant webpages which are collections of other memories in your brain associated with that aforementioned query, and “scores” these webpages/collections of memories according to how stimulated your brain becomes when these collections are recollected. Allowing you to ping collections of memories with other memories and rank them by emotional experience.</p>
<p>When you fail to recollect something, you’re essentially just giving the wrong query for that collection of memories in the network of memories that is the internet of your mind, with each part being like its own server that’s encoding, processing, and distributing data. The more specific the query is, the more specific the data collection is, and this can be a problem when we’ve encoded that data collection to a <em>specific</em> query. This is why re-tracing our steps can be useful, because we can find the exact metadata on the collection of data to query it specifically. I.e. googling the <em>exact phrase</em> on a website instead of just the general phrase by using quotation marks or a long verbatim quote.</p>
<p>It gets really interesting when you realize that you, the self, is basically just a memory of memories it’s collected. I.e. if your memory is wiped and replaced so is your identity!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like my subconscious pretty much knows right away whether it remembers something or not. Like when I'm thinking &quot;what was that name again?&quot; my brain right away knows either &quot;oh yeah it's in here somewhere give me a minute&quot; or &quot;Nope going to need more than our memory to find this one&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, usually you know right away if the answer is contained <em>somewhere</em> in your memory. The difficulty is accessing it, and that's a search your subconscious can conduct as a background process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you go into a thrift store to find a very specific item - a light blue fleece with dark sleeves, size medium, without pockets or a hood. Finding it is pretty unlikely. </p>
<p>The next day, you're in a different thrift store, looking for a green t shirt in a wicking material without a logo. Again, no luck. </p>
<p>Every day, you're in thrift stores looking for one very specific thing. The chances of finding it are very low. </p>
<p>But you will routinely find things that you were looking for &quot;just last week&quot; which will seem like such a coincidence. It's actually something like 50x more likely, just by random chance.</p></div>		</li>
