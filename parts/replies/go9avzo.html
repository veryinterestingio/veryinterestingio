			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect. If both pupils are newly dilated after a hit to the head it’s usually too late. One blown pupil can sometimes be saved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>walk and talk normally, and your pupils aren't dilated</p>

<p>wouldn't you only get those symptoms if your trauma is to the back of the head?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats an excellent description of a concussion. I got a concussion playing rugby and I very distinctly remember feeling my brain &quot;slosh&quot; up against my skull. &quot;Rattling around&quot; describes the sensation well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in the context of traumatic brain injury, these symptoms are usually due to a large brain bleed causing a profound alteration in consciousness. so the injury can be anywhere really.</p>
<p>plus the skull, especially the skull base, is rough and sharp. trauma to the brain often causes it to shear against the skull base and cause contusions in multiple places.</p></div>		</li>
