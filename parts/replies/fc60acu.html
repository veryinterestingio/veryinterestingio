<p>I thought 65 cubes for a 12oz-16oz Coke sounded way off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because OP incorrectly assumed a sugar cube is 1g, when they are about 4. There are about 65g of sugar in a 20oz bottle of soft drink, which are supper common in the US. OP was probably looking at the nutrition facts when they had this thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is up to the establishment as it depends on the individual fountain settings. Supposedly McDonalds has somewhat sweeter cola on purpose in order to accommodate for ice melting as you drink. There are presumably other restaurants that try to save money by skimping on syrup. The effect is not huge in either direction, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Coke rep for each restaurant can (and will if called) come in and test each drink in the fountain.  The nozzle is taken out, a little measuring device is attached and they run the tap.  It separates the syrup and water to measure the ratio.  The rep wants it tasting its best as that’s the way it’s designed.  </p>
<p>Another food for thought; ever had mixed feelings about soda out of a gun (bar)?  The syrup is ran through a “cold plate” (metal plate) at the bottom of an ice well.  If there isn’t ice on it, the soda will taste horrible as it doesn’t come out as thin as needed.</p></div>		</li>
