<p>Regular people can boost performance through other stuff like regular exercise, healthy diet and balanced lifestyle (adopting moderate hobbies, socialising with people, etc.)</p>

<p>Which are all things that ADHD makes incredibly hard, as well, so if you take the stimulant and it makes it much easier to do all that stuff, then you're able to claw back some semblance of normalcy.</p>
<p>I recently got put on Vyvanse and I'm now able to go exercise without it feeling like torture, keep my train of thought in conversations, have less anxiety, practice guitar and my diet is way less shit than it has been in the past few years since I'm not stimulating myself with junk food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good for you, honestly that's awsome that youre feeling great. My best advice as someone who's taking ADHD meds, try to not take them on weekends. It keeps your tolerance low and prevents dependency. It feels great to never get tied down fully to the meds and you know you can still be you without them </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested too.  It still takes a helluva lot of effort to force myself to do my homework.  I stay at work until 1030 because I know I can't focus at home to get it done, of course I end up reading Reddit or playing a game on my phone for two hours before I finally can't procrastinate any longer...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it works for me, but everyone can react differently. I think I was on Ritalin as a kid and I didn't like that then, either.</p>
<p>If you don't like how methylphenidate makes you feel, I wouldn't be afraid of seeing if your doc will switch meds once you taper off. </p>
<p>/r/ADHD has some stories about people's experience with different meds. It could be dosage, the meds themselves, or some people may have a different condition that overlaps with the symptoms of ADHD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taking Concerta 36 for several years and JUST switched over to Vyvanse after talking to my doctor over the course of a year about it.  He prescribed 5 doses of Vyvanse and filled my regular script of Concerta, so I could measure the difference.  After my 2nd dose of Vyvanse, I knew I had to switch and it was a world of difference from Concerta.</p>
<p>Concerta worked for me for a while.  Better focus, more productive at work, better at remembering tasks, starting tasks and actually finishing them.  But in the last year or so, Concerta felt more and more like it was draining something from me.  Like it was grinding me out.  I became a bit like a zombie, the positive effects weren't there, constant feeling of being stuck, and my focus on tasks was scattered.  I didn't want to up the dosage because I felt like all of that would just increase and really kill my personality.  In that last year, those <strong>good</strong> habits I created over the last couple years started to crack.  The worst part was for some reason, I was <strong>binge eating</strong> like a mother fucker on Concerta.  I've always worked out, ran, ate healthy, and had proper meals during the day. I got myself down to my goal weight of 190 lbs. But all of a sudden in the last year or so, I was just eating and gained about 20 lbs.  That really messed with my self-worth and I knew something was off.  I've read that Concerta can do that and the formula from the generic changed.</p>
<p>I've been on Vyvanse for about a month now and it's like a new light has gone off in my head.  Was Concerta masking something?  I don't know, but I feel like this how I should be and perhaps how I used to feel.  I've been been much more productive, prepared, caring, and accurate with work at my job.  The focus and resolve is absolute.  I've tackled things in my personal life that I've been putting off like going back to the gym regularly, starting and maintaining a garden with my girlfriend, cleaning up around the house, initiating things, I even started reading a book (I used to be an avid reader), and fixing some of my vintage audio gear.  AND, I stopped binge eating completely (which I read that vyvanse is actually prescribed for as well).</p>
<p>I would just talk to your doctor and research more about Concerta's effects as well as Vyvanse.  Start taking notes on how you feel on Concerta and explain that to your doc.  Do the same once you're on a Vyvanse trial.  Remember, these medicines help you become the change you need.  If something's not working, try something else.  Vyvanse is definitely working for me and I'm happy I switched.  PM me if you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have so far done 2.5mo of treatment. Started at 5mg, increased to 10mg, 15mg, starting 20mg tomorrow - all with 2-3 weeks in between and check-in's with my psychiatrist. </p>
<p>At first, I felt guilty because I was still in denial that I had ADHD. Basically, it was hard for me to admit that all this time I was actually at a &quot;2&quot; for productivity instead of a &quot;7&quot; that was just lazy and always underperforming. I blamed my laziness/stupidity for failing classes, graduating last out of my friends, avoiding e-mails, etc. So taking Adderall felt like I was cheating - going from a &quot;7&quot; to &quot;9.&quot;</p>
<p>But after my diagnosis and accepting the fact that I do need support to be productive on the same level as my peers (I went to an elite private school and now work in tech), I see Adderall and ADHD in a totally different light. Medication has helped me phenomenally, bringing me up from a &quot;2&quot; to a &quot;6&quot; - sometimes I even get those super productive hours of being an &quot;8&quot;! I can finally sit in long meetings listening and retaining information instead of constantly getting distracted. Before it was impossible to work on a task longer than 5min, now I can do tasks for 40-60min. </p>
<p>I hope my experience makes sense. I used to be someone who always shits on rich kids in college popping Adderall during finals. But now I understand how life-changing it can be for people who really do need it in order to surviv and function in a highly competitive, demanding environment like college or corporate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you’re responsible with it you can just take it on days you know you will need to focus.  I sometimes have to audit my peers files. When I do this I use my prescription. If I’m just doing my regular day to day job function that I’ve been doing for 10 years, I don’t need it so I don’t take it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is such a slippery slope though.</p>
<p>For example, I also get the benefits from Ritalin when I work, especially because I suffer from depression and can be quite scatter brained from it. I feel more focused, I am more productive, feel calm and more confident etc.</p>
<p>So at what point am I taking it as a performance enhancer, and at what point as medication?</p>
<p>The poster above writes about &quot;highly competitive&quot; environments - here's the thing, most people suffer from impostor syndrome or sometimes can't focus well. So, especially if taking the drug is based on a self-evaluation of expected productivity, I feel like there's a risk that in the end, everyone starts taking things because we can no longer compete with our now super productive coworkers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. This comment sums up how I felt about my ADHD also. I felt so guilty for taking something that helped me. I felt like I was cheating. Once I came to a better understanding of how much I was affected negatively by ADHD, I started feeling better about taking medication. I'm a much better person because of it, so I'm always glad to hear other people are doing better because of it too!</p></div>		</li>

<p>You see, the problem is not on you or whoever think he can’t function properly. This highly competitive environment is poison. It’s why ie: Adobe push out updates of their softwares continuously while you’re still learning the new features of the past releases. I can pictures coders coding like crazy-fucks all day long on some sort of medication. Rats race at its finest and like rats, people are getting tested with different drugs to see how they react at this amazing new brand society.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk about you but most people with adhd aren’t that challenged. I’d say most normal people operate on an 8-10 while people with ADHD (myself included) operate on a 5-8. From my experience using stimulants I operated on a 9 or 10 and I wasn’t on Addy.</p></div>		</li>
