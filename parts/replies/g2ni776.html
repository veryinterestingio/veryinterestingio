			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't digest <em>some</em> fibers. Soluble fibers (fruits, nuts, legumes, and some veggies) you'll get a slow, moderate source of calories from those carbohydrates, insoluble (veggies, whole grains) you'll get few if any. Both help with feeling full for minimal calories (soluble dissolves in water and digests slowly, creating a lot of bulk with slow, moderate amount of calories, while insoluble adds bulk without adding any/hardly any calories). Both help you get full, both can help with lowering insulin response if you're switching from a simple carb to high-fiber food (white bread to whole grain bread, for example), and both have the added bonus of being connected to reduced incidences of colorectal cancer (which is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the US). Get your fiber folks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's a hormone called ghrelin that is responsible for this. This is why people who fast (most often intermittent fasting, e.g. 16/8) do not get hungry after a while of practicing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't really know what a calorie is. It's not smart enough to count how much sugar and fat you ate and how much energy you're expending to do the math on whether or not you need more food. All it knows is you haven't eaten for 6 hours and your stomach is empty so you should probably eat something now</p>
<p>Also, we evolved at a time when food was scarce. Nowadays we sit on our asses 15 hours a day and can drive to the grocery store in 10 minutes, but for most of human history eating too little was a much bigger concern than eating too much. So generally your body will tell you that any time you <em>can</em> eat, you <em>should</em> eat. If there's space in your stomach fill it up. After all, who knows if you won't catch any deer for another week or if you'll suddenly have to spend a bunch of calories running from a bear</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct asf. Also, one can stretch their stomach by gorging and, when it empties into further down the digestive tract, the hunger sensation is lying to them and telling them that they need more from the feeling of the stomach shrinking back some</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the problem of not wanting to stop eating once you've started. It's often easier to forgo food altogether in a 12 fast than to eat a moderate amount and stop before satiation. </p>
<p>There are ingredients in food that stimulate the sense of hunger and wanting to eat more even if you are full or have had a large meal recently. Eg. Sugar, msg. </p>
<p>For instance if I had a coffee with sugar in it I feel like eating afterwards. If I have a coffee with no sugar then I am content with just the milk protein in the coffee. Chocolate is the same. It is full of fat so it should fill you up but the high sugar content stimulates your taste buds to want more sugar, so i eat the whole family block after saying I'll only eat one or two rows. </p>
<p>Restaurants add msg to encourage you to order more than what you need. Have you ever eaten a vietnamese pork and salad roll? They often have msg in them. Even though the roll is large and would be likely to fill most of your stomach, the msg stimulates your taste buds and leaves you wanting another taste of something salty or savoury.</p>
<p>I think the biological process that is happening with sugar and msg is that they make the salivary glands go into overdrive which mimics a hunger response. So we are tricked by our saliva into thinking we really need to eat this. The extra saliva can trick the stomach into thinking its about to receive food. The swallow response may even start contractions of the upper gut system and produce tummy rumbles on a full stomach, which usually happen when we are hungry. If this hypothesis is true then it may help explain why elderly people who have lost the ability to swallow also lose their appetite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m the opposite. If I have coffee with sugar in it it staves off my appetite for ages. If I’m really busy and don’t want to stop what I’m doing to spend time making a proper meal I’ll just drink some coffee with a teaspoon of sugar and be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because your body went into ketosis - burning fat for fuel. Once you go into ketosis, typical hunger pangs go away for most people. That's why the keto diet is popular. You're not constantly craving food 24/7.</p>
<p>While in ketosis, I sometimes have to remind myself to eat. I don't get hunger pangs, I just get a very gradual decline in energy. The same will happen if I forget to stay hydrated since ketosis makes you pee a lot and you lose things like electrolytes and magnesium.</p></div>		</li>
