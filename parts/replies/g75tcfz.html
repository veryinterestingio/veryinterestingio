<p>Note that the table you linked does not actually use the Richter scale, it uses the Moment Magnitude scale,</p>

<p>I did not actually notice that until you pointed it out.  I am just so used to earthquakes being measured in the Richter scale, and the numbers correlated with numbers I'm used to more significant earthquakes being on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>I also didn't even consider that seismographs could have been a thing then (and had been for over 1500 years, the first one being invented in 142 AD).  Which makes me feel really silly.</p>
<p>Do you happen to know why the switch from Richter to Moment Magnitude?  Is the switch in scales something that's mostly going to be within the scientific community, or is it going to trickle down where news people start referring to earthquakes using that scale?  I pulled up the USGS map for <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/?currentFeatureId=nc73464701&amp;extent=20.75611,-130.16602&amp;extent=52.5897,-59.85352" target="_blank">recent earthquakes</a>, and it lists the magnitude, but I don't see that it's telling me which magnitude scale they're using, or at least not in a way that a lay-person like me can determine.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Richter scale has not been reported or used since the 1970s. That people still refer to the moment magnitude scale (which is what is primarily reported in the US) as the Richter scale is confusing. The Richter scale had a lot of problems. It saturated (i.e. it maxed out at larger magnitudes) and it was really only viable for Southern California earthquakes measured on a particular type of seismometer. </p>
<p>You can tell by the abbreviation. Mw = moment magnitude, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_magnitude_scales#Magnitude_scales" target="_blank">all of these different scales</a> have unique abbreviations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For geologists, but turn on any TV program about earthquakes and it's Richter this and Richter that. </p>
<p>I didn't know it wasn't current until you said that. Interesting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What made southern California earthquakes different than other ones, or is it just that southern California was where all the particular seismometers were?</p>
<p>Interesting that the Richter scale hasn't been used since the 70s, that's older than I am.  But until today, it's the only earthquake scale I knew of.  </p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moment magnitude measures the total energy released seismically, whereas the Richter scale measured shaking intensity 100 km from the epicenter of an earthquake (correcting for local site conditions).</p>
<p>Also, it is nonlinear. An increase of 1 magnitude unit represents 31x more n energy released. Put another way, a Mw 7 earthquake releases 31^4 = 923521 times more energy than a Mw 3 earthquake. And a Mw 8 earthquake would release 31 times more energy than that, and so on. That's why the common myth that little ones are &quot;good&quot; because they release a useful amount of stress is mostly false.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale" target="_blank">moment magnitude scale</a> reports a magnitude based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_moment" target="_blank">seismic moment</a>, i.e. the amount of work (in the physics sense) done by the earthquake, though technically it's a torque measured in newton meters. The seismic moment can be approximated as a product of material properties (the shear modulus), the area of slip during the earthquake, and the average slip within that rupture area. </p>
<p>Like the local magnitude scale (i.e. the Richter scale), it is logarithmic. A magnitude 2 has 10 times the seismic moment of a magnitude 1, a magnitude 3 has 10 times the seismic moment of a magnitude 2 (and thus a magnitude 3 has 100 times the seismic moment of a magnitude 1), and so on. A common misunderstanding is that moment <em>does not equal</em> radiated energy. Radiated seismic energy scales ~10^(1.5) with magnitude, so a Mw 3 has 32 times more radiated energy than a Mw 2 and 1000 times more radiated energy than a Mw 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is just based on wikipedia, but what I found there said that nowadays scientists all use Moment Magnitude, but media tends to use the term Richter scale still. I guess this arose because of the deliberate set-up of Moment Magnitude to have similar values in the middle of its scale.</p>
<p>The Richter scale is essentially a scale that measures the amplitude of shaking recorded on seismographs, adjusted for distance. But this is a very indirect quantity: it depends on the seismograph used, the adjustment for distance is not simple because seismic waves don't fade uniformly over distance, and other technicalities. What seismologists want is a measure of the actual event: moment magnitude does that.</p>
<p>One important limitation of the Richter scale is that it has an upper limit of about 7-8 beyond which it becomes meaningless, because the instrument used to measure the shaking would not record higher (I believe this is about more than just limitations of the instrument, but limitations of the specific quantity being measured by it, but I'm not sure).</p></div>		</li>
