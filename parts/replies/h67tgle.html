			<div class="markdown"><p>This sort of answer is what leads to OP's question. If the universe is expanding in volume like the balloon then there must be space for the balloon to occupy. Your explanation does not answer the question and just saying &quot;it's irrelevant&quot; isn't an answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, the confusion here just stems from misunderstanding the metaphor: in the balloon example, we're looking at a 2 dimensional field. We are ONLY considering the surface of the balloon: the space inside and around the balloon are not part of the metaphor. As a 2 dimensional person on that 2 dimensional field, you would see everything moving away from everything else. And you might ask yourself: where are those dots moving to? And if you were to walk across the surface, looking for its edge, you would find none. Because there is no end to that surface. </p>
<p>The universe is if we take this 2 dimensional metaphor and extrapolate it to 3 dimensions. You'd also view everything moving away and might assume that there is some edge that all this matter is moving toward, but again your assumption would be wrong. No matter which way you go, you'd never reach the end of the universe. You'd just keep traveling forever. There is no edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this analogy is confusing since to me, there's still a whole space (be it a room in a house or the outdoors if the balloon's being inflated outside) that I'm picturing. The dots moving away from each other makes sense but doesn't help me disregard the 'nothingness' beyond this theoretical balloon universe fabric</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is irrelevant in this scenario <em>because</em> it is an analogy. That's why I mentioned that we focus only on the surface of the balloon itself. The <em>fabric</em> of the balloon is stretching, just like the fabric of the universe. We don't really know the geometry of the universe as a whole, so we don't know whether or not there's a &quot;volume&quot; like the inside of the balloon.</p>
<p>For all we know, the universe is everything there is. Therefore, it has nothing it can expand <em>onto</em>. So the &quot;stretching&quot; is more of an intrinsic property of spacetime itself than a consequence of external forces. Except that is a bit more difficult to grasp, hence the (albeit imperfect) analogy.</p>
<p>I guess another analogy would be if we considered everything in the universe is shrinking evenly. For us, it'd look like everything is moving away from us. But the universe at large would still have the same &quot;volume&quot;. This would also be a valid interpretation, since it's the same property and result, but a different frame of reference. In the balloon example, it's the fabric itself that changes size. Relativity is wild :P</p></div>		</li>
