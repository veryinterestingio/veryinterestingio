<p>I recall reading more than a few times that reptiles like pythons and crocodiles can survive on only two or three (admittedly large) meals a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kept a ball python for 16 years. Every October he stopped eating and would start again in May. Barely lost any weight during the time. It was pretty wild, and I still tried feeding him every few weeks. My caging was thermostatically controlled, and humidity was monitored. Nothing changed expect for his prey drive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>even tinier bugs.</p>
<p>It's like in that Peter Pan film with Robin Williams, where all the kids are lined up biggest to smallest and Peter Pan says that each kid needs to protect the smaller kids, and the smallest kid says &quot;who do I protect&quot; and Peter Pan says &quot;little bugs&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The movie is Hook.
Robin Williams as Pan, Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, Gwyneth Paltrow as Young Wendy Darling, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, and Glenn Close was the guy (Gutless) they put in the Boo Box towards the beginning of the Movie..
I saw this movie over 300 times over the course of 3 years while working at a movie rental store, I love this movie.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Detritus, aka fancy word for dust or dirt. Things like the roughly million skin scales that the average human sheds everyday. Microscopic fragments of food particles, plant matter, or microorganisms also fit the bill. </p>
<p>Actually now I wonder if they mistakenly ingest microplastics, too. From a quick google search it seems to be a thing in small aquatic species, but I couldn't find any info on terrestrial ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an awful lot of tiny bugs in the world. Many of them so tiny that you can't see them. Sometimes the predator is big enough that you can see it but its prey is too small. So it seems like the spider is surviving without anything to eat, but in reality there's plenty of prey all over the place. Those tiny bugs in turn survive by eating hair or anything else organic that they can find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can eat creatures larger than them. If it gets stuck in the web, the spiders have the advantage and can have a nice meal on a tiny gnat or whatever. Plus, as I said, water.</p></div>		</li>
