<p>This right here. I wish someone would have explained that to me in school.   </p>
<p>Also adding that wood already contains some liquid in the form of water and sugars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sugars are not liquid.
Wood is made up of a large percentage of polymerized sugar aka cellulose.
Cellulose is a carbohydrate.</p>
<p>Phase change and chemical change are two completely different things. </p>
<p>Many substances will burn before changing phases as they are too entangled or cross-linked to allow free flowing movement before the heat is high enough to begin the chemical reaction of oxidation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking this comment to also say that things need not transition from solid to liquid to gas or vice-versa. A change of phase from solid to gas or gas to solid is possible, it's called sublimation (from solid to gas) and desublimation when it's the other way around</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) is a common example of sublimation at room temperature.  You can get it to be a liquid under high pressure, but when you usually see it it sublimates from solid to gas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>very literally. you explicitly heat the wood in a low oxygen environment to get rid of the water and other things so that the only thing left is the underlying wood carbon. </p>
<p>Then, later, you can use the charcoal to make a normal fire, with oxygen, that burns nice and hot with very little smoke and stuff. Like when you want to cook your food and not coat it with vaporized bits of sap and bug bits and whatever else might have been on your wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, that's how ancient people made charcoal, and one way it's still made. If you &quot;burn&quot; wood in a low oxygen environment, it becomes charcoal; this was accomplished in the past but burying wood and heating it, I believe, or placing it in a sealed vessel; its not a true vacuum, ofc, but it can't get enough oxygen to properly burn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since I was wondering and didn't see the answer:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>At normal atmospheric pressure, carbon does not melt when heated, it sublimes. i.e. it undergoes a phase change directly from solid to gas. If the pressure is increased to 10 atmospheres carbon (graphite) is observed to melt at 3550 Â°C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about wood is that it's a bunch of different elements.  As you heat it up, it carbonizes (a bunch of the more volatile elements get driven off and become gas).  If you are left with mostly carbon, you can heat that up until it evaporates or becomes liquid (if under pressure), but carbon has the highest melting point of any element.  You are a long way from wood by then.</p></div>		</li>
