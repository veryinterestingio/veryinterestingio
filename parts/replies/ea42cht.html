His earlobe fell in the deep
Someone reached in and grabbed it

We were at the beach
Everybody had matching towels
Somebody went under a dock
And there they saw a rock
It wasn't a rock
It was a rock monster

Motion in the ocean
His air hose broke
Lots of trouble
Lots of bubble
He was in a jam

Let's rock!

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s very important to note that the chemistry for carbon based life occurring in liquid water allows for far more complexity and abundance of that complexity in cosmic chemistry than any other chemical process.</p>
<p>So while carbon based life and liquid water are not the only basis for life, and you could do silicone based life in sulfuric acid, like found on Venus. Life sould be hundreds of thousands of times less likely to occur on Venus than on Earth simply because molecules have less opportunities to achieve complexity. Beyond that any other chemical basis for life would be more than millions of times less likely to occur due to the difficulty in achieving complexity.</p>
<p>There could be life based on other processes we don’t know, but from what we do know life is very unlikely to exist outside the Goldilocks zone, simply due to lack of opportunity for complex chemical processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel that even if liquid water weren't a strict requirement, the &quot;goldilocks zone&quot; allows for most other possible life solvents to be liquid as well. There is also a kinetics issue. I cannot imagine any kind of life which doesn't utilize polymeric macromolecules, and these can decompose at high temperatures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we say for sure that life would require those things though? It’s way outside my knowledge level, but isn’t everything we know about the requirements for life based on the life we can observe? Would that mean that we can’t make objective statements about what does and doesn’t need?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If so, there seems to be the possibility of even more basis of life... maybe.</p>
<p>Edit: quick search seems to indicate it has yet to be replicated, so... also maybe not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The molecule was carbon based but able to use arsenic instead of phosphorus.</p>
<p>Arsenic generally substitutes for phosphorus which is what makes it toxic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk nothing about anything, but don’t the elements have different properties at higher/lower pressures/temps? Could something something valence electrons and something something change the way the chains are linked together to form life? Or maybe some type of rock-plant that “breathes” the atmosphere around it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the idea of a rock organism is that it doesn't have a way to move stuff around in itself. Liquids allow for systems that carry molecules around in the body and that's pretty important. Even if it could, the rock would need a way to assimilate outside materials to grow its structures and it would be hard for a organism with 0 liquids to develop means of moving around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many of these lifeforms – such as bacteria and archaea – are still living happily without oxygen today. They thrive in places on Earth that have little oxygen, for example in mud banks and near geothermal vents. Instead of passing electrons to oxygen, some of these creatures can pass on their electrons to metals like iron, meaning that they effectively conduct electricity. Others can &quot;breathe&quot; sulphur or even hydrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But crucially for this question, even those weird forms of Earth life rely on liquid water to exist.  The Goldilocks habitability idea makes a working assumption that all life requires liquid water.  That may turn out not to be true, but it is true for every kind of life on Earth no matter how weird its biochemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am more or less an expert on this, due to having watched a couple of TV documentaries on this subject. One of them was dedicated to this subject, what would life look like in other worlds. Don't remember all that much, but it was leaning against the conclusion that it would probably not be all that different. One of the arguments made was that the eye supposedly has develop (at least) six times in Earth history, independent of one another.  This was seen as supporting a notion that there are logical and useful ways for different elements to develop in living creatures. This is extremely thin, I know, but it would be really interesting to hear from real experts.</p>
<p>I also vaguely remember Neil DeGrasse Tyson touching upon this in the Cosmos series, when he mentions that the genes that allow the metabolization of sugars are the same in every living thing that does it, from trees to mammals. Although, we don't know if we one day we will encounter life processes that are entirely different.</p></div>		</li>
