			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it works its way in.  The environment is so cold that the moment a droplet stops moving it freezes.  Go look at a freezing stream and you'll see ice starting on the tops of rocks then expanding outwards until it joins up.  In slow moving large rivers, or if it is cold enough even still open ocean, you'll get a &quot;greasy&quot; like appearance as small bits of ice start to appear.  They act like seed ice for growth and will expand until they join up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would happen if the water gets supercooled - the water drops below freezing, maybe in the stream, maybe on the way down - but can't freeze because there is nowhere for the ice to start forming, in clean, steadily moving water over smooth surfaces.</p>
<p>When the slow moving, supercooled water is agitated, such as by hitting a surface, of it touches other ice, it then freezes.</p>
<p>More simply, sometimes it is just that water becomes slow moving when it hits a surface, drop-by-drop. The splashes of the drop are small enough to freeze, or a film of water moving over the surface is thin enough to freeze. This causes the ice version of a stalagmite, slowly growing upward as water drops onto it.</p></div>		</li>
