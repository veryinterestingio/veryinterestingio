			<div class="markdown"><p>Just read the article posted yesterday on the nature of reality and how some scientists view the universe as a manifestation of the underlying mathematics. Basically: say you're playing a VR game. If you want to know what the rock at your feet is made of, it wouldn't make sense to talk about the pixels, and whether those pixels were made of smaller pixels. What would make sense is to envision the computer code, which could be expressed mathematically. The reality would be the lines of code that create the &quot;universe&quot; you are in. Likewise a quark is a mathematical expression. It has values (spin, charge).
Not entirely analogous but it helps me view it. </p>
<p>EDIT: Article is in Scientific American. Thanks to one astute editor below for pointing me to Max Tegmark.

Although it’s not a perfect analogy I think it’s a great little snippet to use if you ever find yourself like having a conversation about the universe etc. it’s a pretty elegant little framework</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is the ONLY analogy. The world as you percieve it, is only there in that way because YOU percieve it that way. There is no color &quot;red&quot;, your brain makes that up for you. There is no liquid  or frozen water, it is just how all those little things relate to each other. All our perception is nothing than interpretation. The logic of numbers and variables is the only thing that exists in the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is more or less how it does work in real life. At the quantum level you aren’t really talking about discrete entities anymore, but rather overlapping fields (math) of differing strength that all interact via a quantum ‘foam’ that makes up space itself. The interaction of those fields creates forces that all scale up and give ‘physicality’ to things at large scales. The neat interpretation of this is that no body really exists except as a massive collection of sentient math in a discrete space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, considering mathematics is literally an invention we created to describe our universe it's rather silly to proclaim that everything we know so far can be described by it. It's not like math is something we found laying around and just so happens to be really good at explaining things. It is our explanation, our description, our way of understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently reading the Three Body Problem series. A major theme is that another civilization has managed to block our advancement in theoretical physics, so that we haven't continued to advance our fundamental knowledge of the universe, which could then be applied to advanced technologies. (spoiler: In the narrative, we still managed to advance quite far in tech, fully developing on existing theory and methods, which is cool to think of how far we can get with our existing tech level, but we never made that next great leap.) It was done because it would take 450 years for them to get here to go to war, and looking at the exponential speed our tech advancement into the 21st, in 450 years we may have advanced to a stage where we could oppose them. I'm at a point in the story where after 200 years we have gone quite far, but like our computers may be way faster, but are still based on traditional architecture, and we haven't advanced much in materials science, propulsion, energy, but just used what we already knew to it's maximum, and it's both absolutely amazing to imagine this seemingly advanced human civilization, and it's not nearly enough to stand a chance against a type II civilization. I never gave our advancement in the fundamental understanding of the universe much thought, nor just how much we know now that we haven't yet mastered or applied universally. It's fascinating, that's for sure. It puts new meaning to the idea that the future is here but not evenly distributed. Eventually, however, we will have to make fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe to truly get to the next level as a civilization. That part is not fiction.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a experimental particle physicist and I don't like your reasons. </p>
<p>For one, it is not really assumed that quarks are the smallest. There are models that hypothesize about the building blocks of quarks, just as there are models where quarks are fundamental particles. </p>
<p>The standard model, the current state of the art model of particles, treats quarks as fundamental particles. In that sense, it is assumed, but physicists know the standard model is just an approximation, and no physicists would say that quarks are point particles or fundamental simply because our current best model treats them that way. </p>
<p>Moving on, we model them that way because we cannot probe deep enough to see any hypothetical structure inside the quarks. But we do not probe/discover particles with microscopes. You can't see a meson with a microscope, but we know what they are made of. Nor does confinement prevent probing the inside of quarks. If anyone is interested I can write up how particles are discovered and studied, but it isn't with microscopes, and it has never been. So I am not sure what you mean by not being able to see them &quot;puts a damper on things&quot;. </p>
<p>This is also not really correct:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, our understanding of what goes on at subatomic levels is guessed upon using our observations and tests in our macroscale world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use various high energy processes to probe the microscopic world. That is why particle physics is often intertwined with &quot;high energy physics&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is supposed to be a summary, a distinct explanation of mechanics and complex mathematics shortened, converted into layman and explained using terms people are familiar with. Of course the finer details are going to be lost. Factually, I haven't said anything wrong, or nothing that can't be understood through context.</p>
<p>If I was going to sit here and detail every single thing (as one should expect from someone who does this daily), we'd be here all day. </p>
<p>Yes, small does not equal mass, tier does not explain the difference between mesons and baryons, yes, tests on the macroscopic scale does not directly state &quot;particle colliders&quot;, but it does infer we do tests on our level, using particles from the subatomic level. Small does give someone the idea that is necessary to understand fundamental matter. </p>
<p>I can't be both super specific and super layman without fat cutting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've said wrong things. </p>
<p>e.g. Color confinement doesn't prevent probing quark structure. You just need more energy. </p>
<p>Also &quot;viewing&quot; quarks is not the issue. </p>
<p>I don't want to be rude, really, I love that you are explaining things, but IDK, that rubs the wrong way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with Fmeson, it seems like you just watched a youtube video</p>
<p>In ELI5 terms: Quarks are not the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle" target="_blank">fundamental particles</a>, there are bosons, leptons, quarks, photons etc. that all exist and we do not know what other parts they are made of.  Nobody assumes that they are not made of other even smaller parts, because that would be wholly ignorant, our technology at this time is just not able to determine the make-up of these fundamental particles.</p>
<p>You get into reasons that go deeper than an ELI5 answer, but those reasons simplify the problem to the extent that they are wrong, as the guy says below me.</p>
<p>You're whole rational in 2 is just an assault on the current paradigm, which I just consider a cheap shot as the whole question would change if the paradigm was wrong.</p></div>		</li>
