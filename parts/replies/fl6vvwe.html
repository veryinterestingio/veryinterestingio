			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about the Banach-Tarksi paradox. The paradox is that you could make duplicates of equal size to the original by separating the data sets by direction. Basically that the sum of all parts is greater than the whole. However i was shown a 3-dimensional visual and in that context i don't believe the paradox would hold true because of the nature of up/down/left/right requires a frame of reference. There by ruining the methodology that allows the paradox to occur. I was wondering if you could explain whether or not I'm correct in my thinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Banach Tarski absolutely holds with a frame of reference, that is after all, all that co ordinates systems are!</p>
<p>The gist of banach tarski is thst certain infinite chains of transformations don't preserve volume, it has no basis in the real world because things aren't infinitely divisable in reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree very much with the idea that infinite chains of transformations aren't possible in the real world. To get a feel for how weird infinity is, just take the simple example of 0/0. It is equal to absolutely anything you want by just taking the limit in a different way. This is not too far from the kind of ideas that are present with Banach Tarski (or at least how I think about them).</p></div>		</li>
