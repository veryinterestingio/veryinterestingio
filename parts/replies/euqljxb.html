			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that, power control on the devices is something almost necessary for everyone as it tries to make sure that all signals that get to the antenna have a similar power. Imagine that a phone is 100 feet away, and the power it sends is strong enough to reach the antenna but a laptop is right next to the antenna and basically &quot;shouting&quot; at it. The more &quot;shouters&quot; there are, the harder it is to hear the whisper of the phone. Most wireless systems (and that includes LTE and such) will tell the nearby or powerful senders to lower their signal so the antenna can hear everyone equally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wifi antennas and such are omnidirectional, what you say doesn't make sense because the router doesn't change power depending on what device it's trying to talk to, as all devices receive the same exact signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. You can find the antenna of the modern LTE networks pretty easily, and your phone works just fine right next to them, as well as anywhere within the broadcast range which usually reaches at least 10 miles. This is all at one transmission power level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People assume that the best way to get their wifi to work better is to boost the power. Really, the best way is to get everyone around you, including yourself, to lower your power.  </p>
<p>Imagine you're in a room with a bunch of other people. Everyone is talking rather loudly, so nobody can hear. Everyone keeps talking louder, so they can have a conversation. Pretty soon, everyone has to yell just to hear themselves. If everyone whispered, you'd be able to have a conversation.  That's the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also get people to stop bonding channels in 2.4 (or entirely tbh, it's over kill for 99% of use cases). It destroys the spectrum and limits the air time for everyone.</p>
<p>It's so frustrating seeing some ISPs installing routers that come default to 80MHz or even 160MHz channel widths in 5GHz. It's unnecessary and makes the WiFi for the whole neighbourhood worse. Then people who know just enough to be dangerous assume that's the deal setup and they copy it on 2.4 (why do manufacturers let you choose channels other than 1, 6, 11 on consumer devices, let alone bonding channels in 2.4?) and suddenly the 2. 4 becomes more unusable than it was to start with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It would potentially cause problems elsewhere. And really if your too far for a reasonable connection, or if there’s interference of any kind then extra power wouldn’t even do anything</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to assume no.</p>
<p>My old work laptop had an aircard i would have to manually connect to before signing into our VPN.</p>
<p>If I go into a tunnel the aircard is working extra hard to get that signal. We would regularly burn out our aircards going through a mile long tunnel.</p>
<p>Im going to GUESS its similar to that. To leave it going on full power would just burn out the hardware.</p>
<p>Is this a good educated guess anyone who knows anything?</p></div>		</li>
