			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc, some labs now have diamond anvils capable of pressures on the order of terapascal to investigate processes on planets with pressure regimes greater than Earth, check out yingwei fei at the Carnegie Institute in DC.</p>
<p>Edit: Iirc this is how scientists confirmed that there is a mineral in the Earth called bridgmanite, which we cannot observe (directly or naturally), that actually exists. Or at least this is related.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Found the talk I saw on this. 1.25 TPa achieved. <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/486297" target="_blank">https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/486297</a></p>
<p>Edit 3: Thanks u/CrustalTrudger for the mention. The talk on these diamond anvils was really fascinating. As you said, these experiments are really important for validating planetary models of mineral changes, convection, melting, and more, and as someone working in experimental rock physics, this technology has made some great strides recently and is rather impressive.</p>
<p>Edit 4: Apparently the original confirmation of how bridgmanite forms was from a meteorite, which from asteroid impacts, can reach high temperature and pressure (24GPa) like that deep in the Earth (specifically bridgmanite forms at depths greater than 660km). Bridgmanite was found in a meteorite (source <a href="https://www.anl.gov/article/earths-most-abundant-mineral-finally-has-a-name" target="_blank">https://www.anl.gov/article/earths-most-abundant-mineral-finally-has-a-name</a>) and makes up 38% of the Earth. I believe these diamond anvil experiments, maybe the one I sourced above, have formed synthetic bridgmanite.</p>
<p>Edit 5: u/mfb- corrected my first post, it is not diamond anvil cells that reach 1.25 TPa but are shockwave experiments. The diamond anvil experiments in the study I sourced reach 40 GPa and 3000K, which is quite high temperature. The shockwave experiments did reach over 1 TPa and still offer insight into planetary materials and processes, but I am not sure if they are analogous in their results to diamond anvil cell experiments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are indeed super important for validating so many of the crucial values needed for a variety of simulations. One of my first classes in grad school (a depressingly long time ago) was on rheology and it was really eye opening as to how much was really underpinned by these high pressure experimental results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This probably goes way beyond eli5, but I'm pretty interested, how do things like this help us understand the composition of areas deep inside Earth? I looked up bridgmanite on wiki and there's a pretty precise answer of how abundant it is in the mantle. I don't understand what exactly you can even model to figure out what's way down there. The source on wiki is paywalped and my knowledge of this area basically ends at knowing that there is a layer called the mantle anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone in grad school now, I can only look back at papers from long ago and think about how far technology and science has come, and hope to contribute. Indeed, so much of mineral physics, rheology and such, are underpinned by results from high T-P experiments.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a shock wave as far as I understand, not a static pressure in a diamond anvil cell.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. It would seem like the traditional diamond anvil experiments in the talk I sourced mentions 40 GPa but 3000k, so very high T. I will amend my original comment. Another DAC experiment, no T specified in the abstract, reached 200 GPa and I think some may go higher but not 1 TPa. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with DACs in my masters and we easily reached 100 GPa. Our goal wasn't the highest pressure possible so we didn't chase higher pressures but it's entirely possible to go much higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like cool work. My experimental studies are done using piston cylinder or similar apparatuses, so 1 GPa, only about 1000 degree celsius, so upper mantle.
I think 100s of GPa are feasible using diamond anvil. I didn't save sources but shockwave experiments can go higher apparently but I am not sure if they offer the same insight as diamond anvil cell experiments. Are you familiar with shockwave experiments much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For pure carbon, about 10 GPa (100,000 atmospheres or 300 km depth.)  For the mix of minerals that typically host diamonds, quite a bit less (50,000 atmospheres, 150 km or so)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm guessing this question will be outside your field of study, but I'll ask it anyway.  If we are ever able to better manufacture diamond thin films without issues like faceting and then use it as a high temperature semiconductor for a Venus probe, how stable would it be?   I know it's not thermodynamically stable at STP but I'm not really sure of just how big of a kinetic barrier there is, and would it be a significant issue at Venus' 737 K and 9.2 MPa surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to precious stones, synthetic and created are two different terms.  Synthetic is anything that can approximate the visual appearance of a stone, and can even be glass or polymer.  Created means that the stone was formed in a lab and is chemically identical to a natural stone.  There are also treated diamonds that are heated or whatever to change their color; that's how LeVian does the whole <a href="https://www.levian.com/Content/Images/ChocolateTimeline/img5.png" target="_blank">chocolate diamond</a> thing to my understanding.  I'm not GIA certified, fyi, but I have been in the industry of putting jewelry together for a few years now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physicist-but-non-geologist here. How do you calibrate a diamond anvil cell operating at terapascal pressures? I imagine that you must use a laser to obtain emission lines of (something) and use a theoretical model of how those would shift under pressure. Do we have an expert here who can enlighten (!) me on how this is really done? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper linked doesn't use a diamond anvil cell for the highest pressures - those are done with pulsed power on the Sandia Z Machine. So that's shock compression instead of static compression which is a faster timescale.</p>
<p>You can use spectroscopy with DACs, x-ray diffraction is another common diagnostic technique. For shock compression, we commonly use interferometry to measure how fast things are moving, and we can calculate pressure from that. </p>
<p>(I'm a high-pressure physicist but I work with geologist who use DACs)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had questions about these shockwave experiments (I run piston cylinder experiments but nothing like the diamond anvil cell or shockwave tech, I am only passingly familiar with the high T and P studies). Are the phases produced using shockwave experiments comparable to those produced using diamond anvil cells? Are they more short-lived? Is the analysis done post mortem or in situ? I am trying to gather how they are different besides the physics/methodology in how they are performed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert in diamond anvil experiments, but have worked with a variety of other experimental petrology techniques. In general we produce a calibration curve based on a phase which transforms at a known pressure and temperature. Ultra high pressure experiments are often done in a synchrotron to observe the phase transitions.</p></div>		</li>
