			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. I got the first dose and ended up catching covid 5 days later. I canceled my second dose as the local health department told me to wait 90 days. I just recently read on CDC, they recommend you wait 90 days if you had a treatment, which I didn’t. Shoot though I already canceled my appointment so this makes me worry less as i try to reschedule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edit: I saw all this, and then read/remember that when asked Pfizer said they hadn’t tested this and couldn’t trust it. So why does the study say they did trust it? I can’t keep up anymore - trying to get more informed just gives me different answers and stresses me out.</strong></p>
<p>I read this and the actual study in the Lancet, and I have to say, I feel a lot better about our vaccine timelines now (although I’m not sure why this is 60 when the news coverage of the vaccine touted 90%). From The Lancet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In participants who received two standard doses, efficacy against primary symptomatic COVID-19 was consistent in both the UK (60·3% efficacy) and Brazil (64·2% efficacy), indicating these results are generalisable across two diverse settings with different timings for the booster dose (with most participants in the UK receiving the booster dose more than 12 weeks after the first dose and most participants in Brazil receiving their second dose within 6 weeks of the first). Exploratory subgroup analyses included at the request of reviewers and editors also showed no significant difference in efficacy estimates when comparing those with a short time window between doses (&lt;6 weeks) and those with longer (≥6 weeks), although further detailed exploration of the timing of doses might be warranted.</p>
