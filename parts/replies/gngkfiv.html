			<div class="markdown"><p>If the cavity has already formed, it is not reversible. Therefore your dentist will advise you to go for a filling. It was discovered that fluoride helps to redeposit calcium on the tooth, and if the cavity is very very small, fluoride application or use of fluoridated toothpaste may reverse it, but only if it's very small (if you can feel or see the cavity, it's already too late)</p>
<p>If you have a good dental hygiene, a pre-cavity will remain as it is, and will not progress futher, but will not heal either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I see. I was under the impression it was more reversible than it is, but I might be thinking of the fluoride (and overestimating its effectiveness).</p></div>		</li>
