			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why Intel made fun of AMD for their &quot;chiplet&quot; designs just being &quot;gluing CPUs together,&quot; but the joke ended up being on them when in everything except the very top end of consumer CPUs strictly for the purpose of gaming, AMD's chiplets started blowing Intel out of the water. The only place Intel has an advantage right now is that the i9-9900k is about 5% faster than the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X in gaming applications because the i9 has decently higher clock speeds (I'm not going to compare the i9 to a 3950X since that guy is $250 more than the i9, which would be like comparing an i3 to a Ryzen 7). In literally every other application and price point, the Ryzens destroy everything Intel has to offer.</p>
<p>Now, that said, Intel could very easily strike back when they get 10nm production finally online.</p></div>		</li>
