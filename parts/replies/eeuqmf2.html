			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a hospital and this is referred to as “expressive aphasia.” We see it most commonly in stroke patients.<br />
If your patient suddenly starts speaking in “word salad” it sets off the OHSHIT alarm because just minutes could be the difference between minor memory problems and having to be fed/bathed for the rest of your life.<br />
Make this known if you ever stay in a hospital, please.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I notice I tend to invert certain data points at time.  Like if I have two numbers in my head in my head when it's time to verbalize that they may come out backwards.  And I'll be showing with my hands 5 fingers but I might say the second number 9 that's in my head.  Not really sure if that's dyslexia, I just always assumed so.</p></div>		</li>
