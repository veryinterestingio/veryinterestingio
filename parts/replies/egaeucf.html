<p>There are several things that can happen, that depend on the star's mass and composition, and each of <em>those</em> passes through many distinct stages before its ultimate end.</p>
<p>A star can heat up, cool down, swell, shrink, pulsate, lose its atmosphere, explode, implode, and many other things besides. Once the initial main-sequence hydrogen burning equilibrium is over, everything after that fluctuates wildly.</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>Edgar Frog:</strong> I think I should warn you all, when a vampire bites it, it's never a pretty sight. No two bloodsuckers go the same way. Some yell and scream, some go quietly, some explode, some implode, but all will try to take you with them.</p>
<p>I believe this all applies to celestial objects, too. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don‚Äôt know, my astronomy and cosmology professors made stellar evolution seem not too complicated.</p>
<p>What happens after a star leaves main sequence:
SM=solar mass</p>
<p>&lt;1Sm= Red dwarf</p>
<p>4sm= white dwarf</p>
<p>8sm=supernova</p>
<p>13sm=neutron star </p>
<p>15+sm=black hole</p>
<p>(It‚Äôs been like 5+ years, so might not be exact)</p>
<p>And composition doesn‚Äôt matter because they all fuse up to a certain point and either they overcome degeneracy pressure and collapse further, they don‚Äôt and supernova, or it becomes a dwarf. Everything depends on mass only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as it runs out of the hydrogen, it starts to fuse the hydrogen into heavier elements, assuming it is heavy enough. Iirc, our sun isn‚Äôt big enough to get past hydrogen, the ultimate stopping point is iron. Where at a certain point, the gravity of the mass of iron overcomes the amount of force given by heat and energy, making the star collapse onto itself. The mass of the star does not change with the iron, but the internal pressure from energy drops, as fusion of heavier elements creates less energy. Until this stage, the star will indeed swell above its original size.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravity of the iron is the same as the gravity of the elements used to make it. The star collapses because fusing iron is the point where fusion takes more energy than it outputs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As hydrogen ‚Äúburns‚Äù - using the language astronomers use - helium builds up in the core. This causes hydrogen burning to occur in a thin shell around the core, which constantly gets bigger. Complicated thermodynamics causes the star to expand in radius and cool off at the surface as this occurs. This forms a red giant. </p>
<p>If the star is massive enough, helium begins to fuse in the core, generating a bunch of heat and causing the star to contract and heat up again. Then carbon (if I remember right) builds up as helium and hydrogen both burn in shells. The star thus expands again. </p>
<p>This continues until the star reaches a point where it‚Äôs not massive enough to fuse more heavier stuff in the core. Most stars don‚Äôt go beyond hydrogen burning, and very few go beyond helium burning. </p>
<p>To the community: it‚Äôs been a couple years since I took a stars class. Please correct me if I messed up. üôÇ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars can fuse all the way up to approximately atomic mass 58 or 60 on the periodic table (around Iron). The binding energy per nucleon chart shows where fusion will stop. <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/117150/peaks-in-binding-energy-per-nucleon" target="_blank">https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/117150/peaks-in-binding-energy-per-nucleon</a></p>
<p>Basically the star will fuse as long as fusion releases energy, provided the star is massive enough. Once the elements get heavy enough, fusion no longer releases energy, it costs energy. And that's the end of fusion in a star. You can have a star that is fusing Hydrogen, or Helium, or even heavier elements - up to approximately Iron.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately yes, this is how it ends. The universe cannot sustain itself forever, as stars continue to burn hydrogen into heavier elements. Eventually there won't be enough hydrogen for stars like ours, and after that even the heavier stars will go dark. This is essentially the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe" target="_blank">heat death of the universe</a>, where all has come into thermodynamic equilibrium. </p>
<p>Luckily we've got a lot of time. The universe, at 13.8 billion yrs, is relatively young. I believe we won't have to worry about the universe going dark until a few 100 billion years. Plenty of time to come up with a solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What, if anything, can humanity(or whatever our descendants become) do to survive during and after  the heat death phase? I've heard that black holes can sustain us like Stars do now for many trillions of years after the heat death of the universe. Then when black holes evaporate,  do we have still have any chances left?</p>
<p>One of my very sci-fi ish theories is that since whatever created the circumstances of my birth may occur again in the future, I'll be born again after I die. Of course I won't remember any of it, but still. I sometimes think if I'll wake up when the universe is much, much older and billions of years into the future after I die</p>
<p>Also, if parallel universes in whatever form exists, there are still more chances that I'll experience life again. It'll certainly be different, perhaps a different gravitational constant or speed of light.</p>
<p>Essentially I'm going to be living through endlessly, over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Sorry I was bored and just felt like writing up some sci-fi stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not any more. The first generation of stars (called population iii) were composed solely of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of slightly heavier elements like lithium. The first heavy elements were fused in their cores, but they burned out fast and scattered those heavy elements across the cosmos. These days all stars have some amount of contamination; the newer the star, the more heavy elements it was born with. </p>
<p>As for your second question, refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future" target="_blank">the greatest page on wikipedia</a>. The answer varies based on certain unproven decays, but one possible future has all matter eventually becoming giant iron spheres called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_star" target="_blank">iron stars</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a star is sufficiently large enough it will fuse all the way up to iron. If you could take apart a start you would see its layered like an onion.
