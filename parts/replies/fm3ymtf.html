			<div class="markdown"><p>also a conscious person will generally try hold on and stay as close to your chest/back as possible which helps. Easy way to demonstrate this effect is pick something up. It doesn't have to be super heavy but it has to be something that has some weight (aka not a sheet of paper, but something like a desk chair is fine) using both hands pick it up and hold it close to your chest. It may be awkward but it isn't problematic to hold for a few seconds or minutes. Now hold it as far away from your body as you can and notice the difference. (this is the extreme example but you get the idea)</p></div>		</li>
