			<div class="markdown"><p>We can and do artificially create the correct conditions for a wide variety of previously unknown chemistry every single day.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is in the form of changing the pressure, temperature, or the key components of the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Sometimes this is in the form of changing the relative concentrations of solvents, reactants, acids/bases, maybe use of radiation or electrochemistry.</p>
<p>But it is highly unlikely that we are on the edge of a paradigm shift as large as &quot;before this, there was no fire, after this, there was fire&quot;, because as humans we are able to create and study these conditions and carry our understanding forward to speculate on new conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There could be plenty of strange conditions which could be found on other worlds we haven't really encountered much. Perhaps some really funny things happen in a room of gaseous fluoride that'd be really obvious to aliens on a hot fluoride rich world but which we're unlikely to encounter. </p>
<p>Yes, maybe our chemists will discover the same reaction, but constrained in small lab environments we would probably never gain a cultural understanding or appreciation of it. We might see the energy released, but we would miss the 'campfire' or 'forest fire' equivalents the aliens appreciate</p></div>		</li>
