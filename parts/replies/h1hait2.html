			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. The point is to perceive the difference at that level. Imagine trying to tell the difference between 25 millionths and 100 millionths of a paperclip.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if you had 200 milligrams you could kill 66 people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if there's such an incredibly tight margin, how is it in any way feasible for dealers to cut their supply with fentanyl? too little basically doesn't save you money at all, but even a hair too much kills people. i just don't see the benefit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not so much that the margins are tighter than other opioids (but it could be somewhat, IDK), but that the raw amount of material per dose is so small. Even if heroin and fentanyl were each deadly at 10x the normal dose, say, it’s still much harder to accurately measure out a dose of fentanyl when a single dose is like one grain of sand’s worth as compared to a small pile of powder. And if you’re trying to cut a large batch of heroin with fentanyl, it’s hard to make sure it’s mixed so thoroughly that each tablespoon of the heroin, say, has one grain of sand of fentanyl in it, and not 5 or ten while others have zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure, but my question is more why bother using fentanyl (and cutting only a couple grains per batch) instead of something where you could cut with a significantly higher portion and get much more of a value out of it</p></div>		</li>
