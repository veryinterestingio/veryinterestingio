			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of that is being raised on a high sugar/fat/salt diet and eating poorly prepared veggies, you can actually train your palate towards the bad for you foods. I made a major transition in my diet about 15 years ago and legit now salt tastes saltier to me and sugar tastes sweeter because I'm not used to overloading my system with it. You have to kinda deprogram the high tolerance. </p>
<p>But really I think the biggest thing is poorly cooked veggies, I personally think vegetables are heavenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah a lot of people who claim to hate vegetables were victim to their parents who prepared them the good ol' fashioned boomer way - boiled to death from a can with zero seasonings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree with this. Absolute omnivore here, my favorite food is a perfect steak-- wagyu, dry aged, koji aged-- you can't beat it. I only CRAVE veggies though. If you're looking to step your game up, Jose Andres book Vegetables Unleashed is great for thinking about veggies and cooking them differently. You may not like the recipes, but it's an essential book in my opinion. Perhaps even more valuable than that, the Flavor Bible, a compendium of different foods, flavors, herbs and spices and their affinity toward other foods. There are no recipes, but if you aren't good at seasoning, you can practice with this books guidance. Consider how we prepare meats, we marinate them, slow cook them, perform precise high heat sears, spend lots of time considering how to season them... How much time do you spend preparing or considering how to season your veggies? Do you spend an hour, sometimes two or three preparing them? If not then you haven't unlocked their potential and what's more you become so much better at cooking EVERYTHING by learning to prepare VEGGIES. I spend eight weeks at a time making large batches of black garlic, which I almost use exclusively in place of normal garlic. I ferment fruits and veggies which takes days, and I am always trying to think of new ways to use them. They're prettier on the plate and add so much more complexity and diversity to a meal. Rant over lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^^ this. I grew up in an Indian household where veggies were traditionally cooked to mush with a lot of oil. I grew up thinking I hated veggies. lo and behold my surprise when I’m complaining that the stir fry bag didn’t come with enough broccoli because I learned that i preferred my crunchies crunchy. I love carrots, snap peas, cauliflower, etc. the only veggies I still think are gross are green peppers and squash, but I can still season them to tolerable in a fajita mix if I add enough mushrooms and onion and taco powder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I borderline eat too much meat but ill be damned if veggies don't taste good.</p>
<p>You just gotta learn how to cook.</p>
<p>Also, if thats too hard, butter. Lots of butter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It literally just had a little salt, pepper, and olive oil. Roasted perfectly.</p>
<p>I grew up heading shit like that because it was steamed into mush</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very cultural. There's been a lot of research showing the complexity of how we develop our palate--everything from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/08/08/139033757/babys-palate-and-food-memories-shaped-before-birth" target="_blank">what your mother ate while you were in the womb</a> and <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jpgn/Fulltext/2009/03001/Early_Flavor_Learning_and_Its_Impact_on_Later.5.aspx" target="_blank">during breastfeeding</a> to the <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0195666314001421" target="_blank">best time to diversify a child's palate</a>. The overarching conclusion is that food preference has to do with familiarity and exposure. Combine that with the heavily processed american diet and the barriers to fresh food access and you get lots of picky, unhealthy children who go on to have more picky, unhealthy children.</p>
<p>As another illustration of how cultural food taste is, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/inside-out-pixar-makes-crucial-change-japanese-tastes-editing-out-broccoli-10413794.html" target="_blank">broccoli scene in Inside Out had to be changed to bell peppers in Japan</a> because Japanese audiences just didn't get why a kid would dislike broccoli. These things aren't universal by any means. Culturally unloved foods are likely to be ones that are uncommon in that culture, and unfortunately in the US that generally includes...pretty much all veggies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. Im one of those children raised on freezer food and fast food, and healthy food just does not taste good to me. No matter how much I eat or try it. My partner on the other hand, was raised on home cooked, healthy meals. He's the primary cook and it will remain that way exactly for the reason that I want our children to have more diverse and healthy diets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that the Japanese &quot;piman&quot; is picked much earlier than green bell peppers in Western countries, and as such has a very bitter flavor. </p>
<p>What we would consider a bell pepper they call &quot;paprika&quot;, and it isn't particularly reviled in my experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The liver is central to metabolism, which is what vitamins are used for, and also acts as storage for a number of vitamins, so naturally eating it will provide  you a boatload of vitamins. You can actually poison yourself with Vitamin A if you're slammin too many livers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see this said a lot, and I don't understand it, I quite enjoy the taste of unseasoned meat. Like, yeah, it's better with salt, but not radically so. Current assumption is that it's mostly Americans, and Australian meat just tastes better? Or there's straight up a genetic component, like how coriander tastes like soap to some people?</p></div>		</li>
