			<div class="markdown"><p>The photo was originally taken on a film. So it doesn’t get much smaller. The “enlarger” is an actual device even though it can technically make smaller prints. But you need the original film to do that. </p>
<p>Have you ever shined a flashlight on the wall? The circle is one size. If you move towards the wall the circle gets smaller. And if you move away from the wall the circle gets bigger. Put a photography negative against the flashlight and you have a hobo enlarging device</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're unlikely to want to make a 35mm negative smaller - rather than resize a print down you'd be better to make a new print and enlarge the negative less.  If you really need to reduce a print, you may need to effectively take a picture of it and then print that new negative at smaller size.</p>
<p>Apparently one way spies would make microfilm of documents is to take a photo of the document to produce a small negative, then take a photo of that negative from some distance to produce a very very small copy (done on a Mythbusters-type TV show)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to do Microfilm was a camera called a Minox. I had one. It’s negative was 8mm wide. They made a copy stand that telescoped into the size of a pen. You put the camera on the copy stand set the focal length to the setting for copying documents and clicked away. Minox lens was very nice. I used to be able to enlarge to 11x14in. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The resulting image is 1:1 with the original negative.</p></div>		</li>
