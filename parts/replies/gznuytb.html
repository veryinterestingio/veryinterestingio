			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, but a those distances, the mirrors and telescopes required to resolve anything more than a stray photon or two would have to be the most massive objects in the universe, comparable in size to solar systems or galaxies themselves. They'd collapse into black holes long before being big enough to be usefull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have another question - so an object 1 billion light years away, we’re seeing it as it was 1 billion years ago, because it took the light 1 billion light years for that light to reach us. That’s all logical. </p>
<p>But due to the continued expansion of the universe and the growing distance between celestial bodies that comes with that, is there time dilation that affects time scales on observed celestial bodies, similar to the Doppler effect when an object is moving away from you? So if i were to stare at an object 1b ly away for 1 minute, am I really getting 1minute of time passage as experienced by the distant object, or am I getting only maybe 50s of information. Or is this accounted for in the red shifting of light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll see things happen there more slowly, if for nothing else then because they're moving away so each second their info takes more time to reach here.</p>
<p>As far as time dilation it's a bit tricky because we're all stationary in our own reference frames.  You have to use full General Relativity to work this stuff out rather than simple Special Relativity.  I'm not sufficiently on top of GR to talk about this part in much depth, but in general we don't talk about there being time dilation just from the expansion of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so it is like the Doppler effect then. And yeah I don’t think time dilation applies, because with the universe expanding we’re not traveling through space as it expands, we’re just getting further apart as space expands. </p>
<p>Can this Doppler effect slowing the observed time mess with our calculations of distance to said object? Also, does this mean that if it’s 1b light years away, we’re not actually looking 1b into the past by looking at it? Maybe 1.2b years in the past, because our observed time is passing more slowly?</p></div>		</li>
