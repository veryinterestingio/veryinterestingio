<p>I remember the grimy place I was living in as a student got really clean once it was time to work on my dissertation!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately now my night owl brain channels that energy when I need to start getting ready for bed/work. Then all of the sudden it's 11pm and I'm organizing my closet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you just had a moment of motivation and energy to focus and do those things</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right...and the OP already responded saying that he believes I am correct in my assessment. I also gave him a reason for what it is that I believe helps me get to that place.</p>
<p>And that was literally the answer. It’s not that complicated..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADHD isn’t “dealing with shit until you decide to not deal with shit” or “I just like to procrastinate” it’s a set of symptoms that range from an inability to get started even on simple shot to maintaining focus on stuff you need to focus on to maintaining a normal emotional state to being able to make proper decisions and set goals for the future and other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like anxiety/depression to me. Not the clinical description for ADD. </p>
<p>And once again, doing things you NEED to do vs doing things you WANT to do is my point. Which you completely disregarded. If you don’t give a fuck about coding on an app for your job but you enjoy playing video games, or boxing, or doing graphic design, you don’t have the “inability” to do anything because it makes you happy.</p>
<p>Once again, y’all need to stop thinking there is something wrong with you and you can’t focus. You can, you just don’t care about whatever it is you’re doing.</p></div>		</li>
