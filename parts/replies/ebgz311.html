			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, studies have shown that we can identify certain things, like danger or anger, faster than our brain cognitively realizes. </p>
<p>People have physical responses (minute ones) when they are shown a picture of an angry person for milliseconds at a time. It is faster than our &quot;active&quot; train of thought can process, but our &quot;gut&quot; recognizes the anger and starts making preparations/getting ready for a potential threat. In these cases, our gut seems to have a more direct line to our visual input than our own conscious selves have. Daniel Kahenman calls the &quot;gut&quot; in this scenario &quot;system 1&quot; which makes snap judgements based on assumptions, biases, and heuristics. It is faster than our &quot;system 2&quot; which is more deliberate in decisions. System 1 is great at identifying threats (though will throw false positives, as another comment noted).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely related to the original post, but your comparison of system 1 and system 2 also works for explaining stereotypes. They don't exist to discriminate against people; they exist to help us make those quick judgments. They are a part of survival</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree! Yes they are pretty powerful mental shortcuts and in general, are effective at mitigating risk. The general concern is that their false positives can too easily lead us astray, and that our reliance of the speedy responses of system 1 lead us to make pretty major mistakes when we rely on system 1 for gut calls instead of forcing system 2 to take control.</p>
<p>On the discrimination front, I frankly have not done the reading necessary to talk in detail or at length. That being said, our biases are heavily influenced by our social experiences, and they tend to be self reinforcing. We search for data that confirms our belief that something/someone is good or bad. We therefore overweight confirming evidence and underweight complicating factors that could weaken our beliefs. As biases that are created culturally, they also can build unreasonable fears or expectations about the behaviors of &quot;others.&quot;</p>
<p>Aside from disciminaton, a nice example in the finance world is that stock traders tend invest in a company whose CEO they personally like. They tend to do it because it is easier to answer the question &quot;do I like this CEO?&quot; when the real question should be &quot;what are the financial prospects of this firm for the next 1/3/5/10 years?&quot; Substituting an easy question for a hard one is a very common event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also factors into things like anxiety and PTSD.  If your parents were abusive, for instance, sometimes everyday things can be registered as a dangerous pattern.  Sometimes you're not even aware of the signs your picking up on.  Mom used to wash dishes angrily before you got beat?  You might not have noticed the subtle cues that let your body know there was a threat.  Now every time someones a little stressed while washing mugs in the break room sink, your adrenaline starts spiking and you don't know why.</p>
<p>It's that subconscious element that can make these symptoms near impossible to get over.  If you KNOW setting down the sponge a little assertively is a trigger, that at least gives you something to work with.  But when your triggers are subtle facial tics, imperceptible changes in tone, where do you even start?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We stereotype everything. Not just race or ethnicity or jobs or whatever. </p>
<p>I have a stereotype that people with a bunch of face tattoos make bad decisions and I should be cautious around them. I’m sure there are plenty of face tatted nice people. But I’ve got that stereotype. </p>
<p>I also have the stereotype that frail old women are nice. I’m sure some of them are dangerous and plenty are rude. But I tend to feel safe around little old women.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Semi-related, the phenomenon of blindsight is very fascinating. When the visual cortex - the part of the brain that processes sight for your conscious mind - is damaged, you are blind, but the eyes and the optic nerves are still running data to the rest of your brain, producing blindsight. People with blindsight have been found to accurately react to things, including emotions on faces, when they can't &quot;see&quot; anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes PTSD interesting. Recently, 30 years after my abuse, I had a family reunion over the Thanksgiving holidays. There were a lot of details that matched my childhood family holiday reunions that resulted in abuse and rape. The modern family reunion was factually completely different⎯different family, I was older, different location⎯but there were enough similarities to trigger a response. I spent the first three days in a fugue state or panic. The brain, and its primal core, can be terribly powerful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've experienced such similar situations. I was abused as a child and an adult and this knee jerk gut response is so intrinsic to me it that I've attributed it to depression, when in fact things in my peripheral are maybe sightly off and I have this overwhelming sense of constant doom because I'm being constantly &quot;re-triggered&quot;, to use an inflammatory term. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Its sad when inoffensive clinical terms are now deemed inflammatory. Yes, there are a few that abused the term for their own benefit but there isn't a single thing that hasn't been abused by an individual at some point or another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone who fails to deal with any trauma will deal with PTSD to some degree. Anything stressful or disturbing can be a trauma.</p>
<p>That is, <em>most people</em> will deal with PTSD throughout their lives - it's important to recognize that. Recovery is made through understanding and working through the trauma, which sometimes can be incredibly difficult to do.</p>
<p>edit: Since this was apparently not clear: Everyone will deal with <em>post traumatic stress</em>, the same issues that if clinically significant can be diagnosed as post traumatic stress <em>disorder</em>, in their lives. </p>
<p>It's like the difference between experiencing depression at normal times (like the loss of a loved one) and having a mood disorder like major depressive disorder (in other words, &quot;having depression&quot;).</p></div>		</li>
