<p>In this case our amplifier is entirely digital and consists of some transistors that can handle the needed power demand.
The amplifier and mixer is controlled by the operating system on kernel level, thus the volume settings of the phone is the bottleneck of the entire audio system. </p>
<p>If any app can overrule it like the phone-app itself, it has access to an OS interface which controls that part of the OS, so that an incoming phone call mutes the music and raises volume for the ringtone.</p>
<p>There's other apps that don't have access to the OS' interface like the volume bar in the browser version of youtube videos. These bars actually control the signal level of the browser plug-in and not your phone's amplifier / mixer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But some apps can detect or even control the volume, such as VLC. My guess would be such apps could also change their behaviour based on the volume, but I don't see the point.</p>
<p>In VLC for example the video is already running so sound decoding is absolutely trivial in comparison.</p>
<p>Or if <em>only</em> sound is playing, it would make more sense to pause.</p>
<p>I doubt any app developers bothers with actually disabling audio processing when it's muted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I toggle the volume buttons on the side, it just changes the media volume setting. App notifications and ringer volumes stay the same, unless I set my phone to not disturb.</p></div>		</li>
