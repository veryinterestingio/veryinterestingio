			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the same hibernation state appears in other smaller mammals, and they lose more muscle mass than bears.  In fact, nearly as much as humans do while not in a hibernation state, but just on bed rest with normal caloric intake.  It's not a simple question, and bears are in fact quite unique in this regard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep as you said no one knows quite why, and in 2001 this article says as much, see this link (<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2001/02/bear-muscles-bear-winter" target="_blank">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2001/02/bear-muscles-bear-winter</a>)</p>
<p>Whats amazing is the benefits of finding out are quite significant, yet in 2015 scientists are still no further in their research, still speculating that bears avoid muscle protein degradation and hence strength by synthesizing amino acids and proteins from storages of urea nitrogen, (since bears do not urinate during hibernation) or by shivering and muscle contractions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you assume that bear muscles function the same as human muscles? Obviously bears evolved to hibernate and leaving the caves with no muscles would be maladaptive, so you would expect their muscles to stick around.</p>
<p>Humans do not hibernate and consequently adapt relatively quickly to strength demands placed on them, and almost as quickly shed mass not in use to prevent metabolic waste.</p></div>		</li>
