			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's be honest, anyone who researches consciousness dabbles in drugs if they have any of the materialist approaches, since it's a very obvious way of seeing some extra features of the brain and consciousness. </p>
<p>It's funny though, as much as I'm excited about what you mention, it's hard for me not to think that it's gonna be AI that finally puts the nail in the coffin (or the 'mind in the body', I guess). The problem with writing about it is someone could have already nailed it, and we just wouldn't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spoken like someone that has no interest in psychedelics :)</p>
<p>I see what you mean, but the psychedelic experience is so different from conscious states naturally attainable, unlike opiods or amphetamines, that sets them apart. </p>
<p>You can feel a small amount of the opiod experience just by running or eating good food. To touch on the psychedelic mindspace, you can meditate, dream, or cheat with substances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh... I've done lots and lots of psychedelics, and I like them a lot, actually!</p>
<p>I mean... Opiates &quot;feel&quot; good, right? What is the feeling that is being felt? This is why I think opiates are just as valid as psychedelics when it comes to understanding consciousness. All drugs do, even psychedelics, is induce a  psychoactive change... A feeling. Psychedelics feel different than opiates, sure, but they have an equally strong effect on consciousness. It's just different.</p></div>		</li>
