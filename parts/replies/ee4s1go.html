			<div class="markdown"><p>Contracting skeletal muscles requires very little energy compared to calories spent maintaining homeostasis. Based on my personal age, sex, height and weight I burn about 1,200 calories just by existing. If I laid in bed all day, that's how much energy I'd need just to keep the motors running without losing weight.</p>
<p>To burn the equivalent amount of energy with skeletal muscles through exercise, I'd have to run approximately 12 miles which is a lot. Using your nervous system to twitch your muscles frequently to prevent atrophy would require a relatively tiny amount of energy and would certainly be worth the investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, humans can do something like this, at least to a much lesser degree.</p>
<p>For example, taking a skier and having them use virtual reality goggles to virtually 'go down the slope of a mountain' causes minute twitching in the muscle fibers. I don't believe there is enough muscle activation to build or maintain muscles, however it supposedly causes their brain to build pathways allowing them to go down the mountain more successfully on subsequent runs.</p>
<p>Think of it like intentionally inducing the tetris effect and the body actually responding to that stimulus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even easier than that, just imagine humming any song. You’ll notice that your vocal cords will tense along with your imagined hum despite the fact that you’re not doing it for real. In fact, it’s extremely difficult to prevent your muscles from doing so. Super weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it doesn't exert the muscle until failure, which is what triggers re-building, which results in being swole. </p>
<p>But it does prevent the muscle from atrophying, which means shrinking from lack of use.</p></div>		</li>
