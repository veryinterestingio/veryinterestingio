<p>You see that one contains a blurry sky but on the other one you can see the rain.</p>
<p>To get the second video (where rain is still visible) you need to produce a bigger video file (or as with this particular example, a video file of same size but made with a more advanced encoder, therefore capable of doing more within same size constraints)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, actually. Random noise can't be efficiently compressed because there are few similarities between one frame and the next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, in a way, you could say that a video file is arguably more &quot;<strong>moving</strong> pictures&quot; than film or tape, because the video compression methods in use today usually involve &quot;motion vectors&quot;, which means the frames after a key frame encode the differences as what parts of the image moved where, plus compressed pixel data. So there is actual motion encoded in the file. :) (But it is motion that is just computed from the image differences, not actual captured motion of actors etc., of course.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this idea apply to live video chats? If I’m FaceTiming someone, does it use less data when I’m in the dark (i.e., each frame is essentially the same as the last one)? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Live video chats are a bit different. with stored media, the user is waiting for data so if it takes a little longer to transfer it's not the end of the world, and data formats are a tradeoff between transmit time and quality.  with live chats, though, the most important thing is that data arrive on-time.  Late data is worse than no data.  So it is encoded incrementally, such that if only a small bit gets through, it's the &quot;most important&quot; bit; and as more data comes through per second, it refines the picture to higher quality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. Is the “most important” bit the most important of the whole frame, or is it the most important in the change from the previous frame? ie, does it try to send the entire frame each time?</p></div>		</li>
