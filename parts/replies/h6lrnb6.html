<p>Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>outside only - are those people insane? I mean sure as long as he is not sick and you send with extra socks, jackets and hoodies each day. He will not enjoy it some days. Also wool, get your kid some wool. I had to spend an unusual amount of time outside when I was kid and it really really made me want to move to LA. Or even find some place that is warmer than LA. He will live, he might not be fine. </p>
<p>Also, the only reason you look forward to your first winter is because its your first, you will not be looking forward to your second.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've lived in Washington for a couple years now, this it's all very accurate.</p>

<p>Except the bullshit about the umbrellas. I'm also a Washington native and the &quot;I don't own an umbrella&quot; is just something you hear people say, plenty of natives own and use umbrellas; like I'm going to show up to work in a soaking wet suit because of some sort of unfaltering local pride.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/why-seattleites-love-to-hate-the-umbrella/" target="_blank">People do hate them though</a>; &quot;locals don't own umbrellas&quot; is one of those sayings you hear non-stop, like &quot;I don't mind driving in the snow, it's everyone else I don't trust&quot;, or &quot;the roads are more slippery when it first starts raining (after having had no rain for a while)&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
