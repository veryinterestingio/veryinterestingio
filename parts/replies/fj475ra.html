			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me, chytrid isn't specifically my area of expertise, and while it has been detected in my general region on a variety of amphibians, it does not seem to currently be driving precipitous declines in the southeastern US.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see what someone more experienced on the topic might be. To my knowledge, the fungus can be spread by humans, including those of us working on conservation. We have protective measures to minimize the risk of professionals carrying the fungus and contaminating new sites, such as bleach baths for equipment between sites, use of disposable gloves when handling contaminated objects/subjects, etc. But not everyone is a researcher with prophylaxis,  so spread is still possible. But there is still a very real risk that other wildlife can transmit the fungus.</p>
<p>The only real positive news I can recall hearing on the topic in recent years is that it seems some frogs are developing resistance to chytrid. I can't pretend to know an ounce of information beyond that. All I know is that it doesn't currently seem that chytrid isn't being blamed for most of the declines here in the southeastern US, but projects further west have not dealt so much with treating the fungus <em>in situ</em> as much as manipulate what they can in the population (e.g., head-start programs that raise frogs in threat-minimized settings, translocating frogs to fungus-free locations) to help them persist until we have better ways to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone more in tune with chytrid can chime in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/thesimpletoncomplex I think you gave a pretty solid summary! One reason it might not be an issue (as much) an issue in SE is that it really prefers cooler temps. That's why so many high-elevation amphibian species are being devastated by it.</p>
<p>There is some initial evidence that some species can evolve some resistance (Voyles et al. 2018 is a big one). As you note, in-situ treatment at a scale that can actually shift a population trajectory is very difficult but some research groups are having success (Sierra Nevada Yellow Legged frog researchers have been doing some really great work. see Knapp and Briggs publications). I'm also finishing up a project where we were able to increase overwinter survival in juvenile frogs from 1% to about 30% by treating them in the field with itraconazole... so that's pretty amazing. In other words, there are some glimmers of hope but it is definitely still a scary outlook.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s kind of unrelated to the thread, but I was wondering if you have any advice for someone wanting to be a herpetologist? I’ve done a few population surveys, mostly for amphibians, but I’ll be doing my first snake survey later this year. Is there anything else that I should be doing? Thanks for any advice!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, congrats on getting into fieldwork! I hope it’s an awesome time and you get some good data. </p>
<p>I agree that this is a competitive field. One issue is that it often requires people take seasonal jobs or internships to break into, and that can be tough. I wish it wasn’t this way, because it keeps out folks who can’t afford that or can’t move frequently, but unfortunately you have to be prepared for this. </p>
<p>In the long term, you have to have skills beyond being a field tech. Don’t get me wrong, that work is difficult, skilled, and absolutely crucial. Doing it will make you a better biologist, too. Getting your hands dirty and knowing how things work will help you as you progress in your career. However, you also need to be able to do analyses and write papers or reports. Science doesn’t stop with fieldwork, there’s so much more to it! If you’re in school, don’t blow off those stats and GIS courses. Learn to approach writing as a process and not a chore. Look to more experienced folks to learn about experimental design, data management, and analysis. Consider learning a coding language like R. Network with colleagues and consider collaborating on projects. </p>
<p>You could also consider museum work in addition to academia, although that is also highly competitive. Museum work still has the research side of things, but you need experience curating a collection. That includes learning cataloging, specimen preparation, etc. </p>
<p>Finally, consider that a lot of ecology or wildlife jobs aren’t strictly herpetology, so keep in mind that you may have to branch out. That doesn’t mean you won’t get opportunities to work on your taxon of interest, but you may need to be flexible. That could mean taking a job as a GIS analyst, consultant, etc. This can open up a lot more opportunities!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many different paths you can take to be a herpetologist, I suggest taking a path with more opportunity. I'm going to be blunt and honest: I've struggled to be one and still often have friends successful in other fields who try to convince me it's time to move on. It's a great community with very few paid opportunities, and even fewer opportunities to build a viable career.</p>
<p>In my opinion, your best option to build a successful career is to aim toward academia. But even that option is not easy and highly competitive. But I can't recommend academia to all because in some cases, it will chew you up and spit you out (or try to). That's a separate conversation of making sure you put in the work to make sure you've got the proper mentors and support.</p>
<p>Otherwise, as with anything when you're trying to build a career, network. I was actually once fairly quiet about my love of herps, fearing it was too nerdy. In college, I happened to make some friends who were also into herps and making a career of herpetology. We bonded, took many trips together, formed a herpetology club, and actually still do a lot together today. Their knowledge was beyond mine when we met, yet most of us found our professional niche to keep herpetology part of our lives. One of us works academically on herps, a couple of us work on wildlife for state agencies, one has a side-gig that involves a lot of wildlife experience, and so on. We all got involved with our state's herpetological society, which was eager to have us involved. I started with the society as a quiet nobody in the audience, but I've given several talks and made lots of friends in the society ever since.</p>
<p>One of those college buddies had a research project and the rest of us volunteered to help every chance we got. It was road cruising for snakes, so the sort of thing everyone wants to do, but introducing us all to note-taking a field techniques. So getting involved is a big part to get the experience that otherwise only the paid job can get you.</p>
<p>Fast forward a bit, I'm managing a pet store, mostly applying for animal care jobs when my buddy who had the research project was asked if he knew anyone who wanted a 6 month job tracking some herps. I was the first to call, he offered me the job, it ended up lasting 2 years until I was recruited to grad school. Grad school was hell for me, and I won't bother with more detail on that. I did not finish, and that made it much more difficult for me to pursue the career further. Ultimately, my networking saved me, and people who knew me offered me jobs again...although it's worth mentioning that I have yet to find permanent employment and the life consequences that carries.</p>
<p>It's hard to come straight out of college with a lot of knowledge about a broad range of taxa, but learning to identify flora and fauna is almost always a huge plus, especially if you're into ecology.</p>
<p>Most importantly, if you choose a career as a scientist, please take it seriously. I say that not to be a jerk, but because I've literally known people who blow off the actual work part of herp jobs to literally just find/photograph herps.</p>
<p>TL;DR - network, volunteer, network, be active, it helps if your whole life revolves around herpetology, and it helps if you take the time to learn more broadly about different forms of life to learn how everything fits together. Oh, and school is in there somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good question. I should preface my answer by saying that my work with amphibians hasn't included any work on Bd (short for <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>, the scientific name for the fungus), so this is just my knowledge from trying to stay up to date in the field. There are a lot of people doing really important work on this!</p>
<p>The fungus spread across the globe so quickly that for a long time, scientists didn't even know where it originated. In 2018, scientists <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/origin-of-frog-killing-chytrid-fungus-found-36616" target="_blank">published a paper</a> in which they sequenced the genome of Bd samples from around the world. They found that the fungus most likely originated in Asia. Knowing where it came from helps us put policies in place to prevent the spread, especially if there are novel strains in the same region (and if you read the link above, there are). Note that other regions have been suggested as well, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323396/" target="_blank">Africa</a> (and possibly spread due to export of African clawed frogs for the pet trade). The more recent study seems to be the largest yet, which is notable considering Bd is pretty tough to culture in a lab setting.</p>
<p>Bd has been successfully treated in captive frogs, typically using a series of baths with an antifungal known as itraconazole (more info <a href="https://www.amphibians.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Froglog46.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (PDF). It has been used in zoos that can house threatened and endangered species. It's a tough treatment, because amphibians are sensitive to the itraconazole as well.</p>
<p>There is a bacterium called <em>Janthinobacterium lividum</em> (Jliv) that inhibits the growth of Bd. It's actually also being investigated for use in the fight against antimicrobial resistance (a topic for another day). There are instances where Jliv has been found in wild frog populations and these frogs seem to fare better against Bd. For example, frogs in the genus <em>Telmatobius</em>, found in the Andean highlands, have been very susceptible to Bd. However, Jliv has been found in a couple species, <em>T. intermedius</em> and <em>T. marmoratus</em>, and these species <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v131/n3/p233-238/" target="_blank">are persisting</a>. <a href="https://aem.asm.org/content/82/8/2457.short" target="_blank">Lab studies</a> have looked into whether Jliv can transfer between individuals, to see whether this could be a viable way to help populations build resistance to Bd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/MockDeath There is a lot of research on how we can treat Chytridiomycosis, all with varying levels of success and feasibility. Treatment with anti fungal drugs has been promising with some species (Brannelly et al. 2012, Hardy et al. 2015- both in Diseases of Aquatic Organisms [and my soon-to-be-finished MS thesis AH!]), there is evidence that some probiotic treatments could be viable (Piovia-Scott et al. 2017 in Microbial Ecology; Rebollar et al 2016 in Frontiers in Microbiology), and we can cure individual frogs with heat treatments (Woodhams et al. 2013). Of course a lot of these methods are hard to scale up to the level where we could actually help declining populations, but a lot of smart people are thinking about it.</p>
<p>The amphibian chytrid that all of that\^ research was done on is called Bd (short for batrachochytrium dendrobatidis)... another complication is that there is actually more than one &quot;strain&quot; but the one causing the most damage is called the &quot;Global Pandemic Lineage&quot; (GPL for short), but even within GPL there is variation in the virulence between populations. Different amphibian species also respond to infection differently. For example, bullfrogs can have heavy infections and not die, but other species may be driven almost to extinction by it very quickly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have to deal with another emerging species called &quot;BSal&quot; (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans) which is having a huge effect on salamanders. Its impact on anurans is less devastation, at least thats how it seems initially, but we still don't know that much about it.</p>
<p>I think important things we can do to prevent its spread is limit international (and interstate) amphibian pet trade (see the Lacey Act), disinfect gear between aquatic sites, and support wildlife conservation research as well as disease ecology research! (Actually just all research! ha!)</p></div>		</li>
