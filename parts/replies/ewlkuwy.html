			<div class="markdown"><p>I removed one on my lower eyelid with a pair of very sharp nail clippers.</p>
<p>Didn't hurt one bit. Bled like a bastard though. Have something around to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>To figure out if it will hurt, just put the clippers over it and lightly squeeze them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Save yourself a trip to the doctor,  dab some Tea Tree oil on it then cover it with a plaster.</p>
<p>You're supposed to re-do it a couple of times a day but TBH my Mrs did mine before bed and we would totally forget about it the next day.  The annoying wee fecker would soon be gone anyway.  I don't think I've had any that took more than one go.  </p>
<p>Edit to add.  No I don't sell essential oils I think the Mrs just buys it in the super market.</p></div>		</li>
