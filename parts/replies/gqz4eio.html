			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting.
I found the scarring and inflammation leading to squamous carcinomas to be of particular concern.
Are these types of statements accurate on a broader scale? For instance, I injury my shoulder and continue to re-injure it throughout life, resulting in reduced mobility and increased inflammation. Does this increase risk for cancer in a measurable way?</p>
<p>Thank you!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes, constant injury of the same part of tissue will increase the chance of cancer cells forming. Cancer is formed through the accumulation of mutations in the genetic code. Carcinogens are things that increase the mutation rate. However I don't think this would be in a measurable way to the point that you would need to take specific steps to avoid it.</p>
<p>Having inflammation creates reactive oxygen species that can cause mutations in DNA. But this isnt as good at causing mutations as something like UV radiation.
Inflammation has a biological purpose though, and if you weren't capable of inflammation you'd probably die of an infectious disease, or your wounds wouldn't heal properly. So it's not really a thing to worry about in your day to day life and mostly inflammation is a good thing.</p>
<p>Also whenever you have increased cell division there's an increased chance for cancer. Breasts get cancer because they constantly remodel their tissue. Skin gets cancer because is constantly grows, also UV. Colons get cancer because they are constantly growing new cells. Cancers in non replicating tissue are much rarer. This means that anytime you have a wound that is repaired you have an increased chance of cancer cells forming too.</p>
<p>There is a disease called epidermolysis bullosa where kids are born not producing the right type of collagen for their skin, so the skin is weak and they are constantly getting blisters and sores (often called the butterfly children, as they are delicate like butterflies). On top of constant pain and worrying about wound infections and bleeds, these kids have an increased chance of squamous cell cancer, to the point that skin cancer is the leading cause of death in older children with this disease. This is partly because their skin is constantly inflamed and needing to regrow, so the chance of mutation is high, though there are also other factors that make skin cancer particularly bad in these patients.</p>
