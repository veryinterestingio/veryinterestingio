			<div class="markdown"><p>I do. Especially in social situations. I zone out so much. I never know what to say so I immediately can get inside my own head during a conversation. Or if no one is talking to me I drift away. &quot;What am I doing here?&quot; &quot; Whyed I come here again? This is boring.&quot; &quot;I shoulda just stayed in&quot;. Randomly I just get this almost feeling of dread like I shouldn't be there and stare away into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But hang on. You can see a photograph of someone with thousand yard stare. And it’s obvious. And photos don’t move. So there must be more to it than movement. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say it's obvious. The guy has bright blue eyes and in a bright environment the pupil is very small, making the eyes very intense. In addition his eyes reflect a bright environment. It's like the girl in the National Geographic cover who had intense eye color. It's good photography, not necessarily some inherent stare the subject has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The technical term is impaired &quot;saccades&quot;. Saccades are the scanning eye movements that allow us to see something (an image, or face for example) as a whole. The brain and eyes don't use every single data point that is in the picture or face, but instead, &quot;scans&quot; to gather several views before creating an image in the mind. So when someone is preoccupied by something else their mind isn't scanning their surroundings.</p></div>		</li>
