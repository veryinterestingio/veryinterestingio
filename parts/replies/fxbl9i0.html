If Germany finds that corona stays in the air, then the WHO would release that info internationally so that all the myriad little countries would also get the news. The WHO knows very little itself without data and resources from the larger member countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The WHO is a medical and scientific arm of a political organization, and therefore is, unfortunately, overly politicized - especially in this situation when an authoritarian and unreliable state actor who partially controls the WHO is also responsible for the pandemic crisis being managed.</p>
<p>That said, Trump's move to leave the WHO is also entirely political and is aimed at distracting an increasingly disillusioned public from his own failures.  It's meant to provide legitimacy to Trump's arguments that the damage done by the virus in the US is solely the result of China and the WHO rather than being a result of Trump's mismanagement of the crisis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second point is spot on. Trump doesn't want to admit that he was wrong about the virus just being another flu and it will go away when the weather warms up. He also doesn't want to admit that he was wrong about how he handled the situation because to do so would be too admit to a failure and Trump thinks that Trump never fails. To claim the WHO has been a puppet for China may be objectively correct (I'm still trying to decide what my opinions are on that) but that doesn't change the fact it is nothing but an excuse to cover a failure. &quot;I only failed because the WHO was wrong&quot;. Though that doesn't do much to credit him if he expressed any amount of trust in the WHO in the past.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Their recommendations and timelines can only be as good as the data they have. Hasn't there been an issue of not having enough information, as well as people not following principles to help keep the rate of spread down? I'm not surprised at all by what we are seeing now. Is the WHO at fault for failing to provide accurate information or being corrupt? Possibly, but I also figured this sort of thing would happen because in the beginning it seemed like everyone, to some extent, was onboard with #flattenthecurve or whatever, then as soon as it seemed like things were getting better, you would end up with a bunch of idiots that think it is completely fine to just go back to life as normal. Are some of these idiots part of WHO? Maybe, but there are also plenty of idiots around the America.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You claim that we know for a fact that WHO has irresponsibly withheld information to the benefit of China, I would like to see some sources of this.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the first point, as for the second point I'm still unsure. Is it definitely in need of reform/replacement? I'm still trying to figure this out.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I would agree that many may be up in arms to defend the WHO simply because Trump is against it. Do I think it is stupid to completely leave the WHO? Yes. Do I think the WHO is corrupt and needs to be fixed? I'm still trying to figure that out.</p></div>		</li>
