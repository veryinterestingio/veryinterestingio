			<div class="markdown"><p>The process of metamorphosis occurs in all insects, be it gradual or complete. There is also ametabolous metamorphosis, in which there is no wing growth and the offspring simply grow larger and sexually mature to become adults. This occurs in primitive insects such as bristletails and silverfish. Gradual metamorphosis defines Hemimetabolism or the group Hemimetabola. In this process, the offspring called nymphs grow larger until a sub-adult stage before they become sexually mature and some with a full set of wings. This occurs in grasshoppers, true bugs, dragonflies/damselflies (generally), cockroaches, termites, and mantises. Complete metamorphosis or holometabolism is a characteristic of insects in the group Endopterygota (Holometabola). This includes lacewings, antlions, fishflies, dobsonflies, moths, wasps, bees, ants, beetles, flies, scorpionflies/fleas, alderflies, snakeflies, caddisflies, and more. In complete metamorphosis, the egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages are present.</p>
<p>What happened between the slow transition from ametabolism to hemimetabolism and the crazy transition from that to holometabolism, where you have this weird pupal stage and a larva that looks nothing like the adult when you compare it to the other metamorphoses? The answer might be in the insect egg. I read a very interesting paper that attempted to explain evolution of holometabolism. Before a hemimetabolous insect hatches, in the egg, they are a soft, non-pigmented, short-legged thing or a pronymph. This stage is very different from the nymph stage. When the juvenile hormone (JH) production of the pronymph begin to naturally cease, the body of the insect is signaled to advance to the next life stage. The pronymph hatches and remains a pronymph for about a few hours, and then becomes a nymph that is slightly more rigid, robust, pigmented, and resembles the adult a little more. In holometabolism, it seems that the this metamorphosis simply evolved by the extension of the cessation of JH production. This means the pronymph doesn't become a nymph until much later in life. You might think this sounds vulnerable, but don't - <em>this would become the larval stage</em>. The 3-5 nymph stages would also be pushed together closer to the adult stage. Eventually, these stages must have all fused together into the <em>pupal stage</em>. So there you have it, what were once the pronymph and nymphal stages of grasshoppers became the caterpillar and chrysalis stage of the butterfly, respectively (but butterflies did not evolve directly from grasshoppers, of course).</p>

Was something I wondered for a long time though, probably since I was a young kid </p></div>		</li>
