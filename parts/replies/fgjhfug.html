			<div class="markdown"><p>A number of things. </p>
<p>Open concept homes became really popular. With more openings, there are less ways to stop the fire from traveling.</p>
<p>Cheaper materials. A lot of furniture is made with particle board instead of solid wood. It's much easier for fire to get through particle than it is a solid hunk. Cheap fabrics tend to burn quicker too, though not sure why on that end, likely the type of threads used. </p>
<p>I'm sure there are others, but those are the ones I can remember off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this information is covered well. The biggest reason for the acceleration in fire behavior over the last century has been the change in manufacturing from common materials (wood, for example) to plastics (A.K.A. hydrocarbons). Gasoline is made of hydrocarbons. Propane is a form of hydrocarbon. They're exothermic (when they react/ ignite, they give off energy in the form of heat).</p>
<p>The material gets hot enough to exhibit pyrolysis: decomposition of a material exposed to high temperatures. Wood, when pyrolysized, releases CO and CO2, whereas plastics release complex hydrocarbon chains. These chains ignite and break down and what isn't burned is emitted in the smoke. Eventually, everything burns. So, if the environment is hot enough, that smoke becomes more fuel, until the entirety of the contents has burned. </p>
<p>Think about this, too. More and more houses are built with open floor plans and higher grade energy saving components. So, we have less doors in a house to &quot;snuff out&quot; a small room-and-contents fire and in larger spaces, that heat is held inside the house longer due to better insulation, both in walls and windows. This can create a hazard for firefighters known as backdraft.</p>
<p>Long story short, do what u/firefighting101 says: get out quickly and have a plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, we are much safer from fire due to modern fire safety standards. I don't remember the statistics, but the chances of items with modern safety features catching fire is far smaller than it used to be. However, when thing <em>do</em> catch fire, they burn far better than older items.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. People don't usually argue against better safety standards. But even then, there are recommendations that are not always followed.(i.e. NFPA recommendations)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Once a certain temperature is reached flashover occurs and everything pretty much combusts simultaneously. The rule we were taught is that if one fire extinguisher doesn't put out the blaze--get out as fast as possible.</p></div>		</li>
