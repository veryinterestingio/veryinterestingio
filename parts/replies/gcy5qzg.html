Lab jobs were bleh and I moved eventually finding I disliked being stuck in entry level work. Went back to school for Electronics and currently pursuing Electrical Engineering, it's been very rewarding and much better paying.</p>

<p>Keys: Go back to school, don't give up, always be willing to ask for help. Doing this alone is near impossible...unless you're rich.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First, go back to school and get some kind of science degree or certificate. Depending on where you live, this can be done at a community college. Especially if you live near a very science heavy city like boston, SF, or even smaller research parks like in Raleigh. Then, find a smaller company that needs a lab tech/lab assistant/whatever they call it. Get in, prove your worth and, with a smaller company, you will likely get promoted as they grow. If not, who cares? You got experience and can start jumping ship for promotions. Good luck to you!!</p></div>		</li>
