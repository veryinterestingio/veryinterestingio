<p>None of the other planets we can measure have any free oxygen in their air, since this requires life (or some other process we aren't aware of).</p>

<p>We have found molecular oxygen in another galaxy. We haven't found it on a planet yet, however. So &quot;requires life&quot; might be a flawed expectation, but since this is a relatively new discovery, a lot more analysis has to be done.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings up another question. When scientists say there is water on a planet, do we know that it is H2O and not something similar like H2O2 or some type of liquid acid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do! The ELI5 version is that we know what color water is and so by carefully measuring the light coming from the planet we can see what colors it is and thus we can determine whether there is water there. The more complex answer has to do with absorption and emission spectra. Basically, every atom, compound, and molecule absorbs and emits energy at very specific wavelengths that we can calculate with quantum mechanics. In labs on earth we can experimentally verify these numbers with lasers even for small quantities of materials. In space we need very large telescopes or arrays of telescopes taking observations over multiple weeks to detect the light coming from planets but once we do we can get a careful enough read to see what wavelengths of light are coming from that planet and from there conclude what is present on the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To see if I understand this..</p>
<p>Does that mean, if we see hydrogen and oxygen on the surface (I'm assuming we can't see the wavelengths emitted by things inside the planet), and we also know that somewhere between the surface and the core there is a zone of the right temperature where liquid water could exist, then we say scientists have found water under the surface of a planet?</p>
<p>Or is there a way to use spectrography to look at things bellow the surface?</p>
<p>I apologize if we are getting out of ELI5 territory.</p></div>		</li>
