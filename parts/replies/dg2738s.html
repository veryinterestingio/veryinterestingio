			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I love this sub,  thank you so much, I can't even think of a time I was thinking about such thing, but I come on reddit, scrolling down and see this and I start to wonder, why? Now I know. And learning something like this while on the toilet...dunno. I just think is awesome. Have a great rest of your night, or day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow on the toilet here. Eli5 is pretty great for serendipity  </p>
<p>Edit: given the number of fellow redditors that enjoy their toilet, I would estimate that any new TIL is likely a TILotT (today I learned on the toilet). </p>
<p>Who could imagine that such a simple device could improve life so much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that you can induce air sickness by &quot;yawing&quot; the aircraft, using the rudder so that the aircraft &quot;side slips&quot; rather than flying straight.<br />
Especially in cargo planes (we're looking at you, airforce transport guys) where you have little external reference, a yaw is undetectable to the troops in the back.<br />
Mass vomiting can occur without even feeling nausea, and is usually left to the troops to clean up at the other end of the flight.<br />
Pilots can have some pretty shitty ideas of humour sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I occasionally make the mistake of looking at a text message when I'm the passenger in a car. Without fail, I end up bent over with my head between my knees trying to alleviate the car sickness. Hell, even just being in moving traffic can sometimes trigger it. Anxiety is such an asshole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I totally agree. What's your situation on sea sickness? If I look at any text while driving I get motion sickness pretty quick. Same thing with sitting in a boat in choppy water. I wonder if there's a connection. </p></div>		</li>
