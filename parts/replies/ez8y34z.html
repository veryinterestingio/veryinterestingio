			<div class="markdown"><p>Intercalation was my first guess, but I haven't found any articles/papers on it, do you know of any? It seems to me that most of the benzene should be metabolized, and that which isn't may not be large enough to be an intercalating agent since the diameter of a base pair is significantly (2x? 3x?) larger than that of a benzene. That said, this is out of my field so I'm somewhat grasping at straws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer the /u/FM79SG gives is the correct answer. The top rated one dealing with P450 enzymes is correct in biochemical content but not relevant to the DNA damage in the say way that Intercalation is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's true, while benzene can be epoxidized, usually it acts by intercalation, while large poly-aromatics usually affect DNA after epoxidation.</p></div>		</li>
