			<div class="markdown"><p>While SARS-COV-2 is a different virus on a lot of axises from influenza, the paper is about the physical mechanics of viral bodies in air. The same factors should impact SARS-COV-2 as well as influenza, as they are both viral bodies exposed to the same environment. SARS-COV-2 has likely different tolerances for both heat and humidity, but enough heat and humidity will eventually intefere with SARS-COV-2 transmission simply based on the physics of viral bodies. The science to be done now is to figure out at what heat and humidity points SARS-COV-2 will struggle at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking at SARS half life on various materials before that prelim study on covid-19 came out. The old studies became really hard to search on Google once covid-19 really got the interest of the public because search algos frequently got &quot;rewarded&quot; for presenting search results for covid-19.</p>
<p>I find it interesting to see that there are lots of studies currently being conducted on medications that could be useful, but really quite little research on the properties of the virus itself.</p>
<p>I think that there is a big disproportion between funding for testing meds over direct research on how the virus survives through the various ways it can be spread.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since beta coronaviruses cause the 40% of common colds</p>

<p>I have seen this elsewhere recently, and I do not doubt you for a minute, but as a complete layman, if anyone had asked me prior to this pandemic 'What virus causes the common cold?' I would have said rhinovirus.<br />
I remember seeing 'coronavirus' on the back of a Lysol spray can ages ago, but never knew what the buggers did.   I guess this has been an educational experience for many.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.</p>
<p>&quot;The Common Cold&quot; is a set of symptoms.   Not the name of a virus.</p>
<p>Just like &quot;Pneumonia&quot; is the name of a set of symptoms - that can be caused by many viruses (including some of the viruses that cause common colds).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the common cold was caused by a variety of virusses, the most common of &quot;common colds&quot; is caused by the rhinovirus, about 15% of colds are caused by a form of corona-virus. Just not the one we are having issues with at the moment.</p>
