			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been suffering migraines since I was child, even had surgery once.  Sudden temperature changes, as well as hard rain after a few dry days, or suddenly drying out after several days of rain are all sure fire ways for me to suffer.  My headaches even come on before you can see the storm coming. (My guess is the pressure change precedes the storm?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a pilot and when I was younger and dumber I flew with blocked sinuses. Discovered the immense pain it causes on descent but also the fix. Probably not COVID safe though. Stick fingers up nose and blow as much pressure into you sinus cavity as possible. You'll hear a squeak and then be all good for a little while.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I get the exact same symptoms you describe too. I still haven't found a solution yet either. Plugging my nose and blowing often makes it significantly worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me it has to do more with moisture in the air than anything; specific to sinus pain. When the temperature changes and gets colder, the air dries out. This causes issues in many people's sinuses as they are less lubricated causing discomfort with breathing. It's one of the reasons in the winter people will use humidifiers. When the temperature rises the moisture in the air does too, restoring comfort. Using a hygrometer you can actually see this in action.</p>
<p>In the summer I have a humidity of 50 where I live, while in the winter 20-30 depending on how cold it gets. The dryness hurts my sinus and head. I put a diffuser or two on to hydrate the air and I'm fine. The pressure change has nothing to do with starting my discomfort or restoring my comfort.</p>
<p>Its important to drink water and stay hydrated for different reasons. In the summer cuz you sweat more, and in the winter cuz it gets dry out and your body needs to retain water.</p></div>		</li>
