<p>Most rifle caliber AP ammunition is hardened steel or tungsten alloy cored. DU is excessive for the projectile size and velocity of most shoulder fired calibers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That difference won't matter for the amounts of rifle caliber AP ammunition carried. Not really.</p>
<p>Shoulder fired anti armour weapons use explosives to penetrate any sort of heavy armour, not hard, dense metal going fast, and that's been the case since WW-II.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall hearing that DU munitions are self-sharpening?</p>
<p>That most metals will tend to flatten &amp; splatter sideways during penetration of a hard, armoured surface, making a larger and larger cross section of armour they need to punch through.  DU on the other hand (for reasons I don't know) keeps a tight, sharp core during penetration and therefore is even better than its ludicrous density would suggest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the energies you're talking about, collisions with <em>any</em> material can be best characterized as &quot;splashy&quot;.  The forces are large as compared to the forces holding atoms to one another.</p>
<p>So when the penetrator hits, the tip shoves aside the first metal layer in the armor.  The first layer of the tip also smooshes out to the side.  It has lost its energy.  But there's the rest of the penetrator coming right along.  And since the first bit of armor and the first bit of penetrator are now going sideways and back out of the crater, there's room for the penetrator to cram itself up its own ass, so to speak.</p>
<p>Think of holding the open end of a sock up to some Jello.  Now imagine rolling the sock inside out through the Jello.</p>
<p>This is why they put ceramic layers interspersed with the metal ones.  A fair bit of energy goes into shattering the ceramic, and ceramic doesn't splash out of the way quite as well as metal would, so you have some hope of disrupting the jet of metal from the penetrator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually I'm convinced this entire comment is an innuendo. It's always dicks trying to be penetrators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>believe the term often used is ' buttering '. upon impact the outer layer melts/ vaporizes while the rest of the projectile continues forwards further into and then thru the armor at high speed and instantly becomes a white hot liquid mass incinerating everything inside it...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Édit: assumed</p>
<p>Honestly, have you ever thought about this? We have expended huge amounts of resources to work out what kills men best. It’s a great use of our limited resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always considered the opposite...how did something so squishy and unprotected become dominant on the planet? Why don't we have armor plating? Why aren't we waterproof? How can be be 60+% water, and yet die from too much of it? With so much water, why aren't we fireproof?</p>
<p>It's not just that we're so good at killing each other, but that we also so easy to kill and maim. It's weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's two specializations humans evolved that really set us apart from other primates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Walking all day looking for things that make us go.</p>
</li>
<li>Looking for things that we can throw at things that make us go.</li>
</ul>
<p>So when you think about <em>how</em> we became what we are as a species, weaponizing everything we come across and looking for things to use it on is basically at the core of what makes us human.</p>
<p>And if it's dead before it claws your face off, you don't need defenses, squishy's good enough. Evolution's a bit of a lazy b- that way.</p></div>		</li>

<li>There's only one terrestrial species on the planet that has endurance comparable to a (wild) human. We domesticated it.</li>
<li>There is no other species on the planet with the specialized ability to throw any object with both accuracy amd force.</li>
<li>There is no other species that can carry objects to use as projectiles <em>or</em> consume water/food while still moving at any speed short of full speed.</li>
<li>No other species has the same combination of abstract intelligence and ultra-fine motor skills required to make complex tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans have used weapons, basic clothing, protective equipment, survival gear, fire, and coordinated planning since before recorded history. We've been wiping out species that by any reasonable measure should have crushed us since the last ice age.</p>
<p>Humans can hunt by <em>literally</em> chasing anything they want until it dies of exhaustion. And we've done it for literally the entirety of our evolution. We haven't been true prey animals since we started walking upright.</p></div>		</li>
