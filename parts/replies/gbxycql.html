			<div class="markdown"><p>I can give a few important questions from a pure physics perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unification of quantum theory (specifically, the Standard Model) with gravity and all that comes with it (so General Relativity). Currently, no coherent theory is known that encompasses both. String Theory is the usual candidate for a solution, but it has yet to produce experimentally verifiable results and has been around for a few decades, so some scientists are growing sceptical about it. There are alternatives, but they have different problems, so I would say there is still a lot of work to be done here,</li>
<li>What the hell dark matter actually is. We know it exists from a lot of observational evidence, but no known particle matches its properties. There are, again, many different theoretical candidates, but nothing confirmed. However, there are several experiments around the world bent on detecting dark matter particles in the lab - if one succeeds, we might be one step closer.</li>
<li>The accelerating expansion of the universe is, as far as I know, unexplained (this is sometimes known as dark energy). Don't know much about that though.</li>
<li>A bit less fundamental, but technologically important: High-temperature superconductivity has been experimentally observed and even put into practice for such things as superconducting magnets, but we don't really know how it works - the theories of superconductivity we have predict that it should only be possible at really low temperatures around absolute zero. This is especially bad since, because we dont know how it works, we can also not predict what types of materials might be superconductive at high temperatures. There is a lot of resarch done in this field, so I think we might see an answer to that some time in the future.</li>

<p>The simplest option is a cosmological constant. If it's that then there is probably nothing left to explain. It's just another fundamental constant in the equations. Other options could be more interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this from a cosmology perspective:</p>
<p>About 21 years ago we discovered that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (dark energy, 2011 Nobel Prize). We finally measured gravitational waves in 2015 (2017 Nobel Prize). Arguably the biggest change is that we've had a ton of experiments come along that give us better pictures of the large scale structure of our universe (e.g. Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Dark Energy Survey, and CFHTLenS) and better pictures of the &quot;baby universe&quot; (e.g. WMAP, Planck, and BICEP). These have led us to the most precise measurements of cosmological and fundamental physics parameters to date.</p>
<p>What questions still remain? We don't know what dark matter is, though we are pushing the theoretically boundaries for ruling out certain models of it. Dark energy is also unknown, but as /u/mfb- pointed out the answer may just be &quot;it's a cosmological constant&quot; which doesn't allow much more to be said. We are trying to understand which, if any, model of inflation is correct. There are also tensions within the standard Lambda CDM cosmological model we don't understand. For example, the Hubble parameter measured from the early universe is in tension with the value measured from that late universe at the 4.4 sigma level. Similarly, a different parameter S_8 is discrepant at about the 3 sigma level when early and late universe measurements are compared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A huge advance has been made in the field of planet detection. 20 years ago we had discovered about 50 planets, and they were just sort of trickling in as we happened to look for them. Kepler (and K2) alone has since discovered over 2000 planets, and we have almost 4400 confirmed exoplanet discoveries, with Gaia expected to discover tens of thousands more, and we’re talking about atmospheric characterization of super-Earths with JWST. This has also led to an explosion of planetary science and planetary formation studies. The Big Question of habitability and aliens (insert History Channel guy here) remains, but we’re probably not too far (in scientific terms, that is, probably still a couple decades) from being able to look at a planet and say “yes, humans could live there.”</p></div>		</li>
