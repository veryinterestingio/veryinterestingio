			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, from an evolutionary standpoint I don't see why not. A smaller body would requires less food to grow and sustain, probably. I'm thinking something like a giant cookie cutter shark. Takes a big ol' bite of passing whale and goes on it's merry little way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the bigger the teeth, the more surface area, and the more difficult it is to use those teeth. </p>
<p>The bigger the teeth, the more bite force required, so having huge teeth on a smaller body, wouldn't be an advantage. </p>
<p>Plus they are thought to have eaten whales as their primary diet. </p>
<p>The article also mentioned large vertebrae.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the benefit of the big teeth? They'd be like a hydraulic hammer connected to an electric toothbrush. </p>
<p>Teeth are just the gripping part of the jaw, which needs to be able to move the teeth. That means a huge jaw, which only helps if they're eating huge prey, which requires a huge digestive system...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you heard of the real life &quot;cookie cutter shark&quot;, called the Greenland Shark? Its teeth are like a sawblade that it uses to cut little circles and patterns out of seals and whales. Most of them have parasite worms that live and dangle out of their eyes, so most are blind.</p>
<p>Here's a great video on them. Scientists noticed seals turning up with really weird cookie cutter chunks taken out of them, and eventually they start finding out more about the little known Greenland Shark and realizing that it's what's doing the cuts. Usually it only lives very deep in the ocean (why they're all blind), but sometimes they come up to attack seals:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not as long as people estimate but it was definitely a strong, bulky predator. It definitely needed a large jaw and teeth in order to grasp its large prey preferences.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The reason for this is simple; it makes them blend in with the deep blue depths when seen from above, and makes them blend in with the white surface when seen from below. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Countershading also conceals an animal from the sides. After all, white bellies are found on many land animals that would never be seen from below.</p>
<p>It works by cancelling out the shark's self-shadowing. This takes away a clue that many creatures use to help them perceive the shape of 3D objects, making the shark less noticeable against almost any background.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course from the fossil record alone we would probably not have any idea that the frigate bird, for example, sported a giant red inflatable chest sac. Although unlikely in a shark I always wonder about what wierd unknown appendages dinosaurs may have had.</p></div>		</li>
