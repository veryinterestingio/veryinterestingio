			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation of why many people don't care about the captions. </p>
<p>It also just depends on the bar - I've seen CC plenty of times at bars. If OP asked politely, I'm sure they would turn them on for him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, watching sport with captions on is really annoying.
