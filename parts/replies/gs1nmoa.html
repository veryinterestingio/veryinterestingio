			<div class="markdown"><p>I do database management for a company that works in exactly this way. We act as an agency for people who work as subcontractors. Part of the service we provide is tax compliance for contract labourers. I can not name the company, but we operate out of the UK and can cut an international worker's taxes by 30 or more percent.</p>
<p>I worked for many years as a subcontractor and wa responsible for my own taxes.</p></div>		</li>
