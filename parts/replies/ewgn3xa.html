			<div class="markdown"><p>Large families did not cause the famine. The people received a percentage of total crops. The famine was caused by communal farms over reporting the total yield of their crops so they received little, to nothing. For example if a farm reported a 10 ton yield, even though it was 5 tons, the government took all 5 tons. This was because Mao wanted China to be on par with the Soviet Union &amp; USA so he created unrealistic goals which was impossible to meet. Everyone was afraid to tell Mao this. It also didn't help they took melted down all the tools down to make (impure) steel that couldn't be used anyways due to poor quality. </p>
<p>ELI5: I grow food for government. Government gives me some food, and takes the rest. I lie to government about how much I grew to make them happy, and now I have nothing for myself. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but Mao felt that steel was the backbone of a strong country. So he pulled people from agriculture to produce steel in their backyards creating useless scrap metal (you need a clean furnace and you need to maintain high temperatures - you can only get this from fossil fuels, they were using wood, their furniture etc). It was the stupidest thing ever. It'd have been funny if 20-30 million didn't die...</p></div>		</li>
