I'm not an expert by any means, this is entirely based on the little knowledge/first hand experience I have and other comments on this post about how the washer/dryer decides its cycling-- and some barely educated guesses. That said, I've had more than one washer and dryer that would buzz and not open til the drum settled.</p></div>		</li>

Then it unlocks.</p>
