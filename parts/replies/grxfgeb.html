<p>The British Blue Steel missile, attached to Vulcan and Victor  bombers, in the 1960s, was produced by AVRO.  It used 85% concentration  of HTP.  To light the twin chamber Stemtor rocket, HTP passed through a  catalyst screen.  Kerosene was then injected into the two chambers to  produce 20,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds of thrust each.</p>
