			<div class="markdown"><p>While  the new B.1.1.7 variant of  SARS-CoV-2 has an unusually high number of  mutations (possibly due to  prolonged replication in an immunodeficient  person?), only a few of  them are to the spike protein.  The off-spike  mutations shouldn't  affect the vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>They   just came out with a preliminary analysis of the mutations and the ECDC   (the European version of the CDC) came out with a threat assessment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One   of these (the N501Y mutation) occurs in the region of the Spike   protein,the receptor binding domain (RBD), that the virus uses to bind   to the human ACE2 receptor. Changes in this region of the Spike protein   can result in the virus changing its ACE2 binding specificity and alter   antibody recognition.Two other mutations (N439K and Y453F) also occur  in  the RBD region and increase binding affinity to ACE2, and have been   shown to escape the neutralising effect of a few monoclonal antibodies   (mAbs).<a href="https://www.cogconsortium.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Report-1_COG-UK_19-December-2020_SARS-CoV-2-Mutations.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cogconsortium.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Report-1\_COG-UK\_19-December-2020\_SARS-CoV-2-Mutations.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.cogconsortium.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Report-1\_COG-UK\_19-December-2020\_SARS-CoV-2-Mutations.pdf</a></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So,   sure, in theory, it might impact antibody recognition.  But escaping   from a few select neutralizing mAbs isn't the same as escaping from the   entire polyclonal humoral response generated by the vaccine.</p>
<p>The scariest thing I've seen is this study <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1.full" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1.full" target="_blank">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1.full</a></a> showing that the N439K mutation was escaping the nAbs in the sera of people naturally recovered from covid infection.</p>
<p>But   most of these mutations have already been circulating, just not in   combination: the N501Y mutation has also been circulating since July, at   least, in the U.S. (<a href="https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/2020/12/20/new-covid-19-variant-was-identified-last-summer" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/2020/12/20/new-covid-19-variant-was-identified-last-summer" target="_blank">https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/2020/12/20/new-covid-19-variant-was-identified-last-summer</a></a>), the N439K mutation was circulating since summer in at least a few countries <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219063v2.full-text#T1" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219063v2.full-text#T1" target="_blank">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.25.20219063v2.full-text#T1</a></a>.  So on their own, these mutations don't seem to have prevented high vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>Together,   will they? We don't have any analysis of the people infected in the   vaccine groups that would let us know what happened (i.e. did they fail   to generate strong polyclonal nAb responses to the vaccine?  Or were   they infected with weird strains that escaped their vaccine-induced   responses?)</p>
<p>So it's really too   early to say whether the combination of antibody-escaping spike   mutations found in B.1.1.7 will have a significant effect on vaccine   efficacy.</p>
<p>This was basically the  conclusion of the ECDC threat assessment</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based   on the number and location of spike protein mutations, it seems likely   that some reduction in neutralisation by antibodies will be seen, but   there is as yet no evidence that there is a resulting impact on   increased risk for reinfection or lower vaccine effectiveness. Some   level of reduction in neutralisation by convalescent sera and monoclonal   antibodies has been observed to date for a wide range of variantswith   unclear clinical impactNo  phenotypic data are available for the new  variant and no data are  available with respect to the ability of  antibodies elicited by vaccines  under development to neutralise this  variant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without a doubt, it will be closely monitored.</p>
<p>The   nice thing about the mRNA platform is that it should be able to  respond  speedily so that the vaccine can adapt quickly if the strain  proves  capable of escaping the vaccine-induced response.</p>
<p>But it's impossible to say right now whether that will be necessary for B.1.1.7</p></div>		</li>
