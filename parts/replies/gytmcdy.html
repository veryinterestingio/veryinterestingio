			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that people should know about their family history, age related fertility decline, fertility threatening conditions, and how to prepare for pregnancy. We just don't talk about this enough! Rather than have &quot;maternity leave&quot; women should be given &quot;first trimester leave.&quot; I could go on and on :) I wish I could change policies in the US immediately to address the problems I see.-DrAimee</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, This Dr. Duke. I have always seen a natural connection between virology and the study of reproductive endocrinology &amp; infertility. Viruses and viral genomes play major roles in embryo development and early pregnancy; roles of which many remain understudied or not yet known. As a virologist, my approach to everything from my approach to evaluating issues related to conception such as early implantation failure or early pregnancy loss to preparing a patient for their second or third trimesters includes assessing whether any viral factors may interfere with their health or their ability to successfully continue their pregnancy. In addition, the field of virology naturally dovetails into study of possible therapeutic applications for viral vectored gene therapy and even vaccine delivery and then investigating for any impacts on reproduction.</p></div>		</li>
