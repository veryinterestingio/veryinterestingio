<li>No. (There has been some research on this, and the current consensus is definitely not.)</li>
<li>We don't know if the acceleration of cosmic expansion might stop in the future. It's  theoretically possible, if dark energy is a dynamical field, but we don't have any evidence that it will. From our current understanding and all the best available data, it looks like the expansion will keep accelerating forever.</li>
<li>The whole conservation of energy thing is a lot more complicated on scales of the entire cosmos, especially if you don't consider the cosmos to be a closed system. There are a few different ways to think about energy on those scales, but none of them are as simple as &quot;the universe can't end because of conservation of energy.&quot;</li>
<li>I'm not sure exactly what this refers to, but there are some models of a post-Heat-Death universe that involve spontaneous creation of new universes. I discuss this a bit in the Heat Death chapter of my book.</li>
