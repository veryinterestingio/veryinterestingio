			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how our SOPs were developed back when I was in. We usually stacked like 5 tracers in the top and bottom the magazine. First tracers out were so the rest of the patrol could see where you were firing to identify enemy locations. Last several tracers were to let you know you were running dry in that mag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I think it was pretty standard across the board. Last thing you want is to pull the trigger when you have a shot lined up and nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh buddy well let me tell you my story.</p>
<p>I was a SAW gunner in Ramadi on my first deployment. We are running a night op in the city (still RIPin with previous unit) and I'm crossing a street when I see this dude with a fucking AK step out from a doorway like 20 meters from me. I lock eyes with this dude and it's like that quick draw moment in old westerns. So I throw up my SAW and pull the trigger to squeeze off some rounds at this dude and all I hear is..... Click. My blood runs fucking cold and I remember that I never put my SAW in condition 1. This dude starts blasting off rounds at me (and I'm sure he was just as surprised at I was to see me so close). I piss myself running across the street to cover.</p>
<p>Learned my lesson about keeping my weapon on condition 1 after that.</p>
<p>Literally the next time I was on a night patrol on the outskirts of the city and we take contact. Instead of finding cover, I take a knee and decided to gain fire superiority for the team. Squeeze the trigger and hear a single bang. Fucking jammed. Rounds snapping and cracking and whistling all over. Green tracers overhead. So I do remedial action and fire a second single shot before it jammed. I fired about half a drum of 249 one single shot at a time that night. Had some sort of feeding issue with the belt.</p>
<p>I have lots of experience with lining up shots only to hear click as a machine gunner ðŸ˜‚. I guess that's why you don't initiate ambushes with open bolt weapons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the answer to this would be what people were answering...how do you know when you were about to be out. Instead I see a stream of  &quot;when you pull the trigger and nothing happens, you are out of bullets&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't that also give away your exact location? I mean, they would generally know the vicinity, but I would think for an enemy on say a bit of a flank [so it's not aimed at you], it would be great to see a whole platoon worth of tracers to let me know exactly how people are spread out? [I could be misusing words/etc. I've only ever played games].</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, on a combat patrol (which is to my knowledge the most common type of engagement these days), they already know where you are. Usually, you can't fire unless fired upon, so it's a moot point.</p>
<p>The idea would be to get as many guns on target as quick as possible so that you can establish fire superiority and gain control of the engagement.</p>
<p>I am an avionics technician who went through basic combat training and have ex-infantry friends. So all my knowledge is pretty basic and/or second hand, and I'd be happy to be corrected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah tracers do work both ways. Although rifles are pretty dang loud and give away your general position too. Machine gun belts all have tracers every few rounds by default. Luckily tracers don't really start showing up to the enemy until they've traveled a little.</p>
<p>But yes, it's a concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what the U.S. did in WWII with aircraft: last rounds were tracers.  Excerpt from Oberstleutnant Killinger instructing his interrogation staff in a POW briefing:</p>
<p>&quot;Second: What is the significance of the shooting of ten-straight white tracer bullets in combat?&quot;</p>
<p>They didn't know.</p>
<p>And they found out.</p>
<p><strong>Interrogator Hanns Joachim Scharff,</strong> talking to a POW pilot: &quot;It is too bad America did not have more experience in working off English bases, since it sometimes overloads your industry back home, such as they now have run out of the chemicals they use to make red tracer bullets.  Those white ones you fellows are using in your dogfights must be rather hard to follow with your eyes, so you have to shoot a whole string of them; ten, twenty, even fifty of them.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Liutenant Peter Pompetti</strong>: &quot;Ha! You're nuts, Hanns; they haven't run out of much of anything back home. White tracers are just our own way of warning ourselves.  When ten of them or any big batch of them shows up, you know you'd better start heading for home pronto because you have just shot out your last ammo. The guns are empty.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Hanns</strong> (thinking to himself): &quot;I ignored his answer, outwardly by changing the subject to a more trivial subject, like central heating as used in the USA, but my mind was thinking how valuable this bit of info would be to our own fighter pilots. When they would see those white streaks, they would know the enemy plane was now defenseless.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid Q: Are tracer bullets still bullets? Or are they only like guiding blanks that glow?</p>
<p>I guess my question is if they are as deadly as a normal bullet, or if they are some sort of pyrotechnics that consumes in flight to do the tracing thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My SAW gunners generally preferred the 100-round canvas bags, rather than the 200-round plastic drums. They tended to stay on better and rarely gave feed-related stoppages, but you unfortunately had half the belt length. 100's for the initial belt, 200's for any subsequent reloads.</p></div>		</li>
