<p>That I get, because a faulty panel will have some short circuits or higher internal resistance for some reason. However, if the ambient temperature is 20 degrees celcius, then the temperature of a panel in operation shouldn't be less than 20 degC?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no, not cooler than ambient temperature. On a second read-through I've noticed I may have misinterpreted your original question.</p>
<p>Solar panels still only convert about 20% of the solar energy hitting them into electricity. And since they are rather dark, they become quite warm.</p>
<p>But the reason why malfunctioning panels are warmer than ones actively providing electricity that is being used is even simpler than you think: malfunctioning panels have an efficiency of 0%. So the panels producing electricity take 20% of the solar energy hitting them and converting it to electricity, so there is less heat left to, well, heat up the panel. The panels that are malfunctioning take in all the solar energy that hits them (minus reflected energy obviously) and convert all of it to heat by simply being dark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solar panels are typically 10-20 degrees hotter than ambient air temperature because they absorb more of the IR spectrum than air does (as indeed do most solids)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Just being a stickler to include visible light</p>
<p>They are 10-20 degrees hotter because they absorb both visible and infrared. Sunlight is roughly 50/50 Visible and Infrared. ( little more IR than Vis) but the amount of each that's absorbed is not in the same proportions. Some of the IR probably goes right through them, not sure. And then you have reflectivity changes based on the angle of the light.... . Way outside my field of expertise so maybe someone else will correct me, but I think it's a good generalization to say things are hot because 1/2 visible and 1/2 infrared.</p></div>		</li>
