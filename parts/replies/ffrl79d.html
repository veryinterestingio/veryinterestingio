			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say specifically, but it likely adds to the carcinogenic properties just by way of having more ingredients than naturally present. I'm sure stuff like burn-time agents and flavorings aren't doing your lungs any favors ya feel?</p>
<p>&quot;Tar&quot; isn't a great term for it. Tar is already used in asphalt repair, and refers to a petrochemical. Marijuana smokers call it &quot;resin&quot;, and that works I guess? But it's a by-product of the combustion, you see it on filters when smoking cigarettes, they slowly turn from white to brown as you burn through them.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar" target="_blank">Tar is a dark brown or black viscous liquid of hydrocarbons and free carbon, obtained from a wide variety of organic materials through destructive distillation.</a></p>
<p>Calling it resin is imo incorrect, resin is the sticky stuff some plants, including cannabis, produce. Terpenes and shit.</p></div>		</li>
