			<div class="markdown"><p>to clarify a point, as there are two factors here at play, Satiety (satedness, derived from satisfaction) and Fullness</p>
<p>volume without nutrients = fullness, but not sated</p>
<p>Nutrients without volume = no fullness, and no satedness (satiety requires fullness to some extent)</p>
<p>Volume + Nutrients = Full and Sated.</p>
<p>you can be sated without being full, for example, a glucose pill can really take the edge off hunger, but you wont feel as if you are full, nor will you be properly sated, but it can satisfy your hunger for a small while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really a way, but learning portion sizes that leave you feeling full and not hungry for a good few hours is a good place to start. satiety comprises a balancing act of several hormones and also encompasses cravings, it's more of an analogue scale, if you've eaten well and have enough calories, you shouldnt feel like eating for a reasonable time after. It's a very complex system all in all, and I won't pretend I understand all of the nuance, I think if there was a good answer for your question, obesity would be far less prevalent!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a few years ago that ancient varieties of fruit &amp; veg had certain nutrients/chemicals that would also trigger a &quot;stop eating, you're full&quot; reaction, but in our efforts to create a larger more resilient crop we've basically bred those chemicals out of the foods we eat.</p>
<p>I do not know the science behind it, maybe someone else does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not necessarily a good attribute, anyway. You have to eat, for example, a shitton of broccoli to get adequate protein and calories. A low-cal veg that triggered the “full feeling” too early would be detrimental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadn't heard about that, but I'm not sure it's plausible.</p>
<p>I mean overeating and obesity have only been a problem for one particular species (humans) for a very, very short period of time (&lt;100 years). The creatures that we inherited our digestive system from had the opposite problem, and getting enough calories was important for survival.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if an animal feels it has eaten enough after consuming a certain fruit or vegetable, even though that fruit or vegetable doesn't contain a lot of calories, that animal would probably not make it through the next starvation period and be eliminated from the gene pool.</p>
<p>In other words, feeling full after consuming low calorie plants is something that evolution most likely would have selected against, because for our ancestors that would have been pretty dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation!
Although I’m kinda suspicious of the “volume without nutrients = not feeling full”. As someone stated that clearly if you were to eat 2 full heads of iceberg lettuce you’d definitely “feel full” even though not consuming many calories/nutrients?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps the lingo in my answer was a bit too simplistic. The two types of 'feeling full' I was talking about are scientifically called satiation (the one that makes you stop eating) and satiety (the ones that makes you delay the next meal).</p>
<p>Satiation requires volume and nutrients, and it's different from just feeling physically full, so I guess that would be a third kind of full.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, eating just salada i could feel full, but not satisfied. </p>
<p>Same could happen when exhausted and I'd eat some dry food. Like rice and dry meat. I'd not be able to eat a lot before feeling full. Not so sure on the reason behind that one though.</p></div>		</li>
