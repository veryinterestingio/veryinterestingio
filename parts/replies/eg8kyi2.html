			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way. </p>
<p>If you have a shoebox with stacks of quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies, and then you shake it up, you would expect it to become a mix. You could keep shaking it, but it won't ever not be a mix. </p>
<p>This shows how particles prefer to be mixed when there's nothing stopping them from being mixed. It's a result of entropy. </p>
<p>You could introduce some kind of magnetic field and some coins would separate out to one side while the other coins wouldn't move. That's kind of like oil and water; there's some kind of interaction that prevents everything from staying mixed.</p>
<p>So unless there's a reason it shouldn't mix, you'd expect things to stay mixed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well this is just wrong. seen as the smaller and larger coins will separate </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough if you have a mix of different size coins and shake them up you tend to get clumps of same size stacked against each other. It's not perfect but helps a little when sorting change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read once that when people develop a recipe for a product to market, they will need to consult a food chemist at some stage to make the product shelf stable. The chemist will include ingredients that prevent separation, color change, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this has already been mentioned but two liter bottles back in the day were solid black plastic the bottom 1/4, exactly because the color coloring would sink to the bottom (not al the way, just enough to gross people out). Somehow they figured out the chemistry and that has gone away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For the fat in milk, you stir until the fat ends up in tiny little spheres with water around them</p>

<p>One of the coolest things I saw under a microscope was milk.  Like you have all these small &quot;balls&quot; of white stuff with clear liquid around them and my professor asks us, &quot;What is it?&quot;  Of course, we're all like, &quot;Umm maybe some cells or something?&quot;  No it's milk!  Wut.  Microscopically, milk is just round balls of fat in &quot;water&quot;.  That blew my mind for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To get the clumps of fat near to each other and start combining back into bigger clumps is a higher energy state, and in general, things want to stay at the lowest energy. It basically takes more energy to get the water (like little sticky magnets) out of the way that's keeping the fat separate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even then you have to open up the micelles (little balls of fatty acids) so that the hydrophilic (lit. loves water) heads get out of the way so that the hydrophobic (lit. fears water) tails can mix and form larger micelles. Which also requires more energy. </p></div>		</li>
