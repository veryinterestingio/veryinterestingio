			<div class="markdown"><p>I said this comment on the original thread but I will add it here also. While cows, goats, and sheep are all ruminants (4 chambered stomach, foregut fermenters) goats and sheep tend to browse more than graze. </p>
<p>The difference between browsing and grazing is that browsers will each anything (leaves, sticks, bark, grass) whereas grazers will only eat grass/plants low to the ground. Cows can be browsers but their symbiotic rumen bacteria are very efficient at breaking down cellulose (what makes up cell walls of plants) that they don't really need to be browsers. (The rumen being the first chamber of their 4 chambered stomach). I imagine that along with poor water retention, is why their feces are different than that of their other ruminant counterparts. The giraffes I used to work with also had nice little round feces balls but they will also eat leaves and other stuff from trees, not just grasses. That leads me to believe browsing habits have something to do with how the feces come out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lagomorphs are tricky. They practice coprophagy where they eat their feces to get as much nutrient content and fluid/water out of that as possible. That compacts the feces.</p></div>		</li>
