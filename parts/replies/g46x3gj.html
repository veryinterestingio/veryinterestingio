			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. That makes sense. So I guess to expand on that, why are the smoke particles different then the water vapor particles in clouds or fog when it comes to what wavelengths of light travel through them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The size is a big difference. So different colors of light have different wavelengths. Smoke particles are really tiny, and let large wavelength red, orange, yellow light through nicely, compared to other colors that are scattered more. </p>
<p>Water is more transparent and droplets are a lot bigger, so it actually absorbs those smaller colors, reds etc, and lets the smaller wavelength (higher energy) blue, green, purple through better. For example the ocean is blue-ish, and gets more blue the further you go down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some of the chemicals may be impermeable to some light, or it may absorb some kinds of light while water vapor is fully permeable to light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve had this question for a while but never had a good chance to ask it, but this seems like a good spot.</p>
<p>We have blue skies and red/orange sunsets because of the thickness of our atmosphere. It seems like a pure coincidence of physics that we get this wide range of color in our skies. Would other planets with thicker atmospheres have only red skies?  Is it possible for the sky to scatter almost all visible light, leaving only infrared to pass through?  Would a thinner atmosphere give us a purple sky?</p>
<p>It just seems like our atmosphere hit the sweet spot for variety of color, against the odds.</p>
<p>Edit: Nevermind, I think we've got an answer based on what /u/Saedius said, and further consideration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah certainly. It's possible that on another planet we could have evolved to see ultraviolet, microwave, infrared, and other electromagnetic radiation. Some animals can see at least ultraviolet. And those would be just as &quot;colorful&quot; if we could sense them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both, the variety of wavelengths occurs before any eyes see them.</p>
<p>Good insight though, since even though another planet may have a light spectrum that goes from, say, ultraviolent at the high end to green light at the low end, the species of that planet may evolve vision that displays the full rainbow of colors over the smaller spectrum.</p>
<p>In other words, the rainbow is in our brain, not in the sky, so it doesn't really matter what wavelengths are in the sky.  It seems I have arrived at my answer.  Thanks for the help!</p></div>		</li>
