			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one for about a year and honestly it impressed me with the accuracy. It could reliably tell the difference between laying on the couch and watching Netflix and laying on the couch and taking a nap, and it would also accurately tell me how many times I woke up during a night of sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive had a charge 2 for almost 2years and it does this. When i take a nap it logs the nap, and the nights im constantly tossing and turning it logs that too fairly well. Its not perfect but it gets the times fairly right and everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Maybe once a year it misses and logs lounging for napping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it gets a rhythm of your normal heartrate and movements, and then goes on to compare deviations from there. Im sure there is some scientific formula that says when you arent moving and x% below normal they are either sleeping.</p>
<p>What i dont get is how accurate they are in terms of restlessness. I had a charge HR for about two years and it would accurately tell me the amount of hours I slept, when I was restless during the night, and how I slept.  Something like 7 hours of sleep, but from 5:12-7:39 you were restless and you woke up at 7:43 or something.</p>
<p>And i felt super restless and my bed looked like i was tossing and turning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing a sensitivity setting for this in the app. It had two options. But with the higher sensitivity it said my sleep quality was terrible with a lot of restlessness (a bit concerning) and with the lower setting it detected me being still on the bed awake as sleeping. There wasn't a &quot;just right&quot; setting I could use. (But this was from an older device a few years ago).</p>
<p>If you haven't already done so, you could check out an app like Sleep as Android. Among other functions, you could use the sleep recording feature, which records movement and noises after it's activated. So, when you listen to it later, you'd hear the tossing and turning noises and could compare it against the Fitbit data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine showed a lot of restlessness so considering a bunch of other symptoms, I got referred to a sleep specialist. I did a couple of sleep studies but I think the equipment and hospital bed kept me from moving, because the restlessness continued at home. Then my (amazing) sister made me a weighted blanket and the difference it makes is huge. It's too heavy for me to be restless if I wanted to. My Fitbit reflected it, with just a few instances of brief restlessness here and there, though that could probably be attributed to sleeping with a bed hogging dog who hates my weighted blanket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Occasionally I'd fall asleep on the couch watching Netflix before bedtime. It was able to guess quite well (within 5-10 minutes) of when I nod off. I know because I calculated how far back I have to rewind the show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on which one you get, right? The ones with HR monitors would be more accurate than ones without I would think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, the fitbits that track heart rate will tell you detailed guesses such as how long you were in very deep sleep vs how long you were in light sleep. it will also pick up when you were awake in the night and how long you were awake for before you fell asleep again.</p>
<p>the lite fitbit devices that only track movement and no heart rate will only make general guesses of how long you were asleep for. it's not sensitive enough to tell you if you woke up for a few minutes, or what stage of sleep you were in.</p>
<p>I've owned both fitbit devices and, even though the devices make guesses from collected data and are not intended to be as accurate as an actual sleep tracking device, I reckon that the heart rate fitbits are quite close to what real results would be. when I was in nursing school I used to study sleep cycles as I suffered from bouts of adult nightmares and sleep paralysis. i found rem cycles fascinating and I perused the library in my free time to understand it more. from the research done on how long we stay in each stage of sleep, how many times we may dream per night, and how many times we sleep without dreaming, etc, it just felt like the results I got from my HR fitbit were atleast correct even if it was not super accurate down to the very minute.</p>
<p>I think where the device may struggle is after long term use, the battery becomes flimsy, it starts having issues with its internal memory and what data it doesn't fully write before the next charge. i noticed the sleep tracking would go dead for a couple hours and in other areas of the fitbit tracker it was sporadic. I haven't had a fitbit last more than 10 months before the device stopped syncing with the app because of battery issues or memory issues...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heart rate monitor on Fitbit is wildly inaccurate. The chest straps that are used by polar and Garmin products is highly accurate and the Fitbit is typically 10 to 15 beats per minute off and they have no explanation for it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual Fitbit or is it from another manufacturer? When I'm not wearing mine, it doesn't measure any hearbeat (of course) so it 'knows' I'm not wearing it's and doesn't record any data at all.</p></div>		</li>
