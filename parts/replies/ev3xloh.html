			<div class="markdown"><p>A good parallel to this is remembering that Bush proclaimed in the middle of several unwinnable wars in the Middle East that we would be the first country to put a man on Mars, and pretty much every person in Congress was like &quot;No.&quot;  </p>
<p>He backed down pretty quick, because Congress wouldn't fund the billions of dollars necessary to investigate the matter, and it ultimately wasn't worth it with two thirds of the nation's budget going towards those aforementioned wars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: Maybe not “super sick”, but it’s clear that extended time in space has pretty severe effects on the body.</p>

<p>All these studies on the Kellys indicate that the effects of space travel can be mitigated but it’s definitely rough on ya.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not very scalable, each rocket is a different design and needs different engines (though sometimes you can just add multiple smaller engines if it still fits).</p>
<p>Radiation in Low Earth Orbit is mostly ok, a lot is blocked/deflected by the magnetosphere, no official solution yet for beyond LEO long term, even the NASA lunar gateway will be unmanned for the vast majority of the time.  Once cost to orbit comes down, and on orbit refueling becomes more of a thing, we could build heavier designs with lead walls or a bunch of water around crew areas relatively easily</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, they are not. But acting like NASA is just doing all this cool stuff and congress just gets in the way is putting the cart before the horse. As a branch of the government, what latitude NASA has is given to it by congress. Its nature as a tool of the state defines it.</p></div>		</li>
