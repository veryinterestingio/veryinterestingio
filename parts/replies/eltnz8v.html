<p>Also why it was the norm before modern medicine, why birthdays are a thing, why some births aren't celebrated until a year after the event in some cultures...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A study of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ailanthus_altissima" target="_blank">invasive tree</a> has some numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The remarkable success of Ailanthus invasion into the United States is due in part to prolific seed production and prolonged fecundity. In this study, it was established that Ailanthus seed production can begin as early as 4â€“5 years and can extend &gt;100 years, at which time seed viability can exceed 65%.  </p>
<p>...  </p>
<p>Total lifetime seed production is dependent upon the individual lifespan of the tree, but females that live 40 years will easily produce <strong>10 million seeds</strong> during their lifetime, whereas exceptionally fecund long-lived trees may produce in excess of &gt;50 million seeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Million.  Seeds.  At greater than 65% viability.  There's a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/8/7/226/pdf" target="_blank">table in the study</a> (PDF) that gives some numbers, but they studied trees from 7 to 104 years old and they all have the same reproductive properties.  Several other studies estimated 27,000 seeds annually per tree, another pegged it at 564,000 - 3,793,000 seeds per tree.  Per tree! Per year! Crazy.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think this is pretty much the best explanation.  Because seeds are nutritious but incapable of moving to escape herbivores, a lot of plants produce far more than are actually needed to maintain stable populations.  In more formal ecological terms, these sorts of organisms are called &quot;r-selected&quot;, and have <a href="https://images.slideplayer.com/32/9799523/slides/slide_3.jpg" target="_blank">very high mortality rates</a> for early life stages which then flatten out (like the oysters on that graph).  This is in contrast with &quot;K-selected&quot; organisms like humans, which tend to have fairly low mortality rates for most of our lives until we reach old age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it's a relative comparison to other species that might have 99% infant mortality rate.  Also, I think 80% sounds a bit high for human infant mortality rate; maybe just pre-reproductive age mortality in general?</p></div>		</li>
