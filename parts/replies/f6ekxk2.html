			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the link between Bernoulli’s principle and sonic flow?</p>
<p>Edit: My understanding is that the principle doesn’t apply because the flow isn’t contained once outside the nozzle. Low pressure at boundary between the two steams won’t cause a diversion in just one direction because both sides have the same pressure. I don’t understand how Bernoulli’s principle could apply if this wasn’t supersonic flow from a converging-diverging nozzle, and would very much like to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't capture everything going on. Unless senility has set in bernoulli's equation is an energy balance equation. Nothing wrong with that. But doesn't deal with energy stored as compression. So doesn't provide correct answers for compressible flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bernoulli's law is only accurate when you assume that a flow is incompressible (also has to be inviscid, steady, and irrotational).  Past a Mach number of about 0.3, the incompressible assumption falls apart, so you can't use Bernoulli's for supersonic flow (Mach &gt; 1).</p></div>		</li>
