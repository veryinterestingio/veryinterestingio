			<div class="markdown"><p>When the bees feel too cramped or want to move they swarm. What that is either the existing queen and roughly half of the population will leave and the new queen takes over the hive or they will make a swarm queen and when she has matured she will leave the hive with roughly half of the population. Then they fly around and search for a new home. That is when you see those big clumps of bees hanging out on a tree or other structure. The Queen isn't a very good flyer so they fly for short distances and the rest while scouts go out and look for a new hive location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new queen and half the remaining hive fly out in a swarm. They are looking for a new place to build their hive. When you see honeybee swarms out and about, this is what is happening; the Queen has landed somewhere and the workers are swarming around her. (They are very docile while swarming, believe it or not!)</p>
<p>Once they find their place, they build a new hive and live their bee lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are superceeding queen cells and swarming queen cells. The later are queens reared prepping for a swarm. A superceeding queen is intended to take over an old or underperforming queen within a hive. You can tell which one you have by where the queen cell is located on the frame. In the center, or on an edge. An it's not unusual to have several of both types in a hive at one time.</p></div>		</li>
