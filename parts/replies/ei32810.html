			<div class="markdown"><p>Along these lines, think about the placement of the thermostat sensor vs. the location of the vents.  The heat kicks on, the locations nearest the vents warm up first.  This in turn &quot;spreads the heat&quot; until it the air surrounding the sensor is warm enough for the sensor to say &quot;OK, that's enough,&quot; and shuts the heat off. </p>
<p>By that time, the other areas of the building have warmed up well above the target temperature, as much as 5 to 10 degrees more, depending on the size of the rooms and distance to the sensor. Then after a while the rooms equalize in temperature, and then will equalize to the temperature of the walls &amp; outdoors. Yay, thermodynamics!</p>
<p><del>Coincidentally</del> Consequently, this is why the sensor is never placed in the same room (or near) the vents.  They'd shut off before the other areas reach the target temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep this. Especially on multi-floor households. Heat rises. Our top floor is always several degrees warmer than the bottom floor, and there's not much you can do about that. Rooms with more windows/more exterior walls will also be colder in winter, or hotter on sunny days when the sun is shining into those windows.</p>
<p>You can get multi-zone systems with multiple thermostats to reduce this problem, but fundamentally it's very difficult to get an entire building all at exactly the same temperature.</p>
<p>Some newer thermostats can run the fans separately from the heating/cooling, which helps, though doesn’t entirely eliminate the discrepancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to multi-zone systems better modern thermostats let you program periods of fan blowing with no temperature control. Something like every 20 minutes my system will run the fan for something like 5 minutes even if no heating or cooling is necessary. This circulates the air throughout the house and prevents those hot and dead zones from forming.</p>
<p>This can be done pretty much regardless of what setup you have, and if your thermostat can't do it an upgrade will probably pay for itself within a few months depending on how much you over heat/cool your house to compensate for the weird zones.</p>
<p>Between that and a couple new registers cut in to help the air get back to the basement (where the system is) the comfort in my home is waaay higher than before hand, there is barely any difference in temperature throughout the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, my parents did a massive remodel of their house when I was a kid.  They added 8 feet onto the back of the house, and turned the attic into a full master bedroom.  They also took this opportunity, of the house being opened up, to install central air.  </p>
<p>The problem is that that room was the only one on that floor, so it didn't have it's own AC compressor.  This meant that the temp was set for the rooms on the 2nd floor, but the 3rd floor was always considerably hotter because it was on the top, and all the roof insulation kept the heat in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bedroom is the smallest in the house and the most well-insulated, and our thermostat is on the 1st floor (bedrooms on 2nd floor). The result is I get crazy heating/cooling, so my room is 10-20°F different than the thermostat temp. Like thermostat heat set to 62 = bedroom is 80; thermostat AC set to 75, bedroom is 62. Even when I close my vent it only helps marginally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HVAC guy here and just want to clarify this comment. It is generally true in most instances. With the addition of &quot;Smart&quot; thermostats and newer algorithms for temp control, thermostat operation is not so cut and dry anymore. Most household thermostats will track temperature and heat/cool calls. It eventually will learn how long it needs to run and when it needs to shut off to maintain temperature. It'll run heat before the temperature even drops below set point. Same goes for cooling. It may warm up/cool down 2-3 degrees over/under set point, but it's not a hard line. It's learned when to shut off. The scenario you've described is more akin to office and other commercial environments, where deadband (temp gap between heat and cool settings)is minimum 2 (most often 3-4) degrees. At this point your description of the +/- 2 degrees for set point is also being utilized. This is only a very basic description of what happens in a typical application and can vary GREATLY. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for you Mr. HVAC Guy: Say a recently built house has one level split into apartments, but there is only one thermostat for that entire level, is that something that can be easily fixed? Fixed meaning having separate thermostats/independent temp control in each apartment.</p>
<p>I’m having a hard time picturing in my mind how a single heater or air conditioner would be able to control temp for both areas separately, but I am also hopeful that it could happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It cannot be easily fixed. If there's only 1 thermostat for the whole level, the system was designed to handle that entire level. If it's forced hot air (or air conditioning), there's really nothing that can be done. If you have a boiler, it would be easier to &quot;fix&quot;, but you'd need to hire a plumber anyways. Best solution is space heaters for whomever is colder. </p>
<p>Edit: you could purchase a thermostat with a wireless sensor and then use it to average the 2 sides. I still believe for heating that a space heater would be best, only because there's ALWAYS going to be one side that's uncomfortable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If OP has a modulating thermostat then it works like this, yes, but in older houses there are still a lot of on/off thermostats which just run the heater at max until they turn off. This means some of the air near the heaters is +20 degrees hotter, depending on the max temp set on the heating system itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even older thermostats will likely have a dead band.  You may have to manually switch between heating cooling but each will likely have a + 2 or - 2 degree swing.  Having a modulating heating system isn't what OP was talking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he's confusing a modulating system with a thermostat having a dead band (the temperature range that the set point sits so the thermostat isn't constantly hunting for that perfect spot).</p></div>		</li>
