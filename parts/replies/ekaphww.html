<p>I have no idea but when magnetic tape was a medium, there was one roll made and the center of the roll was the best quality and the quality diminished as the product went out to the edges.  So the center of the roll was used for professional or 'center cut' was for broadcast TV/production then the next was high end, then high end consumer, all the way to low quality at the edges.  Just wondering if paper had the same or similar production quality because it's expensive to make rolls of this stuff and to make a cheap roll doesn't sound cost effective but to have a 30 foot roll of paper where the center cut is the better, granite dusted quality while the edges are dollar store left overs makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike magnetic tape, paper tends to have more consistent quality throughout the production run. Producing higher quality paper requires a different (more expensive) process than what is used to produce low quality paper.</p></div>		</li>
