			<div class="markdown"><p>Doom 2016's colorblind setting inexplicably added a colorblind filter to the game, making everyone red/green colorblind for no discernable reason instead of changing colors to make the game more playable. It really highlighted how heavily the game relies on green lights to indicate the path the player should take, and how desperately it needed actual accessibility features.</p>
<p>Really useful tool to try to explain to someone why these features are important though...</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TInXjMPZths" target="_blank">Here's what it does.</a> I'm trying to say this was terribly implemented and useless. It's an excellent case study to see the impact this sort of thing can have because it can be enabled in-game by default without dev tools or console commands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often &quot;colorblind mode&quot; is actually what the devs enable to make themselves &quot;colorblind&quot; to assist in designing their game in a more inclusive way. Then, this mode gets left in by others who likely assume it is meant FOR colorblind people. This has been observed in many games and could be the case for the game you describe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not all of us are the same kind of colourblind, problem colours for some people aren't issues at all for others.
Very few games have options for the other kinds of colourblind, and some variations of colourblind filters actually make it much more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You nailed it.  I'm red-green color blind.  When warning lights are green/amber/red, I cannot tell them apart.  They look very similar to me.  I use an app on my phone to increase contrast.  Then I can see the difference.</p>
<p>All of those of us that are colorblind use the wrong name for colors.  I have a color called, in my head called blurple.  It's somewhere between blue and purple.  There's another color that's maybe green.  I can see verdant green, I can see orange, I cannot see a color that people call green that I see as brown.  I ask for help when I need it.  I know the ratios of ink to make whatever color you want in a Pantone book.  That's why you have a book.  It tells you.  Photoshop is your friend when color correcting.  I'm actually really good at color correction because I can't see the color.  I do it by numbers. 70.65.60,95 - 6,2,2,0.  Your inks will work.  Find your blackest black and your whitest white, match those numbers in curves to those.  It will print CMYK very pretty.  You get gorgeous plates.  Just learn your image setter.</p>
<p>Yes, I can see yellow.  Everyone always says &quot;What color is this&quot; and holds up a pencil..  It's yellow.  They're all yellow.  How would I not know that?  Also, yellow is one of the colors I can always see.</p>
<p>I cannot see pink though.  It looks white to me.  If you think that you're showing me pink, you're wrong.  You're showing me light red.  Actual pink looks white.  Straight up, no color.  It's just white.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this answers the OP's question pretty well. You can't see green, but you <em>know</em> grass is green, because it's common knowledge. If tomorrow you got glasses that allowed you to see colors (Not sure if that's possible with deuteranopia) you would know what green is because now you can see it, and you can see the green grass and know what it is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What it does is change the light so that you can tell it apart from other colors where you couldn't before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that a flashing light is a caution or an implied stop sign.  Now it's different.  They've switched to flashing green left turn lights in the Twin Cities.  Now, I have to stop because I can't tell if it's a caution or not.  It's irritating.  The old system seemed to work.  </p>
<p>If I know the area, I know what it means.  If it's a place I haven't been, I get anxious.  I know it's my fault for not seeing certain colors, but I go with safety as priority.  It's irritating when a light that used to have a protected left becomes a flashing left.  &quot;Is the light out?&quot;  &quot;What do they mean?&quot;  Sometimes it means the light is out, sometimes it's normal.  It's quite irritating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you don't mind me asking, what about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magenta" target="_blank">Magenta</a>? Obviously it's much more saturated (also more &quot;bluish&quot;) so I'm assuming you can &quot;see&quot; that, but I'm curious if you have a hard time distinguishing that one from other colours.</p>
<p>I'm only slightly colourblind, so I only mix up very light shades of pink, red, and green, especially if the lighting isn't great. I also on occasion mix up blue and purple, if they aren't perfectly pure.</p>
<p>I'd really love to try those glasses...I imagine they're fairly expensive, though.</p></div>		</li>
