			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a road cyclist, but pre-Covid I visited a friend who took me on some trails. I borrowed his bike that had a 1x drivetrain and was geared for some steep climbing. My instinct was to get off the bike and walk it up a very steep hill, but the second time I trusted the bike and used the low gear. It was crazy how easy it was to maintain a normal cadence and make it up.</p></div>		</li>
