<p>Edit: I know reddit is literally nothing but people repeating themselves but holy fucking shit I get it they're not looking for drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I travel with a large external battery. They always pull it out and look at it. Never even ask me to turn it on though. </p>
<p>Notably that could be because when I travel with it I also have cameras, tablets and other crazy abnormal amounts of electric devices so it makes sense in context. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Or a fake auxiliary hard drive.</p>
<p>Also they do that to make sure you don't have a completely discharged lithium battery ready to go supernova.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can see the shape of batteries by tuning the scanner but it takes time. They do this on laptops to see the battery cells and they know what batteries look like (they see like a billion of them a day). Not only do batteries block other stuff in the bag, they want to see the exact outlines of the cells and nothing but cells. That's why they go in separately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TSA doesn't specifically look for drugs. Their job is to prevent the plane from getting blown up or hijacked. There are lots of stories of people getting drugs past TSA</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, even if they don't block, they have so many bits (batteries, chips, case, drives, etc) that they make it hard to distinguish if anything's a bit weird. And if you've got a hand luggage bag like me (laptop, power pack, kindle, headphones, etc), that's even more noise to hide stuff in.</p></div>		</li>
