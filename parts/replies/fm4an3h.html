			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it a bit more clearly: When someone is conscious, they are actively trying to keep balance. They are basically using their muscles to keep their body in a position that is as easy to carry as possible and has the least chance of the two of you falling over. When they are NOT conscious, they are not doing this, so their body flops around and their weight shifts in your arms, making <em>your</em> muscles do much more work to keep the balance, in addition to the work they were already doing to lift the person.</p>
<p>This is where the term &quot;dead weight&quot; comes from. Two things might have the same weight, but a dead weight is harder to carry that a (cooperating) live weight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I then amaze them by deadening my weight, and suddenly they can't get me off the ground.</p>
<p>I never knew the actual science behind it, it's just like I relax my body and they can't lift me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh random tangent on “deadening weight” I learned in karate. If someone has a hold on you, like wrapped their arms around you, you can deaden you’re weight which makes it much harder for them to keep hold of you. This makes escape much easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry. That sounds traumatic. Did you ever get a new dog? Not that a new dog magically fixes grief, but I always hope that people who genuinely  care for animals go on looking after animals because otherwise the only people adopting pets will be assholes and sadists. Anyway, I bet she was a very good girl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Irrelevant.  Reread the comment from /u/CMDeml.  It's not the weight, it's the floppiness.  Futon mattresses have to be floppy so they can go up and down without getting bent out of shape...</p></div>		</li>
