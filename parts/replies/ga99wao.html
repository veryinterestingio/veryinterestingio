			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine the content for the advertisement tubes are far less &quot;dense&quot; and can travel far smoother and faster compared to things like videos.
IMO, money is probably another factor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the issue at the time. To continue the &quot;tubes&quot; analogy, imagine that your browser has a built-in pump attached to each of the tubes. The Youtube pump is bogged down with a lot of traffic at that moment in time so it's not loading the video. The other ad pump is not even at 50% capacity so it happily pumps your ads to the browser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah IIRC from my courses in Web Development, advertisements, even the ones that have different panels or “flip” to different elements, are (or used to be) often less than a megabyte. Takes like NO time to load them. That’s what we were told the size standardization was, or at least used to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He got crap for it because it was a bad analogy for the point he was making, and because the full quote is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten movies streaming across that, that Internet, and what happens to your own personal Internet? I just the other day got... an Internet was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning on Friday. I got it yesterday [Tuesday]. Why? Because it got tangled up with all these things going on the Internet commercially. [...] They want to deliver vast amounts of information over the Internet. And again, the Internet is not something that you just dump something on. It's not a big truck. It's a series of tubes. And if you don't understand, those tubes can be filled and if they are filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line and it's going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube enormous amounts of material, enormous amounts of material. -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Which, as you can see, is pretty indicative of him not understanding the metaphor or anything about the technology he was tasked with making law about.</p></div>		</li>
