			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how much I believe this, since that's not what voltage is. What you're describing is a ratio of charge (number of electrons at the negative terminal compared to the positive), while voltage is the amount of energy per unit charge (joules per coluomb).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voltage is also the amount of charge on 2 surfaces, divided by the capacitance between the surfaces.  The capacitance in a battery is relatively fixed, so Voltage is proportional to charge in a battery.  The equation is V=Q/C, or Q=CV.  Where Q is charge and C is capacitance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Every conductor has an inherit capacitance between itself and a nearby ground (or other wire). For example, CAT5 twisted pairs have a small capacitance per metre. Iâ€™m also lead to believe that this capacitance exists even when conductors are completely isolated (this is where my understanding starts to get shaky). Anyways,  this capacitance can be used to deduce voltage in any conductor.</p></div>		</li>
