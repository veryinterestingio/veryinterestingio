			<div class="markdown"><p>The Colorado's water is used to irrigate an area of farmland roughly the size of Missouri throughout the basin and outside of it through diversion projects. Some of this farmland is among the most productive in the world and is a large part of why we have access to things like strawberries and lettuce in January in the US. The system remains relatively inefficient with old wasteful irrigation methods still common while water intensive low value crops are still grown in several areas. Water law does little to incentivize efficiency except by sheer market forces and we are seeing the beginning of the impacts of the strain on the basin which will only grow due to climate change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the produce during the winter comes from Mexico, with a lot coming through Yuma and Nogales. They then move back up to California for our main season. Large amounts of workers move back and forth for the seasonal changes.</p>
<p>That's not to say no produce comes out of the US in the winter, but we're reliant on Mexico for the bulk of it during that time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If Egypt realizes they are facing 10s of billions in costs to move and gain water for its people or billions to wage a war with Ethiopia...</p>
<p>What will they chose?</p></div>		</li>
