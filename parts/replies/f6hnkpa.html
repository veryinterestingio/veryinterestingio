<p>Polish mathematicians cracked the code shortly before the war broke out, and relayed that information to British Intelligence. </p>

<p>This was invaluable to the code-breaking effort, however the methods of codebreaking were obsoleted very rapidly by changes and improvements in Nazi procedure.</p>
<p>In particular the catastrophic error of typing out the wheel setting twice at the beginning of the message was fixed quite quickly, and more wheels were put into use which made the Polish methods no longer feasible. In some ways they remained the basis of code-breaking efforts on Enigma, but Bletchley also developed very novel methods as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polish and French.. they both had been working on german cypher machines since WW1.</p>
<p>There was still a french team decyphering enigma messages in Vichy France. It still worked with the british. They used to communicate between each  other using.. enigma-like encoded messages.</p>
