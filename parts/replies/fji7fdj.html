			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I still have questions about this. If it's a grain of sand, i think it would only need a tiny bit of coating to make it feel nice for the oyster. Why aren't pearls just the size of like... 6 grains of sand?</p>
<p>And what's this I hear about bugs. Do some of the pearls we wear have bugs in them?!? Can we somehow x-ray them to see little bug carcasses???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the growth is happening because of irritation of the oyster body, it will stop when the pearl is so nicely covered that there is no irritation anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But surely that only takes a millimeter or so of coating around the sand grain. After that, adding more layers just makes the pearl bigger, which I'd think would make it <em>more</em> irritating.</p></div>		</li>
