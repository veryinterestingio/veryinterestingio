			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically: while the physical cleaning properties of a product (how well it removes dirt and other debris) start to work immediately, it takes time for the sanitizing properties kick in. The chemicals need to penetrate the bacterial cell walls and wreak havoc on their insides.</p>
<p>It's the reason you're supposed to wash your hands for 30+ seconds even though all the dirt is gone in 10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other one is to rinse the surface after use if it is being used to prepare food.  Most household disinfectants are over 10x stronger than sanitizers used in restaurants.  If you're using a disinfectant in your kitchen you'll want to rinse that off before preparing your meals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be inaccurate to say that: It effectively kills %100 of germs, but reduce it to %99.99 for legal reasons; and that in science there are no FACTS, because anything can be dis-proven with enough future discovered evidence?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>pretty much, alcohol kills things through straight up destroying them, compared to something like antibiotics you can develop a resistance to because it has to bind to specific sites on the bacteria or recognize it in some way</p>
<p>it's like saying bombs kill 99.99% of the people in the area they're dropped in, because maybe someone was down in a mine shaft or something, and you can never really guarantee 100%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s true that you won’t ever see “kills 100% of xyz” even if for a particular test, full kill was achieved. It has to do with the nature of the logarithmic scale.
Think of it this way: For each LR, there is a reduction of 90% of the bacteria present, or a 10-fold reduction. If you start with 1 million colonies and achieve 2LR, there are 10,000 cells left on a surface (99% have been eliminated). If you can achieve 5LR, only 10 colonies will be left (99.999% have been eliminated). 6LR will leave only one colony out of 1 million.
Sort of how you can infinitely approach a limit but never reach it in calculus, you can always get closer and closer to 100% bacterial reduction but statistically, you can never reach it.
If you want to be more informed about the products you use on your body and in your house, read the back of the bottle. If you follow those directions perfectly, you will get the full benefits. You’d be surprised at the use-directions for most of your household cleaners. There is a huge variety in recommended contact time, reapplication recommendations, drying time and rinsing time. These all have to do with how the products are validated in a test environment, not how the typical consumer may feel like using it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also suspect that re-application is recommended because the company can end up selling you more, but I digress</p>
<p>Yeah, I know the concept of a line approaching but never reaching a number.</p></div>		</li>
