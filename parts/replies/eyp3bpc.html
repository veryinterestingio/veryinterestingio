			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because Capsaicin &quot;dissolves&quot; in fat. So, when you take something fatty (whole milk, yoghurt...) The Capsaicin is carried away!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because it essentially gets cancelled out or swept away. When there's enough of a trigliceride (what's in fat and oil), it can either overpower the capsaicinoid, or if there's a really big molecule, it can straight up rip it out of the receptor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so do you know why my perception of heat doesn't always match up with the Scoville scale? That is, some peppers listed as milder taste spicier to me than others listed as hotter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peppers will always vary, the Scoville scale is much like the Schmidt pain index or EF tornado scale in the sense that nature is pretty random, and can vary in a ton of ways, so it should really be seen as one guy's test.</p>
<p><del>If it were more like the pH scale, where they actually measure for density of capsaicin per cubic cm or something, it would make much more sense, but no, they just go until people can't taste it.</del></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just on a point of detail - they used to measure Scoville ratings by tasting as you say, but nowadays - I believe and Wikipedia agrees! - a more formal chemical procedure is used - high performance liquid chromatography. But your first paragraph still holds of course - peppers of each type will vary as to how hot they are so type x will not necessarily always be hotter than type y.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because peppers vary, you can have a reaper with 2million scoville late in season from the same plant that earlier in the harvest made 1million scoville peppers. Same goes for every pepper, growing conditions and water/lack of all influences the plant.</p>
<p>Edit* i have a 7 year old chocolate bhut jolokia that produces insanely hot peppers in fall, but the first few peppers in the season isnt hot at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just growing regular old jalapeños and serranos in Texas and they got wildly hot in the depths of summer but the spring peppers were hardly hotter than a bell pepper. It's so interesting to me how temp and sun affect plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but I'm talking about something different. Reading this thread I'm wondering if it has to do with different capsaicinoids affecting people different, or maybe sugar blocking the relevant receptors or something.</p></div>		</li>
