			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this. I’m not deaf and I’m pretty sure I don’t have a brain injury, and if I really want to I can imagine words being spoken in my head. However, when I think, it’s almost never in words. Say I’m cooking a recipe that I know. I’ll think that, say, it’s time to put the salt in, and I’ll do it, rather than an internal monologue being played saying what I’m doing/going to do. I’m not sure if I’m in the minority here or what, but anything else is completely alien to me and I find it distressing that some people actually think with words because it seems too chaotic.</p>
<p>That being said, how are you holding up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I’m going about my day on a somewhat autopilot I don’t think in words. I’m not even sure how to describe it honestly. But when I have to think something out in a detailed fashion then sometimes I’ll think in a conversational way like I’m discussing my thought with someone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I'm special cause I don't have a inner voice and I can't imagine much of anything. I have <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">Aphantasia</a> never knew people could actually see stuff in their head so it was rather surprising.</p>
<p>Also I don't have a &quot;inner voice&quot; like in movies where a character thinks to themselves. Obviously it's not just like in the movies but there is no &quot;voice&quot; it's just all my thoughts at once.</p>
<p>The thing that is the most interesting to me has got to be that by 7th grade I was a college level reader. It's so fascinating to me since I've never once &quot;seen&quot; anything in my books besides my dreams (which don't follow Aphantasia for whatever reason). Another thing that's wierd is I can't read &quot;in my head&quot; I'm just scanning and absorbing the words/sentences, no voices for characters just the meanings of the words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No expert on this but if you think the brain is like a very complex computer then it is just an series of electrical signals and pulses that can store, record and play back information.</p>
<p>Your eyes, ears and nerves etc are just there to record data from the outside world and convert it into an electrical signal the brain can read. </p>
<p>Therefore you can then playback the recordings in your head. Just as you Can put a song playing on a computer without having speakers plugged in or volume off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your explanation, I'd say to also take into account the imaginative and &quot;editing&quot; capabilities of the brain.</p>
<p>Rather than merely recording what gets from our senses to our brain, our brain unconsciously forms a coherent, whole picture before it reaches our consciousness.</p>
<p>Instruments, sights, all sorts of stimuli that we once received can be reproduced once again, yes. Modulated, modified. And interestingly, imagination and other phenomena can produce sounds you wouldn't normally even find outside, ever... such as this weird, indescribable, alien... humming? Calling? Though the modern repertoire of electronic instruments has considerably broadened our range, and arbitrarily defining sound waves may help us actually listen to some sound that could so far only be found in our imaginations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really work like this, but I assume the info from &quot;hearing part&quot; of your brain gets transmitted somewhere, and this place is also accessible from the &quot;thinking part&quot; of your brain. So you get the music on the same place, just from different sources.</p></div>		</li>
