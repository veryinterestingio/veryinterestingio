			<div class="markdown"><p>The name Vitamin comes from 'vital amine' - because when they were originally discovered, it was thought that all of them would be amines (a type of chemical, like how alcohols and esters are types of chemicals). This turned out to be untrue, in that ther original micronutrients that were isolated were not all amines (part of the reason why we call them vitamins instead of vitamines). Also, as time went on, the presumed function of some vitamins was discovered to be incorrect, or others were discovered to be non-essential in diet. Sometimes the old names stuck, othertimes they were changed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, the body produces Vitamin D from sunlight exposure on the skin, and Vitamin K is produced in the gut from bacteria</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ill take a minute to just share a piece of information about B9.</p>
<p>Folate(natural) and folic acid(synthetic) are not as interchangeable as most people think. Between 30-40% of the human population actually has some level of inability to effectively process folic acid in the cellular respiration process, making it toxic to the body and causing things like nerve damage, cancer, and having the potential to harm a pregnancy. Its caused by a mutation of the MTHFR gene. </p>
<p>Source: I have the mutation. Its kind of a new discovery so when I got my genetic testing results back, my doctor wasn't even sure what it meant. Took lots of research and various other appointments plus having a parent with a background in biochem to understand what it means. I can no longer eat foods with enriched products like enriched flour, enriched rice, etc. I also have to be careful with things like low calorie fruit juices and food products where natural vitamins are taken out to reduce calories and synthetic vitamins are put in. Vitamins with folate in its natural form is a must.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know struggles with weird symptoms of a very strange variety with no seemingly significant connection, its worth getting tested. Its also important for those struggling with infertility to get tested as well. Same goes for mamas who struggle with miscarriage(s) or are pregnant currently. If you or your baby have the mutation, taking synthetic B9, as is pushed so heavily in prenatal care, is dangerous to the health of the unborn fetus and can have some damaging long term effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its specifically the synthetic version of b9. The gene mutation itself means that there is less absorption of folate, so technically I (specifically me, different for others depending on what mutation and whether single or double alleles) have to eat or intake about 3x the daily recommended folate to even absorb the 100% needed value. When folic acid (synthetic) is added to the mix, it gunks up the chemical process of processing all those other B vitamins, which means not only are you insufficient in b9, but lots of other things, and it reduces the already reduced amount of folate your body can process in chemical reactions in your cells.</p>
<p>Basically, what I want people to understand is that its not B9 vitamins, its specifically the synthetic form of B9 vitamins, which is folic acid.</p>
<p>Tl;dr </p>
<p>If you have an MTHFR gene mutation:</p>
<p>folate = natural = good B9
folic acid = synthetic = bad B9</p>
<p>Edit: Not sure why the downvotes, but I'll leave the comment here. Note, I'm not an expert. I've just been dealing with it for a while. This is how it was explained to me by someone who knows what they're talking about. Feel free to do your own research on it and kindly correct me if I'm horribly wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you live in the US? One thing I've noticed when I visited was that everything was enriched and fortified with vitamins and iron. Cereal, hershey chocolates, flour, Random snacks, Milk etc. While in my country it's usually only baby food, some types of cereals marketed to small kids and medical foods (Ensure etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it was government mandated in, I think, 1998? </p>
<p>The primary reason was to lower the rates of spina bifida due to lack of B9 intake during pregnancy. </p>
<p>Poison 30-40% of the population to potentially (not guaranteed) save 500 babies from spina bifida, and also cause tons of miscarriages, stillbirths and infertility as well. Seems about right.</p>
<p>To be fair, intolerance to folic acid because of mthfr gene mutation is such a new discovery in the world of science that  the mandate/regulations just haven't caught up. My hope is that, one day in the future, they'll realize the detrimental effects of it. For example, because the body views it as a toxin, it increases levels of cortisol in the body, thus, causing weight gain and an inability to burn fat. Fat america? Probably folic acid. I'm not saying that there is a definite correlation/causation, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if there was. Same with things like autoimmune disorders. Just looking at all the issues I was having, the issues my siblings were having, my dad... Other people I know who have been tested but didn't know what to do with the information... Its astonishing no one has figured it out. Another thing to consider is this mass amount of people who have, or claim to have, a &quot;gluten intolerance&quot; when they have 0 diagnostic signs of celiac, but enriched flour products like bread, cookies, etc. make them feel like crap. Its probably not gluten intolerance at all -- its probably folic acid. </p>
<p>When I stopped eating it, it was life changing. Its so freaking difficult to avoid though, especially because not every product that contains it actually puts it on the labeling correctly. For example, lots of companies just assume folic acid and folate are interchangeable. When I see folate on labels now, I have to be careful: try it, see how it makes me feel. There are tons of products that use &quot;folate&quot; but based on the way it makes me feel, I pretty much know that its labeled incorrectly. </p>
<p>The most frustrating thing is not being able to eat anything with flour unless I literally grind the wheat and make it myself. Even organic foods are not necessarily safe because enrichment isn't part of the qualifications for &quot;organic.&quot; Another difficult thing is it's really annoying to explain to people, &quot;no, its not a gluten allergy. I can eat bread, i just can't eat bread with enriched flour.&quot; I've had so many people just say, &quot;eat gluten free.&quot; It isnt that simple because lots of gluten free products have rice flour, and white rice is ALSO enriched, therefore, so is the flour version.</p></div>		</li>
