<p>I have measuring posts outside where I've tracked the heights my two sons on their birthdays each year. On their 8th birthdays they were the same height, but their yearly growth patterns were very different from each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming they mean &quot;consistent&quot; insofar as for an individual, when they're going thru puberty they don't grow faster and then slower and then faster again. But between individuals how they grow will differ because of their personal hormone levels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My son has always been quite tall for his age, and would grow rapidly at different points of the year -- in that we would start measuring weeks apart, and then back to months apart (my wife has a PhD in statistics, and knows all about measurement error and confirmation biases.).   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There would be mornings where he would wake up in pain from growing, and then we would measure, and see differences.  Now, he is an outlier at over 6'5&quot;, but his growth was not consistent at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comparing two people won't always be consistent. Each person will have their own Physiology, and all those other factors that govern growth hormone release won't always be exactly the same.</p>
<p>But the same person's growth pattern should remain more or less consistent if their eating/sleeping/exercising patterns remain more or less consistent.</p>
<p>But biology is weird, so you can never say for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean no direct offense to you, but this is why we have so many issues today.  Anecdotal tales and misunderstanding that comes from them.</p>
<p>&quot;these things are occurring pretty consistently&quot; does not mean every person will grow at the same rate, it also doesn't mean the same person will grow at the same rate. It simply means growth hormones are released at a consistent rate, consistent does not mean constant, unchanging and/or static or default.</p>
<p>The human body is not an assembly line. It relies on many other things and is changed upon many conditions both external and internal, and includes diet, stress and other environmental factors, but it is still consistent. consistent for that person and consistent in the process.  </p>
<p>Your anecdotal measuring of your two sons does not disprove or even waver the consistency of hormones released during puberty (etc).</p>
<p>This is exactly why anti-vax, flat earth and all the other crap out there gets traction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend was above average height in 4th grade. In 10th grade he was by FAR the smallest one in my class. Now, in grade 11th grade he's one of the tallest men in my class. I can too disprove that growth CAN be inconsistent. My dude here is not saying &quot;Hormones release inconsistently, here's proof&quot;, but that his sons growth was inconsistent. The guy before him was clearly referring to growth and not hormone release, &quot;It's just our own perception that we see that someone's grown an inch and we hadn't noticed&quot; (In simple words, growth should be consistent, if not, it's just because we didn't notice).</p>
<p>Plus it has nothing to do with Anti-vax, that is straight up a fallacy. It's the same as saying &quot;I eat apple and I'm fat, therefore apples make you fat&quot;. You're doing the same, comparing apples with pears (Edit: This is a saying in Spanish. It means they're obviously different, therefore shouldn't be compared).  Dude replied to &quot;consistent growth&quot;, but you came back saying &quot;That doesn't mean that hormone release was inconsistent&quot;. No shit, he didn't even mention hormones, he was just commenting on the growth part of the argument.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Although these pains are called growing pains, there's no evidence that growth hurts. Growing pains may be linked to a lowered pain threshold or, in some cases, to psychological issues.</em></p>
<p><em>Causes</em></p>
<p>*The cause of growing pains is unknown. But there's no evidence that a child's growth is painful.</p>
<p>Growing pains don't usually happen where growth is occurring or during times of rapid growth. It's been suggested that growing pains may be linked to restless legs syndrome. But muscle pain at night from overuse during the day is thought to be the most likely cause of growing pains. Overuse from activities such as running, climbing and jumping can be hard on a child's musculoskeletal system.</p>
