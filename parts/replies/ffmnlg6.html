<p>Also for me, the worse the overwhelm gets, the louder the sounds seem to get, the brighter the lights seem to feel, the more intense every touch feels.</p>
<p>Like there is a controller in my brain trying vehemently to close off the city gate to stop the flow of input, turning all the dials and pulling all the levers in a panic, causing everything to get even WORSE. </p>
<p>Thank God I learned to get tf out of anywhere before it gets that bad. Haven't had a meltdown in years. But my later teenage years are littered with meltdowns, me screaming and crying and hitting people and throwing things because DONT FFING TOUCH ME! STOP MAKING NOISE! LEAVE ME ALONE! It's like a counter productive fight-flight-freeze reflex. I used to start fighting. Not that it helps, because you can't fight sound or light.</p>
<p>And then afterwards you're exhausted for hours, sometimes days and really ashamed of what you've done.</p></div>		</li>
