			<div class="markdown"><p>You have your causality backwards. The bulk dielectric constant is a macroscopic quantity heavily influenced by the extent of hydrogen bonding, a microscopic quantity. The hydrogen bond network allows water to respond rapidly and collectively to external fields. As you break that network (by e.g., <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/material_anomalies.html#dielmax" target="_blank">heating up water</a>), the dielectric constant goes down.</p></div>		</li>
