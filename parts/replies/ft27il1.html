			<div class="markdown"><p>When you rotate an image, some programs do not re-encode the image, but instead set a flag in the file to display it rotated. Since the original encoding hasn't changed, the loading appears bottom to top or sideways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure those come from smartphones or other cameras with accelerometers. Since a smartphone can be rotated in any orientation, the camera sensor’s “up” can differ from gravity.  It’s indicated by metadata in the image file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a bit -- some JPEG images are stored with Metadata that says &quot;display this image rotated at (90, 180, 270) degrees from how you would normally display it&quot;. So those images that load top to bottom are rotated 180 degrees, and you will see some images that load left to right or right to left too.</p>
<p>The reason this exists is so the camera can always generate the image the same way from it's perspective (regardless of rotation), and then if you had your phone held sideways it can slap on the rotate metadata to display it so that 'up' is 'gravity up' instead of 'up' in the direction of the phone camera. This is a lot faster and simpler than re-saving the photo rotated.</p>
<p>Look up EXIF rotation metadata. This is sometimes also a problem if you open image in software that doesn't understand the metadata -- because it will open it rotated the wrong direction!</p></div>		</li>
