			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid question incoming: when you say &quot;evolved narrow hips&quot; it makes it sound that back then we weren't like that, now assuming we weren't like that and through time birth has gotten more difficult, does that implies that things will get harder and harder until one day humans won't be able to give birth?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Evolutionary traits stick if they make the bearer more likely to survive and make healthy babies. If a trait has both upsides and downsides, then over time evolution will select for the optimal compromise. Big brains and narrow hips both impede childbirth but help with overall survival, and hundreds of thousands of years of evolution have put us in the sweet spot between all the extremes. That's not likely to change significantly unless the equilibrium changes somehow.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't imply that because if hips got too narrow to allow birth, then that trait wouldn't be passed on.</p>
<p>And before people say &quot;hurr durr c-section&quot; they would allow maybe a niche population of humans to have abnormally narrow hips, but that small population would die out without continuous c-sections and evolution would favor wider hips back to normal size again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends, if males find smaller hips attractive, they will outbreed the thicc ones.</p>
<p>Evolution can produce some weird effects: flightless birds, long necked horses..</p></div>		</li>
