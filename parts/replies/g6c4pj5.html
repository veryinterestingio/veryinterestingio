			<div class="markdown"><p>Sitting changes how blood flows in the legs. When in a lying down position, the flow of blood in your legs is fairly unrestricted, and you can move your legs relatively freely. While sitting, the blood vessels in your thighs are compressed and the path the blood takes is curved due to the position you‚Äôre in. This increases the necessary blood pressure for your veins to carry blood back to your heart. Remember that it‚Äôs your arteries and heart that do all of the work to pump blood and that veins are relatively inactive. Worst case scenario, this can cause clots, and I believe there have been cases where people on long 10+ hour flights having those clots travel to the heart and lungs, resulting in hospitalization.</p>
<p>This actually can happen from inactivity as well though, but there isn‚Äôt really any risk from lying down to sleep for a normal amount of time, and even being sick and spending most of the day in bed is safer than sitting for 8+ hours. When in the hospital for something that makes you unable to walk for an extended period of time, they put this thing on your leg that massages the muscles to encourage normal blood flow in the legs to make up for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would moving your legs around help alleviate some of this? I have a desk job but I also constantly shake at least one of my legs so I'm curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's been a few studies into this, but the bleak outcome is offset if you tap your food or rearrange yourself every now and then. The &quot;you will die if you sit still&quot; thing is if you sit perfectly still and don't move at all. Fidgeting is all you really have to do to counter it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, since heart disease seems to be one of the main risks I suppose you can start there?  How does sitting increase heart disease for someone that gets the recommended amount of exercise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn‚Äôt really an answer.  ‚ÄúAssociated with‚Äù is basically just saying there‚Äôs a correlation.  Yes, people who sit more are more likely to have those problems, just as people who eat sugary cereal for breakfast every morning are less likely to have altimeters than those who don‚Äôt (because they‚Äôre children).  OP‚Äôs question seems to be getting to the core of this and is asking if sitting more is also a cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is tons of research into this but AFAIK no RCTs (what u need to link causation) .... that would be a difficult study to design.  The research looking into this accounted for confounding variables such as obesity and other unhealthy lifestyles.</p>
<p>RCTs are ideal but not always available. </p>
<p>Vaccines for example. There are no RCTs (placebo controlled) but we can garner enough evidence to say they work and are safe üëÄ</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that I think OP is trying to get at, what are the health risks for someone who sits during the day but overall does not lead a sedentary life style, or even leads an active lifestyle. </p>
<p>Good point re vaccines, and I don‚Äôt overall disagree with the point of your reply but just wanted to point out that I think it kind of glossed over the key issue in OP‚Äôs question</p></div>		</li>
