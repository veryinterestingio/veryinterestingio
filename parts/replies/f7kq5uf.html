			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on this: we are primarily looking for the REASON why our universe is mostly regular matter. Its one of the greatest mysteries in physics and some evidence has been found that antimatter and matter is not entirely symnetrical but not enough to account for the discrepancy. Heres a great ELI5-friendly page from CERN about the matter (pun intended): <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem" target="_blank">https://home.cern/science/physics/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've asked this a couple times and never get a satisfying answer, but isn't the following a decent explanation?</p>
<p>Suppose we have an infinite, empty, universe, model it by R^3. Distribute randomly with a fixed density both matter and antimatter throughout R^3.</p>
<p>Then, with 100% likelihood, there will be rectangles of arbitrarily large size that contain matter and no antimatter, and rectangles of arbitrarily large size that contain antimatter and no matter.</p>
<p>Is it so hard to believe that we live in one such rectangle, that happens to be larger than the observable universe? Where does any part of this breakdown or not hold up with our current predictions? </p>
<p>The only response people ever give is that it would be &quot;unlikely&quot; for such large regions of space to exist with these matter-antimatter imbalances, but infinite space means unlikely things are nearly guaranteed to occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that people already thought about this in the scientific way. They calculated probabilities for those models and it simply turns out they are extremely unlikely based of what we see e.g. in the cosmic microwave background.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a decent explanation, but it's not provably the answer. Science is less &quot;can we think of a plausible explanation&quot; and more &quot;let's evaluate all explanations and see which ones are most likely based off of quantifiable evidence&quot;. Since there's no evidence that we just happen to exist in an anti-matter deficient section of the universe we can't just chalk the answer up to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My area of research is exploring exactly that. I work on the neutron EDM project at oak ridge national labs, which is deeply tied to the dominance of matter over antimatter in the early universe. If anyone is interested, I've talked at length on an <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/br9xss/is_there_any_scale_where_the_distribution_of/eoc758v/" target="_blank">askscience thread</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One question if you're willing:</p>
<p>How do we know that objects we see <em>aren't</em> antimatter? Like how would we know if a star we are observing is in fact matter or an antimatter star? I know almost nothing about the nuclear properties of antimatter, other than it is the reverse of normal matter. If all of the molecular orbital configurations are the exact same, shouldn't spectral emission lines also be exactly equivalent?</p>
<p>How do we even tell matter and antimatter apart in a lab?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always just assumed that inflation might be responsible for the imbalance, as any tiny patch has exactly 100% of either matter or antimatter in it, and each of those patches got magnified to universe-sized patches. Do you mind mentioning where the mistake is? (Absolute layman in physics)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence that there is not antimatter galaxies or stars. Space is not a perfect vacuum even between galaxies and at the border, we should be able to detect the result of the mutual annihilation. So if the exist they have to be completely isolated from regular matter.</p>
<p>Even if they were isolated you could detect them because an antimatter supernova should not emit the same collection of neutrinos.</p>
<p>Antimatter has been detected in space in the center of our own galaxy because of the annihilation but it is produced the reaction in black holes and neutron starts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An antimatter star would have an antimatter stellar wind, which we’d see wherever it comes into contact with regular matter, and vice-versa. Since we don’t see massive gamma ray bursts at every border of interstellar space, it appears that the vast majority of stars are made of the same type of stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, how would we know if we are looking at a galaxy that it is composed of normal matter and is not part of a vast clump of antimatter?  The quantum spectra of materials in that galaxy should all be equal to the spectra of a normal matter galaxy.</p>
<p>My guess: cosmic rays which are thought to be somewhat isotropic and ubiquitous throughout the universe are all normal matter protons (as we sample them here on Earth)... And if the galaxy in question was made of antimatter, then we'd see an abnormal spike in gamma radiation coming from that galaxy corresponding to proton-antiproton annihilation.</p></div>		</li>
