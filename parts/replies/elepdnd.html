			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a bit, in general, different classes of stuff in space are a lot more dependent on how massive an object is, not much else really makes much a difference.</p>
<p>Anything much less massive than like, the moon, is generally going to be rocky and irregular and would typically be called an asteroid or comet depending on its orbit.</p>
<p>As an object gets bigger, it will become a nearly perfect sphere under the forces of its own gravity. The earth (obviously) is in this category, and basically anything in this category will be either a planet, or a moon, and will be rocky, at best with some kind of thick atmosphere.</p>
<p>As something gets even bigger it’ll start to be able to hold onto a lot of atmosphere, and become a gas giant.</p>
<p>After than you start getting into the range of stars. Depending on size/composition you will either start seeing “failed stars” like brown dwarfs or gas supergiant planets, and eventually you will start seeing the smallest actual stars.</p>
<p>From that point on its more or less just bigger stars. There are certainly more massive things like black holes, but those don’t form from pure accretion.</p>
<p>Obviously composition of the material in the area will affect the characteristics of any objects that form, but in general most of the loose stuff in space is lots of hydrogen gas with some heavy elements sprinkled in, so you tend to see objects following the general trend everywhere. While it’s much harder, if not impossible, to detect small, rocky planets (and larger stuff) hanging out in space (that are likely also often snatched up be local stars), logic would dictate that they exist in nebulae at the very least as a stepping stone to some eventual stars.</p></div>		</li>
