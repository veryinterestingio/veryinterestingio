			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that depends,  are you just talking about real small potatoes, or are you talking about &quot;new potatoes&quot;. The latter, you eat them skin on, though you could wash them off i guess.. ive never taken it off of new potatoes though, most here dont</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are small potatoes that are just small. People usually won’t buy them individually so they are sold together in bags of all small ones. These are mature potatoes (I.e. from plants that have died back) just small. They will have the normal tougher skin.</p>
<p>Then there are “new” potatoes, usually available in spring and early summer. These are harvested early, before the plant has died back, so they are smaller because they haven’t had all summer for the plant to send sugar down to them. They will have the more delicate skin that rubs off easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are.
I dig them out from under the plant in the summer and they have no skin at all - the baby potato skin is just oxidization, not actual potato skin.</p></div>		</li>
