			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also find where they are sending the data and block connections just as easily.  You think Windows 10 was given as a free upgrade because Microsoft is a super giving company or they are mining data?  Same thing applies there, firewall on the system and block IP's or domain names at the router as well.</p>
<p>And the voice services are the big ones that can send data at any time to them and record everything that is going on.</p>
<p>I use a 55&quot; 4k LG, there is about 30 or so ms of lag but it works ok for most everything but snipers for gaming.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While major corporations have done some pretty shady shit, using an unprotected wireless network without the permission of the owner is a crime if the network isn't specifically made to be used by the public; an unsecured wireless network is no-more an invitation to use it than an open door is an invitation to let yourself into a stranger's house. I highly doubt any but the most unscrupulous of electronic manufacturers would take that risk.</p>
