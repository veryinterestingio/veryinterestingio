			<div class="markdown"><p>So, thinking from the southern hemisphere's perspective, are there similar counterclockwise currents in the South Pacific and South Atlantic, and are there associated hurricanes and typhoons?  If not, why not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are anti-clockwise currents in the Southern Hemisphere. And yes, there are associated hurricanes (in this context just called tropical cyclones) that can hit the east coast of Africa below the equator as well as northern and western Australia and across Indonesia. But yes, it is a messy picture with many factors. There are virtually no cyclones in the South Atlantic, for example, because there is a lot more wind shear - and ironically, stronger winds in general, but the sort that break up any incipient cyclone that would form. Cyclones are defined by their pattern around low pressure zones, rather than sheer wind strength - so perhaps ironically, moderately strong wind can prevent the super strong winds that come with cyclones. </p>
<p>Why that asymmetry between hemispheres, though? This last point is the case in turn because the Southern Hemisphere has more ocean than the Northern Hemisphere (since it has only a fraction as much land), since water takes much longer to warm up than land and the colder average currents lead to more of this wind sheer. But also (complicated again) because a large chunk of the land it does have is around the South Pole, i.e. Antarctica, which is under an ice sheet regardless. Though land itself allows far more flow of heat (one property), it also allows much more of a physical “solid platform” for the ice to cling to and propagate (another property working in another direction), which is why Antarctica has more ice than the Arctic, helping to make the Southern Hemisphere even colder.</p>
<p>There’s far more to it and I don’t understand all of it myself, but hope that goes some way towards an answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the impression that Southern California was just at the edge of where hurricanes were possible.  Didn't a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1858_San_Diego_hurricane" target="_blank">hurricane brush San Diego in 1858</a>?  </p>

<p>Will even a slight warming of the water make this appreciably more likely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it would, but the reason we don't get hurricanes is because the average wind blows away from San Diego towards the ocean, not towards land.</p></div>		</li>
