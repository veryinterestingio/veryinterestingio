<li>Thank you.  We have some flexibility in how much CO2 emissions there can be.  Heat is  required for the endothermic pyrolysis reaction.   We can use natural gas feedstock or carbon or hydrogen product to supply the heat. Using natural gas is the cheapest but also produces the most CO2.  At      this point we are really working to develop options for the process, with heating options to be decided later.</li>
<li>A great question. The United States produces about 10 million metric tons of H2 annually, and SMR accounts for more  than 95% of this production.  New markets for H2 such as fuel cell-powered vehicles are projected to significantly increase the demand for H2 in the coming decades. Carbon      also has large markets, and is marketed in a number of different forms, including carbon black, CNTs, carbon nanofibers, carbon fibers, graphene, and needle coke. Table ES.1 in the report linked below  summarizes the market potential for the different types of carbons. However, given      cheaper processes for producing valuable solid, this could open up more markets for solid carbon.  In this report we co-authored with Argonne National Laboratory, we provide the scale of hydrogen production today as well as various carbon markets:  </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for these answers as well.  I'm disappointed in the first answer.  I was hoping you could be more specific than what the linked article said, but it sounds like you are not able to support the &quot;virtually eliminated&quot; claim at all.  I guess that was written by someone other than a scientist?</p>
<p>On the second question, that table is great--exactly the information I was looking for.  It sounds like considering the products mentioned in the OP, carbon fiber and nanotubes, future global estimates correspond to about 40 thousand metric tons on H2 production, which is less than 0.5% of present day US hydrogen production.  So considering just those products, this is a nice process to slot in to make bit of present hydrogen production have lower emissions, but it's not a way to produce the much higher H2 we'd need if we relied on it heavily for vehicles.  </p>
<p>So to make this part of a story about H2 vehicles, we'd need to use it for making carbon black.  But doesn't that undercut that economics?  It's harder to pay for this producing a low-value product like carbon black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry that the first answer disappointed you.  But again, the actual amount of CO2 emissions depends on how the process is operated.  Energy is required to drive the endothermic methane pyrolysis reaction, and there are different options to enable the heat for this.  Essentially, there is a trade-off between supplying heat from burning natural gas or some of the product hydrogen; the latter being more expensive but offering the most benefit in GHG reduction.  To provide some more specifics for you, Iâ€™ll share that we have a preliminary process model in place.   From this we project the possibility for an \~ 80% reduction in CO2 emission versus from steam reforming (on a kg CO2/kg H2 basis).  This also assumes that methane  is used to supply heat for the reactor, however, the GHG reduction could be more if product H2 is used.  But again we caveat that this is very preliminary, and we are still working to develop this technology to enable these benefits.  </p>
<p>To your other point, you are correct, carbon black is relatively cheap.  In our process we are actually targeting highly crystalline carbon, which would provide more value. The market price of carbon ranges widely from $0.4/kg for carbon black to $600/g, for example, for carbon nanotubes. More information about the carbon market sizes and prices can be found here. <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1411934-overview-natural-gas-conversion-technologies-co-production-hydrogen-value-added-solid-carbon-products" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1411934-overview-natural-gas-conversion-technologies-co-production-hydrogen-value-added-solid-carbon-products" target="_blank">https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1411934-overview-natural-gas-conversion-technologies-co-production-hydrogen-value-added-solid-carbon-products</a></a>. Whereas carbon black has the largest market volume, we anticipate that market volumes for other types of carbon may open up if we can offer cheaper means of production. So, we are not just targeting low-value products, we are aiming to produce a more crystalline carbon, that could serve higher value markets.  I hope that this more elaborate response is of interest.</p></div>		</li>
