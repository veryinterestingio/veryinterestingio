			<div class="markdown"><p>Most tires if not all tires are not made with injection moulding. The &quot;little hairs&quot; are a part of the mold when it gets pressed into shape the additional material has somewhere to go.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before being molded, the tire is a &quot;green tire&quot;, which is a soft, unvulcanized rubber with little to no tread pattern. Today many green tires are handmade by skilled workers but there are fancy machines that can make them automatically too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked as an engineer at a tire factory for a few years. Tires are assembled as a “green tire” by placing many different components together in a basic tire shape. Part of the tire like the tread, inner liner, belts, ply, sidewall, etc. start out as separate rubber or rubber over steal/fabric pieces that are assembled together. The green tire then put into a mold in the shape of the finished tire and a bladder is inflated inside the tire pressing it into the mold. After some time at a certain temperature and pressure the mold opens and you have a finished tire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not injection molding. It's not liquid rubber being injected into a mold. It's two halves of a steel mold closing around soft rubber already formed around steel belts and rayon/nylon cords. </p>
<p>So essentially a tire I formed of uncured rubber the consistency of cold silly putty, and placed in the press which closes around it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bought a set of Michelin Pilot Sport 4’s for my M6. Superior to the Pirelli P Zeros that came on the vehicle as original equipment.  They are expensive though, but I love them.  They are soft  and this will lead to less total mileage but I don’t fear driving in the rain anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting note. You'll never find these on the tread of a Michelin tire. They are on the sidewall, but not the tread. Michelin uses some sophisticated methods for venting over the tread.</p>
