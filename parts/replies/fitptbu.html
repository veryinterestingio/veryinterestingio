<p>about how massaging of an area actually does nothing but stimulate the body to repair or work the tissue in whatever way needed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah bad wording on my part. What I meant was that locally you do not affect the area in the sense that you break down tissue, but you act more as a catalyst for the body to do its own thing. And again this is a relatively new hypothesis, how true it is I can't say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lumps are adhesions, or muscle fibres that are not releasing.</p>
<p>Trigger point release is extremely effective for releasing adhesions and returning balance to muscles.  Correct foam rolling is a really great way to release these, as well.  </p>
<p>Massage may release adhesions and restore muscle balance.  This is very important because the body will compensate for the imbalance in ways that can become harmful, especially over time.</p>
<p>Many times, when you think you have an injury, it is simply an adhesion/adhesions and the compensatory effects.  Trigger point release and massage can alleviate these problems.</p>
<p>Additionally, massage does help to move the blood through systems that may have had flow inhibited, and can clear out some wastes from musculoskeletal systems, including those introduced by stress and stimulated hormones.  </p>
<p>Always make sure to drink lots of water after a good massage.</p>
<p>Massage may be uncomfortable, but it should not be truly 'painful'.  Knowing the difference between deep discomfort because of 'locked' muscle fibres and true pain is really important.</p></div>		</li>
