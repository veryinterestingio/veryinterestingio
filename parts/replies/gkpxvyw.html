<p>I'm not convinced by the force/range of motion arguments. The elbow has in fact a more substantial bone structure than the knee. In place of the patella the elbow has the olecranon process rigidly affixed to ulna, which provides the force transfer and joint protection, while not preventing rotation.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the transition from quadruped reptiles to quadruped mammals, evolution modified our basic stance from legs splayed out to the side to legs tucked underneath.  As part of that decision, the hind legs were rotated so that the hind limb joint bent towards the front, and forelimb joint bent towards the rear.  That meant that the rear legs had to straighten  to propel the animal forward, while the fore legs had to bend.  Thus the rear limbs could benefit more  from the additional leverage that a kneecap could provide than the forelimbs.</p>
<p>It should be noted that kneecaps have come and gone several times in the fossil record, so maybe you're right.  Maybe it has nothing to do with force/range of motion.  Maybe it's just that sometimes kneecaps are sexy, and sometimes they ain't.</p></div>		</li>
