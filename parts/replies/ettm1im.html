<p>I think the reason it's more prevalent for men is that we associate testosterone with masculinity - more of one means more of the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. The reason is testosterone is mainly linked to increased muscle development in popular culture( which is true ). This is something that appeals to men and women.</p>
<p>Estrogen is linked to larger and more sensitive breast, mood swings, headaches, and short term memory loss. In popular culture it's mostly known for mood swings.</p>
<p>There many downsides of taking anything that increases your testosterone levels for both men and women and for that reason it's regulated.</p>
<p>Supplements on the shelves that you buy over the counter don't actually increase your testosterone levels they're just trying to fool idiots that don't know better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For mannnnnnnny women, larger breasts would be a downside.  They are heavy, they hurt your back, they require expensive undergarments and sometimes different tops altogether, etc.  (One of the reasons women I know have a lot of clothes is because stuff fits pretty differently at different points in the month.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with what you're saying, but there's been growing talks about people aiming for high testosterone for reasons outside of body building too. For example, the nofap community can't stop talking about how not masturbating raises testosterone and link this (probably falsely) to numerous benefits.</p>
<p>I wasn't trying to make an allusion to the effect of the hormone at any rate. I suppose what I was trying to get at was the idea of marketing towards men and women. The thought process of hormone = masculinity/ femininity seems to be more common in men, maybe due to differences in the way the two genders think, or the public perception of what they do and how they work. </p>
<p>Either way, my point was that the idea of raising a hormone to be more feminine just doesn't appear to be something that women gravitate to and so these supplements don't get marketed on those grounds.</p>
<p>And I appreciate none of it works, the wellness industry is mostly snake oil and barely regulated- in the UK they only have to meet the standards of food, not the standards of medication. Also if they were effective and had no side effects, why on earth wouldn't doctors be using them. People love a quick fix or a miracle cure though, they're not going anywhere for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, not only. Men with low T suffer symptoms related to mood, confidence and energy. People with these symptoms (whether it's due to low Testosterone or some other issue) look towards related treatment because they believe it might alleviate them, which is possible.</p></div>		</li>
