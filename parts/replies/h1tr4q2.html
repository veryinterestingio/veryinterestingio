			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on,  if you've never done this,  I highly recommend doing this.  A full moon is so bright that armies would move by it.  Do it on a night with a half moon and no moon as well so you understand the contrast.  It's really impressive just how bright the moon is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of when I finally looked up what a harvest moon actually is (rather than a farming game!) - it's a very bright full moon in Autumn which gave farmers an extra hour or so of daylight/twilight to finish the long job of bringing the harvest in.</p>
<p>The really sad thing is the stars. In my city on a good night I can see maybe a hundred or so scattered points of light. The few times I've been somewhere properly dark it blows me away just how many I can see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add, if the Moon is a thin crescent, it means the Moon is almost in line between the Earth and the Sun. Which means someone on the Moon would be seeing a full Earth. Which is why the earthshine is brightest when the Moon is a thin crescent. At half moon, someone on the Moon would be seeing a half Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: you can prove that this isnâ€™t just your brain playing tricks by blocking your view of the bright crescent of the moon with something.  You can still see the dark part!</p></div>		</li>
