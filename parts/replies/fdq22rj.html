			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm kinda thinking out loud here, and it's a tricky topic, but my way of looking at it is a bit like this... </p>
<p>As you move up the chain of command in the way that you've said, the nature of the orders given changes. The orders become less specific, less directive and more strategic. For example, orders from a lieutenant to a private might be &quot;neutralize all threats on this street, then set up defensive positions on that crossroads&quot;. The orders that particular lieutenant got from their captain might have been &quot;secure this village by sunset&quot;, the orders that the captain got from their colonel might have been &quot;secure this area [on a map], it's strategically important. Extend supply lines to it and prepare to move onwards to this next area by Saturday&quot;. The colonel's orders from the general could have been &quot;advance our lines forward through this province and reach this river by the end of the month&quot;, and the general's orders could have been &quot;launch an offensive in this area of our front, this will help to divert enemy forces away from this other area where we will then be more easily able to capture this city&quot;.</p>
<p>At each point going upwards in the sequence, the orders become more about what the final objective is, and less about exactly <em>how</em> that objective should be accomplished. Every link in the chain has a degree of autonomy to determine how to achieve the objective that they've been given. </p>
<p>Now imagine that the final outcome of an operation is that a group of privates massacre a group of unarmed civilians. If those privates had received a direct order from their lieutenant to &quot;kill all civilians that you encounter while securing this street&quot;, then the privates obviously have a good argument that they were just following orders and that they trusted that their lieutenant had good reasons for giving those orders. </p>
<p>But if the lieutenant's orders had been &quot;secure this village by sunset at all costs, no matter what it takes, I don't care how you do it, I'll have your back&quot; rather than just &quot;secure this village by sunset&quot;, the lieutenant might try and argue that the killing of civilians was justified due to the compelling strategic need to secure the village, and that he was just following his captain's orders and therefore that his captain is the one ultimately responsible for the massacre. The captain would then say that he never authorized the killing of civilians, and even though he said &quot;no matter what it takes, I don't care how you do it&quot; that doesn't mean that the means of securing the village could include killing civilians. </p>
<p>The point is, it will all eventually boil down to how people interpret the orders that they've been given, and at what point an unlawful order appears in the chain of orders. And then it'll come down to a case of competing stories about exactly what was said to whom by who at what time, and it'll be very difficult to draw firm conclusions about the whole thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we do allow the &quot;just following orders&quot; defense, then it'll always be hard to pin the blame on anyone in particular. So we must instead say that soldiers of all levels including privates must have the conviction to refuse to follow orders if they are unlawful, and must equally take full responsibility for any unlawful acts they carry out.</p></div>		</li>
