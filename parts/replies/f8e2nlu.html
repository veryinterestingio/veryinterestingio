			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that initially alot of the holocaust victims died because they were asking for food and the soldiers gave it to them. I have starved for a few days but never suffered from malnutrition or no food for weeks so I don't know how it feels to be that hungry. </p>
<p>I feel like the slow gradual addition of food would be really painful to handle. Its like being fed only one thing when you are really hungry</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t “starve” for a few days.  You “fast” for a few days.   Starving implies they had probably 15 to 20+ days without food, likely longer.  A few days actually has health benefits to it.  A few weeks can cause permanent damage to your organs.   Your stomach can shrink, and the addition of too much food can stretch and burst it.  As well the dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and lack of essential mineral/vitamins could cause the refeed to kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in the hospital several times with a GI condition in which I couldn’t eat. Longest I went I think was 5 days. After the first couple days I lost my appetite. I was also in a lot of pain and being treated with all kinds of medicine so not sure that’s totally analogous. But I have heard others who need to fast for medical reasons say the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5 days is actually the optimal amount of time to fast for health benefits. Very good for your organs and everything to reset every couple of months but obviously yours was a different case and I’m glad you’re feeling better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your thinking is correct. This is why starvation is often used as torture. </p>
