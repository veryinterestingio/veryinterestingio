			<div class="markdown"><p>Iodine is pretty effective, and a tincture (solution with alcohol) is still commonly used in hospitals.</p>
<p>Studies tend to show chlorhexidine being more effective in preventing infections from surgery, but it's not necessarily a huge difference and there are AFAIK still outstanding questions about which scenarios do or do not favor chlorhexidine, as well as which concentrations to use etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol and iodine are extremely effective, iodine tincture has fallen out of use because of (unfounded, as it happens) concerns about its effectiveness and safety. Turns out it’s both safe and effective, which we already knew after using it for nearly 100 years...</p>
<p>Most likely the manufacturers of the more expensive Chlorhexidine solutions put in a lot of effort to discredit iodine and play up the safety concerns while cooking up some bogus clinical data to show that chlorhexidine is better.</p>
<p>This type of behaviour is not unprecedented in the medical community, and has happened with Virkon vs Bleach (many of Virkons supposed benefits are vastly overstated).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If alcohol swabs aren’t very good at sanitizing skin, does that mean it’s not very good at sanitizing a cut/scrape either? </p>
<p>That’s what I had always heard to use for something like a cat scratch.</p></div>		</li>
