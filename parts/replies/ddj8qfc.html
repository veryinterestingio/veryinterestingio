			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a church (<a href="http://www.dioceseofpgh.org/parishes/saint-joseph-natrona" target="_blank">St. Joseph's Parish</a> in Natrona, PA).  And I would like to elaborate a little more on /u/TellahTheSage's response.</p>
<p>Though (most) religious organizations in the United States have a nonprofit status (certified by a 501.C3 letter from the Department of Treasury), this does come at a consequence. We have to legitimately prove each year through the filing of taxes that the parish did not earn any income. For most parishes, this balances out through donations to other civic organizations and community outreach. There <em>is</em> a loophole that allows for the generation of income, but it must be documented for the saving of something for the organization itself (e.g., fundraiser that ends in December to raise money for the pipe organ to be repaired the following year). It cannot be for some frivolous item that does not benefit the organization (for example, a vacation to Mexico).</p>
<p>Lastly, the total income and expenditures for a given period of time (usually a year, but in my parish it was a matter of practice to do it monthly) must be made public. For the purposes of tax reporting, we have to be able to account for how every penny came into the organization and out (so we have to submit records for donations and bills for expenses). Likewise, since we're a non-profit, those who donate to us may request a certified document noting their exact donations for the year; this way they can use it for their taxes if they so wish.</p>
<p>For the sake of being explicit, the non-taxation applies <strong>only</strong> to the organization, not to individuals within the organization, and <strong>only</strong> in cases of income. You cannot escape personal income tax that easily. Likewise, churches cannot escape other taxes (e.g., local property taxes), for example in <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2015/02/15/In-Allegheny-County-small-non-profit-groups-losing-property-tax-exemptions-in-first-wave-of-review/stories/201502150098" target="_blank">Allegheny County, PA</a>.</p>
<p>Again, this is a single case of U.S. law; and most of what I described was the <em>maintenance</em> of a non-profit status (i.e., if we fail to provide these items, we will lose 501.C3 authorization). I am not sure how it is handled for many other religious organizations who do not have overt community outreach. Additionally, I am certain there is a wide number of smaller religious organizations who may have specific reasons why they could not gain 501.C3 authorization (there are a couple that come to mind, but I'm not going to feed trolls). In many European countries, however, there are further regulations that define what exactly constitutes community outreach (namely non-discriminatory clauses), and it must exceed a certain amount given their income world-wide. This is one of the driving reasons why Scientology is not recognized in certain governments as a religion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting. Is there any safeguard in the tax code to keep a religious organization from giving &quot;leftover&quot; money in the budget to pastor/teacher/etc as a yearly bonus, or just give unusually high salaries?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, no. Which has lead to some scandals in various religious organizations (case in point, Franklin Graham's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/why-franklin-grahams-salary-raises-eyebrows-among-christian-nonprofits/2015/08/18/023ce940-45f2-11e5-9f53-d1e3ddfd0cda_story.html" target="_blank">raise</a>). Some mainstream religious organizations, however, do not allow a pastor or minister to have control over his/her salary; in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, each member of the clergy receives a stipend and has a place to live (rectory, apartment, or dormitory). I don't know of exact numbers, but I am fairly certain some received a larger stipend than others for various reasons (besides actual rank in the Church). Some are in fact quite charitable with their stipends, often taking only what is necessary for their living expenses and education, and donating the rest of it back to the parish. From what I understand, the Evangelical Lutheran Church does the same (from talking to my wife, who is a Lutheran). Naturally, though, they still have to pay personal income taxes.</p>
<p>Again, the key thing with 501.C3 is that there is transparency and tracibility with all income and expenses. Thus, the public at large can become the safeguarding mechanism: make a formal request for the documentation, and if something seems really wrong, a reporter will make sure it makes it to the front page or the 6pm news.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be counter-productive, since if it's paid out as salary or bonus, it will get taxed.  If it's spent on an expense, it's tax-free.  Ultimately, religious organizations make money through donations, so the people donating to the organization have a vested interest in keeping them honest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fantastic quote. Do you know if it has been used anywhere else outside of McColloch v Maryland?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out that being tax-exempt under 501(c)(3) means you also agree to stay out of partisan politics (i.e. a church, or any nonprofit organization for that matter, isn't supposed to endorse a candidate or contribute to a campaign). The separation goes both ways.</p></div>		</li>
