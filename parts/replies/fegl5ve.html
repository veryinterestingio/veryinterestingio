			<div class="markdown"><p>But also, if nothing eats the pepper, the fruit will ripen on the plant, eventually fall to the ground, and the seed will still be planted and grow.  </p>
<p>The fact that birds occasionally eat the peppers and the seeds remain intact and they poop them out elsewhere is not REQUIRED for the pepper plant to survive, it just happens to work that way and as a result the pepper plants are spread around in a wider area.</p></div>		</li>
