			<div class="markdown"><p>Colorado also has a large and often destructive fire season as well. Along the Front Range it's typical to have long stretches of very hazy days due to smoke from Colorado, California, and Pacific Northwest wildfires.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work on two ranches in Colorado about 30 miles apart from each other and both properties have had wild fires on them. One of the properties was burning in places that had already had a really bad fire in 2002. Itâ€™s scary how normal having your surroundings on fire seems to me now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the whole front range corridor from south Denver to Fort Collins is pretty dense. The amount of people moving here has spiked the density. I live in a placr (Loveland-Fort Collins area) where in a relatively small area we have over 250,000 people. Though we're not really in fire hazard area, more prone to flooding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have had for decades a fire season, but yes, it is getting worse, that's why we get smoke in Vancouver for several weeks in the summer now. That's 2 years in a row it's been dangerous to breathe outside in Vancouver as all the smoke from the Fraser Valley comes right through the valley to us. </p>
<p>I grew up in Kelowna though, I was in Vernon in 2005 when that fire burned down part of Kelowna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Up until modern forest management that smoke was normal. The issue is we spent several decades putting out fires that should've burned and now there's so much fuel the fires can't be put out. Thus not only is the smoke back, but it's worse.</p>
<p>Luckily forest management has shifted to letting small and out of the way fires burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just the interior. Vancouver Island was covered in small forest fires last August. But forest fires have been a major part of coastal Douglas fir ecosystems for millennia. Shortly after European settlement, most of eastern Vancouver Island burned during a particularly dry summer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I don't think many people are aware of the role that fire plays in forest ecology.  The cones of the Ponderosa Pine (common to the dry interior lowlands) have actually evolved to be somewhat dependent on fires to open up.  However, the frequency and intensity of fires in the last decade or two are pretty out-of-pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Utah had several large ones- the three around the junction of highway 6 and highway 89 burned a combined 150,000 acreage. But no structures were lost so it was less newsworthy on a national scale.
