			<div class="markdown"><p>As a semi-related interesting fact, the extremely hard shadows in outside space combined with almost zero drag can actually cause an object to spontaneously start rotating, due to the same effect as the one which powers this neat device:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometer" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes\_radiometer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes\_radiometer</a></a>  Even though I am not sure if this is a problem for actual men-made satellites, over the course of thousands of years, this effect can make asteroids rotate so quickly that they explode.
