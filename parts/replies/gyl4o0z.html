			<div class="markdown"><p>ive always heard this particular explanation and i get what its getting at but its not very satisfying.  </p>
<p>theres lots of things that essential for humans to function, but salt is one of the ones that &quot;tastes good&quot;. given that people can be deficient in vitamins and minerals but almost never you hear of sodium deficiency makes it hard for me to accept its a purely utilitarian reason.  otherwise humans would be munching on vitamin D as much as they can</p></div>		</li>

<p>see, this is what im talking about.  what you said here in the quote is much more relevant and satisfactory to the questions of why we use salt or why it &quot;tastes good&quot; than the catch-all that &quot;we need it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exposure to sunlight causes many chemical reactions in human skin, including vitamin D creation, nitrous oxide creation, and creation of molecules that bind to the same brain receptors as heroin. Yes, tanning beds are literally addictive by the same chemical pathway as opioids. Vitamin D feels good, not specifically by taste like sodium, but similar evolutionary driving force.</p>
<p>Even rudimentary human industry makes salt easy to obtain in quantity, but pre-trade networks non-coastal human populations very much had sodium deficiency risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium deficiency happens. We put salt into all modern food, so it won't just happen because you didn't eat enough salt, but it happens when people sweat out too much salt during sporting events, when they're hospitalized and not eating physical food, etc.</p>
<p>It's not like a vitamin deficiency that slowly progresses to into illness, serious sodium imbalance causes serious damage if not corrected and is lethal.</p></div>		</li>
