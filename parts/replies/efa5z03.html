			<div class="markdown"><p>At what point do they refuse to collect organs based on “abuse” or “wear and tear?” Like say the donor in question has plaque in their arteries. Would they still take the heart with the plaque as it’s better than no heart? Do they remove the plaque, or just say no, this hearts not viable for transplant? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Kentucky and surrounding states you have to call KODA for every death or potential death in the hospital. They will evaluate the patient to see if any donation can be made and also talk to the family. Age of a patient and how long a pt has been passed are main factors. Generally they will not take anything from someone over 80. </p></div>		</li>
