			<div class="markdown"><p>How are you calculating the cost of driving?  Are you including depreciation, maintenance, tire wear, insurance etc?  Are you accounting for the opportunity cost of things you could do as a train passenger that you can't do as a train passenger?  My experience is the cost of fuel is about half the year to year operating costs of a car, and more once you factor in capital cost/depreciation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An Amtrack ticket is often 90-120 bucks in my experience, so yeah, that's definitely more pricey than gas and wear and tear for a one way road trip. For longer east coast rides I've gotten flights for cheaper than the train. I'm pretty sure Amtrak is just expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When people talk about automated trains, it's not about reducing costs by employing less drivers.</p>
<p>It's about increasing fluidity. By being able to automate driving you can launch more trains with less safety distance. Instead of having 1 train with 16 wagons departing every hours, we could have 8 trains each with 2 wagons departing every 7 minutes. We could have better service in rural areas where we have currently 1 or 2 trains a day.</p>
<p>And the answer is it's a good idea but when energy will be more expensive, not now. The only advantage of trains over buses, planes, is they use less energy. But energy is cheap now. Trains use a lot of R&amp;D, and maintenance and that's expensive; we'd need to develop new cheap engines, produce a lot of them, maintain them. That's more expensive than the cost of the energy we'd save.</p></div>		</li>
