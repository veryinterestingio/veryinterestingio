<p>It's an interesting video if a little long that gets to the bottom of why blue screens are blue.  Turns out it's because it was simply the default on the computer that it was first developed on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s one of the reasons they switched to green. Blue is a relatively common clothing colour, only <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/queen-elizabeth-green-screen-outfit-funny-photoshop-battle/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic" target="_blank">weirdoes</a> would wear bright lime green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when blue ties were popular. It was not always picked up before the weatherman ended up with half of Georgia showing through their cheast. This is one of the reasons why a lot of studios have a small clothes rack with a selection of clothes in various sizes in case a guest or an unprepared presenter shows up with a pattern that is not suited for television. Granted that bluescreens have given way to greenscreens which only is a problem on St. Patrics day but it have again given way to huge televisions in the background. However cameras do not work well with tight stripes or checkering patterns and guests might not be aware of this and decides to show up minutes before their inverview in their best striped suit only to be quikcly handed a more suitable attire by a production assistant. Even more funny when at the start of the interview they cut to the reverse only to have the interviewer formulate a long winded question and when they cut back for the answer the subject is wearing completely different clothes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In traditional dark room from film development to create printing plates and the like those cameras couldn't even &quot;see&quot; blue. You could annotate with blue ink and it wouldn't be picked up. Also, you used not be able to sign or endorse a check with blue ink because the camera used to record the transaction... Couldn't &quot;see&quot; blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never ever heard of lenses being calibrated based on color spectrum. Every focus calibration charts, lens alignment chart, and back focus chart I have ever seen is black and white. Can you provide me with a source or some key words to look up? I tried a quick Google of your info and didn't come up with anything.</p>
<p>Are you referring to sensor calibration perhaps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration" target="_blank">Chromatic aberration</a>. </p>
<p>But the thing is, no modern lens used in cinematography isn't going to have some degree of correction for it*, so it isn't really true. In fact, most corrections lead to green being the least corrected colour. See the figure for focus error vs. wavelength for simple, achormatic, apochromatic and superachromatic lenses.</p>
<p>*Not unless it is deliberately made for a more &quot;vintage&quot; look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different colours of light have different refractive indices and so different colours of light are focused to different points. This causes chromatic aberration. Almost all modern lenses have some level of correction for chromatic aberration but it can't be removed entirely. Almost all lenses are designed such that the best image is achieved with green light since it is the middle of the spectrum, then red/blue are under/over focused respectively. Old film lenses often have a second infinity focus mark specifically for infrared light because it is far enough from green that an 'in focus' image in green light will actually be completely out of focus for infrared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The keyword to search for is chromatic aberration. The effect varies between lenses. The reason why focus charts are black and white is because you are then able to focus on an average of all the colors, which happens to be close to green. If you try to focus on a focus chart with a bad lense you might notice that you get a purple fringe around the object which is casued by the red and blue colors not being properly focused. If you change the focus you can casue it to become a bigger blue fringe or a bigger red fringe but you are never able to get rid of it until you buy a better lense.</p></div>		</li>
