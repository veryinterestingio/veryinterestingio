<p>Concrete does not have any bounce to it.</p>

<p>Only relative to the human body. A good way to think about materials is that almost everything can be modeled as a spring. Stiffer springs (like industrial coils) take a huge amount of energy to compress, while flexible springs (like the one in a clicky pen) take very little. Concrete is like an array of very stiff springs, and regular soil in your backyard is like an array of not-so-stiff springs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also it turns out shoes have been really bad for humans since it encourages us to walk with our heels. historically humans walked more like animals with their toes which are made to absorb impact. over time we started walking on our heels which let's that impact go straight up to our spine resulting in back pain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your skin has a remarkable ability to thicken where irritated.</p>
<p>If you're still adverse to going barefoot, check out minimalist shoes with zero drop heels and retrain yourself to shorten your gait and step with your forefoot. This allows your quadriceps to function as shock absorbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When walking on your forefoot like the guy above you stated, you'll rarely step into something painful. Your body will react before you've really hit the object, and because you're not stomping down your feet the pointyness doesn't really matter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an ultra runner, I respectfully disagree. This was a trend in running for about 5 years but has greatly wained. It is true that going barefoot does help build stabilizing muscles and can be beneficial when done in moderation. Just because proto-humans went barefoot (and naked) doesn't mean it is smart or desirable. Try running without a sports bra or without having your nuts secured and let me know how that works out.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I also wanted of add that when our caveman ancestors walked around without shoes, the average life-span was probably 30 years or so.  People didn't live long, so they weren't necessarily subject to the long-term issues that we are given our much longer life expectancy.  Running with stuff like Vibram 5-fingers, etc. will absolutely negatively impact your body the more miles/kilometers you rack up.  It just isn't a safe or smart trend to buy into.  Your body will pay a price (eventually) and the bill you pay may very well negatively affect your mobility and quality of life.  Sorry for getting on a soap-box, but as a guy who knows a <em>lot</em> about running, I hate to see people get involved with these fads that are actually pretty dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I jumped on the minimalist shoe bandwagon for awhile after reading &quot;Born to Run&quot; (still a fun read, btw, even if the science doesn't hold up too well). After a series of nagging lower leg injuries (calf tear, strained achilles) that I could never completely recover from, I've moved back to shoes with more padding and finding my body is appreciative.  </p>
<p>I still do love the feel of minimalist, lightweight shoes, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 30 year life expectancy is because before modern medicine and hospitals a lot of babies would die in childbirth or within the first six months. The average age to die at would have been close to what it is today. It's not like 30 was the equivalent of being an old man back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have always walked on our heels, not our toes. There is a reason why our heels look like they do (with a lot of padding).</p>
<p>However, there is a difference in how we set our feet down. Shoe-less walkers place the ball of their foot on the ground first and then their heel. But with a padded and/or raised heel you place your heel first and then the ball of the foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And most modern shoes have a raised heel anyways, placing pressure towards the front of your feet. (Running shoes,boots or dress shoes, and obviously the extreme example of high-heeled shoes)</p>
<p>Plus look at <em>any</em> fitness literature and they will all tell you to push through your heel for leg exercises.</p></div>		</li>
