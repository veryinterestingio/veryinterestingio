			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps, if someone uses feet, divide by 3 and you have meters.  100 feet: 30 meters.  It's not an accurate conversion, but it's close enough to get an idea of scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is almost exactly six times the pressure at my water meter, but my faucets all developed drips within a year of installation, and I had to install a regulator, to reduce the pressure enough to be more manageable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure whats used in the USA (faucets) but I'd suggest that's likely a function of wear and tear on poor quality materials than pressure.</p>
<p>A household tap is no more than a standard gate valve. With the seal created by rubber gasket on a tapered brass face (or similar). Each fitting will be rated for much higher than residential water pressure....for a while at least. </p>
<p>I'd love to have more water pressure here...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water pressure fluctuates a bunch different times of the day, generally going up at night when there are less users. At least that's what the plumbers told me one time when I asked about it.</p></div>		</li>
