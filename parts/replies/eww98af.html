			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically no, since it’s relative to the previous quarter. A 0.3% means the economy did in fact expand ( not much! ), but it did.</p>
<p>Of course the rate of expansion (think acceleration) scares people and can be a sign of bad things to come. The car is still moving forward , just not as fast if your quarterlies are decreasing</p></div>		</li>
