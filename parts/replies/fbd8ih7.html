			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer, but you're missing one key element: service on the US debt.  Who does it go to?  That's the big secret, because if the US owns their own fiat, they wouldn't need to pay interest on it.  But they do, because the Federal Reserve Act gave ownership of the US dollar to banks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a big secret. Interest on US Treasury securities goes to the holders of those securities. Holders can be banks, brokerages, pension funds, individuals, corporations, anybody.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if the US owns their own fiat, they wouldn't need to pay interest on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That isn't true and doesn't follow. The Treasury pays interest on securities because that's what it promises to do. It also works to set a floor on interest rates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Federal Reserve Act gave ownership of the US dollar to banks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's also not true. Dollars are created via government spending. The Federal Reserve is the government's bank and the lender of last resort to private banks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most dollars are created by banks through fractional reserve rules. When loans are funded by banks money is credited to the recipients account. Then reserve ratios need to be met by the bank who issued the loan. That's why there is sometimes a large disconnect between the monetary base and other measurements of money like M1 and M2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, all points. Though it's worth noting that private banks also create money, when they're allowed to do fractional reserve banking, which basically means loaning the same dollar to multiple people at the same time. This makes the economy function like it has more dollars than the government created, and in practice is as real to us as if they had physically printed the money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't need to, they choose to. The Fed could set interest rates to negative if it wanted to and still sell bonds. </p>
<p>Plus you can own your own fiat, whether anyone <em>wants</em> your fiat (tied to how low an interest rate you can get away with) is a totally different issue. </p>

<p>But it's not a big secret? It goes to the main financial institutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Mostly this, but it's whoever happens to own a specific bond when it matures, which can be individual people.</p>
<p>Maybe this isn't clear to them: when the government wants to issue bonds equal to some value, it's not one single bond, but a lot of small ones. It's a little bit like when a company issues stock, it releases a lot of small-value shares of stock, not one giant share worth the entire company. So most Americans could afford to buy treasury bonds if they want, but more often the owners end up being institutions, because that's who has money to park somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Fed doesn't sell bonds, the Treasury does. And no private entity is going to buy a bond at negative interest. (The negative interest rates you hear about in Europe and other areas are very different things.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a big secret, because if the US kept control of its FIAT, instead of paying out 500billion a year to financial institutions, the country would be making 500billion a year from giving loans to it's citizens via money creation and collecting it back plus interest.</p>
<p>Instead our shit politicians allow banks to take all that $$$ because oh I dunno why not, it's just us taxpayers who get stuck with the ever increasing payroll tax that didn't even need to exist before the federal reserve act.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So deficit spending is when the government spends more money than it receives. To do this they have to make more currency, which devalues it. To avoid that they issue bonds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, or, as I prefer to say it, a government with currency control can always turn a debt problem into an inflation problem or vice versa, and the fact they can do that, and everyone (in markets at least) knows they can do that, already connects their inflation and borrowing interest rates, as people try to make money off guessing what they'll do.</p></div>		</li>
