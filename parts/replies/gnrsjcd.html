			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Now I wonder why the brain can play this out of sight out of mind thing with physical phenomena but not emotional phenomena. Or does it? Does anxiety/depression not occur if we cease to think about it?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no! So it can do, but it’s not something you can consciously do yourself, just as you can’t consciously forget about your nose. ‘Don’t think of a white elephant!’ </p>
<p>But it does so with emotional and physical phenomena. If you’re shot, or your arm is blown off by a grenade, you’re brain may choose not to immediately let you know about it? Why? Because it’s useful, if you’re in a situation where your arm is blown off, then your brain going ‘oh fuck look at that, feel all this debilitating pain’ is not gonna help the situation, much more likely you won’t feel much until your adrenaline lowers, when you’re in a safer environment, at which point your brain can go ‘alright, sort out the arm’. </p>
<p>Same can be done with emotions, I know personally from losing someone close, I heard the news and felt... nothing, I was confused, definitely shocked but didn’t feel it emotionally, the situation was obviously so disastrous that your brain doesn’t want to fuck you over immediately, as you may need a clear head to deal with the situation, obviously this wasn’t the case in my situation, there was nothing I could do, but my brain doesn’t know this. And yeh it took about two days before I cried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with anxiety and depression, I can definitely pretty much make them disappear by delving deep into something I enjoy for example. I think my ADHD helps with this. Of course it doesn't really solve the issues or anything! But hey at least I'm able to laugh and not feel like total shit all the time, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well now that you point it out, i’m stuck in manual breathing mode. Which brings up a good question, are people stuck in “manual breathing mode” like if the brain they are stuck with wasn’t developed or was mutated into not having that subconscious activity of “automatic” breathing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This always freaked me out as a kid. I so frequently felt like I was stuck in “manual breathing mode” that my doctor thought I had asthma. Wasn’t until my 20’s that I could articulate the sensation better and realized I’ve had bad anxiety most my life!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean like is that a condition? I’ve never heard of it, and I would be very surprised if it was, as it would also mean you couldn’t breath when you sleep, and unconsciousness would equal death. </p>
<p>You can if you want though enter ‘automatic’ mode manually. By breathing heavily into a paper back, reduce your co2 levels enough and your body will take over for you, and start breathing automatically, it’s a strange feeling, a teacher showed us in class years ago, although I think it’s generally considered a little dangerous nowadays, but then what isn’t!</p></div>		</li>
