			<div class="markdown"><p>At least colloquially in the medical field here in the US, and in my experience, most people refer to the body's natural production as adrenaline, and the administered medication epinephrine. </p>
<p>You are, of course, technically correct as they are both interchangeable, and there is no practical difference between the two besides the means of production and entry into the body.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EMT here - Epinephrine and norepinephrine are the medically accurate terms for said neurotransmitters (there’a also a much more complicated chemical name for Epi, but I don’t know it off the top of me head). Adrenaline was coined as a trade name for Epi extracted from the adrenal gland in the early 1900’s and is much more catchy so it has stuck around as the common colloquial term. We also use a brand name Norepinephrine product called Levophed for hypotensive patients as it has less cardiac related side effects vs Epinephrine, but is just as good as a vasopressor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also causes an extreme state of hyperfocus and desire to identify and end problems. It is the extreme high that slams you in the face at the poker table as well or freezes a person solid during a panic attack.</p>
<p>Poker is an interesting way to experience it since the thing you need to do is sit there and let it pass, so you really have nothing to do but feel it.</p>
<p>Of note, after a strong hit of adrenalin it isn't uncommon for players to make especially bad mistakes in their play; so while I think it helps in picking up on small details and making snap decisions, it does this at the cost of deep analysis and judgement.</p>
<p>In fact, I would go as far as to say that, if all of the players at the table understand the odds involved in the poker game being played, then a significant portion of the game becomes adrenalin management. Avoiding/enduring it yourself; inducing/exploiting it in others. Or, as the saying goes &quot;You want to put your opponent on hard decisions&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Its main evolutionary reason for being, though, is the reward system it compels organisms with. </p>
<p>It’s present in almost every organism on the planet that has a brain, one of the first neurotransmitters to evolve, with a purpose so vital to survival it’s barely changed in hundreds of millions of years - that is except in humans, where it is more complex than its variants found in other animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I think of it more as the &quot;motivation&quot; hormone than &quot;reward,&quot; especially because that word &quot;motivation&quot; takes its root from movement.</p>
<p>It's involved in &quot;reward-seeking&quot; behavior, which includes the actions you take to get there, which usually includes a lot of motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that MDMA mostly just releases all of your serotonin which is why you feel so amazing. But Norepinephrine as you describe it sounds like it causes a lot of the symptoms that come with taking MDMA. Can you elaborate please</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MDMA does affect serotonin, which is why 5-htp can help ameliorate the comedown, but as it is derived from amphetamine (I think), it also acts on dopamine, norepinephrine and adrenaline. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, as are most stimulants. Different stim drugs have differing degrees of reuptake-inhibition for each of those 3 neurotransmitter, basically. MDMA inhibits the reuptake of serotonin greatly, and dopamine and norepinephrine moderately; whereas cocaine will greatly inhibit dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, and moderately inhibit serotonin reuptake. Straight-up amphetamines (and their non-empathogen/entactogen/hallucinogen analogues) will cause a moderate reuptake-inhibition of all three. Amphetamine and dextro-amphetamine produce lesser reuptake-inhibition (but at a similar ratio of catecholamines to each other, if that makes sense) than a stronger amp like methamphetamine would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right. It floods weeks worth of serotonin into your brain, which is what makes you feel so good. </p>
<p>It also releases norepinephrine, which does indeed cause many of the physical symptoms such as jaw clenching and the wiggles. </p>
<p>The wiggles feel absolutely godlike :)</p></div>		</li>
