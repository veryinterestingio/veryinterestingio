<p>Edit: Guys, I know humans have instincts, I'm a human myself! I'm talking about instinctual behaviours involving creation using complex methods like weaving a nest or a puffer fish making complex patterns in sand. Basically, having natural instincts to create UNNATURAL things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>TLDR</strong>: humans have instinctual behaviors. We just talk abaut them with a lot more nuance and specificity so we don't normally think of it as animalistic instinct.  </p>
<p>Humans feel compelled to decorate and furnish their shelters. And our modern homes are not too far from the caves of our cave-ancestor. That's at least partly due to instinct - naturally having this anxiety about ourselves unless we have shelter that meets some never-expressed requirements.   </p>
<p>Humans need room to move around in all directions while covered from the elements. Why do we not live in tunnels like rabbits? Those can make more efficient use of space. Or a hammock between some trees like a spider? Or with minimal shelter like many other mammals.   </p>
<p>Why do human feel a need to collect stuff. I've got a nice rock collection. Some artwork. Jewelery. Other things that bring me joy. Why so much stuff? Other animals don't feel compelled to hoard like humans.   </p>
<p>This is to say, i know <em>why</em> humans are this way evolutinarily. But who taught us to be this way. The need to have things and consume feels much deeper than something we pick up from our parents.   </p>
<p>How do we know how to have sex? Growing up, many of humans never get exposed to sex.... What about masturbation. We've all done it or thought about doing it. But most people's first encounter with the idea of masturbation is not through learning about it from others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used tailorbirds in my original post specifically because I don't think that an in-born desire for an  e n d  r e s u l t  is enough for them to be able to do what they do. It seems to me that they also need to know the  m e t h o d  of achieving it. And that's not something I would say humans have at birth. Our homes end up similar, because of an instinctive desire, that makes sense. But the ways we build them are extremely diverse and we learn them after being born, from others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire way you view the world visually is instinctual. The way you walk around using your eyes is all instinctual.</p>
<p>It's absolute background noise to you, but being able to process the image that comes into your brain is immensely complex. You can tell how far away something is. You can see a car in the distance and know that the car is quite large you are just far away. You know that objects that move away from you aren't actually getting smaller. You can judge distance, depth, layering.</p>
<p>You're also an incredibly pattern recognition machine. Facial expressions have maybe millions of permutations and you can process nearly an infinite amount of them accurately. You can see through a massive variety of animals camouflage by just noticing the pattern doesn't fit.</p>
<p>Your entire body can practically instantly be suffused with a potent stimulating chemical (adrenaline) the moment your body recognises one of the many dangers it's trained to detect, and it can do all this before your brain has even processed the image.</p>
<p>Our instincts are nothing short of miraculous tbh.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is an instinctual template, thank god. Imagine being compelled to build something but having no idea of what or how. </p>

<p>I think the real question here — or at least the question that I find most interesting — is how a bird <em>gets</em> the instinctual template for a nest in particular. The urge to build something without knowing what could be satisfied by building a pile of tiny stones, or a dam in a creek formed by piling up twigs, or an area on the ground covered completely with tree bark. But instead all of these birds — even the ones born in plastic containers — specifically have the urge to build <em>nests.</em> How is that encoded genetically? How does nature ensure that the <em>specific object</em> the bird gets the urge to build is shaped and structured a particular way, without the bird ever seeing that shape or structure? What proteins or amino acid sequences mean “nest” in a fundamental way as opposed to meaning “pile of stones” or “wall of bark” or anything else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watched a video of an abandoned beaver kit picked up by a family, by the time it had been nursed somewhat back to health it had imprinted on the family so couldn't be released. Even this beaver kit, assumingly never having seen a dam was  piling up towels, shoes, anything it could find to make little dams all over the house. It's pretty amazing what instinct can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my own country (Canada), we have an awful ass-backwards law that exists to &quot;protect nature&quot; that says if anyone were to find an abandoned baby beaver (or any wild animal), you can't save its life. If you pick it up and bring it back to your house to raise it as a pet, the government will come to your house and kill it the moment they learn of it's existence. I've read stories of this happening to several Canadians, even people who lived out in the sticks.</p>
<p>One family in British Columbia had a female deer they'd rescued as a baby. They lived way out in the woods by themselves, this deer was like 10 years old, lived inside the house, had a large fenced in backyard, and basically had the mannerisms of a dog. Still wasn't ok with the government. I believe the family posted a single video of the deer on Instagram. The next day the government showed up, took the deer out of their house, and shot it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a 2007 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/104/14/6066" target="_blank">study of mice</a> that provided evidence for how nesting instincts work in the brain. What they found is that there's a hard-coded part of the brain in mice that lights up whenever they see a nest or nest-like shape. Basically, in the context of trying to build a shelter, nest-like shapes are more satisfying than non-nest-like shapes, so they'll tend towards that shape as they piece it together.</p>
<p>And while there are definitely specific genes involved that lead to developing a &quot;nest-detector&quot; in the brain, it's worth noting that brains can develop hyper-specialized &quot;detectors&quot; all on their own without hard-coding. In 2005, the <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/single-cell-recognition-halle-berry-brain-cell-1013#" target="_blank">Halle Berry neuron study</a> showed that researchers were able to pinpoint a specific neuron in a subject's brain that exclusively fired when seeing the name or face of the actress Halle Berry. Of note, researchers at OpenAI this year <a href="https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/" target="_blank">demonstrated the same behavior</a> in artificial neural networks.</p></div>		</li>
