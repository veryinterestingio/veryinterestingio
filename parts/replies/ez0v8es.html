<p>A better answer is, there's a part of the visual cortex that's responsible for making all sorts of transformations to the incoming image. Not just flipping it, but correcting for distortions, applying persistence, etc. </p>
<p>Some of these functions are more or less permanent unless you take drugs or are sick. Some of these functions adapt slowly over time, such as flipping. Some of these functions adapt quickly over time, such as colour/motion correction.</p>
<p>Here's an optical illusion that demonstrates just how quickly the convolutional layer of the visual cortex tunes itself to input: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtsjIAM5Z0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtsjIAM5Z0</a></p>
<p>This illusion is messing with the part of your visual cortex which compensates for relative motion between you and what you're looking at. Without it, your vision would be jerky (think unstabilised handheld camera video). This part is active all the time and is altering what you perceive all the time. The illusion just simulates a high amplitude motion and your visual cortex quickly adapts to compensate for it. When you look at a stationary object, you can briefly observe how your visual cortex is distorting the input from the eyes. Flipping the input from the eyes is just another mechanically similar function of the cortex.</p>
<p>The picture that we perceive is almost completely a 'lie' in the sense that it's significantly different from raw optical nerve input in almost every way. Fun fact: when your eyes move from one object to another, the brain briefly ignores the input from the optical nerve since it's a blur. If someone were to quickly flash a light in your face during this eye movement, you would never know it.</p>
<p>When you're looking at bright objects like a computer screen, the cones in your eyes quickly become saturated and stop transmitting signal. Your optical system compensates by doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">saccade</a> movments and slightly shifting where the eyes point to activate a new set of rods while the saturated ones cool down. You are never aware that this is happening. Your perceived image remains perfectly still even though your eyes just shifted by an entire degree or two. The visual cortex is fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Action, feedback, interpretation. The neural network in your brain learns this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are reasonably sure at this point that the convolutional layer is capable of geometric transforms like a flip. And this has been demonstrated through experiments such as the one linked. Your original statement 'this is not that your brain flips the image' is incorrect. We can optically flip the image before the brain receives it, and the brain adapts to flip it back. </p>
<p>If you ever got the spins from being dizzy/drunk, it's pretty evident that the visual cortex is doing a ton of transform work and it's not always about 'matching feedback against actions', whatever that means.</p></div>		</li>
