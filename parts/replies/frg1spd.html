			<div class="markdown"><p>hi u/baconmongoose! Quite a few of our programs would love to have your participation. I am the project lead of Exoplanet Watch, a project that observes exoplanets, planets outside of our solar system, with small ground-based telescopes to help use large telescopes more efficiently. We have a bunch of high schoolers and their teachers already involved and would love to have your participation- please take a look at our website to see how to get involved! <a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/" target="_blank"><a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch" target="_blank">https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch</a></a>- Rob Zellem</p></div>		</li>
