			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally a crane base is constructed and designed into the foundations of the building using a lift shaft base.
The crane may also need addition ballast to act on the base to stop it falling or twisting and this can be achieved by filling ballast cages with material that will be used in the construction such as blocks or bricks or hardcore that would be used after the crane has been finished with to save on having to cart the material back off site</p></div>		</li>
