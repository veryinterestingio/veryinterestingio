<p>I guess the problems teachers have is that they're trying to explain stuff to everyone, and they only really get one shot at it.  On Reddit, you can pick the explanation that helps you most.  But teachers are usually willing to spend some time with you if there's something in particular you can't get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, people are sometimes a little more ready to learn about mundane things as an adult. We might learn things more quickly as a child in some cases from a numerological perspective, but people in high school are thinking about video games and weird boners too much to be receptive to math. And in math, one you stop paying attention for 10 minutes, you're fucked for the semester.</p>
<p>The other thing that I think goes wrong is a lot of high school math focuses to much on procedure and repetition, with no philosophy or application to break it up or contextualize. It always just felt like I was learning bullshit I didn't need to know. And I have trouble understanding how things work if I don't understand the concept behind it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you plot a graph of y=e^x and then you measure the slope at any point along the x axis, you'll find the slope is exactly e^x .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of a joke:</p>
<p>The mathematical functions are all throwing a big party. Everyone is having fun, except e^x who's standing alone in a corner.</p>
<p>sin(x) comes over to them and asks &quot;Hey, why are you all alone in a corner? Come integrate with the rest of us.&quot;</p>
<p>e^x answers &quot;Nah, it's all the same to me.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of pi and e, let's look at Euler's identity, which states that:</p>
<p><em>e</em>^<em>iπ</em> + 1 = 0</p>
<p>It is recognized as perhaps the most beautiful formula in math, for how it links together some of the most fundamental mathematical numbers.</p>
<p><em>e</em> = Euler's number (which OP asked about as the subject of this reddit post)</p>
<p><em>π</em>= the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter</p>
<p><em>i</em> = the imaginary unit, where <em>i</em>^2 = -1</p>
<p>And obviously, Euler's identity also has 1 and 0, which should need no further explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, let's say, you're a math whiz and you're doing some cool math stuff. You're testing out your ability to do square roots starting at 1 (for the sake of simplicity) and counting down by whole numbers. </p>
<p>Sqrt(1) = 1, no problem.
Sqrt (0) = 0, no problem.
Sqrt (-1) = ... , Hmmm.</p>
<p>Based on our understanding of math, it's impossible to square the same real numbers and get a negative number because a negative times a negative equals a positive, and a positive times a positive equals a positive. So therefore it's impossible right?</p>
<p>Not so fast. Math says, as long as you can do something and get internally consistent results, it's valid, so we invent the number i to represent the square root of negative one. But all of the math that we can do works with that, so it's called an imaginary number. </p>
<p>A real mathematician can correct all the miriad mistakes I have made in this explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i is defined as the square root of negative one. Since no &quot;real&quot; number squared is a negative number, i is an &quot;imaginary&quot; number. It's a funny term because imaginary numbers are useful in signal processing and whatnot.</p></div>		</li>
