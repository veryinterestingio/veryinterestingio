In fact, the GSR shows that the trend over the past five years actually points to an overall decoupling of global economic growth and CO2 emissions (<a href="https://www.ren21.net/gsr-2021/assets/img/Figure_57_2021-super.png" target="_blank">see this figure</a>). Renewable energy combined with energy efficiency are key in making this possible. In other words, we need rising global energy demand to be met with renewable sources, but at the same time, we need to invest in energy efficient technologies and infrastructure to make sure this demand does not rise too much too fast.<br />
We often hear about economic growth and emissions reduction as being incompatible objectives, especially in the context of developing countries. In reality though, there are significant emissions to be avoided by scaling up energy efficiency across households, industries and transport in these countries, where conservation and efficiency tends to be the “lowest-hanging fruit” in the energy transition. Decommissioning fossil fuel and deploying renewable energy are equally important, but a number of political challenges stand in the way. Energy efficiency and conservation, however, are more politically feasible starting points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question here! What sort of evidence do you have to argue that decoupling is possible to the level that it will help us avoid climate catastrophe, looking at current trends of  energy consumption across the globe? Do you think that it will be as feasible to decouple in MDCs as in LDCs.? What sort of trade offs do you think that LDCs will have to engage in when assuming renewable energies and foregoing other forms of energy creation? I'm other words, how do you think that MDCs can convince LDCs to adopt these sort of energies and forego their current investments in fossil fuels ?</p></div>		</li>
