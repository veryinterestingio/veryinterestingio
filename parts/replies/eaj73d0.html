			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain to me how light can be 65 billion years away when we believe the big bang was 13 billion years ago? I always thought the maximum distance possible from one side of the universe to the other would be 26 GLY (light travelling both directions for 13 billion years). </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are also galaxies whose light we have already received in the past but which are currently too far away for any signal emitted from us now to reach them some time in the future.</p>

<p>Wow - so we're stuck with a permanent snapshot of their past state?  If we zoom  waaaaay in, will we see aliens stopped in place?  Like mid-sip on their cappuccino or whatever?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, galaxies that approach the event horizon from within the horizon will appear to just freeze in place at the horizon. So even if that galaxy, say, emitted two signals only a few seconds apart (as measured in its rest frame) towards the end of the history that we see, we will eventually see those same two signals many billions of years apart. So the galaxy isn't quite frozen, but it may as well be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a little tangent to what you guys are discussing, but are those two signals emitted the only two signals we'll see for billions of years? What happens between those two signals? From our perspective would there just be nothing? I see your math flair, so in a math context I guess I'm wondering if signals emitted and signals received must be a one to one function.</p></div>		</li>
