<p>In surgery, there is a full-time anesthesiologist there to monitor and maintain the unconscious patient. </p>
<p>If you've ever wondered why police don't use tranquilizers as a non-lethal way to subdue suspects, this is why. The drugs don't act very quickly, it's difficult to estimate the correct dosage, and there is a high risk of death. They don't get the same training that a wildlife manager would have (and those people usually have a helicopter to follow the wild animals after they're shot).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Versed/midazolam isn't on the same level as most inhaled anesthetic drugs, and while dentists use nitrous they use it in lower quantities and it is still less... advanced than say isoflurane.</p>
<p>The bigger issue though is that in general surgery, the patient is typically given a muscle relaxant that will stop them from breathing.  The anesthesiologist is responsible for using a machine to perform this function on behalf of the patient, and failure to get everything right would typically be much more serious than in dental surgery.  (Patient suffocating, or patient being able to move during major surgery, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably thinking of propofol, the short acting anesthetic that actually puts you to sleep and can be used via drip. Versed is a conscious &quot;sedation&quot; drug similar to valium or xanax (it gives amnesia and is anti-anxiety) that last a couple of hours per dose, though is still used in the settings you mention. Versed and propofol are usually used in conjunction with fentanyl, gases, and paralytics if needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anesthetist here. We have two inhaled anesthetics that work fairly quick. One is profoundly pungent and very irritating to the airways and lungs, so getting someone to inhale it (desflurane) would be difficult even at low concentrations (4-6%). </p>
<p>The other drug is sevoflorane. It’s not nearly as irritating to inhale, but it stinks pretty bad. We sometimes mix it with nitrous and give it in the highest concentrations available (8%) and with that combo we can get kids asleep in 10-20 seconds under ideal situations. Adults would take longer (I’ve done this, it takes minutes).  </p>
<p>But in either of these scenarios, one could try and get very high concentrations and force someone to inhale it and you MIGHT get a very fast KO. But at minimum it would take the amount of time required for the breath in, the blood to flow from the lungs back to the heart and then up to the brain and for the gases to have their effect. So I remain quite dubious that any known anesthetic available today could have the effect shown in the movies. I can imagine 10-15 seconds or so, under the best (worst?) conditions for an adult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrous is a great drug, and in conjunction with the other volatile anesthetics, really speeds their onset. Nitrous alone is an insufficient drug for what’s seen on TV. </p>
<p>The reality is that there’s very few drugs that work that quickly. With fairly rare exceptions, we are using IV propofol to put people to sleep. We use an enormous dose and it still takes 10-20 seconds to work usually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has rebreathed pure nitrous for 60 seconds on multiple occasions, no it isn't. What they use at the dentist is usually a max of 50/50 N2O/O2 and that takes a bit to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drug user here.  In an attack, I don't know. I've done my share of whippits (8gram cartridges of compressed N2O at 98.2% purity [food grade], released into a balloon or cream whipping can) and an entire lungfull, which can be an entire 8gram can, takes 8-10 seconds to cause unconsciousness <em>if</em> you even go out.</p>
<p>I doubt anyone could get someone out in 10 seconds while trying to force them to inhale it in an attack. And even when dosing with a mask, you are breathing oxygen as well, so it would probably be a lower concentration. I guess if you were breathing fast, but with a contraption in your face, you're probably going to try and hold your breath </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: I have a certification in mouse surgeries and use isoflurane for that and it seems to knock them out in less than half a minute. When it leaked during an accident I also couldn’t really smell anything and it very quickly made some of the scientists in that room woozy. However, I have zero human anesthesia training.</p>
<p>Why is isoflurane not used on humans to knock them out quickly, and if it was, how long would it take to knock out a person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do use it! Though it’s kinda fallen out of favor due to various aspects of its effect. I know nothing about mouse physiology, but I can guess a couple things about them that may result in faster inhaled inductions. First would be their relatively high cardiac output/hear rate. I’m assuming their hearts beat faster than most humans. That makes for a faster effect from inhaled drugs. It’s one reason why kids KO faster than adults. Another would be a faster respiratory rate. Again- I’m assuming they breathe faster than humans and again, a reason why kids fall asleep faster than adults. I must emphasize my ignorance when it comes to animals/mice. These are purely guesses. </p>
<p>As far as the people in your lab that got woozy, I guess it just depends on how much they got over how long. It doesn’t take much (it’s rather potent) to make someone sleepy. But it has a rather crap blood:gas coefficient which makes it a poor gas for quick inhaled inductions. </p>
<p>On the bright side, it’s not as pungent as the others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IM ketamine does work, and it’s fairly quick. But we are still talking minutes and not seconds. IV ketamine is significantly faster than IM, but again we are limited on speed by physiology. It takes time for blood to circulate and for the drug to take effect. </p>
<p>Ketamine is a great drug for an anesthetic. I use it every day in conjunction with other drugs. It cannot reasonably be used alone. Major side effects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if you're totally cool with killing someone. There are many, many anaesthetics that are fast-acting, could be administered as vapours from a rag, and that you could protect yourself from.</p>
<p>You now have 40 seconds to intubate your victim, and ensure their airway remains open and their respiratory rate is adequate. You have to stay with them until they regain consciousness, and then ensure that they don't die from common sequelae of anaesthesia.</p>
<p>Google for &quot;Rapid sequence induction protocol&quot; and learn how it's done.</p>
<p>Really, in a crime scenario, it's cheaper, easier, and has exactly the same outcome to slice through the arteries in the neck and leave them to drown in their own blood. Same outcome, cheaper tools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually most anesthetic gases we use come in liquid form but have to be used in pressurized vaporizers and some even need to be in a heated vaporizer to work. Putting them on a rag would be ineffective. So no, there's not really &quot;many many&quot; anesthetics that could be administered from a rag.</p>
<p>Also RSI is actually just to prevent aspiration (getting shit into your lungs) because of a loss of airway reflexes. And you don't necessarily need to intubate to manage an airway. You could theoretically bag mask someone forever.</p>
<p>Also inhaled anesthetics typically don't stop your breathing. They may make it disorganized and irregular by screwing with your body's regulatory check points, but you'll typically continue breathing.</p>
<p>You actually have much more than 40 seconds to intubate. Depending on the person, it's more like 2-3 minutes until they desaturate on room air ie deplete their oxygen stores. Then it's like 5 minutes until their brain gets irreversible brain damage from the lack of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
