			<div class="markdown"><p>You are using a bug where LastPass ENTERPRISE created share folders with admins and the users didn’t understand that was happening - as proof that LP is bad?</p>
<p>OK. LastPass is the largest password manager company and has the most hack attempts. To date they have lost no passwords of users.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to know. This is an area I think it makes sense to go with a company providing a service over some open source software and a blob published to a random cloud provider. There is no 100k bounty for an open source collab... and I DO NOT buy the “hundreds of eyes on it” approach (HeartBleed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. For the average user, the tiny number of flaws in the top line password managers still leave the user more secure than both managing passwords manually and running your own offline manager.  </p>
<p>The former for obvious reasons.  </p>
<p>The latter because the average user doesn't have the skills to successfully use a manual password manager securely.  </p>
<p>Clearly there are edge cases where an offline manager is more secure, but for the average users, lastpass is better.  </p>
<p>The issues that have been discovered in lastpass are patched very quickly (much faster than even an experienced IT professional would likely patch an offline store).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there isn't really much you can fuck up using an offline manager. The only real problem I see is using a weak master password or storing it in plaintext somewhere, but that's the case for online managers too.</p>
<p>Even if someone gets a hand on your database, which is inherently more difficult on a local database than on a cloud database, it shouldn't be that of a big deal, as that's why you should use a proper encryption method and master key in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terrible advice.</p>
<p>You call my mom and try and switch her from Lastpass to keepass... I’ll be waiting for you to concede.</p>
<p>Keepass not only can be set up wrong but relies on also having access to your cloud provider anywhere you want to use it. Not only is this foolish, it’s just another account to remember and step to perform.</p></div>		</li>
