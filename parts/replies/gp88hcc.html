			<div class="markdown"><p>But it also depends on the country from where you live.
As a Canadian use mostly use hydroelectricity. (Seem we have some nuclear as well).</p>
<p>So here it may be more green.</p>
<p>But with the new push, and if corporate stop taxing solar panels in US, even citizens could generate power which will reduce our &quot;power usage&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly my point. The question was specific to a grid using fossil fuels, and even with that it's still worth it since we're greening the grid. It's the same idea as having industry move to using electricity for heat and not have every factory burning coal to heat processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity for heat is a thermodynamical nightmare unless you have no other use for it or can produce it renewably.</p>
<p>That is, as long as you need to have a coal powerstation, you shouldn't be using electricity for fuel. Boiler conversion is close to 80%, Central conversion is 40% or so. Plus transmission losses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a shame the rest of the world doesn't look like Ontario or France or Sweden.  No reason it couldn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess we kinda push at one erea to go nuclear (when it was new) but because of the draw back then (and the fact we didn't see CO2 as a waste vs nuclear waste + the potential nuclear incident) we didn't push this energy nowadays.</p>
<p>Possible good news, it seems research were still going on and we have mini-nuclear reactor that shouldn't cause a meltdown as the worst case scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Texas' failings were not due to renewables failing, they were due to a brilliant combination of incompetence and failing gas generators. Our god-awful governor used it as an opportunity to line his pockets by putting out anti-renewable propaganda while we sat in single digit temperatures with no running water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Texas's grid fell apart because of breakdowns across <em>all</em> generator types, not because specifically the renewables failed.  Natural gas plants (51%) broke, nuclear (10%) plants broke, and wind (20%) did too.  All because of insufficient winterization.</p>
<p>It's incredibly cynical that Texas politicians have blamed renewables for the disaster.  It covers up ERCOT's incompetence, and it also turns Texans against the renewables that were starting to replace natural gas and coal.</p></div>		</li>
