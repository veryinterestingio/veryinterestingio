<p>You're just very good at explaining things, so I figured I'd ask! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So your immune system is 'feeling' for these patterns on the blood cells. I don't know how well to explain this within ELI5 so... As I understand it, immune cells 'feel' these patterns by the blood cell proteins interacting with proteins that the immune cell is presenting on its own surface. When it finds this pattern it activates the immune response and starts wiping out anything with that pattern.</p>
<p>The way your immune system works is that in the womb you essentially have a response to <em>everything</em> and then a combination of your own body and your mother's work to remove the parts of the immune system that target your own body. So a lot of immune disorders then basically arise from that process not really working properly (there's a lot of stochastic randomness to this so <em>technically</em> there might be parts of <em>everyone</em> that is <em>slightly</em> auto-immune if that makes sense?).</p>
<p>So then if you're Type A, by the time you are born you no longer have any immune response to the Type A protein on blood cells, your immune system can only 'feel' the Type B protein because all the cells that <em>could</em> have felt the Type A protein were already removed. So then what's happening is any Type B blood that gets introduced triggers that response as in the first paragraph above, while Type A just appears as invisible to your immune system. Likewise because blood cells from a Type O donor just don't have this protein at all, there isn't anything that can trigger a response, but is why then a Type O donor can't <em>receive</em> blood with either A or B (or AB), because they still have the immune cells present that will react to either type of protein.</p>
<p>The same principle works with the rhesus protein that gives you the + or the - to your blood group, but there is only the one variant so it is either there or it isn't.</p></div>		</li>
