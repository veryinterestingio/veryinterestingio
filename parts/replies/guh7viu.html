<p>I guess something along the lines of not being able to function at peak efficiency. But tbh you're not supposed to work at peak efficiency or are even capable of it for long stretches of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation and anology. I've always had a problem with anyone who says if you wait until you're thirsty to drink water, you're already partially dehydrated. Like no, that's completely wrong. Our bodies are very good about telling us what it needs when it needs it. Just listen to your body and drink when you're thirsty. People who drink water just to drink water are not gaining any benefits.  </p>
<p>Stupid youth sports coaches would say that all the time. Drove me nuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually found that drinking lots of water before exercise makes helps me feel better and be less dehydrated after. I'd try to hydrate myself since morning and stop long enough to pee before exercise, so like topping off before waiting for <em>low gas</em> indicator. Otherwise I'd feel really really thirsty afterwards.</p>
<p>In fact lots of people seem to feel better when drinking more water than thirst indicates regardless of exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I would do the same thing before working out when I was going to the gym. (before stupid covid) it seemed like I performed better if I drank 20oz or more water before working out and I got less headaches.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do the same thing when I drink. Get wasted then drink a pint of water before going to sleep. Takes the edge off the hangover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's called preloading, and there is some studied benefit to it, the idea is you will not be able to hydrate as fast as you're dehydrating during the exercise, but it has to be really intense and in something like high heat. The research specifically say it only concerns top level athletes. </p>
<p>Otherwise research just does not support any of this, it does not support that there is anything positive associated with drinking excess water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never heard that phrasing, but my track coach said &quot;drink now even if you're not thirsty. Otherwise you will be dehydrated by the end of the run.&quot;</p>
<p>She was right. I jumped in late and didn't drink before the run, and it was pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See I heard that growing up all the time, but with the summers in Arizona it was true. Rehydrating isn't easy if you are still working, damn near impossible without stopping sometimes actually so if you can't recoup you have to maintain.</p></div>		</li>
