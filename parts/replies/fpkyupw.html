			<div class="markdown"><p>We tend not to allow <em>anecdotes</em> in the top level like this, since they simply add to the question, rather than to the explanation, if you catch my meaning.</p>
<p>An anecdote will say &quot;I also have X,Y,Z&quot;, without actually trying to explain why X,Y,Z happens. Which is of no real use to anyone in this context.</p></div>		</li>
