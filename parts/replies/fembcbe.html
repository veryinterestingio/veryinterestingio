Supposedly these compounds uniquely attack the biofilm of bacteria making them able to treat supposedly &quot;untreatable&quot; infections. The ratings are given by an organization in New Zealand. I haven't looked into if Manuka honey actually performs better than typical medical grade honey.</p></div>		</li>
