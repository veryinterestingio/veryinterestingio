			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains a lot. So this is why when I wake up at 6am and force myself back to sleep until 7am I feel tired? Should I go to sleep 1 hour later at night to try and wake up closer to 7am?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also try the sleep cycle app/alarm clock. You set a 30 minute (by default) wakee up window and it wakes you when it detects that you are in light sleep (by motion). I know you naturally want to get every possible minute of sleep, but I promise it feels better to wake up when your body wants to wake up. It's worked very well for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wake up at 6 am naturally all the time you shouldn’t force yourself to sleep again. Going to bed later would work but don’t expect immediate better results because your body would need time to adjust. In general a steady sleeping pattern, where you only need your alarm clock as a safety measure is healthiest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about when I sleep from 12 to 7am everyday but I feel different all the time?</p>
<p>What I've also noticed is that waking up earlier than I normally would actually makes me feel better most of the time, which makes me question if sleeping for 4-5 hours is best for 24 years old me. While very rarely I wake up from 10 hours sleep and feel adequate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that there have been studies that show that some people indeed need less sleep, but the range for humans is between 6-10 hours. Anything below that has a serious negative effect on your overall well being.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quality can vary by a lot of things - alcohol and exercise are the two biggest things for me. Even one beer I sleep noticeably worse, and regular exercise helps me sleep better every night. </p>
<p>Maybe try to keep an eye on what you do days before you have good or bad sleep. Diet can play a role, or maybe you're playing a specific video game that wires you before bed. Lots of different things can affect it.</p></div>		</li>
