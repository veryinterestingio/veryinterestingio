			<div class="markdown"><p>Saltaire in West Yorkshire is similar. Titus Salt built the village around his mill with all the amenities for workers. The whole village is listed and a UNESCO world heritage site. It was also a no-alcohol village, but that’s no longer the case, and one of the pubs there now is appropriately called Don’t Tell Titus.</p></div>		</li>
