			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misconception. The Black Rain was black because of the smoke from fires in it, not fallout. There was very little residual radiation or fallout in either Hiroshima or Nagasaki, because they were high airbursts. Almost all radiation injuries at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were caused by acute exposure, not delayed or residual exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fair amount of the fallout was entrained with the particulates from the burning city/people. It may have been insufficient to cause a rise in cancer rates across the affected population, but as we've learned from other cases, that doesn't necessarily imply a lack of contamination. See: &quot;UP PU&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering people have lived in both cities non-stop since the bombings it is not hard to see that residual radiation poisoning from the bombings was not a big issue (I am not saying it was no issue but clearly people willingly live there today and have these past 70+ years which you would not think someone would do in an irradiated landscape with fallout that takes 100+ years to dissipate).</p></div>		</li>

If someone were to wear clothes with contaminated with dust and go to a different city it could expose other people to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best example, thanks to my nuclear training in the navy, is that contamination is the “shit” and radiation is the “smell”. You can get irradiated, but you will not emit radiation. You have to get the physical radioactive nuclides on you, or your clothes, to “spread” radiation. That’s why you see people wearing anti contamination clothing and respirators. It will not stop you from being irradiated, but you don’t want the shit on or in you, and it makes sure you don’t.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And to add on, with some radiation sources (like alpha sources, I think), it's <em>vital</em> that they don't get inside you. Alpha radiation can't even penetrate the skin, so it's relatively harmless when the emitter is outside your body. But if you ingest it, or breathe in particles of the emitter, it can do a ton of damage to the cells inside your body, so you're kinda screwed.</p></div>		</li>
