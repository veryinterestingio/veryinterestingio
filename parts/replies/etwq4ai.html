			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if this is a ridiculous question. I assume that the center of this orbit is constantly changing as the relationship between the earth and the moon change.... What effect, if any, does the wandering of the center of the mass have on the earth , beyond tides? Does it impact plate tectonics, seismic activity etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about that - I'm more of a physicist than an astronomer/geologist so I'm modelling the earth and moon as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow" target="_blank">spherical cows in a vacuum</a>.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I think the short answer is &quot;no&quot; to the plate tectonics thing, probably because the earth is a lot more viscous than water and because the forces on tectonic plates are tens of thousands of times stronger than moon gravity, whereas changing gravity has more of a relative impact on the oceans which only have thermal currents, coriolis forces and weather.</p></div>		</li>
