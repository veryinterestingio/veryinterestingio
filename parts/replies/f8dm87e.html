			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a little bit misleading.</p>
<p>In a world where humans are not as dominant and concentrated as we are, we only need our waste to be carried away from where we drink and plant our food in order to maintain good health. Microorganisms will break down our waste.</p>
<p>However, with modern humans, we produce so much that simply washing it downriver creates large imbalances in ecosystems, even if we ignored the nect group of people that need the river water or whatever. </p>
<p>As for Venice and seawater, I don't know the details, but I would be surprised if the plumbing all around venice just emptied straight into canals without any treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true. They empty straight into the canals.</p>
<p>This was true for the houseboats in Amsterdam until recently. Allegedly they are all hooked up properly to sewage lines now. But I know for a fact that the canal the Dijksgracht still smells like, well, Venice. I had dinner on the terrace at Mediamatic near the Centraal Station and it was a real problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>as surprising it is to believe, sewer in Venice just gets dumped into the canals without treatment. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t the sea treating it? Harmful bacterial and viruses probably won’t survive long in the sea and other bacteria will decompose the waste.</p>
<p>The most important part is that nobody is going to drink seawater (and they probably don’t wash their hands and clothes in it, at least today).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are several vibrio bacteria species (they live in sea water) that cause dysentery and other gastrointestinal diseases.</p>
<p>the part about an ecosystem is that its shared by many living organisms. just because people of Venice doesn't use canal waters for domestic purposes doesn't mean it isn't damaging to the environment. </p>
<p>dumping untreated sewer in ocean creates dead zones along coastlines. it just wrecks havoc with ecological balance.</p></div>		</li>
