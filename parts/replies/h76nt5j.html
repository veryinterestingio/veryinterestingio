			<div class="markdown"><p>i dont think this is fully correct.  Yes the powdered donut is at room temp whereas your skin is at a higher temp so technically it is colder, but this doesnt really explain why powdered donuts in particular feel colder. </p>
<p>I think the fact that the powdered sugar absorbs heat from the skin is the primary reason that makes it feel colder. It is actually melting and the energy used to melt it is from the heat of the skin. The powder is literally sucking up heat from your fingers so it feels colder than it actually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The melting point of sugar is about 186c (366f), how hot are your fingers?</p>
<p>It would take energy to dissolve though, and since your fingers will have an amount of moisture on them and probably wind up sticky afterwards that would more likely explain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re on the right track.  Not so much about “melting “ the sugar but the high surface area being good at absorbing heat from your body (or mouth, as it were)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never gotten this sensation myself, but I don't think this explanation can be correct. Otherwise any very granular food we ate should feel cold.</p>
<p>If this phenomena really is related to heat transfer in some way, it's probably because snow sugar is dextrose rather than sucrose, and dextrose requires significantly more heat to dissolve. So when it dissolves and as the process of dissolving is endothermic, it absorbs more heat from your body than other sugars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you apply that principle to technology sensitive to heat, such as processors? Instead of a hard casing, what about a fine &quot;dusting&quot; layer material that acts like confectioners sugar as a heatsink? Crazy as that sounds, is it possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is allready a thing in thermalpaste. It has good heat conductivity but it isnt powder so i don't know but heatsinks work by having several layers of fins. Its all about having optimal surface area on the cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat sinks do use e.g. blades to increase their total surface area.</p>
<p>But you want the connection of the sink to the processor be as smooth as possible. A granular connection would mean there's air in between there, and air conducts heat quite poorly.</p>
<p>Personally I've never gotten this cold sensation thing when eating foods with powdered sugar on them, but &quot;snow sugar&quot;, which is dextrose rather than sucrose, with a little bit of added fat, requires more heat than other sugars to dissolve. Maybe that could cause the sensation.</p></div>		</li>
