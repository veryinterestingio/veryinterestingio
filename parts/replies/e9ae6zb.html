			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction: the varying magnetic field doesn't &quot;jerk atoms around&quot;. </p>
<p>It really creates an electric current in the metal, very much similar to what you would have if you could connect two wires to the pan itself! This would rather correspond to moving electrons around. The atoms stay where they are, or start &quot;wobbling&quot; once the temperature goes up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To people still confused: wherever you have a magnetic field, you also have an electric field, and vice versa. The two go hand in hand. This is how the charger for your electric toothbrush works, or the wireless chargers you see for phones these days; electricity cannot pass through plastic, but magnetism can, so magnets are used to induce an electric field on either side of the barrier without actually requiring the current to pass through. The reverse is using wires wrapped around a metal to induce a strong magnetic field that you can change the strength of by varying the current - electromagnets!</p>
<p><strong>ELI5</strong> Magnets are like mario pipes for electricity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hence we use AC because it changes 60 times a second (in the US, I think it's a different frequency elsewhere).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electrons circulate, yes.  That's why they're called Eddy currents.  They will find some path through the metal that makes a little circle around some part of the magnetic field, then that flow of current causes resistive heating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, only because it's going to be titanium, not a ferrous metal. Titanium is biocompatible and very weakly magnetic so it's extremely useful in joint replacement, screws and plates, etc because the treatment can be applied and it won't interfere with future medical diagnosis in an MRI.  It's also very light for its strength, one of main selling points of the metal in any application. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, the glass heats up as a result of the pan heating up (retrograde, you could say). So if the “burner” is on with no pan, it doesn’t get hot, but if you have recently cooked on it, there will be residual heat remaining in the glass that was transferred from the pan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even while cooking the glass doesn't get nearly as hot, since as the originator of the heat, the pot is the hotter of the two.  I have fried stuff with a paper towel under the skillet, and the paper towel was slightly brown at the very center when I was done.</p>
<p>Don't try searing steaks with a paper towel under it though.  That's flirting with ignition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not nearly as hot as it would be if it were a regular burner or a glass top range.  Touching it immediately after taking the pan off will be hot, but it won't destroy your hand like a regular burner would.  The glass itself becomes cool enough to touch in just a couple minutes or less depending on how hot you had the pan.</p>
<p>Source: I use an induction range in my house.  I've also had regular glass top ranges and old school electric ranges.  Induction is awesome.</p></div>		</li>
