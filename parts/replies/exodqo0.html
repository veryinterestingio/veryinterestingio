			<div class="markdown"><p>Tumors that infiltrate around nerves often are painful. Often that happens after a tumor is pretty big, but cancers like adenoid cystic carcinoma for some reason like to grow along nerves and are often painful (usually not as much as stepping on a splinter, though)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know for sure, but I would suppose that from a natural standpoint you have to be able to feel pain if you ate something bad, so that you don't touch &quot;these nice berries&quot; or &quot;that barely decomposed and perfectly fine meat&quot; ever again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say you can't feel pain internally, only that visceral sensory nerves are a lot less dense than those of the skin. Additionally, visceral sensory nerves tend to diverge more within the central nervous system, making internal pain sometimes difficult to localize.</p>
<p>Visceral structures are highly sensitive to distension (stretch), ischemia (restriction of blood supply leading to oxygen shortage) and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally produce pain such as cutting, burning, crushing...etc Visceral pain is frequently diffuse and difficult to localize, For example, kidney pain from kidney stones can cause diffuse pain over a large region of the side and back, called flank pain.  Your stomach is a smooth muscle, so it's sensitive to pain from distention, and your entire digestive tract is sensitive to pain from inflammation, so that's how you feel stomach pain It's also noteworthy that what we call stomach pain is almost always abdominal pain, since it's very difficult to localize internal pain to an exact organ.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To jump on this, our organs and our skin have different kinds of nerves. Pain on the skin (and muscles) is something called &quot;somatic pain&quot;: the pain detecting nerves sense cutting, burning, stretching, and other things that may happen. Pain in the organs is called &quot;visceral pain&quot;: it can sense stretching, lack of blood, and inflammation, but doesn't sense heat or cutting really.</p></div>		</li>
