			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally immunosuppression is life long. I have seen 1 patient in a cohort of a couple of thousand patients on no immunosuppression following a kidney transplant, and from what I remember it was an identical twin donor.</p>
<p>The incidence of cancer post transplant (in the UK at least) is attributed a lot of the time to treatment with mycophenolate mofetil which suppresses white cell production. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. So mycophenolate motefil is an immunosuppressant? And if you're treated w/ it for the rest of your life, your chance of getting cancer is higher forever? Not just immediately after the transplant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, fatigue leads to Cortisol (the stress hormone) release and Cortisol is a powerful immune suppressant. Alcohol also suppresses the immune system. Both of these are linked to increased cancer risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does someone like me who is forced by employment (regional truck driver) to live with a level of fatigue combat this raised possibility? I am routinely awake for more than 20-24 hours at a time. I do get to &quot;catch up&quot; on sleep every other day or so, but I know that there is no real catching up that can compare to a healthy sleep cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As both of the aforementioned promote obesity, and obesity in turn increases risks
of all cancers, the answer is yes, prolonged fatigue and heavy drinking at least to the extent they promote obesity alone increase cancer risk.</p></div>		</li>
