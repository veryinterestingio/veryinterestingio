<p>Thorium can't split on its own. When its hit by a neutron it absorbs it instead of splitting. This transforms it into a heavier atom: Protactinium 233. That atom also can't split, but it is very radioactive and decays to U-233 with a half-life of about a month.</p>
<p>Once it decays to U-233 it can split.</p>
<p>This is both an advantage and a disadvantage for a nuclear power plant that burns thorium. You have to start up the reactor with enough U-233, U-235, or Pu-239 that have been made elsewhere so that the reactor can run long enough to start creating its own U-233 from the Thorium you put in. Plus, it takes at least a month for the thorium that gets transformed to become U-233, so at some point in the fuel cycle you need a mechanism for filtering out the protactinium and storing it. Plus, your nuclear reaction has whats called a 'neutron economy', meaning each fission has to produce enough neutrons that it can both fission another atom, continuing the nuclear reaction, and be absorbed by a thorium, making new fuel. If your neutrons are absorbed by other things that aren't thorium, then your reactor becomes too inefficient to keep running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly true. Protactinium 233 has a halflife of a month. That means half of it turns into U233 every month. Constantly some of the Protactinium will be decaying. You also don't have to run full breeder. Most new reactor designs that are being worked on aren't breeders they are converters. They try breed and fission 4-9 Th 232 with the extra neutrons from 1 U235 or Pu 239-241 being added to the reactor.</p>
<p>Because most of the reactors used today work in thermal. Moderated with water, heavy water or graphite. Replacing U238 in the fuel with Th 232 will cause U 233 (and U 235 from the protanium 234 decaying into U 234 breeding into U 235) That can fission in thermal. Pu 239 doesn't fission well in thermal it only fissions well in fast reactors. This means that a lot more Pu isotopes are left behind in fuel made with U 238 than with Th232.</p>
<p>Long story short. Making fuel with Th232 instead of U238 makes for fuel that can be burned up to a way higher degree even in conventional reactors. Candu's might reach upto 20% of fertile being fissioned if the fuel pellets can hold that long. PWR and LWR will have lower % of fuel fissioned.</p></div>		</li>
