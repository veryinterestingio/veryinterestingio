			<div class="markdown"><p>A guy came into work a few years ago. He looked like he was wearing a thick glove on one hand. Cat bite. Red streaks halfway up his arm.</p>
<p>And he told us <em>it looked much worse yesterday</em>. He'd gone to the ER when it started swelling, so this was after about 24 hours of treatment as the swelling and infection were subsiding. </p>
<p>Cats are the devil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar, I had a tiny kitten bite, called the health line and they told me to go to the urgent doctor to immediately get on antibiotics and get a tetanus shot. They take cat bites very seriously even if the wound itself is really minor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Girlfriend rubbed my cats belly a couple years ago and he turned and sunk a fang in to the fleshy spot by her thumb (we didn't realize he'd had an abscess rupture in his armpit that she rubbed). We got her in the bathroom with pressure on it during our walk, took it off and the sink basin almost instantly was covered in blood. She ended up going to the ER for antibiotics, and in the 20~ minutes drive and intake the bleeding had totally stopped. </p>
<p>It was both a startling amount of blood, and a shockingly quick cessation of bleeding. Definitely gave me a new respect for the whole &quot;apply pressure to stop bleeding&quot; advice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not the bleeding out. It is the sealing of the wound. The scab closes the wound and then the bacteria have a nice warm, wet environment to divide and replicate. Your body will send in neutrophils (type of white blood cells) to try and kill the infection. Dead white cells, bacteria, and tissue are now pus. CONGRATULATIONS you have an <a href="https://youtu.be/HxXjP8ljf88" target="_blank">abscess (feline)!</a> </p>
<p>In the specific case of Clostridium tetanii it produces a toxin called tetanus toxin that is real eased that results in rigid paralysis. Here is a video of a dog with <a href="https://youtu.be/EG68o3YbCP4" target="_blank">tetanus/lock jaw</a>.  Yes he is fully conscious and can feel it. Do not get tetanus you will have a bad time!!!!!!!!!!!!
(It is not common in canines but it is seen, and no canines are not vaccinated against tetanus. Horses are as they are much more susceptible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what I've always wondered is we usually get vaccines for viruses right ?. Tetanus is caused by a bacteria ? So why doesn't our usual antibiotics manage to kill them ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, but the toxin is what is the problem. The vaccine help your immune system bind the toxin before it binds to your nerves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Killing bacteria with antibiotics takes time. During that time, they will keep producing the toxin that causes the horrible symptoms. The vaccine works by making you produce antibodies that neutralize the toxin. If your last shot was a really long time ago or the wound is particularly severe, you will also be injected with ready-made antibodies against the toxin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it's pretty hard for the antibiotics to get to the bacteria through the bloodstream if the infection has been developing for long enough (which is probably the case if you only went to the doctor after the infection started causing discomfort/visible damage, since it's so far under the skin that you might not initially be able to see/feel it). Also, not all antibiotics are effective against all types of bacteria, and from what I've heard, tetanus is pretty hardy.</p></div>		</li>
