<p>Long story short, it's probably not a huge issue for most people. But it would be a big issue if you were like, buying a TV for a sports bar something, where you were gonna leave it on the same channel all day every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern OLEDs do pixel shifting, automatic dimming of static images (or even parts of images, like a TV channel logo), screensavers, and other tricks to keep images from burning in. It’s not really an issue in any way for normal home use - even if you use the screen for gaming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely is. Look it up. There are issues where people have got the Netflix logo burned in and that is only on your screen for a couple of seconds at a time which can't be protected against. Also, people that use subtitles regularly have a bright area where subtitles usually are etc.</p>
<p>It's more likely that people don't really notice it or don't report it than it not happening at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fairly long time until they lose half their brightness. But what many people miss is that &quot;burn in&quot; is just uneven aging of pixels, and even losing 1% or 2% of brightness relative to another pixel could show up as &quot;burned in&quot; shadow. That's why &quot;10 000 hours lifespan&quot; is not all that meaningful for example. People often take those figures thinking it will take 10k hours for it to be an issue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mini LED is the term for a perfect version of this local dimming technology where every pixel has it's own individual backlight, this is the newest LCD technology branding you will start seeing in 2021 TVs, but it's still LCD at it's core.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t blame you for not quite getting this right. You’re describing microLED. MiniLED just cuts local dimming into very small sections and is what’s available is in the newest and largest iPad. MicroLED has yet to be mass produced.</p></div>		</li>
