			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like they used colostrum, which is a mother’s milk produced in the first few days after giving birth. </p>
<p>From:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_in_ancient_Rome" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_in_ancient_Rome</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been shown in modern times that having patients ingest mother’s milk (or colostrum) is actually a rather effective treatment due to the benefits associated with it. For example, the use of colostrum has been shown to prevent the growth of Staphylococcus bacteria, which are a known cause of several types of infection.[53] Colostrum is about half as effective as some antibiotics prescribed to patients today. Colostrum is also effective against the bacterium chlamydia. Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease in which some subtypes of it can cause trachoma, which is a major source of cause for severe sight impairment, if not blindness. According to one study, it’s suggested that, in the absence of treatment, to treat neonatal eye infections with colostrum. Since human milk was among the most potent antibiotics compared to almost anything else (both in the modern world and the ancient world) – that is why it was viewed as a divine treatment.[54]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cauterization knives are interesting. Best description I've heard was they produce &quot;an angry spark&quot; which cuts thru flesh like butter and seals the cut as they go. I wrote the PIC firmware for a prototype many years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s actually pretty cool. I was a combat medic in Afghanistan, and I got to make the first cut on a patient with a bullet wound on his leg with the exact tool you’re describing. Interesting they call it the angry spark, because you don’t actually see a spark, but you sure as hell smell the flesh burning when the knife cauterizes it.</p></div>		</li>
