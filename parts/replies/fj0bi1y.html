<p>You will only see this effect when watching a movie or TV show, which is shot at a certain number of frames per second, or when looking at the rotating object in artificial light powered by AC electricity, which flickers on and off very fast.</p>
<p>Viewing the rotating object in natural light, you will just see a blur.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Your comment is completely accurate, but this line needs a bit of clarification. The individual optic nerves <em>do</em> have a propagation delay on impulse, which can be interpreted as a form of refresh rate. This rate is very measurable and, in fact, is the source of the old (and false) mythos that human eyes cannot perceive anything above 30 FPS.</p>
<p>The problem is that we have a ton of optic nerves and they don't all <em>share</em> the same propagation cycle. Since they're all propagating independently, the effective &quot;refresh rate&quot; of our whole eye is hysterically higher than that of an individual nerve, and is certainly high enough to approximate a continuous phenomenon to a first order.</p>
<p>It is not, however, high enough to get entirely clear of the spin rate issue referenced by OP. I suspect the true reason why we don't see this phenomenon &quot;in real life&quot; without artificial reproduction standing between our eyes and the object has more to do with neurology than optics: we can only process so much information from our optic nerves so quickly, and our brain is already taking shortcuts all the time. It's much easier for our visual cortex to say &quot;fuck it, it's just a blur&quot; than to attempt to resolve every single discrete state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can definitely experience this in natural light, not just on TV or under lights. I see it all the time on cars, and during my entire ten-year period working on turboprop aircraft. </p>
<p>It just has to be going at the <em>right</em> speed. If it's too fast, then it'll be a blur more often than not. But if you watch as things start to slow down, there's usually a time when you start to see the rotation more clearly, and the &quot;direction&quot; you see it rotate will depend on just how fast it's going, and can appear to reverse itself also.</p></div>		</li>
