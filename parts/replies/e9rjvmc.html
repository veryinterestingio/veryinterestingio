			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that a shame? It's a different and advanced generation. They can build on science and inventions that the older generation researched or built. The earlier they get a feeling for new technology, the easier they will be able to use it for useful stuff.
Kids can do brainless stuff with an iPad, but it doesn't matter if you throw a kid into modern technology or a jungle, if it wants to do stupid stuff, it will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a shame because 90% of the kids that grasp that technology at such a young age are doing so because their parents are just using the devices as babysitters. We were behind another family while out trick-or-treating back on Halloween and one of their kids was I'd guess maybe 8 years old. He wasn't dressed up at all and would just hold out his bucket while staring at his phone. Wouldn't say trick-or-treat or thank you. Eventually his dad told him to put it away which resulted in a full blown temper tantrum in the middle of the street. Kid got to keep his phone and continued on as he had. THAT'S  the shame of it. I'll gladly eat crow if it turns out he uses that excellent grasp of technology to benefit mankind in the future.</p></div>		</li>
