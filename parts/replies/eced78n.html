<p>Nielsen Norman Group has done some proper scientific studies on the topic and the articles that discuss those findings are freely accessible, anyone wants to read further.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I certainly don’t recall every book I’ve ever read in existence. But if you asked me about every medical book I’ve read as part of my training all the way till now, I could actually give you a pretty comprehensive list (probably numbering close to 20ish by now)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's arguably &quot;cheating&quot;, as you probably remember the books by associating them with when during your training you read them. I could probably list all the course literature I've ever read by going through all the courses I've read semester by semester, but I can't give a list of all the fictional books I read during that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I’m actually listing them by subject. You can call it cheating, but the whole point of it was to refute the notion that there aren’t mental tricks to actually list things.</p>
<p>I use a LOT of mental tricks to list things, and not just books, in my professional life. I used to find it difficult but now it’s pretty much a reflex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd probably go &quot;Artemis Fowl [1, 2, 3...], Inheritance Cycle [1, 2, 3, 4], Roald Dahl [Charlie 1, Charlie 2, BFG, George's Marvellous Medicine...], Gone [1, 2...], Terry Pratchett [...]&quot; in that sort of order because it's easier that way, so yeah there are mental tricks.</p>
<p>You'd associate all of the medical books with &quot;how I studied medicine&quot; and so be able to query them quite quickly by walking yourself through how you studied or your studying environment... redundancy! But that's a special-case; it doesn't work for &quot;all books&quot; at all.</p></div>		</li>
