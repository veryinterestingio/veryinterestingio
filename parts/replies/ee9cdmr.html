			<div class="markdown"><p>I &quot;woke up&quot; in surgery once. I couldn't feel the pain of the incision on my foot but I could feel the pressure. All I remember is feeling that and trying to sit up but I think I was restrained (or paralyzed by the anaesthesia). The next thing I saw was a concerned look on somebody's face and then I was back out. I was told afterwards that I metabolize anesthesia faster than usual for my size. (Not a red head).</p>
<p>Here's my question: Can the anesthesiologist tell someone is waking before they actually come to? Are there vitals that show how deep the sedation is? Or do you just have to rely on what the average dieses are for weight and adjust as necessary?</p>
<p>Anesthesia is so fascinating to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends.</p>
<p>If you are fully paralyzed and unable to move then the most obvious marker of awareness (your movement) is gone.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anaesthetic monitoring for awareness is more of an art than a science because we simply have no idea exactly how anaesthetics work.</p>
<p>Hence we rely on surrogates to check for awareness, particularly in the paralyzed patient. This includes your blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate (which tend to go up when you are stressed or in pain - which can happen if you're ware).</p>
<p>Other methods include commercial monitoring algorithms/products such as BiSpectral Index or BIS (look it up) which uses proprietary processes to check for awareness. They're not foolproof though.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We do dose anaesthetics based on many factors such as type of surgery, nature of patient (including weight, pre-existing diseases, etc), expected stimulus.. None of it is hard and fast despite some general guides for recommended and safe dosage ranges. You do not usually get a static dose of anaesthetic throughout the op - it is adjusted as the surgery progresses due to differences in what's being done to you. We dial up when the surgeon makes a cut for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find your description interesting. Was your surgery supposed to be under full general anesthesia as supposed to a combination of sedation and local anesthetic? </p>
<p>In general the eyes are taped shut during a GA (to prevent corneal injury) so it’s curious that you could actually open your eyes and see someone during the process. </p>
<p>To answer your question - we monitor a myriad of signs to help gauge if someone’s aware. There’s also the depth of anesthesia monitor which is essentially a “brainwave monitor” but it is not super reliable so it’s usually used as an adjunct rather than the be-all-and-end-all monitor. </p>
<p>In modern anesthesia the chance of being aware is less than 1 in 10,000, whereas in high risk surgery (eg trauma, cardiac surgery, patients who are frail) the risk is still less than 1 in 1000.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, it was to put a screw in my foot so I would guess GA would be overkill. We'll assume sedation and local then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had surgery 3/4 weeks ago for the first time and they gave me some nitrous oxide to calm me down/relax me before putting in the cannula because I was a bit nervous. </p>
<p>Felt like I was body stoned and could feel and hear the anaesthesiologist struggling to get the cannula in. Everything got heavy, felt like a crushing sensation and everything was getting louder and louder. Could hear my heartbeat on the monitor getting unbearably loud and my whole body was hurting. Managed to calm myself down by talking to myself in my head but kept struggling to breathe. It went on for what felt like ages. Just when I thought it was unbearable I woke up gasping for air on the operating table. I sat up and they were trying to calm me down. I said sorry, laid back down and then woke up in my room post surgery. </p>
<p>My question is what the hell happened? Haha </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrous oxide, as you mentioned, is simply an agent that helps with sedating you (also has some pain killer effect which we use in women during childbirth), and it in itself can’t put you under. </p>
<p>From your description, it sounds like they took a while getting the cannula in while having you sedated on nitrous. When it finally went in you probably were given one of the few medications that make you forget so part of the memory never had a chance to form (ie the bit where you are wheeled to the operating suite, breathing on the mask etc). </p>
<p>As for the gasping for air bit, it’s most likely during the end of the surgery when the breathing device was being removed as you come to. The gasping sensation can be due to one of many factors, eg maybe the breathing tube was still in your throat, maybe the muscle paralysis you had wasn’t well reversed yet. </p>
<p>It sounds like you had yet another part of memory “gone” - this may have been because you were agitated while gasping for air, so you were given some drug (most likely propofol) to go back to sleep for a little while. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was very vivid and extremely scary. I had an idea it was near the end of the surgery when I woke up because of the lack of intubation. I appreciate the detailed reaponse. Thanks mate. </p></div>		</li>
