			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically speaking, yes. While virus concentrates are highest in the saliva, it has also been documented in other bodily fluids like blood and semen. In fact, a few handful person to person transmission of rabies had occurred through corneal transplants.
(Rabies is a contraindication for corneal transplant and corneal smears can also be used for establishing a diagnosis through demonstration of Negri bodies)</p>
<p>Again, theoretically speaking, yes. A person exposed to rabies may have had inadequate immunisation, and later developing full blown disease, spread the same during the phase of encephalitis, when they're, you know, very aggressive and could bite...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if someone kiss a person right after they are bitten by a dog with rabies virus, would they also get infected? Or just as other replies mentioned that the virus takes time to travel in our bodies and replicate themselves, hence the person is safe?</p>
<p>Thank you all for replying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saliva, yes. The virus concentrates in the salivary glands so it can be transmitted by bites. Other bodily fluids, I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rabies is interestingly not spread by blood or other bodily fluids</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Last year when I researched this, the CDC and WHO both advised that rabies was not transmissible via blood-blood contact</p></div>		</li>
