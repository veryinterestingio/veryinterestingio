			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep it means you look after them. Nail beds have me be a minimum of 1.3 (pinky) to be entered. My sister made me grow mine so I can be used as a model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more genetic than anything. Long bed nails vs. short bed nails is a fun genetics project for classes. </p>
<p>I have long bed nails and my beds go ALL of the way to the end of my fingers so my nails, no matter how short I cut them, always stick out past my finger tips. If I try to cut them shorter they'll bleed. </p>
<p>I realized this when I attempted to learn to play guitar. It wasn't fun.</p></div>		</li>

That's my pinkie, it's the most egregious but all my nail beds go beyond the tip of my fingers<br />
Also can confirm trying to learn guitar with permanails isn't a good time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but the more you cut them back the shorter your nail bed will be. I always clipped them below the white. Keeps your beds short</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my God, this is why I hated my dad cutting my nails as a kid.</p>
<p>He somehow got it in his head that fingernails that end at the tip of your finger are girly and my nails needed to be like his and end a good distance from the tip of his finger.</p>
<p>So every goddamned time he cut my fingernails he made me bleed trying to force my nails to act like his.</p>
<p>It backfired horribly and I've always kept my nails on the longer side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That bit of skin is called the hyponychium! It basically works as a seal to keep germs and dirt from going under your nails, and yes it does shape the curve of the edge of the nail bed.</p>
<p>Interesting that people like it to grow, I always find that it hurts if I let it go too long. Then again I barely ever moisturize my hands so that probably has something to do with it haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a nail expert so this is just personal experience with my own nails, but after a shower I will gently push the skin down with a cuticle stick (or just my nails, if we are being honest). It will take some time to &quot;train&quot; it at first, but if you keep your nails short I imagine you could just start cutting your nails a little more once your skin is no longer in your way.</p>
<p>I prefer my nails a little longer, so I use a little cuticle oil under my nails to keep that area moisturized. Or at least I do ideally, because I'm horrible at keeping up with it lol, but a couple weeks ago the hyponychium under one of my index fingers I guess dried out due to the winter here and my neglect, so it's been pretty painful and I've been trying to remember to put some oil on every so often.</p></div>		</li>
