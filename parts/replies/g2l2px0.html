			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think of it this way. Thirst isn't the feeling of being dehydrated. It is a collection of signals sent out by your brain with the goal of keeping you from being dehydrated. </p>
<p>There are sensory systems in your body that are meant to provide immediate feedback to your brain about probable future body states, and thus help maintain homeostasis. When sensory signals related to fluid intake reach your brain, it can use them to start shutting down the thirst messages being sent to your body.</p>
<p>You can think of this in relation to eating too. When you are hungry and then eat a big meal, sensory signals related to stomach fullness stop you from feeling hungry well before any of that food has been fully metabolized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would I be correct in assuming this feedback loop is controlled by dopamine? </p>
<p>My assumption is that OVLT has expressed that’s it requires you to drink, then the dopamine <strong>system</strong> will kick in and be like, drink water and be rewarded. Hence when you drink you instant positive feedback?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually no, it's not. This is a structure inside the brain, and the brain itself doesn't actually have any pain sensors. However, the membrane which attaches your brain to the inside of the skull (the meninges) does. When you're dehydrated, your brain shrinks in volume and puts tension on this membrane, which gives you that dehydration headache. It's also the reason moving your head quickly when you're dehydrated aggravates the headache.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is definitely the case that too much or too little extracellular salt in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid can cause headache, but I've never seen any evidence that the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis is involved. There could be a link here, but it just hasn't been shown clinically or experimentally.</p>
<p>It is also the case that headaches are super heterogeneous in terms of what causes them. It can be cranial nerve dysfunction, it can be inflammation, it can be dehydration, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of headaches are tension headaches, and the perception of pain is transduced by the nerves in those muscles. There are probably two major and one minor group of muscles that can encapsulate all tension headaches. The first group includes the muscles that attach your neck to your skull and are responsible for maintaining a neutral head position. Common ways this manifests as a headache are shoulder/neck muscle overuse, such as the forward head tilt position sustained during 8 hour marathon computer desk use. The next group includes the muscles responsible for jaw movement in the mandibular chain, starting from the vertex or top of your head, down the temples and to the sharp corners of your jaw on each side. Again, overuse is the culprit, like from chewing gum all day, teeth grinding at night, or even heavy weight lifting (you’d be surprised how much jaw clenching happens in weight lifters). The last, minor group are responsible for frontal headaches and include the entire top/front of the head, forehead, and eyes. Overuse is the name of the game. What all tension headaches have in common is that they’re of muscular etiology, can be palpated or localized to a “pain source”, and generally respond to NSAIDs/acetaminophen. Additionally, most of them will recur since there’s some underlying risk factor (poor posture) that just needs any exacerbation to kick off a tension headache. </p>
<p>These tension headaches are distinct entities from headaches due to intraparenchymal or intracranial volume changes. And this is perceived as usually stretching of the meninges, which, from what I heard is incredibly painful. You bend over, more fluid shifts around to an area of meningeal webbing that stretches more and causes more pain, etc...the only remedy is to relieve the pressure, either by using steroids to curb the body’s response to meningeal irritation, or by intervening on the intracranial volume status. </p>
<p>You’re much more likely to get a tension headache from “dehydration” not because there’s a perceived volume change inside your brain resulting in meningeal irritation, but because you’re getting a charlie horse in one of the muscles around your head.</p></div>		</li>
