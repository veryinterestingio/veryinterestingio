			<div class="markdown"><p>It is important to recognize that the 100 ways to cook an egg includes things like using egg as part of cake batter. So it's not necessarily 100 different methods of fried eggs, for example. It might be more accurate to think of it as 100 ways to <em>use</em> an egg in cooking. As long as the egg is considered a key ingredient of the dish then it's part of the 100 ways to cook an egg.</p>
<p>Eggs are an incredibly versatile food, and if we consider the different ways that various cultures around the world use eggs in their dishes then the list would actually be longer than 100.</p></div>		</li>
