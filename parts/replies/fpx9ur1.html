			<div class="markdown"><p>The nose sticks out of the face. There's more surface area or in other words more air is in contact with that part of the face than the rest, and so it needs better isolation ie more oil. At least that's what I always thought.. maybe there's a similar effect due to surface area that isn't temperature. Maybe the oil keeps in moisture and so again if there's a higher surface area you need better protection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off your accurate answer - I want to add this PSA: the pores on your nose are not the same thing as blackheads. They’re called sebaceous filaments - have you ever squeezed your nose pores and had white spaghetti come out but then they fill back in a few days later, every time? Honestly when I learned this and stopped squeezing my nose pores my skin really improved.</p></div>		</li>
