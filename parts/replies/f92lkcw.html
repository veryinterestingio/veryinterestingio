<p>It might be available in the US somewhere</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a US version, because it was a joint production of PBS and the BBC. They collaborate on big projects like this. The UK version gets British presenters, and the American version gets American presenters, but the information presented is the same in both versions.</p>
<p>The American version of The Planets can be seen on PBS websites, though if you don't have a Passport membership they may have aired too long ago to watch now (only current releases are viewable for free for online PBS; a Passport membership is their on-demand system).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bought a subscription just for this series. Honestly worth every penny. I’m realizing now that all of the great stuff I’ve found on Netflix or prime were just episodes of nova. Going to be sad when I’ve run out of their content.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It has a section about how one of the reasons our solar system is the way it is, despite other solar systems we can see following a different rule, is because of Jupiter. Most rocky planets or 'suoer earth's' that we see are much bigger and further away from the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a huge sampling bias when it comes to exoplanets though. We started out seeing only hot Jupiters because that's all we could see, not because they're necessarily common. The same may apply for Super-Earths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. If they formed in-situ then there is no real reason an Earth mass planet could not form further out. If they arrived by disc migration then kind of the same story in that further out you could form an Earth mass planet. Finally if it arrived by high eccentric migration then there is nothing preventing the survival of an Earth mass planet as it is not guaranteed it would be ejected from the system or launched into the host star/HJ (although it is likely).</p></div>		</li>
