			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I did not know that and it's around 16 years since my last.</p>
<p>Is the shot as effective post being wounded? My last shot was just after I cut a deep wound in my arm. My last shot before that was well over 10 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Receiving the shot immediately after the wound does help but may not be quite as effective as having had it previously.  So the rule of thumb is to get the shot every 10 years as prevention, and if you get a problematic wound (deep puncture, gardening scrape, etc) and it's been 5+ years since your last shot, get one again immediately.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the tetanus booster is often given as a combo shot that includes a Diphtheria booster, and you can ask for the version with the Pertussis / Whooping Cough booster included.  Those illnesses are deadly to infants, but the little guys are too young for the shots, so we need good herd immunity to keep the babies among us safe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do last a long time, you have to get a booster every 7 to 10 years I think. They are usually combined with other things like Pertussis and Diptheria vaccines which are dangerous so it's a good idea to stay up to date with them, if even to protect those around you from whooping cough etc.</p>
<p>*there seems to be differing opinions on if pertussis is included in later boosters. Pertussis immunity seems to not last as long as they thought so it's becoming more common to just vaccinate for all three when you re up rather than just tetanus and Diptheria like resources said when I looked it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this, but I caught my finger in a rusty door last year and my doctor gave me the full TDaP since I hadn't had any boosters for anything in about 12 years. I dunno if it was required or if that's just how she rolls, though. FYI to all planning their boosters, you can get some flu-like symptoms for a few days afterward. I happened to be recovering from a period of burnout and my immune system was a little oversensitive, so I was sick as a dog for about 3 days! </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Boosters used to be just tetanus and diphtheria, but 15 years ago, two things happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some huge studies proved that pertussis vaccines weren't lasting as long as we thought</li>
<li>A more refined version of the pertussis vaccine was developed that is less likely to cause painful swelling at the injection site</li>
</ol>
<p>So mostly we all switched over to giving TDaP, which has all three diseases in it.</p>
<p>Edit: the diphtheria part is actually there to make your body respond to the tetanus part. Your childhood diphtheria shots will last forever but we can't seem to make a good tetanus vaccine that doesn't have the diphtheria with it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I initially thought, looked it up and it seemed like I was wrong. However I definitely got a Tdap booster when I was 21, because the following fall most of my family got whooping cough and I didn't so it had to be that theirs had waned and I had just gotten a booster so I was good. Your answer makes more sense to me</p></div>		</li>
