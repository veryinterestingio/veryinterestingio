<p>I am wondering if we'll ever see a stable isotope of Roentgenium, the fourth precious metal. And I wonder what color it would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of what colour it would be, if you could predict the availability of excited electronic states, then you would know what wavelengths of light would be selectively reflected. The 3rd and 4th slides in this link have a simple explanation of the colour difference between gold and silver:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No. For all elements beyond lead, even their most stable isotopes are still radioactive. It's just a question of how long the half-life is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>would it be possible to have some forms of really stable (as stable as common every day elements) higher elements?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An open question but probably not. The &quot;island of stability&quot; is theorised to occur for certain nuclides of elements around 120, so at or just beyond the top end of what we've synthesised but with more neutrons, but most theoretical calculations predict half-lives of a few days at best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there were a way to arbitrarily add neutrons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is more or less what happens in the astrophysical r-process. Indeed the fact that extremely neutron-rich environments occur naturally, in supernovae and neutron star collisions, and yet superheavy elements do not occur naturally strongly suggests that superheavy elements have short half-lives in astronomical terms at least.</p>
<p>It's been proposed that repeated nuclear explosions could do something similar artificially, something like 10 explosions each 10 seconds apart. Getting funding and permission to perform that experiment could be problematic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s really important you pointed out that if nature doesn’t create and accumulate superheavy elements, then they probably don’t exist (as stable elements), since we would find them if they were already creatable by similar high-energy mechanisms. That’s probably the best guidance we could have when it comes to the limits of elements, but it doesn’t mean it isn’t worth exploring. What I find particularly interesting is what superheavy elements are telling us about the structure of nuclei.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that there was a theorized &quot;island of stability&quot; that would reverse the trend of elements losing stability as they get heavier. It wouldn't help enough to make the elements like that stable enough to last years, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's several types of nuclear decay/ radiation.</p>
<p>beta radiation is what depends on the proton to neutron ratio, beta+ (positrons) is if you have too many protons, and beta- (electrons) is if you have too many neutrons.</p>
<p>But there's also alpha radiation which is just two protons and two neutrons, which you get when you just have too much of everything. So getting the ratio right will deal with beta decay but you'll still have alpha decay to deal with.</p></div>		</li>
