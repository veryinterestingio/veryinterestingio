<p>I'll squeak in here that this is why they started calling them &quot;hedge&quot; funds - as in &quot;hedge your bets&quot;, meaning &quot;to protect yourself against loss by supporting more than one possible result, or both sides in a competition&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>without also &quot;protecting&quot; yourself from gains?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you hedge, you are absolutely &quot;protecting&quot; yourself from certain gains to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Let's talk about why Hedging is important.</p>
<p>Car insurance is Essentially &quot;Hedging&quot; losses.  Yes, you incur guaranteed losses in the form of your insurance premium, but that is considered an acceptable level of loss compared to what would happen if your car were destroyed and you didn't have insurance.</p>
<p>Car insurance is essentially &quot;hedging&quot; your losses against what would happen if you got into a car accident.  you incur guaranteed losses now in order to possibly avoid massive losses later.</p>
<p>What modern &quot;hedge funds&quot; do is the equivalent of buying insurance against <em>someone elses</em> car.  I pay a premium every month, but one day, if you ever crash your car, I get a payout.  This would be as if I were betting on your car getting wrecked.  This is what it means when someone is &quot;betting against&quot; a certain stock. They are leveraging themselves in such a way as to make money if that stock ever does poorly.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Insurance analogy explains the concept of hedging losses, but note that the real vehicles that hedge funds use to bet on a stock or commodity rising or look very different form how an insurance policy works.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about why Hedging is important form a business perspective.</p>
<p>Let's say You run a Sandwich shop.  You exclusively sell one thing: Pork sandwiches.  You know the price that customers are willing to pay for your pork sandwiches, and so it is important that the pork that you buy for your sandwiches stays below that price in order for your sandwiches to remain profitable.  If something were to happen, like some Pork shortage from a virus that is killing park farmstock en masse, causing Pork to suddenly get so expensive that you couldn't sell them at a profit at the price your customers are willing to pay, you would be in deep, deep trouble.</p>
<p>So what you do is you hire a &quot;hedge fund&quot; to help you &quot;hedge&quot; the price of pork.  You give them some money to (counterintuitively)  place market bets that the price of pork is going to go <em>up,</em> even though that is counter to the interests of your sandwich shop, who very much wants the price of pork to go <em>down.</em></p>
<p>What this does is it places you in a win-win situation.  If the price of pork goes down, your sandwich shop does great, even if that means you lost all the money you gave your hedge fund.  IF the price of pork goes up, your hedge fund bet pays out, giving you money to withstand the fact that your Sandwich shop isn't able to operate at a profit.</p>
<p>While it places you in a win-win situation, both of those wins are going to be much smaller than if you had not hedged your bets. You are giving up potential gains in order to prevent potential losses.  Less risk, less reward.</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear, the &quot;Hedge Funds' I'm talking about are the 50's-60's version of &quot;Hedge Funds&quot;  This is not what &quot;hedge Funds&quot; do anymore, and you would now do what you used to do through a &quot;Hedge Fund&quot; through just a regular old broker.  The Irony is that modern hedge funds are <em>actually</em> all about taking massive risks to try and obtain massive rewards, contrary to what their colloquial name would imply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you &quot;win&quot; it's not simply 2x your money.  It might be 3x, or 300x.</p>
<p>Say for example, you see 2 companies that are competing.</p>
<p>You invest 100$ in both(50 each, in this example it's the same amount of stocks/value).</p>
<p>Even if one folds completely, the other may skyrocket due to the new dynamic...so say it's 300x the value you paid and you take in 1,500 by selling when the price is right(often guess-work, if an educated guess considering market factors current and historical) = 1,400 profit.</p>
<p>Now, that's just a generic illustrative scenario of something that <em>could</em> happen.  Both could plummet, both could rise more moderately, both could go an up and down and up and down roller-coaster.....etc etc.  It's not as simple as &quot;pick 2 random stocks and one will do great!&quot;, that's where the &quot;educated guess&quot; comes into play....finding the right pair or group, paying attention to what's going on in the world, both in general commerce and in that given field(eg computer chips), and myriad other factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a really simple explanation you can use sports betting as an example too. </p>
<p>If team A is highly likely to win, then you don't get very good returns but they are the safe option. Bet a fiver on them and you might only get £8 back.</p>
<p>So team B has very little odds of winning but the returns are amazing. Bet £2 on them and you might get £50 back if they win. </p>
<p>So you bet on both teams, but make sure the amount you bet on each works out (based on their odds) such that you will always walk away with a profit or at least break even. </p>
<p>You definitely won't get as much from either result, but you're hoping Team B wins you lots of money while also making sure you don't lose money if team A wins</p>
<p>Doing the same with stocks and financial markets works on a similar, but more complex principle that I'm definitely not qualified to explain properly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to be a stock goes up you buy a stock, and then if it goes up you sell it and make profit.</p>
<p>If you think a stock goes down what do you do?  Well you borrow a share from someone then immediately sell it, lets say the stock price is $100 so you sell it for $100.  Then you have $100 and owe someone 1 share.  When the time comes to give them the share back you buy a share and give it to them.  If the price went down, say it's now worth $80, you profit the difference (in this case $100 - $80 = $20 profit).  If the price goes up then you lose money (say it's worth $150 now, $100 - $150 = -$50, you lost $50).  This is shorting.</p>
<p>The reason shorting is dangerous is you open yourself up to theoretically infinite loses.  If that $100 skyrocketed and is now worth $1,000,000 you just lost a million bucks.</p>
<p>At a high level what's currently going on with GME is someone noticed a hedge fund shorted ~140% of the amount of stock that's out there.  The hedge fund is forced to buy the stock at market price come time when the short is due (when it's time to pay back the IOU's on the shares of GME).  That person and a bunch of others from /r/wallstreetbets predicted/forced the price of GME to increase by buying shares as they KNOW someone has to buy a bunch of that stock in the future.</p>
<p>It's like if you knew I was forced somehow to buy 10,000 rolls of toilet paper next Friday, so you and your friends go around and buy up all the TP in town from the stores.  Come Friday you can basically name your price and I'm forced to pay it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, that makes sense. Good explanation.</p>
<p>I'm still not entirely clear how the Hedge Fund is going to be forced to buy 140% of the stock back. </p>
<p>That seems like a thing that shouldn't be allowed to happen... </p>
<p>Also, what mechanism (beyond contracts) is there to force them? This feels like it would end up in bankruptcy, loads and loads of &quot;contract disputes&quot; and a lot of things getting swept under the rug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you think of buying a stock, in order to profit from it, you're thinking about a &quot;long position,&quot; which is buying a share of stock, holding it expecting the price to increase, and selling it for a profit.</p>
<p>A short position is the opposite, you think the stock price is going to go down. So you short the stock, which sounds a little more complicated but is basically borrowing a share of the stock, selling it immediately, and holding an IOU to give one share of that company back. When the stock price goes down, you can buy it cheaper and give it back, thus making a profit on the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one thing I don't get is why you'd let someone borrow your stock. I end up with a lower valued stock while you get the profit--and interest payments to me won't cover the difference (otherwise you wouldn't make a profit and thus wouldn't try to borrow my stock in the first place).</p></div>		</li>
