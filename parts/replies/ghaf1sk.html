			<div class="markdown"><p>To give an idea, I believe the massive solar panels on the ISS generate a total of maybe 200kW of power. Not sure what the total area of them is, but given the size of the station as a whole you can see in pictures that they're not exactly small.</p>
<p>The issue I can see, though, is where it sounds like you're firing a laser from space down into the atmosphere, since you talk about missiles exploding in mid air--the atmosphere attentuates lasers massively, so that would markedly increase the power requirements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on the type of missile we're looking at. ICBMs, for example, get up to sub-orbital velocities because it's a lot easier to attain high speeds at high altitude. A space-based laser defence weapon would be much more effective against that type of weapon, potentially forcing enemy nations to adapt and go for lower altitude (and so slower/shorter range or larger) missiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another note since this is interesting to me:<br />
Without an atmosphere to help diffuse the heat away from the missile, I imagine it would be a lot more effective per-watt as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a laser weapon probably isn't using a continuous draw anyway - OP's lasers would probably be powered by capacitors that just get recharged by the panels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. It's probably more a question of storage and capacitance at discharge, particularly if you're looking to asplode more than one warhead at a time. But check out <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative" target="_blank">the Star Wars program</a>. Sounds like sci-fi itself, but Reagan really pushed for development of things like directed energy weapons. Almost exactly what OP mentions. The fall of the Berlin Wall effectively ended that enterprise though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the US Government really likes the idea of laser weapons, like mounting a giant one to a 747 to destroy missiles. </p>
