<p>My guess is it wouldn't have the same effect. However, while it might be a &quot;learned&quot; effect, it's one of those things you just learn intuitively by seeing things of different sizes. </p>
<p>People who haven't studied it probably won't be able to describe what something small is supposed to look like, but they know it when they see it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't think so.  The same principles of optics apply to your eyes as to cameras.  </p>
<p>I.e. when trying to look at things at macro distances, the depth of field shrinks.</p></div>		</li>
