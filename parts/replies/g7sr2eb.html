			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all of your points, however, I present a counterargument. I have been the victim of some poor quality updates which have broken apps, removed features or added pay walls. All of which are usually described as &quot;Bug fixes and improvements&quot;. As a result, I don't trust automatic updates anymore and disabled them. The result is that my phone works for longer and more consistently.</p>
<p>I also work in software so am not oblivious to the risks. I run weekly backups and then if I'm sat waiting for something I'll go through and run some updates. If I see devs making the effort to provide release notes, they get updated without much thought as they've shown they care enough to tell users what's going on. </p>
<p>I know it's not a great approach, but it's the unfortunate state of things (IMO at least). These things are being forced on users in a way that alienates them, rather than improving the experience in a way that makes them indifferent or even excited to update. It's not the case for everything, but it seems to be a growing trend.</p>
<p>Edit: Just for completeness, I would not recommend anyone take this approach unless they understand the risks of not running automatic updates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This risk usually isn't data loss</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes sorry that wasn't very clear. The weekly backups are more so that I can restore an older app version rather than for data loss.</p></div>		</li>
