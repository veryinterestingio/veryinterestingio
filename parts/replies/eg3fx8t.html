			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I just got into computers again about 2 months ago. Did a lot of screwing around in high school with hardware and simple commands but I’ve recently come into possession of multiple machines and have just been testing out different operating systems and hardware configurations and resetting them. </p>
<p>Everything I know can be learned with quick google searches. </p>
<p>This one windows 7 machine was my gf’s college computer, and once I did change the password using sticky keys and got into it, I found that it was fully corrupt with viruses that encrypted all of her files. So she gave me the go ahead to reset and reinstall windows 7. Which made me ecstatic because now I’ve done the free windows 10 upgrade and I’m currently cloning the hard drive to an ssd which I will put into an hp elitebook I wiped and therefore have a free activated windows 10 license for it. (In theory) </p>
<p>Edit: speling is harde</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's everyone in IT</p>
<p>Also Windows 10 is likely to recognise your motherboard has changed and the license will not apply. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't be surprised if your Elitebook doesn't boot with that cloned SSD in it. That SSD will have general drivers that are built into win10 sure, but the OS is expecting a completely different hardware set than what you have. Unless of course your GF's laptop is an Elitebook as well.</p>
<p>Also the win10 key usually gets paired with the motherboard but with an upgrade it might just look for the key. Either way, Microsoft will just deactivate one of your machines after 30 days or so.</p>
<p>If anything you can just do a fresh win10 install on your elitebook and deal with it not being activated. (or find a linux distro you like)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used this technique to remove the admin password on my school laptop because I was only playing games on it.. This resulted with them getting Chromebooks which I installed Linux on.
What I learnt from this, spend time doing things on the lessons instead of playing games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was literally my high school experience. It was a poorly setup xp machine that you logged into a windows 7 vm. Except you could bypass the login and instead install and play halo. Had massive lan matches for a few months before they shut down the lab and replaced everything with chromebooks.</p></div>		</li>
