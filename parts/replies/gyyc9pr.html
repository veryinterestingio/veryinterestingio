			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also &quot;whiteout&quot; periods, typically for a week or two right after an earnings announcement, where you're encouraged to do all your trading. The theory being that everyone was basedlined to the &quot;same&quot; knowledge at the earnings annoucement (because they *have* to disclose everything material at that time) and the company can't build up something earth shattering to the stock price within a week or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These. Though, to add, sometimes legal will also advise you to cancel any pre-set buy/sells due to the advanced notice of what is to happen such that it could be construed by the sec as insider trading (basically cya b/c the sec is scary)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, interesting -- this may address my follow-up question. But wouldn't <em>canceling</em> a pre-set buy/sell based on material, non-public info <em>also</em> be suspect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The other thing to remember is that all insider transactions are publicly reported.</p>
<p>The value of an insider trade is that a person could quietly accumulate or sell stock ahead of a major press release and then take advantage of the market response to that press release.</p>
<p>All insider transactions being public means there is no 'quietly'.  Each insider transaction is effectively a press release itself!  So, if an insider is buying up stock, the media will call up the company and ask them to make a statement before they write up what the insider is doing in the newspaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly (2) above relates to anyone in the org that has knowledge of a certain thing. When I was in Amazon, I often knew about something that would be happening and for a period, from being told to a predetermined time, I was legally blocked from dealing in Amazon shares (other than my shares vesting on a normal cadence).</p></div>		</li>
