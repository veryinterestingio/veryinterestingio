			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up! Say I'm drinking soda. I choke on it.</p>
<p>Does that mean miniscule amounts of soda could now be in my lungs? What do my lungs do with this now? Does it break down? Stay there forever?</p>
<p>What about food pieces? I'm betting there isn't a process for &quot;waste&quot; that would otherwise be discarded post-digestion, and there's not acid...</p>
<p>Does that mean the pixie-stix I inhaled in 3rd grade is still in my lungs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coughing fit you have gets most of the crud back up. </p>
<p>For things that don’t get brought up immediately, they cause inflammation and get wrapped in mucus and either coughed up a bit later or brought up the “ciliary elevator” and swallowed. </p>
<p>The ciliary elevator is a fancy way of describing the cells that line the surface of the airway which have little hairs (like shorter sperm tails) that beat rhythmically and waft things up out of the airway. </p>
<p>Chunks of stuff that are too big to be brought up can get infected and cause aspiration pneumonia. </p>
<p>The soda and little food chunks have all made their way out. </p>
<p>The pixie sticks dissolved a long time ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think I remember those hairs for anti-smoking commercials back in the day. When we smoke those hairs just fade away (according to the animation of the lungs of a smoking dude).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body is equipped with its own safety protocols and in your case, when soda has started on its way down the wrong path, your body immediately senses there's something wrong and starts to initiate Embarrassingly Violent Cough Protocol. This usually is enough to expel the soda out of your trachea.</p>
<p>But there are definitely cases where it's just too much soda thats gone down for your body to naturally cough up and it does end up going into the lungs. That's called aspiration and a lot of times a healthy set of lungs will just clean it up by itself if its just a bit thats fallen in there. Working in the ER, I've seen people inhale their own vomit which then lead to what is called Aspiration Pneumonia which then lead to septic shock and then its all kinds of chaos from that point.</p></div>		</li>
