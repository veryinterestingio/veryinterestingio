From what I remember: if the protostar is big enough, it first begins to heat by Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction. This contraction means they are very luminous, so they collapse faster (as more energy is carried away), this causes luminosity to drop as radius drops (the two are related). This contraction heats the core, until eventually H fusion begins, and as the star continues to collapse, fusion happens more and more frequently (as fusion is a probabilistic event where probability increases with density and temperature), and eventually the star reaches hydrostatoc equilibrium where the outward radiation pressure keeps the star from collapsing more and so fusion remains roughly constant. You now have a zero-age main sequence star.
As for D-fusion, this does happen before H-fusion, it's very sensitive to temperature and allows stars to accrete mass. Basically they have the lower energy D-fusion which drives convection in the star, and then it stops as the temp drops in the core as heat is carried out by convection. So the star can accrete more mass, basically acting like a thermostat, and keeping the temp from getting high enough for H-fusion. This loops until eventually deuterium runs out (it is a very limited resource in stars) and the star then can get hot enough for H-fusion on the p-p chain and it goes from there. </p>
<p>I have no idea what this C-fusion stuff is about tho, because deuterium fusion leads to He, which wouldn't be able to be fused, and neither would C because the temp and density are too low.</p></div>		</li>
