<p>randomness and disorder</p>

<p>Especially the disorder part often leads to confusion in my experience if it comes down to statistical thermodynamic. Entropy is not disorder. Entropy is more how spread out things are and can be or how many ways of arranging things there are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entropy is related to the amount of information needed to reproduce the state.  So think of an image.  A pure black image is very low entropy (and vary low disorder), a purely random image is very high entropy and high disorder,  But an image of a person is in the middle.  Some people who use the term disorder are uncomfortable with the idea that the image of a person would be considered highly disordered or that the more information being carried by the signal, the more disordered the signal is.  Other people who think of entropy in terms of information can be upset that the totally random signal is considered to carry more information than the image of the person.  Like static on your TV carries more information than a movie.  So basically that could be what disorder means, depending on your intuitions about what the word &quot;disorder&quot; implies.  Entropy is a specifically defined quantity while disorder is a colloquialism or basically a metaphor.  Are the digits of pi ordered or disordered?</p></div>		</li>

In water, the hydrophilic part of a phospholipid sticks outwards, and the hydrophobic points inwards. The phosopliipids naturally coalesce to form micelles because of increasing entropy.</p></div>		</li>
