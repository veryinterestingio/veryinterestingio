			<div class="markdown"><p>Caveat for mortgage. </p>
<p>A mortgage doesn’t change prices with inflation. Buy a house and you’ll pay the same amount until it’s paid off. Makes it more worthwhile than renting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caveat for that comment.</p>
<p>If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, the mortgage can increase at times (usually tied to the Federal interest rate, but not always).</p>
<p>Second caveat for that comment.</p>
<p>It's common to have property taxes included in your mortgage payment, so your <del>mortgage</del> <em>total house payment</em> will generally increase along with property values and taxes, which typically go up every year. </p>
<p>EDIT: Changed the wording a bit, because people seem to be focusing on where I said &quot;mortgage will increase&quot; and not on the part where I talked about it being the property tax that is often included with your mortgage payment.  I was simplifying to show that the statement I replied to (&quot;Buy a house and you’ll pay the same amount until it’s paid off&quot;) is not true, because of increasing property taxes.  It's true that the <em>mortgage</em> doesn't increase, but the amount of money you pay every month for your house does, which was my whole point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm being pedantic but the property taxes are not actually included with your mortgage payment. A lender can offer to manage the taxes and insurance as a service and you can send the payment in a lump sum. However, for any tax or legal purpose they are completely separate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your comment - most mortgages are sold at fixed rate (this might depend on your country, but both UK and US should have ARM below 10%). </p>
<p>The thing with ARM is that they can be slightly or even substantially cheaper than fixed mortgages but at the price that you're kind of gambling on low inflation for a long period of time.</p>
<p>The fixed rate mortgages are more expensive because the lender needs to minimize the risk that inflation will eat up larger portion of the payment than predicted. That means that your monthly payment is very likely to be much greater than what you would pay for renting the identical apartment, house in the beginning - and, hopefully, substantially lower in the later years.</p>
<p>There's much more to it, not just property taxes, but if you're not renting, you need to incorporate the repair fund to your payments and a lot of non-monetary factors.</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make is that it's impossible to state that &quot;mortgage/renting is more worthwhile than the other.&quot; There are a lot of factors in our future that none of us can influence, we have different character traits, we have different opportunities for renting/purchasing, making it virtually impossible to sum up such a complicated matter to one universally valid sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people nowadays use a Fixed Rate Mortgage, which is as it sounds.</p>
<p>No, property taxes aren't included with your mortgage, unless you're really ignorant about where your money is going.  You may have an escrow account that will pay for property tax by your mortgage company, but it's not your actual mortgage.  Property taxes do increase, but usually it's slower than the increase in rent.</p></div>		</li>
