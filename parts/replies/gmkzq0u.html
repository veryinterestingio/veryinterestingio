			<div class="markdown"><p>Finding local time was never really the problem on a ship, since the sun really does most of the work for you. The real challenge was in measuring elapsed time / relative time on shore.</p>
<p>It generally wasn't useful to calibrate the glasses to local shipboard time. Their use was in measuring elapsed time of a voyage because this information could be used with heading and speed estimates for &quot;dead reckoning&quot; navigation. (i.e I have been going this direction at this speed for this long). Later, if that time had been adequately maintained since departure it could be mathematically compared to the local noon to determine a more exact longitude, and latitude could be measured at the same time using the same sun sighting, giving a more accurate idea of actual location.</p>
<p>It is fairly easy to get a location within a couple of nautical miles using nothing more than a few basic tools and a good watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, there's a noteworthy technological bounty several hundred years ago that one of the British institutions had (it might have been the Naval college?) that was quite a lot of money (for then) in return for someone figuring out how to make a mechanical clock that kept accurate time on ships.</p>
<p>They had pendulum based clocks for a while, but pendulums only keep accurate time when they are on a stable platform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it also helps to understand that time wasn't quite as precisely measured as you go back in... back in time. It's still pretty god damned precise! But now our time metrics are so precise we add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second" target="_blank">semi-arbitrary leap seconds</a> to keep everything working in a way that feels predictable to us. This isn't so different from the ancient jewish custom of &quot;A bunch of guys declaring that there are actually gonna be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Justification_for_leap_months" target="_blank">two decembers this year</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping)" target="_blank">keep the calendars working correctly</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>In some places the &quot;12 hour day&quot; was 12 equal segments of daylight hours. So an hour in the summertime was longer than an hour in the winter time. I have to assume this would have been in cultures that hadn't yet mastered constant time measurements like the hour glass? Or that it's an urban legend and I've been hoodwinked by the internet <em>again.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a sundial, and to expand on why this is useful, Sundials are only good at measuring elapsed time if the sundial is completely stationary.  If you put a sundial on ship, it will always be able to tell you the local time.  However, since your ship is moving around the world, it won't take exactly 1 hour to go from 1:00 local time to 2:00 local time.  Depending on your speed and direction, it may take dramatically more or less than 1 hour.</p>
<p>So you calibrate the hourglass against a sundial on shore, and then travel, flipping your hourglass along the way.  When you get to another shore, you use your sundial to check the local time.</p>
<p>You now have these pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The local time of where you started from</li>
<li>How long you were travelling</li>
<li>The direction you were travelling (because of a compass)</li>
<li>The local time of where you landed (which, remember, is not simply data point 2 added onto data point 1)</li>
</ol>
<p>And with all of these pieces of information together, you can calculate exactly where you are now, based on where you were when you started. (i.e we are precisely X nautical miles in Y direction from where we started)</p>
<p>I also don't think you actually need the compass, it just helps you check your work.  Especially because on the ocean, the direction you are <em>facing</em> (which is what a compass tells you) is not necessarily the same as the direction you are <em>traveling</em> thanks to wind and currents and such.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hourglasses aren't precise enough to give accurate navigation data. Nothing was, until the marine chronometer was invented. Just look at the early maps of the new world; they got latitude pretty much correct since it can be directly measured, but longitude was all over the map (pun intended.)</p></div>		</li>
