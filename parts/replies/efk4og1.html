			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's pronounced Rump-ah and not room-pa it's probably more like 럼파, but they're strange about how they hangulize things. My city gets written as Pain-coo-ba (Vancouver). They could write Pan instead of Pain but they don't. I don't know why, and it bothers me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, theres a system of what &quot;letters&quot; get grouped together (basically every unit is a vowel and a consonant sound) but it's quite simple despite how it looks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The alphabet is super simple to learn (unlike the language itself). Each &quot;block&quot; of letters is a syllable, and there's a list of syllables that are possible in Korean. A syllable can be CVC, CV, VC, or just V. </p>
<p>If a vowel comes first in a syllable, or is a syllable by itself, the letter ng ㅇ is used as a placeholder. It isn't pronounced in that position. </p>
<p>There are a few twists to the system, but there it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hangeul is arranged in blocks for each syllable. This example was two syllables, so two blocks. “Computer” , for example, is another loanword.  In hangeul (3 syllables) it is 컴퓨터 (3 blocks).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.
It’s a block writing system so each block or “character” represents a syllable</p>
<p>Sort of like if we wrote </p>
<p>Ru<br />
N</p>
<p>For run. </p>
<p>But each “character” is made up of letters. </p>
<p>In Chinese on the other hand each character is made up of radicals. Each character is unique- but it’s a combination of 217 (i think) different radicals. These radicals might make absolutely no sense whatsoever when combined, they might be somewhat symbolic...or conceptual  (so the character for peace I believe is the radical for a roof and the radical for woman underneath it) the character for country is the radical for jade and the radical for a wall or enclosed space around it- the jade mind you represents the emperor. Or sometimes a character has a radical that suggests the sound (the radicals have pronunciations but those pronunciations May or May not be close to the entire characters pronunciations)...maybe they combine that radical to form a character that hints at the meaning with one radical and the sound with another. So In Chinese it’s not always the case- but there are times where an educated reader might be able to guess an unfamiliar character based on context. Even though Chinese is completely logographic I think it’s still probably easier to learn to write fluently than Japanese although Japanese is a lot easier to learn how to write in the beginning. Japanese uses Chinese characters but it’s a lot less intuitive which words mean what. Plus in Chinese the characters are pronounced one way where Japanese might pronounce a character multiple ways.</p>
<p>And what’s more there are several dialects in Chinese but these dialects can be as different from each other as English and german. But with Chinese the the writing is the same. It’s like if an English speaker and german wrote a sentence in English and german that meant the same thing...but wrote the exact same thing down despite pronunciation differences.
Oh with one major difference- mandarin and I believe the dialects use simplified characters. Where Cantonese uses the traditional. An educated speaker of any dialect is going to be pretty familiar with traditional and simplified characters. It’s not quite the same but it’s kind of like the difference between a word written in normal letters and a word written in gothic letters. Sometimes quite different but just through usage and exposure you kind of get a feel for the other writing system. </p>
<p>I believe- though can’t say for sure that the dialects follow mandarin word order or something so probably mandarin is the only one where the word order is the same spoken and written. </p>
<p>And to make things interesting
In Korean they also use Chinese characters but to a much lesser extent. But a highly educated Korean speaker is till going to have to know a lot of Chinese characters. Unless they’re North Korean who dont use Chinese characters at all because they’re  complete nationalists. </p>
<p>Basically as complicated as those characters are there a lot of history behind them it’s not all just random and there’s a kind of system behind them that makes it easier. The characters weren’t made to obscure meaning they were made to be understood it’s a functional writing system so theres a lot of hints and things like this built into many (but probably not the majority) of characters. It’s not just complete memorization if separate characters. But make no mistake there’s a lot of memorization.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chinese characters (called hanja in Korean) were the norm for many centuries until Emperor Sejong created the Hangul alphabet to bring literacy to the common masses.</p></div>		</li>
