			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say since both you and the room are at the same temperature, you are unable to dissipate heat into the room as easily, making you heat up more and more. This is following the idea of your body being a constant source of heat like a combustion engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah so the idea is to constantly dissipate <em>some</em> heat at all times, probably the difference between 98 F and room temp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, but OP is asking about temperature differences, not absolute temperature. I guess he means something like touching a metal plate which is at a certain temperature, then touching another one at a different temperature. At which point would you be unable to tell the two apart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still relates to the rate of heat transfer. The way the body detects such differences is by the rate at which heat is removed from your body. If you touched two metal plates, one at room temperature and one thats ten degrees above room temperature, the warmer one will feel warmer because it is not transferring heat from your body as rapidly as the room temperature one.</p>
<p>We can’t actually detect absolute temperatures, we only detect the difference from our body temperatures and by extension our skin temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still heat loss.</p>
<p>Put a paperback book in the freezer overnight. Next to an ice cube.</p>
<p>In the morning, touch them both. The ice cube feels colder right?</p>
<p>That's because paper doesn't conduct heat as well, so you don't feel like it's a cold thing. If you could measure the centre of both with a thermometer though, they'd have been the same temperature, but one still feels colder than the other to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason why a metal spoon feels colder than a wooden spoon, despite the fact that they are both at room temperature. Wood insulates heat, metal conducts heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cause if you put your hand in hot water and then normal water the normal water will feel cold. This is because the hot water will heat up your hand, creating a bigger temperature difference between the hand and the normal water making it feel colder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term you are looking for is Heat flux or the flow of heat energy. Your body measures how much heat is flowing away or flowing to the body and registers that is cold or hot respectively. The reason why I use heat flux is because it does explain why water at 21°C is colder than air at 21°C and the reason is that the water has more flux towards it than air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still can use the flow of heat to explain hot or cold. Cold = lots of heat flow out. Hot = more heat flow in.</p></div>		</li>
