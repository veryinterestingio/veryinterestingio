			<div class="markdown"><p>there is no oxygen present there to allow for combustion.</p>
<p>an old coleman camping stove is almost the same concept. The gas is in a pressurized tank and the pipe is run over the actual stove part. At first its a dirty flame and once the pipe heats up it actually turns the gasoline into a propane like mixture. It used to scare me as a kid.</p>

<p>The trick there is keeping the now burning-hot oxygen from igniting the walls of the pre-burn chamber and/or turbine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They mainly use staged combustion engines over gas generator cycles nowadays but they can still use the fuel exhaust heat exchange to preheat the fuel going into the secondary chamber that spins the main fuel turbine. If it’s an oxygen rich SCE they can remove a LOT of heat with the liquid O2 but will need a high quality metallurgical design to avoid oxidation of any part exposed to preheated gaseous O2 anyway so it’s a trade off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You (and some of the child comments) are addressing the nozzle, and not considering the thrust chamber. This is why exam front sheets usually ask you to read the questions twice. In a combustion chamber specifically, one of the methods used to address heating of the chambered walls is concentrating a fuel-rich mixture towards the walls, and a more stoichiometric or oxidiser-rich mixture towards the centre of the injector manifold.</p></div>		</li>
