			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not even that! Its more of an approach of, &quot;look, they say its such a high temperature but how can anything human let alone their own spacecrafts survive in such high heat? Google it!  If the temperature is really truly so high then that can't ve! Everything must be untrue. No one I've asked has had a real explanation, this questions the entire fact they even had spacecrafts flown there. Live video from nasa of Earth?- could be staged! &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the temperature actually was that high, we can build spacecraft to go through it. We do that on reentry. 1700f isn't that hot, it's not like we're talking about 170,000f or something absurdly hot. Many materials can withstand these temperatures, and they spend a lot of money making space craft.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What does this even mean? Does she believe that humans can't create stuff that is better, more resistant, faster, stronger, etc then we are? Or that there isn't anything naturally made like that? </p></div>		</li>
