			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol afaik the London Underground is the official name and the Tube is the nickname. In Montreal, it's called the Metro. In Toronto, it's just the Subway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Boston, it’s the T. In Chicago, it’s the L for “elevated” or something like that? Tons of places have a unique little nickname for their system — the nickname makes up part of the city’s identity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, I actually don't think I've heard it called the subway very often in Toronto, usually people just call it TTC (the name of the group that runs the trains and streetcars).  That further supports your point, just haven't heard subway specifically very often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Chicago it's the &quot;L&quot; (elevated...?) and in Boston it's the &quot;T&quot; (train or transit...?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The Tube&quot; is a name for the London Underground specifically. It's not the formal name but it is used in official communications sometimes.</p>
<p>Subway systems are uncommon in the UK. There's the London Underground, the Glasgow Subway (which is just one circular line), and the central part of the Tyne and Wear Metro, and that's it. Most major urban areas such as Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, Cardiff, and so on have extensive above-ground rail networks and bus systems, and sometimes trams, but no large underground rail networks.</p>
<p>In British English the word &quot;subway&quot; more commonly refers to a pedestrian underpass under a road.</p></div>		</li>
