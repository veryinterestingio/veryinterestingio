			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat is just the amount of thermal energy in a system (or area, or thing)</p>
<p>Everything in the universe above &quot;absolute zero&quot; is vibrating at a molecular level. The molecules of every single thing, even the water molecules in your icecube in your drink.</p>
<p>At different temperatures, things (like water) can exist in a solid state, where their molecules aren't vibrating violently enough for the molecules to move freely around each other. They're basically shivering but still able to hold together. There's different types of atomic bonds so analogies aren't perfect, but imagine a bunch of humans holding hands in a wave pool. Even if there's a bit of bobbing up and down the humans can still hold hands. </p>
<p>Things that melt, when heated up enough, have their molecules vibrate so violently that the particles temporarily break apart. But as soon as they're close enough to one of their particle friends they stick together again, then break apart again, and so on. In our wave pool analogy the waves are now violent and it's too hard for the humans to hold hands, but they can still manage to continue to re-grab their friends hands. This gives the property of a liquid, where something else is able to move through the liquid because the molecules get pushed out of the way very easily.</p>
<p>If you continue this and turn the vibrating up even more, the molecules can't stick together at all and then you get a gas state </p>
<p>Water of course melts at (above) 0°C (at sea level), but alot of other things do not melt (or burn - not everything melts - things with alot of carbon will burn instead (wood for example)) until much higher temperatures. Metal is in a solid state quite happily until quite high temperatures, but when it's hot enough, the same thing happens to them. Their molecules are vibrating so violently they're unable to stick together anymore.</p>
<p>The bonds of metal (metallic bonds) are very different to the other ways atoms form molecules - (covalent (shared electrons, basically making a group of atoms one big atom) and ionic - basically atoms magneting together)</p>
<p>Metallic bonds involve a lot of free moving electrons, even in a solid state (why you can bend metal-the atoms just move but still stay formed because the electrons are so rich that they don't break apart easily, and why metals conduct electricity, and also why metals can be magnetic (you can shift most of the electrons to one side making it have a net negative charge, and they can stay in that format (the earth has a big iron ball in the core that has done this and creates our magnetic field) and even why metal is shiny (reflects alot of photons back) </p>
<p>Because of the unique type of bonds, when metals heat up enough to liquify they act differently to water in that they're sometimes very thick, or act funny (like liquid mercury), the violent moving around can also affect the magnetic properties of the solid state (when it cools back down). It obviously affects the shape. It's also usually considered quite hot because most metals we think of need to be really hot (with a few exceptions like mercury) before they melt, but the fact it's hot is not so much a property of the liquid, but a property of heat) But mostly it's generally the same as anything else that melts. Just a bunch of people in a wave pool trying to hold hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings up another good question. Why do things like glue and bonders hold things together if it’s not electron bonds holding them together.</p></div>		</li>
