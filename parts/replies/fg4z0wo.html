			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good questions. Singapore may be able to help provide some answers soon. </p>
<p>Singapore currently has 13 infections, all of them mainland Chinese tourists who are being kept in isolation in two Singapore Hospitals. All of them mingled to a greater or lesser extent with the local population before being admitted (139 close contacts have been identified and 134 of those have already been traced and are being monitored). It is still the incubation period but so far no locals have been reported as being infected. The next two weeks will be very instructive  as it will show how widely this group  infected others in a country they were visiting. From that we will get better idea of the virus’s potential. Fortunately Singapore has the expertise and infrastructure to get a good handle on this and provide reliable data.</p>
<p>Update: </p>
<p>There are now 18 cases in Singapore. 17 are mainland Chinese tourists who travelled from Wuhan, the other is a Singaporean who travelled back from Wuhan on the recent evacuation flight. There are still no reported local transmissions. </p>
<p>Two resources from the Singapore Ministry of Health are linked below. The first is an update on the individual reported cases in Singapore for anyone who wants to keep abreast of what’s happening there. </p>
<p>The second is a more general site which contains information on the virus and its effects and is updated regularly for anybody who wishes to understand and keep abreast of what’s happening from a well-informed source. </p>
<p>Link to Singapore Ministry of Health press releases concerning each of the individual cases:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close contact is a measure of both the duration and the proximity of the contact. A close contact is generally accepted to be someone with whom you have been within 2 metres of for a duration of at least 15 minutes.</p></div>		</li>
