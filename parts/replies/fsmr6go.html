			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, dark matter tends to be in a big sphere surrounding and encompassing the galaxy it's part of. And due to this, we suspect that it does not interact with itself either! It's also why it's probably best labeled as 'Dark Gravity'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be a little cautious about saying &quot;it does not interact with itself either&quot;.  It definitely interacts with itself via gravity and possibly through the weak interaction.  </p>
<p>If you mean it can't interact with itself to mean there must be a mediating force for two dark matter particles to interact, that is likely true, but something that makes it more similar to standard model matter, not less.</p>
<p>'Dark Gravity', while catchy, implies that DM are force carriers; while there are some theories which hypothesize this, I don't think they are particularly well accepted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it falls into a black hole yes, it's never coming out.  But it's much less likely to fall into a black hole than normal matter.</p>
<p>When matter (both normal and dark) gets pulled into a back hole it only rarely gets sucked straight in.  It first gets captured by the gravity well and starts orbiting the black hole.  Eventually it gets slowed down by friction and collisions and falls into the hole.</p>
<p>But dark matter doesn't get affected by friction or collisions.  So once it starts orbiting a black hole it just stays there, never slowing down or falling in.</p>
<p>For dark matter to fall into a black hole it would have to be aimed directly at it, and that happens so rarely that it's almost (but not totally) impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How sure are we that Dark Matter is matter at all and not some sort of gravitational optical illusion? Couldn't there be some sort of force or resonance which amplifies the effects of gravity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reasonably sure.  The gravitational effects of dark matter aren't just the gravitational effects we can account for but amplified, they actually represent gravitational pulls coming from different places (usually the outskirts of galaxies).  And dark matter is fundamentally a simpler and more straightforward explanation than some force or resonance or whatever.  We already know there are a lot of subatomic particles out there which often interact only weakly with normal matter (neutrinos for example) and we know that we don't know all possible subatomic particles.  It'd be pretty easy for such a particle to exist and to produce the observed effects...it wouldn't break any known physical laws.  It's like if you discovered a perturbation in the orbits of the outer planets orbits that could be accounted for by gravitational pull of an unseen planet....it's more likely there's just another planet out there than that there's some unknown force that just happens to effect gravity as if it were another planet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This means that you can't just orbit anywhere you want - the gas particles will bump into each other and lose energy. Eventually it settles down into the lowest energy configuration you can get while still conserving angular momentum - and that's a disc.</p>

<p>This is the explanation I've been looking for for a long time, thanks! I never understood why the solar system was &quot;flat&quot; but now it makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that stellar systems formed planes for this reason, but that the relative angle between any two star systems in a galaxy was essentially random. If I'm reading this response right, you're saying that each stellar system forms from a sub-disk derived from a larger disk, which I feel should lead to star systems generally having similar angles that agree with the angle of the initial &quot;galactic&quot; disk. Where am I going wrong here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stars do form from the gas disc, but this gas disc is very turbulent on those small scales, and this turbulence dominates the angular momentum of the star systems. They form from irregular molecular clouds - if you google &quot;molecular cloud&quot; you'll see they're far from disc-like. So star systems really do have basically random orientations with respect to each other.</p></div>		</li>
