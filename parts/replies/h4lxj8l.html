<p>To calculate the pressure at any given elevation, you would have to integrate the gravitational force on the air at all points above the point of interest. The pressure would then follow a form of P is proportional to 1/r</p>

<p>Close; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_formula#Derivation" target="_blank">barometric formula</a> gives P ‚àù 1/e^(r), not incorporating the gravitational variation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To incorporate the gravitational variation below the surface of the earth I think you would use dP/P=Mgdz/RT where M R and T are constants and then substitute the form of g for a uniform sphere where g is proportional to z and integrate which, after rearranging gives P is proportional to e^(-r^2) below the surface of the earth.</p>
