			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine they are not related! What do animal trainers use to reinforce behavior? Those clicky things that are just a slightly more consistant version of the clicks we can make with our mouth. And clicks travel further than words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious. Has anyone done any neurological studies on how and where clicks are processed in the brain? I know there are studies that show that men's and women's voices are processed through different paths in the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, that has a lot to do with how animals respond to sudden hard sounds rather than soft ones.  It grabs their attention, in a sense.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure how valid this is, but I always heard that it's best use names for animals that have a hard consonant in the name. (dogs is where I head this, specifically)</p></div>		</li>
