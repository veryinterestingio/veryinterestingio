			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes me feel much better. I was concerned about the vaccine, not because I’m one of those anti vax people, but because I was worried about it not being effective if it wasn’t stored correctly. With it having to be stored at such an extremely cold temp I was concerned about it not even being effective by the time it got distributed to small town America where people may not even be familiar with the protocols.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I work in Quality Control in a vaccine company.</p>
<p>Long story short, we do huge &quot;stability&quot; studies and chart it for YEARS on whether these vaccines or whatever we are watching are still stable under different temp conditions. I don't mean like 2 years. 10+ years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it’s worth, emails went out to every medical professional in the country about two months ago. Depending on who’s a doctor, nurse, etc…, orders went out for everyone to sign up for their requisite training around distribution, storage, and handling, along with laundry lists of new policies and procedures that are going into place for actually giving injections.</p>
<p>By the time the first vaccines were distributed earlier this month, freezers and other specialized equipment had been in place for a few weeks already. And at this point, nearly everyone leading the medical community is simply waiting for the next batches to be delivered.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you much about the delivery fiasco, but every small town hospital, clinic, or drug store is basically ready and waiting. And only larger institutions with the capacity/capability to purchase liquid nitrogen freezers will get the Pfizer vaccine that requires being stored at 80-60 degrees C below freezing. So rest assured!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you read about someone that purposefully left the vials out for 200 vaccines and got fired for it? Things can definitely happen.</p>
<p>Edit: Must be this one:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. It’s worrisome that someone has already intentionally left out a batch to ruin it and another batch wasn’t kept at the correct temp and had to be thrown out. And those are just the ones I’ve heard about. Good to know that temperature is continuously monitored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a company in Japan that wasn't following regulatory procedure and got some people killed recently. Do you know if FDA publishes audit results? Regulation is great but compliance audit is critical.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with the FDA a couple of times on audits but not for the FDA, so what I’m about to say is an educated guess from my experience. </p>
<p>I do not believe that all audit results are published. If there is something that can impact the general public, than the FDA may issue a statement. Examples being a recall for whatever reason. </p>
<p>What the FDA (and other regulatory bodies) usually do though is share audit results with other regulators. An example being the FDA sharing a lot with the EMA or even other biotech companies that have a partnership with the company that was audited.</p></div>		</li>
