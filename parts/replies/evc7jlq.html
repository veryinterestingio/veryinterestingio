			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the original designs included a dye that would turn bright orange when exposed to sea water.  </p>
<p>If you've never been on an ocean going vessel then this doesn't seem like a bad idea.  For anyone who works outside the skin of the ship/smokers, all of their uniforms would be bright orange by the end of a deployment.</p>
<p>Also, if you go overboard and they lose track of you, you're probably a goner anyway.  It takes about 3 to 4 seconds to lose visual track of anything that goes overboard when the ship is in transit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The should have probably built in a life-vest pack. Like a small back or side pouch that contains a life-vest with a signal LED and whistle. It doesn't need to be the greatest thing ever, just enough to help increase their visibility and so they don't immediately drown. I mean with modern tech they could probably fit GPS trackers in the uniform that activate a beacon once a soldier is outside a certain range of the ship or something.</p>
<p>It's not like you couldn't build stuff like that. The tech is there and not all that expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the scales at which these fabrics are made it doesn't matter really what pattern is put on them. The patterns are not woven into the material, <a href="https://youtu.be/frwFKf037Qs?t=83" target="_blank">they're dyed/printed onto it monochrome bolts of material.</a> (and yes, there are practical <em>screen printing/ink transfer issues</em> in the &quot;size&quot; of the pattern but...)</p>
<p>The nature of the fabric is more important - has to breathe, dry quickly, be rugged and durable and thick enough to offer some protection and be damage resistant yet remain flexible and lightweight as to not impede mobility and physical indurance. So, a lot of synthetics. Herculite is a brand for example that is all of this and mildly fireproof to a degree.</p>
<p>So yeah, not your $10 t-shirt from Target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smaller pixels break up outlines far far better than splotches.  I was one of the first batches of recruits to get the original Marine digital cammies and I remember taking a unit photo when we were on the range.  The guys with the old school cammies blended in color-wise, but their outlines were clear as day because the splotches didn’t end naturally with the environment.  The rest of us looked like a bunch of heads on a green/brown sea.  The smaller pixels blended far better with whatever is next to them and broke up our outlines almost completely.</p>
<p>In a real world environment, that means that an enemy won’t be able to tell where your arm ends and the tree behind it begins.  It’s a very different take on camouflage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they don't, the army's own research showed that the digital splotches performed worst than nearly every type and size of random arrangement up to the perceptual limit of seeing the edge lines.</p>
<p>This is why digital camo is being completely phased out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;pixels&quot; are small enough that you can't see individual ones unless you're somewhat close (at which point you're pretty likely to see the soldier anyways). What they do do (ha) is add a bit of a rougher edge to the &quot;splotch&quot; so from a bit of a distance you don't see such hard transitions as with the older stuff.</p>
<p>This is all just my experience from being in the CF and wearing CADPAT, so the literature might disagree. In Canadian forests it was pretty darn effective, but of course camouflage is only part of not being seen.</p>
<p>Edit - Fun fact: I was able to find repeating patterns in my uniform, so it wasn't totally random, just &quot;random enough.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
