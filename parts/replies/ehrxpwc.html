			<div class="markdown"><p>LEO already has higher radiation than ground level. Many of the computers on the ISS are far from cutting edge because the older hardware has larger transistor junctions that are less affected by a stray cosmic-ray.  </p>
<p>In short an iphone in LEO would most likely brick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always. Astronauts bring some personal devices with them, and they work for the most part. There's a hotspot over the Atlantic where multiple devices will crash at the same time. This spot I believe was caused by the tzar bomba that was dropped near the pole. The whole idea of the high altitude tests was to use the magnetic field of the Earth to distribute the attack elsewhere, meaning a bomb dropped at a specific latitude above the equator would cause emp and radar blackouts at a certain latitude below the equator.</p>
<p>We wanted to aerial detonate a bomb over the Indian ocean to shut down the west border of the ussr. But we saw how bad of an idea it was when we fried all of our own satellites during operation fishbowl. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;hot spots&quot; would come from charged particles, pretty much ionized gas and electrons from the atmosphere being ionized by the nuclear detonation electromagnetic radiation (x-rays) and from the device vaporizing and ionizing itself. These charged particles then swirl in donut-shaped belts above the earth's equator. This already happens naturally in the Van Allen radiation belts, but it got way more severe with these tests. We learned from Starfish Prime that spacecraft orbiting in these regions would get a lifetime radiation dose or worse from a single detonation. However, from the charts I remember seeing, I'm pretty sure they showed it took about a decade or two for the charged particle radiation levels to drop back to normal, so by now, they should be normal. After I think three or so high altitude tests, the scientists came together and said, &quot;Ok, these radiation effects are pretty bad. Let's stop and never do this again.&quot; I learned all this in my Space Plasma Physics course in grad school.</p>
<p>The &quot;hot spots&quot; the above poster might be thinking about might be natural variations due to Earth's magnetic field, such as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Atlantic_Anomaly" target="_blank">South Atlantic Anomaly</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: this <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/2012/03/starfishandapollo-1962/amp" target="_blank">Wired</a> articles says it took &quot;a few years&quot; for radiation levels in the inner Van Allen belt to return to normal after Starfish Prime. The Wikipedia article on Starfish Prime says 5 years.</p></div>		</li>
