			<div class="markdown"><p>A stroke is actually going to result in hyperreflexia. This is due to the fact we are dealing with a upper motor neuron injury (brain and spinal column tracts). Whereas hyporeflexia is seen in lower motor neuron injuries (spinal cord nuclei and peripheral nerves).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To amend this slightly, in the acute setting, strokes can present with hyporeflexia similar to a “spinal shock” phenomenon. Just as an acute stroke will not present with spasticity but rather a flaccid paralysis. Over time, this develops into hyperreflexia and spasticity and classic UMN clinical pattern. </p>
