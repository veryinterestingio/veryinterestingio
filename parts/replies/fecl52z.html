Folks tend to get horribly chapped lips and in her experience Aquaphor is the only thing that works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not inherently bad, it just poses a risk of irritation. Vitamin A (tretinoin) is good for your skin but is also quite irritating and youre unlikely to find a dermatologist who‚Äôll recommend putting it on the skin of your lips.</p></div>		</li>
