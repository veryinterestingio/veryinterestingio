<p>I guess that spotify just register which bluetooth you use more often and see it as your car.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There. Fixed it for you. The feature you are talking about would pop up in any car. The question is hiw sporify knows you are a passenger. The Iphone doesn’t know by itself, so Spotify probably try to figure it out itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure this is the correct answer. I don’t ever ride as a passenger in my vehicle so when my phone connects to my car it assumes I’m driving. When I ride in someone else’s car, my phone isn’t synced to their infotainment system so the phone doesn’t even know I’m in a vehicle.</p></div>		</li>
