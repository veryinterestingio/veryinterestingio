			<div class="markdown"><p>Prions and the like do not die when burned, these aren’t viruses, but it’s better to be safe than to have a pandemic on our hands because some dead guy was infected by a super-bug.</p>
<p>Edit: to be fair, a legitimate cremation would kill prions if it was done over several hours, prions can withstand heat for quite a long time but they aren’t <em>completely</em> immune. You can’t just burn them though.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  People have contracted anthrax from infected animals thawing out of the permafrost, so it is possible, and yes we would be more likely to survive it because we have cleaner living conditions, better communications, superior medical knowledge, and a much larger pharmacopoeia for dealing with infections.</p></div>		</li>
