			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an episode of Doctor who, where the main character is locked in a fort. He escapes only after billions of iterations of carving a hole in a diamond wall. </p>
<p>He punches as much as he can, and then gets restored to an earlier version of himself where he goes through the loop again.</p>
<p>The damage is miniscule, but enough taps and it caves away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was such a cool and haunting episode. Especially given he couldn't remember each loop and did literally billions of years of it while being chased by a terrifying monster, dying each time. Although that must have been some special stone  for all his walking on it to not cause any wear.</p></div>		</li>
