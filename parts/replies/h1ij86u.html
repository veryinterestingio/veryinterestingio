I get that available pills today are not enough to replace a  well balanced diet.<br />
But why farma can't make a pill that has everything you need?<br />
Even if it's not a pill, wats stop us to eat something like dog food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s really nothing preventing us from designing a pure artificial food blend that meets nutritional requirements, but compared to just eating a balanced diet it would be much more expensive and probably disgusting, so there’s just no incentive to do that.</p>
<p>But for people who have lost the ability to eat normally we have enteral and parenteral nutrition, which seems to be what your asking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such products do exist. It's actually much less expensive than a balanced diet but tastes like chewing a popsicle stick, or liquid pancake batter without sugar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up Soylent. It's a powder/drink which tastes like chalk, but is pretty much what you describe. People have gone on soylent-only diets and come out fine, if a little roughage-deprived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love a product like that but for general public.<br />
I don't really care for making food or the food taste.<br />
So for like 5 day of the week I would be really be fine by eating like a protein bar an moving on.<br />
And treat my self once in a while with a &quot;real food&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MS in nutrition here. Researchers are still discovering components of foods that may impact health. It is not just the vitamins in fruit, for example, but phytonutrients (some of which are known but new research is still being conducted). So the ELI5 version: you can’t put something in a pill if you don’t know what to put in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do NOT have an MS in nutrition so maybe I'm just talking out of my ass here, but yes, there have got to be things in foods that we just don't understand yet. Enzymes and other fun things. Plus, just taking pills would make you hungry all the time and you need the bulk of food for proper digestion; your colon needs lots of fiber. Plus plus, pills can't hold enough proteins to meet your daily needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to add that as a human being, eating food itself is a vital component of...well, us. Why the heck would I want to throw FOOD out for some pill? I can see very limited use for severely injured people, but we already have means of feeding them using IVs and cannulas.  </p>
<p>So along with the medical (and technical) limitations, theres also cultural and psychological limitations.</p></div>		</li>
