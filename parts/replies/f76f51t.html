			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people today have a slight overbite where the lower front teeth are behind the front when your mouth is shut. Old skulls generally have those teeth meeting at the cutting edge to bite through tougher food. Pic at the top of the article.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had orthognathic surgery and they purposely placed my front teeth just in front of my lower teeth. I actually cannot imagine how wide open my mouth would look if it wasn't that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if my front teeth connected at the edges none of the other teeth would have connected and I'd've never been able to chew, only bite.  The jaw and teeth would have to be shaped quite differently for that to work so that both front and back teeth made contact.</p></div>		</li>
