			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, but that doesn't explain it fully. Snakes like Boas are ambush predators but they seem to have lost their ability for venom. There are also plenty of ambush predators like Jaguars which don't have venom. Instead they have all the benefits of being a mammal and massive size (same as the boas in that regard.)</p>
<p>It also takes tens of millions of years to evolve the structures to effectively store and deliver venom, and warm blooded animals are simply newer additions to the tree of life. Put another way, while snakes were stepping up their venom game, mammals were preoccupied figuring out stuff like live birth and milk.  Arthropods have been around longer than both and so they've had plenty of time to evolve all sorts of intricate venom delivering structures (spiders vs wasps vs scorpions). Give mammals another 40 million years and maybe a mammal ambush predator might come around that uses venom like a snake.</p></div>		</li>
