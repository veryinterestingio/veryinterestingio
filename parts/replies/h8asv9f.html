<p>Another example was a COVID positive person dining in a restaurant, who passed along an infection to a teenager sitting at another table.  They shared building occupancy for under 5 minutes.  Notably, the staff members  who were there for the entire duration of the COVID positive diner's stay did <em>not</em> catch it, as they were wearing good masks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a fair point. Other studies have pointed out that the single most effective measure for covid protection is wearing a mask. Obviously one does not do that when you're sitting down eating. OP specifically asks about gyms where one actually could be wearing a mask. However,<br />
1) People in gyms are exerting themselves and breathing much more heavily that people in other indoor venues (say supermarkets).<br />
2) People working out in gyms are more likely to take off their masks because of said heavy breathing in #1, spewing more particles to be distributed by AC and/or fans
3) People working out in gyms are also giving off other fluids, spittle and sweat from heavy exertion. While not airborne, they increase likelyhood of surface contact as a means for virus transfer.      </p>
<p>All this is to say, in gyms, ACs and or Fans are likely to be distributing virus particles, but with a consistent masking policy, they are perhaps not as dangerous as ACs in other contexts such as restaurants where people are tending to be unmasked</p></div>		</li>
