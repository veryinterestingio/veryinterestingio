			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for mentioning this. I had this happen once,many years ago. It felt like a huge explosion in my head,there were bright lights in my head,with my eyes closed. I thought I'd had a stroke. Up until now I had no idea what it was or what it's called. I never mentioned it to anyone because I thought they'd think I was crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One night when I was younger, I was fast asleep when I was jolted awake by what I could have sworn was a bolt of lightning hitting my forehead. That's how loud and startling it was. Of course, we don't have lightning around here, and the window was closed.  Nobody else heard anything. Scared the motherloving crap out of me. Is that like what you experience?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah, well it's complicated. We do have lightning very rarely, and we did recently, and it was a fucking doozy. I live in the south SF Bay area. I remember the night those huge fires last fall started. I went outside and lightning was popping like flashbulbs with almost no rain, more lightning than I had seen in my entire life, and I knew right then there would be trouble. </p>
<p>But <em>usually,</em> you can go years here without seeing one lightning storm, and if you do it's a notable thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's it. The closest thing I can compare it to is like when lightning strikes a really nearby tree or utility pole, or when one of those small transformers (garbage can looking things) on utility poles gets hit by a surge and explodes. LOUD bang and sometimes a bright flash of light (or if my eyes are closed, what looks like a bright flash seen through my eyelids). I've gotten up and walked around to check that we still had power a few times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow I was reading this thread and thinking that I am crazy.  I have been hearing my chooks making the 'bagerk' noise (when they are alarmed/disturbed/egg songs) just when I am dozing off at night.  I get up in a panic and go to see what's happening - Nothing at all.  They are sleeping perfectly safe and happy.  </p>
<p>I feel as if it's hypervigilance or something.  But it's really becoming a problem for me.</p>
<p>I have been taking sleeping pills for many years now.  I cannot do without them. That's probably really bad but I don't know what else to do.</p></div>		</li>
