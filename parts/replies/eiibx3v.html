<p>Put your request in writing (email is sufficient) that the property is no longer livable due to the smell from below. </p>
<p>If they refuse to let you move, review your lease and look for a part olcalled 'use of premises' or 'quiet enjoyment' or something to that effect. Basically saying that the owner provides you with a safe, secure and clean apartment.</p>
<p>Pungent death stinch seeping through the walls is a violation of the lease I'm sure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the right idea, but they're far more likely to understand if you approach them nicely first. It's no more their fault than yours that someone passed, but letting them know that unfortunately there's a permanent smell would make it likely they'll try to get you moved onsite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but a lot of times people will take advantage of you for not making any real demands but just sort of asking.  If they don't take your requests seriously, definitely find some sort of legal leverage if such exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legal leverage does exist. A landlord has an implied warranty of habitability, which means that they landlord is under a duty to make the apartment a livable place. If the smell is causing the apartment to be unlivable, the landlord has a duty to fix the smell. OP needs to post this in r/legaladvice. </p>
<p>Tagging OP u/jokoon so that they see this. Please post in r/legaladvice, they will help you with this situation. I am a lawyer but I do not practice property law (landlord/tenant) so I cannot give you specifics, but I know that there is a legal remedy for you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you send an email or text message, there is a record of the request. Asking 'nicely' doesn't make the request any less legally binding, so long as you can prove that the request was made. </p>
<p>Of course there's advantages to being clear and direct, but still, a judge will see a correspondence and will be able to tell if there exists a legal obligation to remedy. </p>
<p>A landlord arguing &quot;well, they didn't use legalese and they didn't send me a certified letter&quot; isn't going to get them out of obligations under the lease agreement, assuming the request was understandable to a reasonable person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. Handle it delicately at first; if the landlord starts dragging feet, <em>then</em> get serious. Tell them the request was a formality and you are willing to settle the matter legally. Probably wouldn't hurt to talk to an attorney before engaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lawyer will likely say to do it in writing with the date on it, and save a pic of the document. Document everything at this point - every single interaction. Apartment companies I've dealt with have been super scummy, and usually you don't even need to go to court to get them to fix stuff. 1 phone call from a lawyer with the proof helped me out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is their fault for not returning the apartment below to livable conditions, especially when it affects other apartments as well.</p>
<p>But yes, obviously approach them nicely.  That should go without saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. The landlord may be under the assumption that the smell is contained to that single unit. It won’t hurt to let them know that the damage is beyond that space. You may find the other neighbours smell it too. </p></div>		</li>
