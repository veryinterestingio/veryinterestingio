			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this rule of no eating 4 hours before bedtime apply to children as well? I always give my kids a snack before bed, and I myself have trouble sleeping if I'm hungry.. I just read last week that a handful of peanuts is ok before bed, or a peanut butter sandwich.. I'm trying to lose about 5 pounds, so I don't want to mess up my metabolism, but I honestly can't sleep if I'm hungry!</p></div>		</li>
