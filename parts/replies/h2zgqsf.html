You move any stick, you might cause the whole pile to collapse, and you lose.  So you have to be careful and pick ones that won't cause the whole pile to shift.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's already hard to do with pick-up sticks, but they're smooth and straight. Debris have all sorts of shapes that interlocks into one another, you can't move one without it hooking into something else, maybe it's because of its shape or because of cables intertwined or because they're nailed or screwed together or... </p>
<p>It's a literal logistic and engineering nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because that's the most sensible way of getting to them.</p>
<p>Huge bulldozers shoving tons of rubble and crushing the gaps as they do so is not an effective way to save the people trapped in the pockets beneath.</p>
<p>Shifting literally dozens of tons of rubble upsets the balance of the whole pile, and you have people underneath.  By hand, you can do it safely.  By machine you have to be ultra-careful and risk collapsing the whole pile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bricks are one thing and possibly effective in some fashion. These buildings are concrete and rebar with steel possibly as well. Removing single bricks is different than trying to lift large pieces of interconnected rubble. If that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brick down the line is safer than using heavy equipment.  If you‚Äôre using heavy equipment it has the power to rip peoples limbs off, or rip through people. When you‚Äôre using man power instead of equipment the risk of that goes down considerably, almost completely. I think it‚Äôs very tough to find the balance between the two in a situation like this when time is of the essence. </p>
<p>Check out the Oso landslide in Washington. It might help shed some more light on this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A few days later, some blogger came to the area and film the location when they seem to hear someone screaming from under the soil. But they choose to laugh about it and say it's the sound from the ghost. </p>
<p>And our local or central gov never seem to care to save the survivor that maybe still alive down there. No SAR Team whatsoever.</p></div>		</li>
