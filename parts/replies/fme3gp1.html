Thats the way our engines go,</p>

That's the way crank our shafts, </p>

Warm and wet so let her slip, </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This dug up a very old memory of mine when I took a class called &quot;intro to small gas engines&quot; my freshman year of high school and this is exactly what our teacher called it. She was a terrible teacher but we all thought this was the most hilarious thing ever when she told us</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although well written, it’s a little misleading on why the torque difference exists.</p>
<p>Torque has nothing to do with speed (torque with speed is power), so the spinning of the round about isn’t relevant.  It’s how hard you are pushing on the handle.</p>
<p>Electric motors have commutators in them which basically act in the same way that a 4 cylinder engine cycle does.  It’s not a constant force all of the time.  It’s also working the same roundabout principle.  They also don’t start out with the same “starting condition” either.  An electric motor starts off with 0 rpm while a piston engine may be at 2000 rpm when you hit the accelerator.  An electric motor starts with 0 power while a cylinder motor makes some power at idle.</p>
<p>The real reason is that electricity moves at the speed of light.  An electric motor is nothing more than a series of electro-magnets on a rotor.  When you energize a magnet, you get full magnetic force generated nearly instantly. Thy also make their max torque at stall, so it’s like you have a big magnet right next to the rail of the roundabout.  As soon as you turn on the power, the rail sticks to the magnet with the maximum force it can generate.</p>
<p>A cylinder motor has to mix air and fuel to make energy.  The speed that the air is moving has a lot to do with how much energy it can make from the mixture.  Think of it like a tuning a guitar string.  Too little frequency and the note is low or flat, to much and the not is high or sharp.  At idle the note is low or “flat”.  When you start from idle, the motor is flat, it can’t make much force because it’s out of its “tune” range.  As it builds RPM, eventually getting to the point where all of the conditions are perfect and it’s getting the most energy it can out of mixture.  This is the peak torque point of the motor.  Continue to increase RPM and it gets sharp and the force drops off again.  </p>
<p>So when you are trying to start to get the roundabout moving, it’s like playing a song on a flat tuned guitar.  Until the strings “tighten up” aka rpm increase.  You able to give the handles your maximum push.</p></div>		</li>
