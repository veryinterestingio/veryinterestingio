			<div class="markdown"><p>If the question is why do we get a sore throat in particular, some pathogens* do actually target the throat for infection. By inducing inflammation there we feel an irritation and so we cough to relive the itch. This is convenient for them because then they can tag along on airborne droplets into the throat of the next person.</p>
<p>*eg some 'group A streptococci' / strep throat (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88944/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88944/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88944/</a></a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But i guess the question was why coughing leads to sore throat. </p>
<p>The answer would be the system responsible for pain has entirely different function which is to indicate that you relieving yourself too much that it is causing problems. All pain receptors goal is the same, stop what you are doing or you are going to hurt yourself beyond repair. </p>
<p>Imagine body building, you are building muscle and what you are doing is firing pain signals to brain. You stop and muscle repairs to protect itself, if you don't stop though you may tear your muscle and may not recover or have hard time recovering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth noting that sore throat can often develop without much (or any) cough. Infection-induced inflammation alone is enough to damage the throat tissue and cause pain. Coughing can cause further damage, but isn’t required. The mechanism and characteristics of damage from inflammation and from coughing (mechanical) are different and largely independent from each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id argue the question is invalid.  Coughing doesn’t lead to a sore throat.  The same process leading to a sore throat is leading to coughing.  Both are stemming from inflammation/irritation of different tissues.  That being said, coughing while having a sore throat is certainly unpleasant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I'm glad someone added this tidbit. Inflammation in general is widely misunderstood by the public, and usually thought of as wholly negative. It serves a purpose, despite it's usually being very irritating.</p></div>		</li>
