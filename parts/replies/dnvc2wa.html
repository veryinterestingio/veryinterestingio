			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning that improved flexibility does not impact strength. The way your answer was worded kind of maybe possibly implies that and I just wanted to dispel that notion. Stretching to the point of doing the splits, for example, will not affect your squat (assuming you don't immediately do squats right after finally achieving the split, etc. etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is stretching is fascia and tendons, the muscle cells are pretty much totally flexible. When someone who isn't flexible starts stretching, they often say that it is quite painful, which is primarily breaking connections in the muscle fascia, and re establishing flexibility in that layer.</p>
<p>This layer can eventually calcify after injury or through very chronic lack of movement.</p></div>		</li>
