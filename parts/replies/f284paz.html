I was diagnosed with BPD but after years of working on it I don't meet the criteria anymore. it's possible, we do recover! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good for you!!! :) I meet a lot less of the criteria than I used to but I'm still working on myself. The hardest part has been my black and white thinking and self-identity. I still harbor a lot of self-loathing and my therapist says I'm too hard on myself. Which, she's probably right. But still. It takes a long time to unlearn and I've only just been with this therapist a couple years. She's amazing.</p>
<p>The therapists I had before then would basically just listen to my parents talk shit about me, then 'challenge' and invalidate me, and perpetuate the 'why are you so bad?' shit.</p>
<p>I have to say it was fucking sweet to see my current therapist actually call out my mom for the first time in my life. Though we quickly realized any type of family therapy is...unhelpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally found that meditation and mindfulness were the necessary tools I needed to rewire my brain out of bpd. It really is all about changing your environment/lifestyle and dealing with childhood trauma.</p></div>		</li>
