<p>I imagine somebody shooting an arrow out of a rocket and miraculously it doesnâ€™t get destroyed instantly then it somehow travels across the universe just to strike some alien in the knee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't necessarily be miraculous. Once the rocket is underway and no longer accelerating, or at least only gently, you could go outside or to the airlock and fire an arrow out just fine.</p>
<p>There's nothing for it to interact with so it would just fly out into space, not directly away from you but with the product of both the rockets velocity and newly imparted velocity from the bow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately someone took the last one and I suspect it was a space man from across the galaxy hence my desire to shoot one out while in space</p></div>		</li>
