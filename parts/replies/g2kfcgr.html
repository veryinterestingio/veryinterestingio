<p>I've also pooped out stuff I ate less than 6 hours previously.  What's happening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I used to think as well, but it turns out when you eat taco bell (dairy for me) and are shitting out your gut 45 minutes later, its not actually the meal you just ate, but the meal you were still processing, probably from sometime the day day before.</p>
<p>Something in your body triggered an oh shit response (no pun intended) and triggered a process where a ton of your body resources, including water, were diverted to this fucked up situation you threw at it.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and listen to your body. If you are getting results like this consistently from certain foods, avoid them, eat less of them or eat along with fibrous sources, eat digestive supplements (what i do for the occasional dairy treat) or go to a doctor.</p>
<p>Constant bowel issues can lead to some serious consequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd always assumed that it was the result of the body not liking something put in it, but no longer able to vomit it back up, went the other direction to get the irritant out ASAP (less time in intestines = less time for something bad to be absorbed into the body).</p>
<p>This seemed logical to me, but on reflection I've never looked it up. I too would like a real answer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're saying no matter what you eat, there is no difference in how long it takes for you to need to poop? And you're saying that's how it works for everyone?</p>
<p>No, this doesn't line up with pretty universal anecdotal experiences to the contrary. Something is capable of telling the body &quot;expel that <em>immediately</em>&quot; and it's not just your stomach being full from a big lunch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still don't really get it. I have a friend who is sensitive to a certain food, and she will almost immediately (like within 15-20 mins) need to go to the bathroom if she eats it. So is her stomach freaking out at that food in particular and forcing digestion to start more quickly than usual?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like intolerance, or less likely allergy.
Or she likes the taste of laxatives.</p>
<p>It's like lactose intolerance (the most frequent and famous, and many foods contain lactose, so sometimes symptoms occur with apparently strange food)...if you're intolerant, if you drink a bit of milk (or derivates, or whatever contains lactose, even many drugs) you'll need a bathroom fast. That's because we normally have a specific enzyme that degrades lactose, if you lack of it bacteria that lives in the bowel &quot;eats&quot; it producing gas-&gt;inflates bowel-&gt;augmented peristalsis-&gt;stomach ache and poop (often diarrhea, because you expel poop that's not formed yet, fast).</p>
<p>That's not incorrect to say that it's a defensive mechanism...if your peristalsis doesn't work, you die, bowel can break and many others funny events can occur, so if you're full of gas your body tries to eliminate it faster. Same with toxins and gastroenteritis, diarrhea is sometimes directly due to the effect of the toxin (or the aggression from the bacteria/virus), but it's also a way to eliminate what's hurting you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain intolerances can trigger a sensitive system to hyper contract or want to expel things... But keep in mind it's not what's in her stomach launching through the GI track at 500kph... It's what was already in her lower intestines (what she ate several hours or a day previous) that's getting kicked out at rapid speed.</p></div>		</li>
