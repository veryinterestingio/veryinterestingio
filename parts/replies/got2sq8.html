<p>We have equations for electron density at radius r from the nucleus of all the different orbitals, so you can calculate the chances of an electron being at any given distance yourself! They drop off FAST, but you're right, never exactly zero at any distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct, that raises the key point: the usual solutions we see for electron orbitals are calculated with the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation which -- because it's non-relativistic from the get-go -- is simply a convenient but <em>approximate</em> tool.  Not consistent with the &quot;exactly zero faster-than-light transport probability&quot; calculated from modern relativistic QFT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Answers you get without taking Einstein's General Relativity into account, aren't exact; they're approximate. They'll be a little bit off from reality's answers.</p>
<p>Using GR correctly when you calculate the answer gives an exact answer, that matches reality's, as far as we can tell.</p>
<p>--Dave, there may be theories that are a BETTER fitmto reality than GR. if so, we don't yet know what they are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When the physicist Schrodinger was developing his quantum equation in the 1920s, he first tried to base it on Einstein's special relativity, because he knew that was physically accurate.  However, he couldn't make sense of the resulting quantum equation or its meaning.</p>
<p>So..... he sort of shrugged, tried again, and ended up quantizing the physically approximate energy relation from non-relativistic &quot;classical&quot; physics.</p>
<p>Luckily, his equation turned out to be extreeeemely useful for calculating answers to many many things, such as the orbitals of electrons in atoms.  Useful, yes, but not entirely physically accurate, as he knew all-too-well himself.  That's why it's always fraught when people pore over his equation for any absolute physical meaning.</p>
<p>The physicist Paul Dirac ended up publishing the quantized <em>relativistic</em> quantum equation, a couple years after Schrodinger's equation.  Today, the Dirac equation is incorporated into the most modern quantum framework called Quantum Field Theory -- or &quot;QFT&quot; for short.</p>
<p>In that relativistic framework, it can be shown mathematically that there's <em>exactly zero probability</em> of faster-than-light transport of matter or information.  Intriguingly, the fact that antimatter exists is something that's central to the math proof, and that's only encompassed in Dirac's equation, not Schrodinger's.</p></div>		</li>
