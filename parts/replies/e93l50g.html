			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's what I thought for the longest time. Untill I drove my father's truck.</p>
<p>His truck gets the best mpg at about
~2050 RPM which equates to ~74 mph.</p>
<p>His computer tells me that around the the engine is working at about a 25% load (19 mph) to maintain speed. If you go just a little bit out side of that (100 RPM). It jumps to ~40 percent load (15mpg).</p>
<p>So Tldr it is where you engine is working the least hard. Which is not necessarily at the bottom end of your highest gear.  It really depends on your gearing for what that speed is</p>
<p>Edit: so since alot of this seems to be revolving around semis. This is data I collected is off of a 2010 F-250 with a couple of extra sensors installed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drag at 74mph is so big that there's no way that's the most efficient speed. Drop down one gear and keep the RPMs the same and I'm quite confident the mpg will increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Down a gear is about 54 also right at 19 mpg close enough that it's in the margine of error. I do not know which is better. But it is slight which ever it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silverado truck owner here, I can vouch for this. My truck loves to be around 75, at 70 its wants me to give it more throttle to keep from slowing down on hills, turns etc. Tire pressure is slightly higher than normal, low-miles, quality synthetic oil, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d take a grain of salt what a computer says about efficiency.  The mfg has a vested interest in making the customer think they are getting high efficiency and performance.  Cheating at this is probably more common than people realize.  Just look at the risk VW took for something that was obviously illegal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my 1.9 TDI has the lowest load on ~2000 RPM, so driving in 4th @ 2000RPM is better than 5th @ 1200 RPM - by a lot too. (It's got a real time mpg)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, 4th gear in the 40mph ballpark is most efficient for passenger cars.</p>
<p>It's the closest to a &quot;direct drive&quot;, a 1:1 ratio, in almost all gearboxes so there's less parasitic loss. </p>
<p>Even though the engine is spinning faster, and spinning more revolutions per mile, it's making less power overall, so it's actually consuming less fuel. </p></div>		</li>
