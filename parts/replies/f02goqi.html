			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly true but it does not always work this way.  Sometimes a company wants to &quot;win&quot; the default standard war so they are the only game in town.</p>
<p>This happened with Betamax video recorders.  Sony refused to license the technology.  So, competitors came up with VHS.  Betamax was better in almost every regard but it was more expensive.  VHS was good enough and Sony lost and stopped making Betamax.</p>
<p>Fast forward and we saw it again when HD-DVD and BluRay formats were competing.  Eventually BluRay won that battle.</p>
<p>Ther are other examples of this happening.  (See Zip Drives from the 90's or I forget the RAM manufacturer in the 90s with proprietary &quot;fast&quot; RAM that mostly just tried to sue everyone and so on.)</p>
<p>Point being, sometimes companies will not cooperate and fight to be the only game in town.  It is a high risk gamble though.  All or nothing and, usually, it just motivates the competition to find an end-run around you but if you win, like BluRay, it is highly lucrative...like printing free money.  Generally everyone getting on the same page is much better for all concerned.  Maybe you will not make all the money but you will make some money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Difference being that the PS3 played Blu-Ray, at some point there were like 12 million PS3’s sold compared to a million HDD players.</p>
<p>Also the backing of major movie studios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One big reason they lost the cassette format was because of rentals. VHS got in that market extremely early compared to beta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sony wasn't totally out of the game. </p>
<p>BetaSP which I assume was just the higher quality more expensive version of Betamax was used in broadcast television for years. </p>
<p>The first news camera I shot on in 2002 was BetaSP and we used that till we got newer DVCPro cameras in 2004.  (And the only reason we switched was because corporate ads trying to get all their stations on the same format.)</p>
<p>In my master control days from the late 90s through the early aughts shows, commercials, everything was pretty much on BetaSP. </p>
<p>When I first started I thought it was weird but realized the quality was far better and you could rerecord over and over again with little impact to the tape and video quality.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing is essentially the <em>other</em> way standards can arise. The first is /r/REO_Jerkwagon's situation, where a group of industry players collaborate to address a common need. The other is yours, where one rose to dominance (one way or another), and thus everyone else is forced to comply to their chosen proprietary standard. Another example would be the x86 ISA for PCs, and ARM for mobile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it’s internet browser standard about 10 years ago then the Internet Explorer team from Microsoft would just fuck right out of that convention.</p>
<p>P.s. I’m still super salty about the hundreds of hours wasted writing separate CSS all those years so that fucking internet explorer users would “have the same web experience” as normal people.</p>
<p>P.s.s fuck internet explorer. And fuck IE users too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly don't remember the last time there was not a better browser than IE, even in the earlier days Netscape was arguably better than IE, and we have had Opera and Firefox for like 20 years. IE was widespread for sure, but better I do not think so.</p></div>		</li>
