			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when it was a required skill, you had to have legible hand writing to actually make it through school, since all of your papers/etc were graded by the teacher reading them, so if they couldn't read your handwriting, you failed.</p>
<p>Nowadays it isn't as important because you can just type the paper up, and the only thing you need to hand-write is your signature anymore. Maybe some checks if you're old-fashioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In grade school they told us that if we didn't write in cursive in middle school, we'd fail because the teachers wouldn't accept any work that was in print.</p>
<p>When I got to middle school, every teacher explained that if we turned in a paper in cursive they would give it a zero regardless of legibility. In their words &quot;I'm here to grade your knowledge, not decipher your hieroglyphs. If it's in print, I can read it.&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I went to college, first day there one of the things we were told was that writing in cursive - in some classes writing at all - was no longer an acceptable way to hand any work in. It was typed - or in some classes written in block letters - or it was thrown out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an engineer/computer scientist. I write in various printed styles. In college, I was to write in all caps so my writing is legible to all who read my calculations. I can understand this.</p>
<p>I understood the reasons for various styles of paper: green engineering paper, steno pads, graph paper, blueprints, french-ruled paper, college-ruled paper, etc... I just started thinking about the writing on that paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for an irrelevant comment, but a so-called architect told me that the way to write was &quot;pull, never push.&quot; This fascinated me because my learning-disabled sons &quot;push.&quot; They draw their letters in the opposite way I do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might explain why us left-handed people have worse handwriting. Writing right handed your letter naturally “pull” towards your hand. Lefties are always pushing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they, by any chance, left-handed? That makes writing really hard, and so it can be &quot;easier&quot; to push.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an engineer as well, and can confirm. I wrote exclusively in cursive from the moment I learned it in like 1st or 2nd grade, all the way through high school. Then I got to college and all papers were typed, and 99% of handwritten stuff I needed to do were math calculations or design drawings, which need to be in print. By the end of college, I completely forgot how to write in cursive. My normal handwriting is completely print now, and I didn't even realize that it had changed until it was done.</p></div>		</li>
