			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains why so many fans don’t have a very slow speed.  I bought this Hunter stainless steel desk fan for my wife to put on her nightstand, and the lowest setting is like a tornado, and the highest being like a swarm of tornadoes.</p>
<p>Gold edit: man, I almost never look at my comment replies, I guess people liked this one.  Here's the tornado machine in question since someone asked below.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hunter Fans were originally manufactured as room ventilators, not &quot;spot&quot; fans. I'm glad to hear they've not abandon the tradition.
The most impressive I ever saw were in an elderly Southern woman's house. Two story plantation style house. 4 Hunter Ceiling fans hung from the front porch about level with the top floor windows...
Open the front transoms on both floors, crack the rear house wall windows top &amp; bottom about 4 inches &amp; it pulled a breeze through the house. Kept the house comfortable without A/C into the mid 90's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you just solved a mystery I've wondered about for decades. When I was growing up in the 80's all of our ceiling fans were hunter. I always set it on high when I was sleeping and it was like a tornado. Fast forward to 2005 when I was building my first house and I just thought a fan is a fan. Got some other brand at home depot. The highest setting on the new fan was like the lowest on the hunter. Never made that mistake again. Always wondered why the hell every other fan brand sucked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and if you are Southern and didn't grow up in a high-ceiling older home, you most likely had an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole-house_fan?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">attic fan</a>. Before we had air conditioning, I remember these drawing in so much cool summer air at night that you almost needed a blanket because of how effective they were. Plus you got nice fresh outdoor air instead of stale processed conditioned air. My wife and I are building our first home now and I'm strongly considering installing one to save energy during the summer months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cracked a joke in this thread, but to seriously confirm. We had a fan that broke and the dial only worked on low. Answer? Spin the fan with your hands first, then quickly flip the fan on.<br />
[edit: notice this post blew up, so before it happens go gold an electronic fandom reddit or something, i don't need it]</p></div>		</li>

Literally wrap a rope around the shaft, give it a rip, then turn the power on. The faster the motor speed, the faster it has to be going to start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhhh... Makes sense. I have an old, old desk fan that has the &quot;off&quot; setting in between &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot;. Often, when I went to turn it on &quot;low&quot;, it would just buzz and barely move...unless I turned it on &quot;high&quot; first and got it moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be a shaded pole motor which are low power (but also horrible efficiency) motors where the design means that at stall they don't pull crazy amounts of power unlike a &quot;regular&quot; induction motor. Things like ceiling fans can actually sit stalled for quite a long time before they become a danger of overheating/fire.</p></div>		</li>
