			<div class="markdown"><p>well the sun is an infinite energy source as far as humans are concerned, so if we arrange the lifecycle resource use around a greater net gain from the suns input, such as using resources and energy the sun can renew at the demanded rate, then we are in a situation where waste doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't totally &quot;not matter&quot;. The more energy use, the more resources you need to harness that energy, plus the resources for repairs and replacement of old infratructure. Sure, you may not add more CO2 to the atmosphere, but you destroy more habitat to mine precious metals, for instance. Renewables like Solar and Wind also require space - solar especially doesnt do too well with trees - and affect natural ecosystems. They are not perfect.</p>
<p>Think about driving a car. The less you drive it, theI longer it lasts. If you drive 100k miles in 2 years, you'll be requiring many more resources for repair than someone who takes 10 years to reach that milestone.</p>
<p>Even electric cars will need battery changes. As the tires age and are worn from driving, they release fine particles into the atmosphere which are dangerous to human and environmental health.</p>
<p>Everything you do has an impact on the environment in some form or another. Some are natural, but come in unnatural quantities due to our population (excrement), others like agriculture are unnatural and otherwise destructive in ways not jusy directly related to energy and water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your well draws water from an aquifer which recharges at a finite rate. <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/groundwater-decline-and-depletion?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects" target="_blank">Depending on where you live</a>, you may be one of the people who need to worry about conserving the water itself rather than just the energy/infrastructure capacity.</p>
<p>(Chances are that the overwhelming majority of water drawn from your aquifer is used for agricultur, though; your individual usage is probably a drop in the ocean.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saving water somewhere that it's &quot;cleaned&quot; / recycled is definitely a gain, but there are many places where this is not a concern either. The energy I use on water is just to pump it up my well, and is perfectly clean. It would cost more energy to convert to water saving systems.</p></div>		</li>
