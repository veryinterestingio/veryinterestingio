			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found cars in Europe to show up to 10% more than GPS and stationary &quot;your speed&quot; displays, while in the US newer cars are very close to agreeing with (external) GPS. (Except my recent  Volvo rental car (US) that was actually going 73 when it showed 70...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I explained this in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/bimebt/should_i_trust_the_spedometer_of_my_car_or_the/em1ol64/" target="_blank">another post</a>, but unless you're at minimum inflation pressure, maximum tire wear, and GVWR (maximum vehicle weight) your speedometer won't be accurate.</p>
<p>Tire wear, lower tire pressure, and more vehicle weight all increase speedometer values, so while your manufacturer is making your speedometer slow on purpose it is to ensure at any vehicle conditions the speedometer does not read slower than you are traveling.</p>
<p>the slowest your speedometer will be is when your tires have the smallest radius (most wear, most load, least pressure).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is due to the measurement uncertainties.<br />
They integrate it into the number shown, otherwise drivers could turn on them saying that they trusted the reader but got a ticket because their actual speed was higher.<br />
The specification of the speedometer is to show that you are below the speed show, so that you can complies with speed limits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>E.g. 100kmph (62mph) true speed can legally be shown as 114kmph (71mph) on the speedo. </p>
<p>Bit much if you ask me, but better than the other way round!</p></div>		</li>
