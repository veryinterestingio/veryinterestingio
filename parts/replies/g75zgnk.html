			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right on the aggressive schedule, but we at NASA thrive under pressure. We have multiple organizations, agencies, and countries working on providing us suggestions on what research we should tackle first on the Moon. Our NASA internal community will prioritize our objectives for the 2024 mission. Of course, we plan on not only getting back to the Moon, but staying long-term, so we expect lots of incredibly useful research to happen for the decades to come on the surface of the Moon. -CM</p></div>		</li>
