Their algorithm filled in the gaps that those images missed. It needed all that data to verify that the algorithm was correct and accurate. It was truly a group effort hers was one of many algorithms, and astronomers images around the world that contributed to a mind blowing achievement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not at all. They used three algorithms developed by multiple teams, and each team was led by multiple people as well, one of whom was Katie Bouman.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No great achievement is done without the efforts of many people working together. I’m not one of those that subscribe to “the great man theory” that Steve Jobs or Bill Gates were solely responsible for their successes. I placed the link to enable others to more accurately get information about her contributions as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/4/13/18308652/katie-bouman-black-hole-science-internet" target="_blank">Internet Trolls</a> have been attacking her for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They all used her CHIRP algorithm.  Three teams independently implemented it to serve as a check, and there was a team effort in collating and gathering data. But she is absolutely to be credited as lead on the algorithm that made this possible.</p></div>		</li>
