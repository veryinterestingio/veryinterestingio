			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other limits. At the very least they'd run into trouble with the squared-cubed rule. As something gets bigger it's surface area grows as x^2 while the volume grows as x^3. The animal's food and oxygen needs grow roughly proportional to the volume and the ability to take in resources grows roughly proportional to the surface area so eventually it'll get so big that it can't keep up with it's own resource needs. There are also structural limitations that make it hard to be really big.</p></div>		</li>
