			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry!  You're right!  See the other comment explaining the difference between event horizon and ergosphere.  </p>
<p>The true event horizon is the place where an object cannot escape, no matter what, while the ergosphere is a zone that can be escaped by donating some mass/energy (but you can't escape in &quot;one piece&quot;).  As the spin increases, the size of the ergosphere increases, and the effect that the ergosphere has &quot;shrinks&quot; the true event horizon.</p>
<p>Still the main point about the true event horizon being defined by the speed of light applies.</p>
<p>The point where spin would theoretically exceed the speed of light lies just under the event horizon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Any spinning black hole has an ergosphere, defined as that area outside the event horizon where superluminal frame dragging happens. It is oblate in shape, touching the event horizon at the poles of rotation. The event horizon is spherical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right.  Sorry, I was definitely wrong and conflated the two. </p>
<p>I guess technically, the ergosphere is a region where an individual object cannot escape, so it is a kind of event horizon.  It is not the same as the true event horizon because an object can partially escape by imparting some of its mass or energy, but it can't escape in one piece.</p></div>		</li>
