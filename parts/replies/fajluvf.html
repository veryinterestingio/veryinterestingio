<blockquote>
<p>One of the theories why Bulgarians have turned their genetic gestures upside down is connected with the five centuries of Ottoman rule. When the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria, they wanted the locals to change their religion from Christianity to Islam and if they declined, they were often killed. So, according to the legend, Bulgarians agreed to swap the two signs and when they were asked if they wanted to become Muslim, they nodded while actually meaning ‘no’ in their hearts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof, that seems like a stretch. Ottomans converting local population? Wasn't it just extra taxation and janissary drafting, and then be done with it? At least in Greece and Turkey there was some religious freedom for Christians and Jews I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck me that wobble is confusing. </p>
<p>I was waiting tables at one point and asked the customer &quot;Would you like some tea or coffe?&quot;. </p>
<p>And all I got was a stare and the wobble. </p>
<p>What the fuck is that supposed to mean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha, you can tell how recently someone from India moved to the US by whether they head wobble or nod. </p>
<p>I worked at the international office in my uni and learned that pretty quick. They themselves also learn to nod instead of wobbling pretty quick.</p></div>		</li>
