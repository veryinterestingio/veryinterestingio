			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Cable tv providers market the crap out of their HD channels, but the reality is that they compress the crap out of it. Ironically, the best picture quality comes from the free over the air channels, directly from the broadcasters. They compress the signal as little as possible before sending it to their transmitters, which pretty much just rebroadcast it with little to no decompression.</p>
<p>When they send their content to cable providers, it often goes through multiple recompressions before even going out they wire to your house, where it is heavily compressed. Basically, by having cable, you are paying a premium rate for lower quality. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the upvotes. I forgot to mention I use OTA for viewing broadcast channels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember back around 2006-2008 when hd was mostly uncompressed, it was amazing! Especially that one channel with 3 sheets (hdnet?) and thar one that became palladia. Edit: guess it was mojo hd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will definitely agree with this, the compression ratio on cable is aggressive.  High-motion scenes are almost unwatchable.  Fios compression is less aggressive, but I still notice it in very high motion scenes (like confetti raining down).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have DISH Network (pretty much have been a subscriber at various package levels since they started in the mid-90s.) After they dropped Univision, one of the Spanish-language channels my wife watches, we subscribed to Spectrum for a one-month trial as we already use them for Internet. It was about 35 bucks more a month after they tacked on their cable box and DVR fees. However, the compression on many channels was far worse than DISH's. DISH has actually gotten pretty good with their HD and we rarely see artifacting on most channels but Spectrum's was lousy. Plus, the crappy used DVR box they brought us was having issues. Needless to say we stayed with DISH, especially when they let us have a full year of their expanded basic service with DVR and HD for $21 and change a month - a rate Spectrum would never come even close to. Wife doesn't get Univision, but we saved a bunch over Spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Confetti raining down is VERY difficult for any codec. On live broadcasts they can't reprocess for better quality since they have to deliver it in a timely manner. That's also why Netflix can look better because they can increase the bitrate for certain scenes like this but it can't be done live when confetti comes down.</p></div>		</li>
