			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an antipyretic and an analgesic. It was previously considered a very weak anti-inflammatory by technicality, but it's not to a significant degree and certain not close to the level of suppressing the immune response.</p>
<p>Just relieves fevers, aches, and pain. That's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>antipyretic - pyro, meaning fire/fever. Increasing the temperature in a certain area via increased blood flow is a part of the immune response, hence the red, swelled up, hot area where you have an infection going on. </p>
<p>The heat helps to de-stabilize the microbes you're infected with, but it also damages your own cells, so you might need the anti-inflammatories if your body's overreacting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you are correct. Acetaminophen is not an NSAID and has no anti inflammatory properties. It’s just helps with pain and fever. Sorry was just trying to lump them together as being different than immunosuppressants.</p></div>		</li>
