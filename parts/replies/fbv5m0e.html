			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true of ice near its melting point, too: it's slippery mainly due to a thin film of liquid water formed by local melting.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that ice at -200°C would be any more slippery than glass or diamond 200°C below their respective melting points.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's correct. The coefficient of friction for ice on ice at 0°C is around 0.1. At -80°C, the coefficient of friction increases to 0.5. For the sake of comparison, clean glass on steel at room temp has a similar coefficient of friction of 0.5-0.7.</p></div>		</li>
