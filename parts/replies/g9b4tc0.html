<p>As I read /u/yalloc's reply, I couldn't recall seeing the screen go black for the life of me.</p>
<p>Then I saw you mentioned muzzle blast, and holy shit did it bring back a wave of memories!  I remember thinking the &quot;muzzle blast&quot; was the coolest thing ever as a little guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's much older than the NES, there were physical light gun games where the detector is on the thing you're shooting at, with the gun producing the light.</p>
<p>It's a simple circuit that detects light, that's all the zapper does, it tells the NES if it detected light or not and the software determines what should happen on screen. In Duck Hunt they prevented cheating by making the first frame after pulling the trigger all black. If you aimed the gun at a light bulb and pulled the trigger it would detect light on the first frame and know you're a dirty cheater. Some light gun games did not do this, so you could cheat all you want by pointing at a lightbulb and rapidly pulling the trigger.</p>
<p>Arcades also had gun games but worked in a different way so they didn't need to blank the screen. The guns were physically attached to the arcade machine, so as you moved the gun the machine would know where the gun is pointing.</p>
<p>Later home systems used sensors to detect where the gun is pointed, removing the need to blank the screen at all. The Wii used a bar that produced two IR signals that the Wiimote would detect, allowing the Wiimote to know where it's pointing in relation to the screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's based on old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen" target="_blank">light pen</a> technology. Basically, in the day of vector stroke terminals, the terminal would draw a large sort of asterisk-shaped star on the screen, each leg of the star was drawn with a different stroke. The terminal could tell which stroke had triggered the light sensor at the tip of the pen, and then the star would be moved accordingly.</p>
<p>Back in the day when microcomputers were still just hobbyist projects, I saw someone's &quot;game of life&quot; machine at a meeting of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club" target="_blank">Homebrew Computer Club</a>. The machine had a light pen that could detect the electron beam of the monitor when it crossed. By counting the vertical refresh and measuring the time from the horizontal refresh pulse, the light pen could tell where on the screen you were pointing. It didn't really work all that well, but it worked well enough.</p>
<p>The Duck Hunt game is a much simpler (and more reliable) variant of the same idea.</p></div>		</li>
