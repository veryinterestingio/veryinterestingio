			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't even reach absolute zero. We can approximate it but not fully reach it. They're are many theories at what happens at absolute zero but I've of my favorites is that once molecules do that their spin becomes one and they can unlock a phased matter condition. Basically you can move the subject though solid objects without inference. That theory explains casper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just reminded of something very interesting!</p>
<p>When I was just a bit younger a few years ago I met this girl whos friend went to same uni as we did, but he was final year. He said he was really into physics and even claimed he got some work stolen from him that was truly revolutionary this and that. I won't go into that as I can't prove or disprove it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I remember he gave this explanation about temperature, but then he said theoretically it could go towards negative frequencies to get even colder! Now that I think of it, I don't think negative frequencies exist, BUT, if we count negative frequency as vibration in an opposite direction, it's moving again, the body must be warmer than with a frequency of zero. Guy was just spewing bullshit, I feel so stupid now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually are negative absolute temperatures, but not in the way we regularly think about temperatures, and it doesn’t have to do with negative frequencies. Anyways, negative absolute temperatures are basically what lets lasers work. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost like a physics word play! I sadly must work on my understanding of entropy even though I've already heard about it and used it a bit in uni (h-s diagrams, but I was more focused on h part). Still, a very interesting read, I'll watch the video too. Thanks! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>99.9999% of the time, people who are claiming theories about physics are beyond morons. The only time you should trust a ‘groundbreaking’ theory or idea on physics is when it comes from somebody with an actual background in physics, and even then you shouldn’t just accept it at face value, but actually grill the shit out of that person until everyone realizes that they’re morons just like the rest of them.  </p>
<p>But of course once you get that one theory that works, everybody jumps on board.... still never comes from loonies in their undergrad.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I read that list. Most are Sports Scientists with a BSc or Chiropractors, i.e. people with virtually 0 knowledge on actual human biology as it pertains to the effects of EM radiation. I have a BSc in Zoology, making me as qualified as the majority of those 60k scientists</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, said person was pretty egocentric, a bit weird but I don't judge people on that. Still, it was pretty good indicator (or a red flag if you will) that it was all bullshit. He mentioned Schrodinger's cat and similar stuff at some point and always seemed pretty confident in what he was saying which led me to believe he knew stuff, but I was wrong.</p></div>		</li>
