			<div class="markdown"><p>I once saw a gif on reddit somewhere where they filmed a white bloodcell going after bacteria and you could see how it came across a “trail” of the bacteria and started to chase it down from there.
You could also quite clearly see what happened once it encapsulated the bacterium (is that the singular in english?)</p>
<p>I sadly do not have the link to that anymore, but I’m sure that a quick google search could find it ( I can’t provide at this very moment because I’m on my phone and pretty busy, if I don’t forget I’ll try to find and post it later)</p></div>		</li>

Thank you for sparing me the hustle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok but like, they still don't have brains, so their movements need to be some sort of automated.  Does the chemical trail get picked up by some sytem they have that causes their flagella (if they have them) on the opposite side of their cell to start going crazy? Or is their some actual consciousness there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't use flagella, they just wriggle their whole cell body. But basically what you said. They pick up chemicals on one side of the cell and that triggers them to move in that direction. No consciousness, just a complicated cellular machine and listens to signals put out by other complicated cellular machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'They just wriggle' or 'they pickup' implies intent. Would it be valid to say that the chemistry of the white blood cell reacts to the chemistry of the target, the result of which causes the white blood cell to move closer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really all chemistry.  They move using &quot;pseudopodia&quot; - false feet - which are just extensions of the cell membrane (the skin of the cell).  Basically the same way as an ameoba moves.  They have protein receptors in the cell membrane that grab proteins like collagen or elastin that make up the sort of web of proteins that helps form organs,  and they pull themselves along through tissues following a chemical gradient trail left behind by the bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are proteins on the surface of the cell that these chemicals called cytokines bind to. This essentially triggers a cascade of chemicals that tell the cell what to do and where to move.</p>
<p>Edit: as far as moving goes, inside of the cell they also have these structures that kind of behave like a conveyor belt that push the cell membrane out toward the pathogen (to make the &quot;foot&quot;) so the white blood cell can catch it.</p></div>		</li>
