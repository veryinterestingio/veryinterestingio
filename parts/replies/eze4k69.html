			<div class="markdown"><p>Tips from a quilter:</p>
<ol>
<li>⁠Using wool balls in the dryer will stop static electricity, dry clothes faster, and help clothes stay softer.</li>
<li>⁠Dryer sheets are a petroleum product and will cause acne and skin break outs. They are garbage for your clothes too.</li>
<li>⁠Use a color catcher fabric sachets when you have bright clothes or blankets with bright colors interspersed with white or lighter colors. This stops the dreaded color bleeding.</li>
<li>⁠Wash your Minky blankets on gentle and line dry. Preferably spot treat instead of washing as the fibers aren’t dense and will become loose in the wash. Use white vinegar or borax.</li>
</ol>
<p>Others have answered the technical points, hopefully this provides some tips.</p></div>		</li>

Or if you have handmade stuff they might use lead in their glazes particularly lowfire ware, but otherwise industry ceramic glazes don't have lead in them anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This starter question is literally what Tupperware uses to promote their products. As many of their trade marked productions are tempered to sustain heat compared to your generic plastic box.</p>
<p>Source: some fb friends are into Tupperware.</p></div>		</li>
