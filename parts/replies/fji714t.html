			<div class="markdown"><p>So essentially, it can't eject small particulate, but when a pearl gets big enough, it can spit it out? That seems like a nuclear approach to a piece of sand but what do I know clams have been around way longer than my species</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In naturally formed pearls, yes. A grain of sand covered by layers of nacre.  </p>
<p>In cultured pearls, they usually use bits of shell.</p></div>		</li>
