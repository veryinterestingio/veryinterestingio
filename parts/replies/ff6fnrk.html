			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain how the math definitively tells us no?</p>
<p>With the guitar string analogy, it does sound like there is a definite location of the energy at any given time - maybe depending on how you define &quot;energy&quot;. There's at least bounds to it - there's places it's definitely not, so there must be some boundary we can point to and say, this cloud <em>is</em> the electron, and the exact location of the boundaries of the cloud define it's location. Am I way off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for my understanding, we need to stop thinking in a deterministic way (classic mechanics) and start to think in a more probabilistic approach. There's an intrinsic impossibility of knowing every parameter of quantum systems (most notably position and velocity of a particle), so the best way to describe them is with probabilities. There is an intrinsic chaotic nature of these particles,  I find d it very fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Basically, the math describes a probability distribution as to “where” the electron is. There is nowhere that this probability is 0. There are no bounds. </p>
<p>Belle inequalities show us that this is literally true and the actual location isn’t just a mystery—it is unknowable until a measurement is taken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't we measure the energy we give the electron and then try to know how exactly it reacts to it and try to (really acting like a 5-year-old here) subtract the energy we added from the electron, to try and exactly see where it is before the reading even after giving the energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it like a guitar as a whole except when you pick it, the amount of energy in the pick determines which string is plucked. </p>
<p>Electron orbitals have discrete amounts of energy. It’s one of the six and that’s it. We already know how much energy is in it, but that doesn’t tell us that when we put our finger down, whether or not we’re about to catch the string or not.</p></div>		</li>
