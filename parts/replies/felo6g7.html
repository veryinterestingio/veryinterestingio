			<div class="markdown"><p>one way to think about is when you hear that you ‚Äúburn‚Äù fat, it‚Äôs actually akin to burning any other kind of fuel. it‚Äôs not the <em>exact</em> same thing (where my chemists at?) but you can think of our breath that we exhale as like the exhaust that‚Äôs produced when you run your car. we turn fat into heat/energy, and CO2 is a waste product of this process</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is, actually. What we colloquially call ‚Äúburning‚Äù is just an exothermic oxidation reaction. The same thing happens in your cells. It‚Äôs just that the rate of reaction is a lot lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like cellular respiration is a lot more similar to a hydrogen fuel cell than it is to regular burning.  The enzymes involved perform a similar function to platinum in the fuel cell, forcing the reaction to occur at a lower temperature and in a controlled environment.  (Obviously, their actual role in the reaction is quite different...) Also, another similarity is that in both, you aren't actually trying to make heat.  While when burning something, creating more heat is usually good for efficiency, but if you're trying to make ATP or electricity instead, you want to minimize heat production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CO2 isn‚Äôt carried in the blood as CO2 though. It‚Äôs converted into carbonic acid which immediately dissociates into a proton (H+) and bicarbonate ion (HCO3-). Bicarbonate is extremely important for maintaining the pH of your blood. Blood does not vary from a range of 7.35-7.45. Bicarbonate has the ability to gain or lose protons and BUFFERS the blood to this tiny range (under normal circumstances). So your CO2 is really important to keeping you alive BEFORE we remove it from the body. </p>
<p>Protons are then used transiently or permanently in other compartments of the body for work: used in stomach acid, or recombined with bicarbonate in the lungs to form carbonic acid, which then forms CO2 and H2O, etc. The main balance point for pH is really your urinary system. Eat something acidic and you transport the extra protons to the kidneys and pump them into your urine and pee them away. (It‚Äôs more complex than this, but hopefully gets the idea across.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>You always have a certain amount of CO2 in your blood. That does not mean it's fizzy like soda. The gas is just dissolved invisibly in the liquid part of your blood.</p>
<p>The level of CO2 is regulated by your respiration rate. When your body senses the level increasing, you breathe more deeply and more quickly, and that drops the CO2 back to its usual level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>With carbonic anhydrase, blood is also incapable of holding fizzyness. You can dissolve CO2 in blood much faster, but it will also come right back out once the partial pressure drops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do breathe it out... but your numbers are off, or out of context. 10 kg of fat will produce <em>way</em> more than 10 kg of CO2+water - because the oxygen from the atmosphere is used in &quot;burning&quot; the fat. The total will be around 38 kg, with around 11 kg being water, a part of this will also be breathed out.</p></div>		</li>
