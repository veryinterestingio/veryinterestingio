<blockquote>
<p>A quick search suggests that a Dreamliner will generate around half a terabyte of flight recorder data per flight. Having to upload that in real time, across a constantly changing global network of satellites, multiplied by all the flights in the air simultaneously...MASSIVE bandwidth and cost.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big data or no data is a false dichotomy. Each plane could easily send a best-effort summary stream that wouldn't cost much at all. Send ID, position, speed, and anomaly readings. Keep only the latest few minutes of data unless an anomaly is detected. You could send it as a normal cell phone call.</p>
<p>But what is the problem we are trying to solve? </p>
<ul>
<li>If it's to make sure we always know exactly where a plane was before it hit the ocean or the mountain, a summary is sufficient. (It won't save many lives, though. Mountain and ocean will have their fill.) </li>
<li>If it's to replace the black box -- to know <em>all</em> instrument readings in the minutes before the crash -- a summary won't do. Investigators will always want to know everything. They'll still want a recoverable black box. But a summary that includes only the anomalies (because smart software on the plane has selected the right summary data) would be relatively easy and probably sufficient in most cases. No pressure in a certain line, for example. No electricity on another line. If they never found the black box, investigators would still have a good idea of what happened.</li>

After my first experience I pre downloaded some work stuff so I could do exclusively off line work in the air, was not worth it. Even on works dime. God I can’t wait to take a flight again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about flight but I'll give you information my friend gave me. He has a friend that works in automotive testing. They get cars, they put all kind of sensors all over the car including engine etc and they just drive the car on public roads. Sensors are generating about few GB of data per second. They don't have device to storage that amount of data so they have special LTE transmitter with multiple antennas and SIM cards so they send it directly to cloud for further analysis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you could fit a ridiculous amount of storage in a vehicle. Think about how many hard drives you could stuff into a trunk. This really doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>If they do have all the antennas and stuff, it’s not because they can’t fit the data onto local storage. That network connection is slower than the throughput would be to a hard drive in the vehicle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also worthwhile remembering that planes almost never crash, and when they do the black boxes are almost always recovered.  </p>
<p>Of the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/564769/airline-industry-number-of-flights/" target="_blank">450+ million flights</a> in the last 20 years or so, there’s have been something like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_commercial_aircraft#2000" target="_blank">400 crashes</a>, of these, there have only been <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unrecovered_and_unusable_flight_recorders" target="_blank">12 instances</a> where data from the Blackboxes could not be recovered.  (Disclaimer: I’ve not examined any of this stuff closely, but it’s still probably correct to an order of magnitude or so).  </p>
<p>I have a mate who’s an airline pilot &amp; I recall him saying that goat-related deaths outnumber those of the airline industry by a reasonable margin.  Having known some goats this comes as little surprise, but it’s still a very small number :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only recent-ish large airline crash we didn't recover the black box was Malaysian Airlines 370, and thats because we have literally no idea where it crashed.</p>
<p>Even that Air France 380 in the middle of the Atlantic was found.</p></div>		</li>
