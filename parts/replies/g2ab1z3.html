			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the more grandiose projects of Nazi Germany was an eventual plan to dam the Straight Of Gibraltar with the intention of converting the Mediterranean Sea into a &quot;lush farming paradise&quot;. Which sort of ignored the issue of having to physically desalinate all the land they would have recovered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an issue they couldn't have known about ahead of time because of the complexity of the situation that only really became clear with modern environmental computer models, if they did successfully complete the project then the entire environment of the European continent would have shifted in some pretty horrendous ways. Namely most of Europe would become desert due to the lack of water moisture from the evaporation of the Mediterranean Sea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not impossible it just would take a long time (decades). the Dutch have done similar with smaller tracts of land like the Flevopolder. The issue is that there is an inflow of water to the Mediterranean which under normal circumstances would evaporate and be replaced by Atlantic water from the straits. They would need to keep lakes in the basin but they could become quite saline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The salinity would've gone up as evaporation exceeds the input from rivers until it became a salt lake.</p>
<p>There is evidence the straight was closed way back when based on very thick salt deposits and signs of erosion from the rupture of the dam.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite likely, in many projects you get those invested in the idea that push hard to try and get them to come to fruition even after their initial source of funding dries up.</p>
<p>One incident I'm thinking of was a guy that worked with the US military on a super-gun project. His intention was to make cannons that could do most of the effort in launching a satellite (the cannon fires up the satellite with a small rocket motor all the way up to space, and the rocket motor circularizes to keep it in orbit). He actually did some fascinating work with that culminated, if I recall correctly, in literally taking two battleship cannons and welding them together, reinforcing the barrels, and then firing over-charged (extra powder) shots from them. The purpose of these guns wasn't combat, but because in the earliest days of the space race we actually didn't really have a good way of modeling reentry forces on proposed capsules/warheads...so they made scale models with radio beacons in them, fired them out of a cannon into space, and then recovered them after they reentered.</p>
<p>After the various testing systems caught up with the experimental data they obtained, the military dropped funding on the project (though I believe the test cannon(s) are actually still in Hawaii where they were used, to this day). So the guy shopped around to other nations to find someone to support the idea...and, uh...well...Saddam was quite interested in paying for the project. At least, he was...until the scientist died under mysterious circumstances after taking the job.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Iâ€™m guessing you mean the biggest movement of water on Earth from a place with water to a place with no water. The largescale currents of the thermohaline circulation are constantly transporting insane amounts of water.</p>
<p>To give some relative sense of scale here, the unit of <strong>sverdrups</strong> was invented to talk about the flow of ocean currents quantitatively; one sverdrup = a million cubic metres <em>per second</em>. The present day inflow of water from the N Atlantic to the Med is <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2010JC006302" target="_blank">far less than one sverdrup</a> (though it would probably have been several times greater during the Zanclean Flood). The flow of water in the largest parts of major ocean currents like the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, or the Gulf Stream transport <em>well over 100 sverdrups of water.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, the Strait of Gibraltar is only 14 km across, so the waterfall wouldnâ€™t have been that wide. I like to imagine it sometimes though and I think that makes it even more dramatic in a way â€” you could fit the whole width into a field of view and the flow is quite concentrated through this narrow point, it must have really started gushing through once itâ€™s worn down the sill a bit. Iâ€™ve seen the quickest estimates for refilling of the Med at just a couple of weeks, which I canâ€™t help but feel suspicious of.... but if thatâ€™s the case then I also like to picture a bunch of marine life just spilling over along with all the water, just for laughs. Can you imagine a waterfall punctuated with schools of fish, sharks, giant squid all tumbling through?! They probably had more sense than to get near it though.</p></div>		</li>
