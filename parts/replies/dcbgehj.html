			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens when you become addicted to chapstick or lip balm?  I need it on my lips constantly or they feel dry and tight.  Only relief is chapstick (been like this over 20 years so I think it's here to stay)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be weird for a guy to buy (Amazon ftw!) but if you want to get rid of a chapstick addiction, try lanisoh lanolin. It fixed my lips, and you really only have to put it on once a day, its super smooth and moisturizing. I haven't used any chapstick for 2 years now, I just put some of this on before bed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every winter the inside of my nose (where the soft tissue meets the septum) gets chapped to the point of splitting. So far the best treatment I've discovered (believe it or not) is diaper rash ointment. I put it on before bed and it helps for the next day, but it's always a daily battle.</p>
<p>So I may have to give this a try. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is going to be an unpopular statement, but getting &quot;dependent&quot; on lip balm is mostly a myth. As in, nothing will change in your lips by using or even over-using lip balm in itself, you could stop cold turkey with no bad effects. What does happen (though only in some people!) is that you get into the habit to lick your lips, and this may in fact be compounded by an excessive amount of lip balm as there is something to be licked away. Excessive licking causes damage to the lips, which is a form of <a href="http://www.dermatalk.com/blogs/skin-disorders/lip-lickers-dermatitis" target="_blank">lip-licker's dermatitis</a> (also called &quot;licking eczema&quot;), and <em>that's</em> the root of the chapped lips and the need for more lip balm. This is compounded by psychological dependence, which is basically &quot;force of habit.&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR, if you can train away the habit of licking your lips all the time you can quit lip balm any time you want, except maybe if it's super dry outside in the deep of winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the &quot;addiction&quot; is mostly a myth (aside from the salicylic acid in some balms), overuse CAN have an affect on some people.</p>
<p>I used to use Burt's Bees religiously for years, and ended up with an exposure allergy to propolis (found in most batches of beeswax). Took forever to figure out the problem, because I didn't know that could happen. Thought I had a rash or herpes or something, and kept using the lip balm.</p>
<p>It's made life kinda difficult, because that shit's in tons of products, including face creams and toothpaste. It won't happen to everyone who uses Burt's, but more should be aware of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure it's not the lip licking that's reinforcing addiction, it's the sensation of moisturized lips and the feeling of rubbing them together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was addicted to it before basic training (long time ago) and had it taken away right when basic started.  My lips got chapped, but they healed over about a 4 week period and I was no longer &quot;addicted&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, the red portion of your lips (that becomes chap) is referred to as the Red Zone or Vermillion Zone. The external lip skin contains sweat glands and sebaceous/oily glands, and the internal lip contains minor salivary glands. The Vermillion Zone, however, contains no glands whatsoever, hence the need to lubricate by licking or chapstick. </p>
<p>Fun Fact: The Vermillion Zone is red due to the heavily vascularized dermis that shows through the epidermis. </p></div>		</li>
