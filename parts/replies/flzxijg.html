			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember noticing drinking certain milks made me fart for a bit. It wasn't until I was a fully grown adult that I realized those mornings I felt ill or pain in my stomach were actually caused by the milk I had with my cereal. I think I had been eating cereal every few days for years through high school never making that connection.</p>
<p>Nowadays I know the quantity I can handle so if I crave ice cream I keep it much smaller than I would have as a child.</p></div>		</li>
