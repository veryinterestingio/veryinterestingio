<p>Antiperspirants do everything deodorants do, but use aluminum to stop you from sweating all together.</p>
<p>These are defined by the FDA in the USA. Most countries outside the USA just classify everything as deodorants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not /u/boersc but in short... no, they're not bad for you. </p>
<p>The main study that kicked off the fear involved injecting rabbits with a solution containing aluminum phosphate which caused neurodegeneration. Applying antiperspirant to your armpit is not equivalent to an injection. </p>
<p>The &quot;evidence&quot; for the &quot;link&quot; between antiperspirant use and breast cancer was breast cancer seems more likely to turn up close to the armpit than far away from it. Later studies found no link to antiperspirant use and cancer.</p>
<p>No studies to date have found any link between antiperspirant use and disease or cancer. The only known potential issue found is that they can change the microbiome in your armpits. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without wanting to sound dismissive, but there is no scientific proof of aluminium salt being dangerous or bad. If it were, it would have been taken off the market in no-time.
Aluminium salt is a natural component, and there is actually very little of it in the deodorant. Even if it would get in your body, it would be harmless.
There are also rumors of this causing cancer, but again, no scientific proof for that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's mighty optimistic off you, given that we didn't even ban leaded gasoline until 1996.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may over time become sensitive to them.  I wore typical deodorant / antiperspirants for almost 2 decades.  Started getting bad rashes.  Stopped using them for about a month rash cleared up.  Tried them again rash nearly immediately came back.</p>
<p>I work a physically non-active job in a climate controlled room so I rarely sweat.  So now I just don't wear any and wash my pits a couple times a day as needed.  If I don't think I'll have an opportunity to wash my pits and &quot;might&quot; end up getting stinky I do have some &quot;all natural&quot; hippie deodorant that doesn't make me break out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By removing aluminium salts you are removing a key component, the effectiveness of its anti-sweating capabilities without this is less, which is why it is not applied to the full range. You have the option of full protection and white stripes or less protection and no stripes.</p>
<p>Thats what im assuming based on what they wrote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that needed to be in there. </p>
<p>Maybe the non white version has a different but equally effective ingredient, or it's the same ingredient that's somehow already in a gel state. </p>
<p>Wouldn't shock me if the reason is something like... some people don't trust the stuff if it doesn't leave that residue, so it's more profitable to offer both versions.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/boersc" target="_blank">boersc</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because the white stripes are caused by the active component. If you remove the active component, you have to replace it with something different. And most replcements don't work as good as the aluminium salt. (although this is debated by those that prefer the alternate, often 'natural' components)</p></div>		</li>
