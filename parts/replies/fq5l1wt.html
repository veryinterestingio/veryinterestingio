			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine does this as a dedicated amateur. Once he's into an imaging session, the active shots are typically about 5 to 10 minutes long, depending on temperature. One of the limiting factors in all of this is the thermal noise from the camera itself, so in the summer the images have to be shorter, whereas in the winter they can be longer.</p>
<p>The telescope (and camera) itself are mounted on a tracking mount, which has its major axis aligned with the Earth's axis. It then just has to turn at the same rate as the earth to keep the target in view (so spinning once every 23 hours, 56 minutes (aka 1 siderial day) around its axis. Of course, this isn't perfect, so there's actually a second, smaller telescope mounted to the main one, with a high sensitivity but low resolution camera. He then has a computer program that's constantly monitoring this guide camera, and watching a target star within it. As the telescope moves, the computer keeps sending small corrections to the mount to keep everything aligned.</p>
<p>It's pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The tracking mount will keep it in the view (and rotated). </p>
<p>Stars and galaxy don't move at different rares, at least in our time-frame. The mount just has to compensate for our spinning planet. Even the position of our planet on it's orbit doesn't matter (concerning parallax) as things are so far away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if someone says a photo took 50 hours, does that mean it was likely only two nights, or that over many nights they collected 50 hours of exposures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be weeks or months for 50 hours. One might only have a clear 6 hours a night in which it's dark enough for these objects to be worth shooting. But that 50 hours could be 50 days of 60 unique sixty second exposures. These photographers also know how many shots are in the final image, so they can estimate how long the total composite took. </p>
<p>So say day 1, I planned to take an hour of shots, again lets call it 60 one minute long (60 second) shots. Well maybe a plane passes by, or my lens freezes over, or it's cloudy for the last half hour. I might have a half hour worth of &quot;keepers&quot; that are worth editing. Do that every night for a month and you'll get to 50 hours of worthwhile shots! Automation and precision equipment help tremendously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on where you are, and the time of year (depending on Latitude). In southern Canada, in the summer months, you only have maybe 6 hours of useful darkness a night. Combine this with weather, clouds, and so forth, that 50 hours was probably done over 2 or 3 weeks.</p>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope, on the other hand, has a couple parts of the sky that are considered to be the &quot;Zones of Continuous Viewing&quot; where the telescope can stay focused on it throughout its orbit, without getting into interference from the Earth or the Moon. However, these are (I believe) limited to about 72 hours total, as eventually the telescope's orbit will take it through the South Atlantic Anomaly, where they have to shut the instruments down as they pass through the increased radiation in that area.</p></div>		</li>
