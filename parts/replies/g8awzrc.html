			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a feature, it's a 3rd party bot that scans new comments on all of reddit for this trigger phrase. It's not part of reddit per se.</p>
<p>AFAIK there are some Subreddits that block bot activity so it won't work there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Healthy' is an entirely relative term. If you have plenty of energy stored as fat, eating a banana isn't particularly healthy, as you don't require more sugar, unless you're about to exercise or are deficient in potassium.</p>
<p>If you are starving, i.e. you're in need of energy to survive, a banana is extremely healthy. It's providing you with lots of energy in the form of sugar.</p>
<p>As for the peel, if you're deficient in vitamin B6, B12, magnesium, or potassium, or your diet is lacking in fibre, then the peel is 'healthy'. If not, then not really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But could one eat the peel?  </p>
<p>A few years ago... well, quite a few years ago, we would put a partial banana peel on a plantar's wart and eventually it went away, after being quite disgustingly &quot;eaten&quot; (worn down because of the constant moisture/whatever).  That's what i think of when I eat a banana peel.</p>
<p>Do you have any good banana peel recipes?  Asking for a friend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a video once of gibbon monkeys eating bananas. They would eat the peel and throw the inside on the ground. Maybe peelâ€™s the good part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched chimpanzees eating bananas (on tv).  They opened them fom the back, from the end furthest from the bunch.  That way, they're clear of the back end of the banana!  I thought, &quot;that's brilliant!  That way they don't have to worry about the end with that weird black thing that sticks up in the middle that everyone avoids!&quot;  </p>
<p>That's what I do on especially ripe (the best) or green bananas (the other end doesn't break off without much tugging).</p></div>		</li>
