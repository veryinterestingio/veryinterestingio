			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study I just read that suggests viral stability has a U Shaped curve with respect to humidity for COVID.  Dry air is worse than slightly humid air, but heavily humid air is worse than both.  Basically warm slightly humid air is better for reducing COVID stability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation was a little confusing to me regarding lipid envelopes and GI viruses. Viral evolution ditched the envelope because the envelope isn’t good enough? Why not just make the capsid resistant to low pH and keep the envelope too? Also some viruses with lipid envelopes do in fact survive the gastric environment despite those lipids being susceptible to low pH degradation. Coronavirus is a good example. There are several tricks to dodging exposure to low pH such as hiding in mucous or food particles.</p></div>		</li>

Viruses are EXTREMELY stingy with their genetic code. They try to squeeze out every last bit of mileage.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This statement is wonderfully ironic. The term, <em>virus</em>, was applied to computer code that 1) was unwanted, 2) was self-replicating, and 3) caused harm to its <em>host</em>. Obviously, the origin of this term came from its biological counterpart. Computer viruses are parsimonious with respect to their coding instructions in a manner similar to their biological counterparts. The most successful computer viruses are those that require very little resources and are able to use the &quot;machinery&quot; of the host effectively while also evading the host's defenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are absolutely strategies to survive harsh environments. One is to ditch the envelope altogether, though that can expose a more antigenic surface to the immune system, another is to incorporate elements that can stabilize the envelope, though this comes at a cost, too. Just making the capsid resistant but not the envelope won't work: the receptor binding domains need to be on the surface of the virus. If the virus is enveloped, that means in the envelope, so that needs to stay intact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main evolutionary advantage of having an envelope at all is that it partially shields the viral particle against innate immune sensors, since the envelope is mostly stolen from a host cell to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean &quot;why not just make the capsid resistant...&quot;? The viruses aren't choosing what to do. They aren't choosing their design. Evolution doesn't describe a process with a goal and active steps to reach the goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah yeah it’s a figure of speech. You can rewrite substituting the right evolutionary verbiage the end result here is the same. The virus replication system naturally leads to some outcomes being more likely than others. So why the divergence into some enveloped and some not enveloped ?</p></div>		</li>
