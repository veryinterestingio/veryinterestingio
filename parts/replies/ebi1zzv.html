			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon is the fourth most common, and silicon is the eighth. It's still definitely in the realm of sci-fi, at least in terms our own planet's environment, but Earth does have a high abundance of silicon which has led to a lot of that plausible deniability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there is nothing to stop life happening without carbon, it would be just odd to have such chemistry where carbon would've just not take it's place. We also have to think about life that forms in chemistry with only small amounts of carbon around. It would be bloody difficult without carbon since it is the lego block of the elements but no law forbids life that is totally without any carbon.. Instead of winning the lottery, we need to win a lottery where in order for to cash out a jackpot, you need to win every round for a decade. And by then inflation has already eaten a lot of your earnings. Or it takes two centuries and there is no one to collect the winnings...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have no idea what it does or doesn't take to create non-carbon based life... because we've never seen any.  It's purely hypothetical.</p></div>		</li>
