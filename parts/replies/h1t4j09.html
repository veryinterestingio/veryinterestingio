			<div class="markdown"><p>That local parking garage is built with steel, cement, and glass. So is a skyscraper. </p>
<p>The core materials are the same (or at least substantially similar), but the quantity of each and how they're arranged are wildly different. Add in other people's comments about how similarity is assessed, and you might be able to find 95% of the garage's construction materials and methods in the skyscraper, or 40% of the skyscraper's materials and methods in the garage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a large portion of what you do isnâ€™t intelligent.  It is moving water around, getting rid of waste, making energy, getting stuff in and out of cells. That is the same regardless of if you stick a big brain on top of the plumbing or not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an anthropomorphic view of the subject that makes you feel that a fruit and a intelligent species are so far away from each other. </p>
<p>If you consider the vast amount of matter in the universe, and every chemical reaction that can occur, those reactions that lead to life generate a very very small portion of what exists in reality. </p>
<p>Every living organism exists in a very small bubble of what matter can become.  The fact that humanity has always spent a lot of effort to differenciate itself from the rest of the living creatures doesn't mean its true. We feel special because we persuade ourself that we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically they were correct, there is cement in the construction of the buildings.  Because it's mixed into concrete doesn't mean it's not there  :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>V true. We're drawn to the differences in species but the fundamental similarities are more amazing (at least IMO). All life is one.</p></div>		</li>
