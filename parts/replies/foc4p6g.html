			<div class="markdown"><p>The processor is perfectly happy executing what it sees as valid instructions, even if they don't make sense.  &quot;Graceful&quot; crashes happen when a problem is detected, not necessarily when a problem happens.  Modern systems have so many levels of error detection and correction (in the program you're running, the toolkits the program is built on, the operating system, the CPU firmware, etc) that problems are usually caught before stuff gets really strange.  Even your hard drive can detect errors, not only when reading or writing data, but when sending it through a bad cable, using checksums (basically a math formula with the data as an input that returns a result which is compared to the expected result to make sure your data is what it should be).</p>
<p>Server memory (RAM) sticks actually have an extra chip that has the job of using checksums to detect and fix 1s or 0s that should be the other one. That can happen randomly sometimes (entropy, cosmic rays, interference, etc) but isn't usually an issue for regular PCs because they're not super critical and aren't powered on for months or years at a time.  If you leave a computer on for a very long time without the special memory, the errors would build up until interesting stuff starts to happen.  &quot;Interesting&quot; is not a word you want anywhere near &quot;bank balance database&quot;, &quot;secret decryption keys&quot;, or &quot;private personal data storage&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mainly because the N64 doesn't read code directly from the cartridge like older systems do. It copies into memory and runs it there, for performance reasons. So messing with the cartridge connection doesn't cause as much trouble as it would on a NES or SNES. Mainly it just interferes with sound and 3D models because games do usually read those directly from the cartridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing missing is that It doesn't explicitly state that tilting the cartridge affects the physical connection between the cartridge and the console. </p>
<p>I realize that for most it's a no brainer, but for me I had to read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/g6r5fs/eli5_in_the_nintendo_64_game_console_why_does/fobvukh" target="_blank">another comment </a> before this one truly made sense to me.</p></div>		</li>
