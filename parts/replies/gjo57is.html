<p>144hz is great because it's still evenly divisible by 24 and 48, but offers a higher target frame-rate for gamers that want sub 7ms response time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, there's nothing wrong with 120Hz for most people. Even most gamers. It's just that the industry has kind of settled on 144Hz being the de facto standard. You'll find it has much more support than 120.</p>
<p>Just to illustrate that point, Newegg lists 12 monitors at 120Hz, but 380 at 144Hz.</p>
<p>165Hz is also one of those oddball refresh rates I mentioned before. It's got a lot of options, too. Not sure why that refresh rate has been chosen as another kind of go-to. But like I said, there's absolutely no concrete scientific or physical limitation on why 144. It's just a confluence of other things that all point to roughly that number so it was picked.</p>
<p>EDIT: It's possible the 165Hz monitors are actually 168Hz (24 x 7 = 168) and they're just being marked as 165Hz because round numbers are catchier. Or maybe they are 165 and they're bucking the tradition of being a multiple of 24/30. Who knows. :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, although most 144hz monitors also have a 120hz mode for compatibility so there's really no point to getting a 120hz only monitor. Most games I've played have native 120hz support if they have 144hz support which is nice.</p>
<p>120hz works great for games like SOMA because it locks to 60fps. Selecting the 144hz option makes the game jitter like mad doing the pulldown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding (not in the industry, merely a consumer) the 165hz/144hz and 75hz/60hz numbers come from trends in panel manufacturing; the tech used to develop &quot;higher refresh displays&quot; (basically that to bring down response time) has jumps instead of steady progress.  120hz came out of some LCD development done by Merck in the early 2000's (sounds like I know more than I do, that's the extent of my knowledge there), and 144/165 were target values reached under those new design limitations.  Almost any 60hz panel will actually overclock to 75hz without issue (I've done it to every TN/IPS display ive owned, every single one works, despite being marketing as only 60hz displays.  VA panels seem different, this is what most TV's use, and I couldn't tell you why, probably a different limitation from the different panel technology).</p>
<p>Most people don't realize that 300/360hz displays literally only came out a couple months ago.  You don't really hear about it because computer hardware/game engines are still the limiting factor, 300+fps can only really be hit in niche games or stuff like csgo which is almost a decade old.</p>
<p>Also I believe 165hz is the limit of display port 1.2 2560x1440, but I could be mistaken. 8 bit +frc?  I don't remember the specifics but it's before chroma subsampling so full 4:4:4 color (was an issue with early 4k120/144hz displays, the cable couldn't carry enough so they dropped color sampling to 2:2:4? I think.  Whatever it ends up being, getting to be less eli5 and more eli enthusiast</p></div>		</li>

<p>Third was bandwidth limitations. I'm unable to find the original source for this at the moment so I'm going by memory. At the time that 144Hz monitors began appearing on the market the bandwidth limitations were in that same range. You couldn't really push much more information to the monitor and because of points 1 and 2, 144Hz was settled on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old bandwidth limitations was DVI dual link. Running 1920x1080@144Hz was really pushing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said, I couldn't find the article on that so I was going off of memory. I don't recall exactly what cable they said was being used, sorry. But I do remember them saying it was near the absolute limit of what could be handled at the time.</p>
<p>It was a PC magazine/blog article so there's no reason to disbelieve it as some random schmo writing crap on his personal blog somewhere. I really wish I could find it so I could clarify that third point.</p>
<p>Of course <a href="https://www.avadirect.com/blog/displayport-vs-hdmi-vs-dvi-vs-vga/" target="_blank">this here</a> says DVI was capable of 144Hz @1080p so perhaps that was it after all.</p>
<p>EDIT: Someone below put in the actual technical specs that backs me up on this: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/kzbt1h/eli5_why_are_monitors_144_hz_instead_of_a_flat/gjo6r13/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/kzbt1h/eli5_why_are_monitors_144_hz_instead_of_a_flat/gjo6r13/</a></p>
<p>You could get an absolute maximum of 159Hz out of a 1080p signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That answer is incorrect, because the calculation does not take blanking intervals in to account.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Video_Timings" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Video_Timings</a></p>
<p>Depending on what blanking interval type is being used, the maximum frequency of DVI-DL differs.</p>
<p>With the fastest blanking interval, CVT-R2, 148Hz should be within bandwidth limits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first consumer 120hz monitors were probably made for 3D vision in the late 00s (I mean, I know some CRTs could probably get around there way before the late 00s, but they were hardly affordable) and indeed you had the cable bandwidth that you had. </p>
<p>But the first 144Hz screen was arguably the Asus's VG278HE in 2012. And if HDMI 1.4 was just 3% faster than dual link DVI, displayport 1.2 was already a thing back then. And that can do even 240hz in full RGB 1080p.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that is true, the response time isn't tied to the refresh rate. There are monitors (especially cheap monitors) which can't display their advertised refresh rate, because their pixel response time is to slow. Not that they display 60 instead of 144, but them doing only 120 reliably is definitely a thing. Maybe there are even worse examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of point 1. Really there wouldn't be a difference since both 145 and 143 would keep it under 7. In fact, 143Hz is the slowest you can get and stay under 7. 142Hz is slightly above 7.</p>
<p>But because of tradition, 144 was the natural choice.</p></div>		</li>
