			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had cats my entire life and too be honest, I can't think of a sound they make that means they're playing/laughing. Purring can obviously mean they're happy (though they purr for a ton of reasons, including being in pain / not feeling well, trying to make you feel better, etc.). Some cats (one of mine) will like, chirp/trill when he's happy to see me (or when he thinks it's dinner time). Again, not really laughing per se but still happy noises.</p></div>		</li>
