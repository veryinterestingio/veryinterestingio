			<div class="markdown"><p>They could've controlled for &quot;skin with no bacteria&quot; vs &quot;skin with one type of bacteria&quot; vs &quot;skin with multiple types of bacteria&quot;<br />
And then if the multiple bacteria skin was chosen significantly more than the others, they could say &quot;well, they clearly like more bacteria over less or none bacteria, but we didn't control for what <em>types</em> of bacteria, so we can say they like combinations, but we're not sure which combination.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more likely that it's difficult to control for exactly one type of bacteria. Seems to me that they would see trends in attraction to people with overlaps on a broad range of bacteria but, without a way to tighten that range and test specific combinations, can't determine exactly what bacteria are the cause.</p>
<p>That my two cents, anyway. All I know is that we're loaded with bacteria and it seems like it would be at least extremely time consuming to manufacture a test that can isolate each type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s important to note that about 1% of known bacteria are able to be cultured in a laboratory setting. Some virulent microbes aren’t virulent until they’re in vivo. The natural world has a lot of complex environments, and human skin is one of them. So you could potentially get a group of humans and clear off their skin and like... rub a culture of a certain bacteria and see what happens. Or you could just record what happens and take note of what samples you get, and see if there’s a correlation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if these microbes happen to serve an important function?</p>
<p>Perhaps they are the same general family on all mammals that mosquitoes eat, and mosquitoes are so successful because they target an important microbe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a teenager, I would get mosquito bites fairly often.  Ever since I hit my 20s, I no longer get them.  First they generally seem to avoid me,  but even if I do catch one sucking on my arm and see it full of blood, I no longer seem to react to it and get the mosquito bumps.  My blood type is O+</p>
<p>My GF on the other hand, we go out in the woods or out camping for a weekend and she comes back with two dozen or more bites.</p></div>		</li>

That’s also where I am right now. Eating lunch. With a bunch of voracious corporate fuckers.</p></div>		</li>
