			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to argue against the study but displaying my own anecdotal evidence. I am not at all in an angry state or anxious when I listen to extreme metal, I am a very stoic person by nature, but am rather looking for something real. I find that the ever expanding genres of metal offer something that many others don't, a real genuine care for their craft. I understand that is a bold statement, as I listen to other music genres that show real passion, but it is more so a dig at the genres like rap and pop that are just making music for money. It is hard to fake metal, and even harder to fake the more extreme genres. Bands like Silent Planet, Devin Townsend, Counterparts, Being as an Ocean, Oathbreaker, etc all put an immense amount of energy and purpose into their art which transcends their medium and is felt upon listening, making the end user truly empowered. I feel that music is something special and allows for some of the most direct emotion sharing of any medium and maybe that is why it has been around for as long as it has and almost every culture has their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I quite agree with you. I think those articles and my generalization of their contents give a fair answer to OP's question - <em>as</em> a generalization. There are obviously a lot more factors than can be addressed in an ELI5, and a lot of it has to do with the brain chemistry of emotions, which I know exactly nothing about. </p>
<p>What I do know is that is that I did music therapy with adolescents for three years and saw music have a <em>tremendous</em> effect on their ability to stabilize their own moods. I had to jump through a <em>lot</em> of hoops to do it, though, because it seemed counterintuitive to my colleagues when they heard the music that my kids chose for their playlists - almost all of it was always extreme in the sense of being heavy, or intensely sad. Nobody was putting pop on their playlists. I had to do a lot of research to prove that it was effective, and my clients had to do paperwork (rating their before-and-after moods on a Likert scale) every time they had music therapy or wanted to use listening to their music as a coping skill (it was an inpatient facility). And the administration still shut down my music therapy program because they just couldn't wrap their heads around the idea the Cradle of Filth or Rammstein or songs about being suicidal really did help those kids deal with anger, depression, etc. So instead they took music away from the kids, then penalized them when they got in fights or cut themselves. Very frustrating.</p>
<p>Another point that may be more relevant to you - in the course of the research I did for that music program, I found a lot of articles describing a correlation between metal fans and above-average intelligence, and that correlation is independent of mental health. People who like metal are often very intelligent and/<em>or</em> struggle with depression, anger, anxiety, etc. I should have looked up an article about that correlation for my comment above, but I forgot about it until I read your reply. That was a long time ago - 2006, I think.</p>
<p>In any case, it's a really interesting subject all the way around. And I definitely agree with you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your comment and I am sad to hear the outcome of your program as it sounds very interesting and quite helpful. I certainly don't outright disagree with the paper, as I think the generalizations it makes are probably right. The older I get the more I feel music is quite special and its effects on me grow stronger. The sheer notion that some people don't listen to music or only listen to the radio on their drive to and from work is absolutely baffling to me. Since you have a background in the study of music, have you done any research on frisson and the effects of music?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading this just sounds like you are describing the same thing but in a more “appreciation based” version of emotion. If that makes sense at all... </p>
<p>You gain the emotion from the skill or talent - the quality of the music as a whole from what I understand of your comment. </p>
<p>Do you have a particular need that you feel the music you choose to listen to at any point in time satisfies? </p>
<p>I would argue if yes, then it kinda fits in the same category... </p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My real gripe is this comment, &quot;People who are in a stable, comfortable position will find extreme music uncomfortable or disturbing, while someone who is going through a period of anger, anxiety, or depression will find it soothing.&quot; I am generally in a stable mood but still adore extreme music and don't find it necessary to increase my arousal or decrease it. I can alter or maintain my emotional and physical arousal independent of the music I am listening to. I can be studying for an exam, listening to extreme metal or be at the gym listening to R&amp;B.
To answer your question directly, I don't feel like I generally choose a style of music based on my emotional state, as it is generally neutral, but I may chose an artist more often than not. There is so much new music every day that I am flooded with albums in need of listening. I do think you are right though that part of my enjoyment or fulfillment comes from the quality and purpose of the music I choose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For specific band/ emotion release; Five Finger Death Punch doesn't do anything for me except annoy me, it's heavy and loud but vocally he's too in the front? Whereas Gojira, Amon Amarth, Deftones are all fairly mid balanced. Bands like Old Man Gloom, Sumac, The ocean all have way in the back sounding vocals. I think it's safe to say they've all got some fairly heavy instrumentation. </p>
<p>I'd put those bands in specific playlists because emotionally most of them let me space out and build tension/ release. Which for FFDP I don't really ever get the build up or maybe it's all build up and no release. I can listen to an 18 minute long song and half of it is industrial pops and bs and it's fine. Or I can hear 2 minutes of rapid gunfire drums and blazing vocals and feel more annoyed for the lack of build up and closure.</p></div>		</li>
