<p>It was Muddy Waters Research that figured out that Luckin Coffee was a house of cards, faking their sales numbers, and rode that company all the way to bankruptcy and a huge fortune.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a very important part of the answer a lot of people miss.</p>
<p>basically, without a source of income from failure there is nothing to put the brakes on the hype train, if positive news was always good for stocks and negative news always bad it aligns profit incentives such that you shouldn't dig too deep and certainly never publicize bad news.  </p>
<p>one thing betting markets like stocks do really well is efficiently use information, but if you lack a mechanism for negative information to be used then you're really setting the stage for bubbles, even moreso than the nature of a financial market already does</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it has a different profile of risk. If the stock doesn't fall as much as you think it will, you can still lose money. If it falls much further than you think it will, you miss out on a lot of money. Also, fundamentally, if you think it's immoral to make money on the failure of a business, selling calls or buying puts is no different to shorting in that respect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. I think we should only allow people to buy stocks at ever increasing prices. No selling of any kind. That way the stonks market can't ever go down.</p>
