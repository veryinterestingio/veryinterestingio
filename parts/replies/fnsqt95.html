			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this especially true if it’s for say, a morning exam or a work presentation where I have to get up earlier than I usually do. Before I go to sleep I make a mental note that I HAVE to get up at x:xx or I will be in deep shit. And somehow my body literally wakes up exactly at this time or five minutes before when normally I sleep right through this time. It honestly is the weirdest thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. If I have to be up early, I'm always internally thinking &quot;I gotta wake up at 6. That's only 6 and a half hours from now. 6 and a half hours. Wake up at 6.&quot; over and over and set an alarm but still wake up at 15-20 minutes before the alarm.</p>
<p>I always joke that it's like a part of me is sitting there all night counting the seconds to 6 and a half hours (I always specify internally the time in hours and minutes before falling asleep and not only &quot;wake up at 6&quot;) and that's why I end up being off by 15-20 minutes, but I know that's obviously nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can train yourself to do this every time. I did, I have no idea how though.i haven't used an alarm clock since the late 90s. It's great because I never feel like my dreams or sleep were interrupted. It sucks because I can accidentally set it too early if I'm anxious about something.</p></div>		</li>
