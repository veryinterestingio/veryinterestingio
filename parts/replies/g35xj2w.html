It means it’s not powered in parking mode because I have to bring it in the house because it’s too hot, but it works perfectly while driving and I didn’t have to run cables that always seemed to fall down with my old car</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's why Tesla have a dashcam... it isn't actually a dashcam, but rather the cameras exist for automation/self driving. They use the data to train the system and improve it.</p>
<p>Tesla then realised later on that they could allow the cameras to be used as a dashcam, and for &quot;sentry mode&quot; (where the cameras act as CCTV when your car is parked up)</p>
<p>The dashcam is therefore actually just an added perk - Tesla are quite good for that, it's the only car I've ever owned where extra features are added over time. For example in the last update, the side-rear facing cameras were added alongside the reversing camera. And a year or so ago, some models were even given extra power (by unlocking higher rated modes in the motor and battery control software)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Automakers do not want to accept liability for anything they don't have to. Unless it's going to make them more money.</p>
<p>The last thing Chevy wants is to get sued by GEICO because their camera fucked up and didn't record an accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, alright let me ask a question then: would insurance companies file a lawsuit if a dashcam bought by a customer (i.e. Canon just for an example) did not record an accident?</p>
<p>Here's a scenario - 360 dashcam activated and records at all times when driving over 60 MPH and when the car is parked. The camera would record everything happening. Would GEICO or an insurance company sue Canon for faulty tech if the dashcam didn't properly record? I'd assume the answer is no, because the customer/client independently bought the dashcam on their own by choice.</p>
<p>Is that the proper mentally to approach this? Because if a car company manufactures their own dashcam tech and installed it on their own cars, the driver would be holding the manufacturer responsible for any repairs/updates/etc for that dashcam, yes?</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply in advance, and if not, don't worry about it!</p></div>		</li>
