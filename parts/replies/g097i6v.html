<p>Much less work, and arguably more enjoyable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been curious about this all my life. For me, carbonated beverages actually <em>hurt</em> to drink. I can’t take more than one sip at a time from anything like soda, beer, seltzer water or I will start tearing up and my throat/tongue feels like it’s on FIRE. I assume this isn’t normal for anybody else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had the same problem my whole life. It feels like a hundred little needle pokes. Are you sensitive to acidic things and strong flavors in general like I am?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate soda too. Hated it as a child because it hurt too much to drink! Never understood the appeal of soda. Beer is the only exception though. I’ll fight through that sensation for a good beer.</p></div>		</li>
