			<div class="markdown"><p>He also created the EPA, among other things.  He had a plan for health care reform that was much more aggressive than Obamacare.  He supported welfare reform that was more liberal than what was implemented under Clinton.  He opened us up to communist China and pursued talks with the Soviets.  These are just a few of the reasons he was primaried on the right by John Ashbrook in 1972.  He was attacked by M. Stanton Evans as having “taken the country further left than Humphrey...could ever have managed to do.”</p>
<p>Then Watergate was blown open, and that same conservative firebrand said “If I’d known he’d been up to all that stuff, I’d have been for Nixon all along.”  Republicans who voted to impeach faced primary challenges and even picketing from pro-“solidarity” conservatives who felt that Republicans who had voted to impeach a Republican who was obviously guilty of the crimes he was charged with had betrayed the party.  This was the birth of the RINO slur, and the mindset that gave us Trump.  The conservative snap-back against the left-wing activism of the “Watergate Babies” primed the pump, and the firehose of money that was enabled by the liberal-written (and Nixon-approved) Campaign Reform Act led to the rise of wedge-issue PACs.  The next time a Republican won the presidency, it was with the backing of Evangelical Christians and his motto was “government is not the solution to our problem, government is our problem” and once in office he refused to fully staff many agency positions, working instead on the advice of people he was comfortable with and the relationships he felt he had with world leaders.  This led to many policy missteps, and arguably to such disasters as the Marine Barracks Bombing.  That’s been the GOP in a nutshell till this very day.</p>
<p>If Nixon’s administration were teleported into office today, it would be seen as a radically left-wing socialist rogue operation.  Our politics have shifted that far right.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, he was still an above-the-law criminal, and he most certainly was <em>not</em> a radical-left socialist.  He was infatuated with law enforcement agencies and loved the idea of using them against his “enemies.”  But he was equally enamored with efficient and effective administration.  He was a populist, in a very <em>real</em> way - not the fake populism of Trump.</p>
<p>After Nixon’s fall, the right became reactionary, in greater measure than the left had become reactionary against Nixon prior to it, and in the decades since the left drifted towards “the center” which, <em>no shit</em> moves further to the right as the left and right move to the right.  It’s been a problem.</p>
<p>If anyone wishes to correct any errors I have made in this post I am very willing to learn where I have gone wrong - but please be willing to do more than just tell me why it <em>feels</em> wrong.  I don’t like it either, but near as I can tell this is the way things are.  The fact is that prior to Reagan, most Republicans operating at the national level were to the left of the Clinton administration.</p></div>		</li>
