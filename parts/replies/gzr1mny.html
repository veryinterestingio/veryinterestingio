			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's most likely that you actually get a 4K video stream which is downsampled by your browser's player. So you get 4 pixels for each displayed pixel. The difference in quality is then explained by the fact that these 4px are stored using more bits (on average, of course a modern compression algorithm does not store individual pixels) than the 1px in the 1080p stream. Assuming that YouTube's algorithm tries to create a comparable video quality in each resolution, it's probably safe to assume that the 4K stream will at least have double the size of the 1080p stream. So, your 4px, displayed as 1px, may be closer to the original source than the 1px that the 1080p compression generates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The video you see is always compressed with data losses. There is a tradeoff there, how much data you want to retain, and how much to save.</p>
<p>When watching 1080p video, you get the amount of data Google deemed good enough for 1080p resolution.</p>
<p>With 4k, to fill 4k screen with minimal artifacts, you have to use more data. Even if you downsample this to 1080p, you still can enjoy some benefits of having less data thrown out.</p>
<p>Basically, because of lossy compression, each pixel in 1080p video is not perfect match to &quot;perfect fidelity&quot; 1080p video, they're close, but there is some error. With 4k video, you have more data sent to you, so downsampling it back to 1080p the error for each pixel is smaller.</p>
<p>How it should mainly be visible is that pixels are &quot;crispier&quot;. Black next to white might be smudged to gray at border with high compression for example, but with less compression, there is less smudging, the line is crispier with sharper change from black to white. Or between any colors really, but the larger the jump between pixels, the bigger the smudging tends to be on lower data rate.</p></div>		</li>
