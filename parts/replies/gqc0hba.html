			<div class="markdown"><p>You seen like you know what you're talking about so let me ask you a question I was having trouble finding the answer to. There are mutations occuring that are causing variants of SARS-CoV-2. Every study I have heard about show that the vaccine are still effective against these variants. The vaccines use the spike protein as the marker that they &quot;show&quot;your immune system. But if the spike protein changes from a mutation, wouldn't the virus not be able to get into cells anymore because the conformation changed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and that’s one reason why none of the new strains have yet been able to escape the wrath of the vaccines. The spike protein can’t change via mutation too much, because if it does, the critical binding sections of the protein will no longer be able to bind to its binding sites on the host cell, or activate the cell membrane fusion, and the strain won’t be able to reproduce or survive. </p>
<p>Any new strain that manages to escape into the wild must therefore use a spike protein that's very similar in its binding sites to existing strains.</p>
<p>So any antibody that binds to those precise sections of the spike protein should be effective against all strains that use the same mechanism of infiltration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only a portion of the spike protein interacts with ACE2, its receptor expressed on human cells. </p>
<p>Mutations that occur outside of this interacting region might not effect its ability to bind to ACE2. Furthermore some mutations within this interacting region also may not block binding with ACE2 while also still causing problems for antibodies depending on the exact change.</p>
<p>So overall its true that the need to bind to ACE2 limits how much the spike protein can mutate, it doesn't mean it can't mutate at all without losing its ACE2 binding ability. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>14 +/- 9 seems like a weird figure. 4, 6, 8, 12, or 20 you can split evenly over the surface, with complete symmetry among them — i.e., at the vertices of an inscribed Platonic solid. I know that in particular a lot of viruses are icosahedral because of geometrical restrictions on the number of point defects necessary to have a fully enclosed surface. Is there anything like that for spike proteins on coronaviruses or other viruses with more spherical shapes? Also .. is it really that few? That common artistic rendering of the coronavirus, with the red spike proteins, seems to have a lot more than 21 spikes, as do electron micrographs I have seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible for the immune system to learn to recognize some other feature of the virus in a natural infection, so that although the patient might clear the disease, the acquired immunity is not great?  That would explain why the vaccines are better: you're training the system on something it would see at the beginning of a potential infection, rather than something that might appear later on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understood you well that exactly the case. The immune system does not target the spike protein only but all the surface structures in any combination, so you can have dozen of antibodies targeting various parts of the virus, albeit with lower efficiency than the response generated by the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
