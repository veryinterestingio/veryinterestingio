			<div class="markdown"><p>GammaKnife is a type of conformal photon radiotherapy. GammaKnife uses radioactive Cobalt-60 sources to produce 1.17 and 1.33 MeV gamma rays. The other type of conformal photon radiotherapy uses X-rays generated by a medical linear accelerator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically it. Beams coming in from each element do relatively little individually but add up a large energy deposition when they join in one geometric focus. </p>
<p>The main difference is that FUS doesn't involve ionizing radiation. GK is valuable because it minimizes the off-target radiation dose but, to some extent, any amount of high-energy photons travelling through tissue carries some risk of inducing secondary damage. With FUS, energy deposition along the beam path would only be an issue if the resulting temperature increase crosses a certain damage threshold, known as the CEM43 (cumulative effective minutes at 43*C). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also FUS makes use of temporally constructive interference from the phased array, while GK isn’t a coherent source, so consistent interference can’t be achieved across multiple sources. Maybe more akin to proton beam therapy, but then that involves spatial coherence of wave functions of many particles delivered at various times from one source</p></div>		</li>
