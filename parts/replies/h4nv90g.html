			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh this was something I only learnt recently. I thought black holes were these monsters that will suck everything in like OP’s mum. </p>
<p>But they have no more gravity and ability to suck things in than the mass they’ve consumed. Which is super reassuring to my inner child who thought we would all die a horrible horrible death from a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is OP’s point. As more things are swallowed, shouldn’t the mass (and therefore gravitational pull) of the black hole increase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does, but gravity is strongly affected by distance, i.e. is very weak over longer distances. The black hole gaining mass will therefore increase the range where the black hole has a meaningful pull on other objects, but not by a lot. And the distances in space are huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the most likely outcome still doesn’t not remain hitting the event horizon. </p>
<p>It turns out to be very hard to hit things in space accidentally. The problem in space is that any slight movement perpendicular to an objects pull of gravity probably is going to result in you missing that object. This is in fact how orbits work, the Sun for instance always pulls on the Earth but we have enough velocity going sideways that we always miss it. Now it takes a special amount of velocity to reach a near circular orbit that the Earth is in but to just miss the Sun from say interstellar space, it takes a very small amount of initial perpendicular velocity. Just think about the amount of asteroids that scientists always call out as “near misses” to earth. These all happen because these objects have slight lateral velocities relative to earth so always move out of the way enough to avoid a collision, even if earth deflects their path.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the sun could double in mass and the earth would still not hit it because it has the lateral velocity not to.  It’s orbit would become egg shaped and we would all fry to death but we would not crash into the sun.</p>
<p>Now with a black hole this is taken to a further extreme. As an object, the sun is really big, but black holes tend to be far smaller and for you to be sucked in you must actually hit the event horizon. This nearly never happens, the reality of black holes tends to be that say stars tend to have a near miss with the black hole, are ripped apart by the tidal forces, half of the resulting star orbits the black hole and slowly falls in as the gasses collide and are pushed by this into the black hole, while the other half of the star is scattered into interstellar space. </p>
<p>Semi related fun fact, it costs more energy to hit the sun from earth than to escape its gravity.</p></div>		</li>
