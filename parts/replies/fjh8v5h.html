			<div class="markdown"><p>You need a water heater mixing valve. The water heater should be very hot, not just because it makes it last longer as you said, but it's a health issue. The output of the water heater gets mixed from 'scalding hot' to 'safe hot' as it exits, and then your shower can mix to hot/warm as desired. This is safe, gives you plenty of hot water, good temperature control at the point of use, and a modern water heater is pretty well insulated so it's still quite energy efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean everything you said is true but I would argue lots of showers have poor temperature control at point of use. That's probably the reason for OP's dilemma.</p>
<p>I wasn't suggesting they lower the water temp, just saying it would have an effect. Didn't mean it if it came out that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure I agree. The other problem is that length of delivery varies, so you set one shower up perfectly and then the other will be getting water that is too hot or too cold depending on the distances and whether or not all your hot water lines are insulated.</p>
<p>I've just seen far too many people turn their water heater down to levels that aren't effectively killing legionella, and that turning it down is good to safe money, some even remove the mixing valve (wtf!). And don't get me started on tankless :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>120 is hot enough to prevent bacterial growth. Mixing valves are usually used for undersized water heaters that will run cold prematurely. The hotter they run, the less efficiently they do so and the shorter life of the tank. Also, if the plumbing doesn't have an expansion tank it will damage the plumbing over time from expansion and contraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am pretty sure you need 130-140, with most recommending 140, which is hotter than anyone wants to have coming out of their taps, so you set the water tank to 140 (or higher - again, that makes it last longer, sure call it undersized if you want) and then mix it down to, say 100-110 as your peak 'hot', then shower at whatever you like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An expansion tank is either necessary or not regardless of whether or not you're running 120 or 140, no? And has more to do with the installation (e.g. backflow valve).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone else crank the hot and then use the cold for fine tuning?</p>
<p>Also, I find I want my showers hotter and hotter as it goes on. Like I get used to a temp and then decrease the cold water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of us have that kind of set up. At home, I have one of those valves that couples the two. On the rare occasions that I'm staying somewhere else with two independent valves, I typically do the same. I find that adjusting the cold only usually provides for easier control.</p></div>		</li>
