			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but it fizzled out as a religion. I don't know how long it took, but it could have been a while, as people could still bring up their children as pagan. I wouldn't be surprised if many practised both for some generations.</p>
<p>The main point of allowing it to be practised in private was to ensure people wouldn't get prosecuted for holding onto their faith, while still officially converting as a nation. It was a brilliant solution to avoiding war.</p></div>		</li>
