			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much right on the money. Only thing I'd add is that instead of the nerve believing the muscle is cramped, it's actually the mechanism by which muscles expand and contract that isn't working properly.</p>
<p>Think about the way a zip tie works. You've got notches on a band and a piece that holds itself in place once it passes another notch. Your muscles kind of work like that, except chemical signals are what gets it to change &quot;notches&quot; so it contracts and relaxes. A knot happens when the contractions are sustained for so long that a point in the muscle becomes locked in place &amp; stops receiving the &quot;relax&quot; signal, even if it's fatigued. This is why it hurts so damn much to get a knot worked out, that part of the muscle is now realizing how little blood flow it had &amp; how much pain it <em>should</em> be in.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the location &amp; severity of the knot as well as if the patient has any conditions that could affect muscle relaxation and circulation. Some knots will go away after 15 minutes on the massage table &amp; a little stretching in the days to come, some only start to go away after years of regular massage work &amp; physical therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the muscle. Some small muscles like the gracilis in the groin, or the subscapularis and serratus anterior in your armpit can go ballistic just under light touch. if you are doing active release you just repeat a movement that isolates the muscle youre trying to unbunch while applying pressure to the knot, and after 30-45~ seconds usually you can release most muscles in your upper body, granted you can reach them.</p>
<p>edit- for certain muscles in your neck and shoulders, you can roll them out between your fingers if you know how to find knots by feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrolyte deficiencies in general can also contribute to this, Salts are needed for nervous transmission and cramping can happen if, for example, a person is taking too little magnesium or sodium in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor told me it was a buildup of lactic acid in the muscle. Not 100% sure if that’s true but that’s what he told me. Happy to be told I’m wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Med student. Lactic acid is formed during anaerobic cellular respiration. Basically, your cells need oxygen to continue making energy. When you don't have enough oxygen, your body will inefficiently continue making energy, but it also forms lactic acid. Lactic acid is what causes sore and cramped muscles. Taking a moment to breathe and slow your heart rate will increase oxygen to the area. After a workout, you have tiny tears in muscle tissue. They will be repaired, and this is how you gain muscle mass. You need to supply nutrients to the area, and the above comment is correct. Massaging the area increases blood flow and increases the resources in that area.</p>
<p>TLDR Lactic acid is formed when you put stress on your body and you become oxygen deprived. Excess lactic acid leads to soreness/stiffness and cramping. Your body is telling you you need a break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and I also want to make sure people realize that Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS), which happens after exercise (especially with resistance training and calisthenics) is a different thing than lactic acid induced soreness/cramping, is <em>not</em> caused by lactic acid and is also perfectly normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't the whole &quot;lactic acid is the cause of sore muscles&quot; completely debunked?
Simple way to notice it : endurance walkers / runners never go into anaerobic mode, and yet they can get sore muscles. </p>
<p>But anyway studies were made abiut it, and turns out, lactic acid could help make muscles LESS sore and painful.
There is a scishow video about it. You should watch it.</p></div>		</li>
