			<div class="markdown"><p>But...you can though. Or at least I can. I'd prefer not to, because I'll just need to go again in half an hour, but it's certainly possible. Happens every time I'm startled mid-pee, and I startle easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I thought this was pretty common or at least related to kegel strength/control. I’ve had to pee really bad on a car ride so I grabbed a bottle, once the bottle was filled I just shut it off. That released enough pressure that I wasn’t miserable and then finished peeing when I made it home</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it a difference between men and women? I'm a women and can start and stop my stream at will. Whenever I have to pee in a cup, I pee a little to find the stream, stop, line up the cup, go a little, stop, check the volume, go more, stop, volume is good, release the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All right, I have to ask: Instead of waiting until you got home, why not just empty the bottle out the window and then keep going right there in the car until you're fully relieved?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I feel it is like when people say that «you can pee without pooping, but you can't poop without peeing» - which is also not true, you can poop without peeing, you just prefer not to hold. Why should you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk in my experience it's really hard to poop without peeing. Holding in your pee also results in holding in your poop in my experience, so in order to poop you have to let the pee out as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be a difference between boys and girls. When I sit down, the poop gears set in motion. Girls maybe used to sitting on a toilet without pooping.</p></div>		</li>
