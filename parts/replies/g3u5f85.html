			<div class="markdown"><p>So is the air from inside the balloon vibrating itself once it pops, or does the movement of expanding air cause the air around the balloon to vibrate?   More specifically, of the outside air wasn't static and was flowing, would I still hear a pop?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rapid expansion is itself a vibration, think of it as a bubble which is expanding, it is pushing on the air creating high pressure area, and leaving behind a low pressure area behind it. If the air is not static there will be interference in waves, think of a windy day outside, you have to speak louder to get your sound through</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, when a balloon is under pressure (inflated), it has a higher density of air particles. This means that there is a bit more energy and vibration inside the balloon. When a balloon pops, the pressure is released, and all the air particles go in every direction, bouncing into other air particles. It does this because pressure likes to equalize everywhere, like people sitting in different seats instead of everyone trying to sit in one seat. It’s easier. Your ears detect this sudden change in vibration of the air as noise, causing the ‘bang’.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the &quot;impact&quot; from slightly higher pressure air expanding.</p>
<p>For example, if you inflated the balloon with colored smoke and popped it, the resulting smoke cloud would be a sphere only slightly larger than the balloon.  It would take a minute for the smoke to spread around the room.</p>
<p>However, immediately upon the transition from a balloon-restricted smoke cloud to a slight larger popped smoke cloud sphere, a sound wave is created.  Just like any other sound, it moves at the speed of sound, about 1000 feet per second.  But, this doesn't mean the air moves at 1000 fps.  Each air molecule just nudges its neighbor and then returns to where it was.</p></div>		</li>
