			<div class="markdown"><p>My <strong>bank</strong> was like this up until about 2 years ago. Your options were multiple choice questions, a password of a maximum of 8 characters (no special characters allowed), and a “personal” picture that you chose from one of 9 different options. No two-factor identification either.</p>
<p>My <strong>bank</strong>.</p>
<p>Edit: this wasn’t some small credit union either. This was one of the 5 biggest banks in the country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap I was just about to make this comment. The options when setting up your account are phones, dogs, computers, bikes, and a few other things. Say I choose phone, computer and bike. There is no chance in hell when I am greeted with a grid of 9 images that I will be able to remember the three things I chose when setting up this account. Glad I got out of that system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This annoys me so much. The best any of the financial institutions I use can come up with is SMS 2FA. Meanwhile all my social media and gaming accounts implement Time Based One Time Passwords or NFT security keys. </p>
<p>Seriously, my Steam account is more secure than my bank account. How is that possible? How!?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't either, but I <em>think</em> the answer would be LA Lakers since it's the only one where they didn't completely spell out the entire city name for the sports team. I could be wrong though. Me and sports don't get along.</p></div>		</li>
