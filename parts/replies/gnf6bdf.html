<p>Another good example of the latter half is Microsoft Office. You had 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2016. If you had 2007 or 2010, you wouldn't be inclined to upgrade to 2013. You'd just reuse the old version since it did everything you needed, and features in 2013 didn't justify dropping the several hundred dollars to upgrade. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Microsoft also would have to patch and maintain security updates for 2007, and 2010 in addition to their latest one 2013. By releasing a new product every few years, less people would buy it, and they'd have to spend more money maintaining security for all versions until their respective end of life dates.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>By focusing on Office 365 (the subscription model), they only have to maintain one product, and the subscription pays for the updates, and upkeep.</p></div>		</li>
