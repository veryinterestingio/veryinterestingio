			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually because that’s when your immune system is working the hardest. The symptoms that people generally associate with a cold are your body’s immune system trying to rid yourself of that cold (runny nose, cough, fever sometimes) </p>
<p>When you lay down at night and into the morning you’re giving your body a chance to rest so your immune system kicks up to try and rid your body of the cold germs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a morning showerer, I always feel better after a shower when I’m sick because it helps the sinuses drain (and I just feel more like a human and not a zombie after a shower). The humidity can also help soothe irritated airways a bit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks primarily the synovial fluid in joints (among other things). All my joints are usually more stiff in the morning and more painful at night/in the evening. But it could just be because of stiffness at night and doing too much during the day, and not just because of my immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My eczema is like this, from. My understanding it's an immune system issue, and it affects me when I sleep and at night when I'm relaxing before bed.  Being allergic to belts is a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Not as severe as your issue, but worth a mention for others .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in my case, I always feel cold symptoms more in the evening. I can feel fine during morning or the day and think I've beaten it but by evening everything hits me. Would that just have to do with fatigue at the end of the day?</p></div>		</li>
