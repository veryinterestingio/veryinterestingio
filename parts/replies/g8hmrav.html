			<div class="markdown"><p>If a planet is rotating fast enough the apparent gravity at the equator becomes noticeably less than it is at the poles due to the planet’s angular momentum cancelling out its gravity. This is perhaps counterintuitive - such a planet would have a significant equatorial bulge and therefore if you were standing there you’d have more of its mass beneath your feet than you would at the poles - but this is precisely <em>why</em> a rapidly rotating planet would have that pronounced equatorial bulge in the first place.</p>
<p>There’s no reason we <em>couldn’t</em> live on such a body just because of its high oblateness, it would just be odd compared to our Earthly experience. It would have interesting effects for atmospheric density, which would in turn strongly affect things like aviation and weather - there would be enormous atmospheric supercells running from pole to equator at the surface, so the equator would likely be one giant hurricane band and the poles more like cold deserts. Equatorial tides would likely be comparatively enormous. There might be interesting geological activity due to the comparatively high stresses this would produce across the planet’s crust. If there were any native life on the planet we might expect to see interesting adaptations to local variations in gravity, with enormously high trees and flying organisms at the equator that couldn’t survive closer to the poles. It’s an interesting starting point for a science fiction story!</p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone who plays and writes for a lot of TTRPG stuff, who is also a huge sci-fi fan, you hit the nail on the head right there!</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Someone mentioned it here, it is Hal Clement's <em>Mission of Gravity</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dragon's Egg is a 1980 hard science fiction novel by Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's Egg is a neutron star with a surface gravity 67 billion times that of Earth, and inhabited by cheela, intelligent creatures the size of a sesame seed who live, think and develop a million times faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first face-to-face contact with humans, who are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's Egg.</p>
<p>The humans arrive when the Cheela are a savage, backward species, fighting rival clans in a subsistence-level society. Within a few human days, the equivalent of a few thousand Cheela years, the Cheela surpass the humans in technology, and the humans are affectionately called &quot;the Slow Ones&quot;.</p>

<p>Follow up to the follow up that I just realized. If the above quote is the case is it theoretically possible to have a massive body rotating so fast that it becomes livable for human life but only around the equator? What a strange place that would be, where traveling north or south would see someone slowly (or quickly, I have no grasp on the size of the curve of the effect) grow heavier</p></div>		</li>

<p>You could have 1 g gravity at any latitude.  Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus have close to 1 g gravity at their surfaces.  For a rocky planet the oblate shape makes the planet effectively a lower density.  So multiple Earth masses or perhaps more iron relative to Earth.  </p>

<p>The angular momentum is linear with respect to distance from the axis of rotation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There'd be a lot of other factors to consider as well for it to be &quot;liveable&quot;, but yes, theoretically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along similar lines, a tidally-locked planet very close to its star (basically mercury, though it’s not completely tidally locked yet) will be extremely hot on one side and cold on the other..but there might be a zone that is habitable at the terminator between night and day.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it...I think I remember reading a story about a race of people on such a world that basically have to constantly travel west on dogsleds to outrun the rising sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would orbits with nonzero inclinations be stable around such an object? Inclined orbits around the earth precess because of the (relatively tiny) oblateness of the Earth.  Would objects just precess a huge amount (like, multiple degrees per orbit), or would they be unstable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Mission of Gravity</em> is one of my favorite hard scifi novels of all time, and the ending is the best ending I've read in <em>any</em> fiction novel I've read so far (though that's probably because I identify so strongly with the message). Clement is awesome at worldbuilding, and even though he's somewhat terrible at dialogue, this works pretty well when you're writing dialogue between humans and aliens because then it's understandable why the dialogue feels weird.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting aspect of a quickly rotating ultra-high gravity planet is that if you are on the surface and look around you, the world will seem to be <em>concave</em>, rather than spherical.
