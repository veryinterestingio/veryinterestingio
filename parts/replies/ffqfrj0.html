			<div class="markdown"><p>This could quickly devolve into a semantic argument, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_trench" target="_blank">trenches</a> associated with subduction zones are decidedly not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon" target="_blank">canyons</a> and never referred to as such so I'm not sure on what basis from the vague question provided by OP we are meant to assume that they did not in fact mean to ask about canyons as typically defined. With reference to trenches, the depth and width of oceanic trenches are relatively well explained with a combination of the age of the subducting oceanic lithosphere (older, colder, and more dense lithosphere generally being associated with deeper trenches) and the amount of sediment entering the trench, either in terms of eroding material coming off the over riding plate or sediment being delivered on top of the subducting plate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be be fair not everyone that asks questions here are themselves a scientist or even knowledgeable in the subject they are asking about so some confusion in definitions is bound to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could a canyon be formed above sea level, and then tectonic activity drops the entire area so that the canyon is now below sea level? It wouldn't be stable over time but it seems like it would be at least temporarily possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. The DeSoto Canyon near the West Florida shelf is like that. It started forming 120 - 200 Mya after the Gulf of Mexico formed. Has slowly been filling in with sediment ever since. I study that canyon as part of my dissertation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, yes, but in general as the elevation of an area drops below sea level (and/or the base level of the river systems in that area) it tends to become a preferential place for deposition to occur, so in this hypothetical, the canyon would begin to fill in with sediment quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a beloved topic by creationists, that the top of the grand canyon is impossibly higher in the middle so that no river could have flown there in the first place. (without accounting for tectonic activity, because of only 4000y time and so on).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many underwater canyons close to the coast are remnants of rivers and streams that ran through before the rise of sea levels starting around 13,000 years ago. Look at a topo map sometime you'll see how everything on the coast kinda &quot;flows&quot; the same as underwater.</p>
<p>Edit: i wanted to add that theres underwater canyons with no corresponding aerial rivers that were indeed caused by rivers so your edit is kinda misleading.</p></div>		</li>
