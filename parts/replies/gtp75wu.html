			<div class="markdown"><p>We do not know about the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and/or actively fermented food in regards to response to immunotherapy. Soon to be published data will shed light on the &quot;negative&quot; role of probiotics in relation to melanoma patients treated with cancer immunotherapy (see Spencer CN et al, AACR 2019).</p>
<p>We do not know if fecal transplants are the only way to get &quot;good&quot; bacteria into the large intestine. Hypothetically, any enteric-coated pill could deliver lyophilized freeze-dried stool to the large bowel. That approach was evaluated in the Baruch et al paper (Baruch, Science 2020) with reported success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if they’re useful in general. In the context of cancer patients receiving immunotherapy they don’t appear to be helpful, and may be harmful.</p>
<p>Gut microbial alterations play a role in the development of immune therapy related side effects. Microbiome modulation may alleviate side effects.</p></div>		</li>
