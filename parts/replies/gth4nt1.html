			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, some of that is that once the woman is through getting her PHD or gets out of residency as a doctor, she's likely 30+ and may still not be married. There's just not a time by that point to have a bunch of kids like there is if you start at 20. (Though there are of course exceptions. Two of my sisters are doctors - and they have 4 &amp; 6 kids respectively.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may be applying a first world perspective to your example. Consider that in Guinea, the <em>median</em> age for a woman to marry is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_age_at_first_marriage" target="_blank">16.5</a>, to a man of median age 24.6. </p>
<p>So, perhaps the more common situation in the third world that is adopting more education for girls is more like: by the time a girl graduates from her secondary education at age 17, 18, or 19 she will already have postponed marriage and a first pregnancy her aunts may have experienced at age 15, 16 or 17.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure - I've read articles about how female education dictates number of kids they have. In the US, I think that the only education group where the girls averaged 2+ kids were high school dropouts. </p>
<p>I was just using PHD/MD as extreme examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that in countries in South America, birth control, contraceptives, and IUDs are in short supply, leading to more pregnancies. There was just news stories on Twitter recently that people were talking about. In Venezuela, women lost access to contraceptives. And that rape rates in these countries are very high, leading to alot of pregnancies. Also that birth control there costs more than food.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, the main ones seem to be that as girls and women gain more social and economic opportunities through education, they tend to seek to have fewer children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They talk a lot about the &quot;opportunity cost&quot; of having kids. Basically, if you have to spend so much time and money on children, you can't pursue other interests. Well-off, educated people have a lot of fun and rewarding things they could be doing with their lives. For some weirdos, that means pursuing their careers.</p></div>		</li>
