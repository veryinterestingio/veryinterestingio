			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. When I spend all day lounging and don't really get dirty or sweaty, I wash with baby soap.</p>
<p>When I've just finished up at the gym, I use a rather standard body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. </p>
<p>When I've just come home from work and I'm covered in grease, pipe dope, and miscellaneous chemicals, I wash first with Dawn dish soap, then with standard body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. </p>
<p>After all of these, I moisturize until I could slide uphill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. If you shower daily, and have a fairly sedate life (I do hope you work out at least), you're fine using mild soap and shampoo.</p>
<p>If you work with grease or spend a significant amount of your work day sweating hard (a lot of construction workers), or push your workout limits regularly, or jog a long distance every day, etc, you may want a harsher soap and shampoo. Having said that, if you're shampooing every single day you want the mildest shampoo you can get or you'll damage your hair and scalp. I use baby shampoo even though I work in construction because a good portion of my job involves meetings with office workers for design plans so I often need to scrub the crap off 2-3 times a day during work hours.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I guess that was a stupid question. I looked it up on YouTube (I originally just watched the embedded video in my Reddit client so it didn’t show me the name or view count or anything). </p></div>		</li>
