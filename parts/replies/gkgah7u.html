			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, sorry if you got that out of what I wrote.  The thermostat only controls whether or not coolant flows to the radiator.  Usually, the heater core picks up it's coolant from the engine.  The one in my truck is plumbed directly from the water pump to the heater core.  The heater in my truck works (poorly) as soon as the engine temp gauge starts moving away from its low stop.  It works better as the engine gets warmer.</p></div>		</li>
