			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I was wondering if anyone else read the question.</p>
<p>I'm a metallurgist. Among other things we would check at one lab I worked in, for ground parts, we would run parts through an arduous set of chemical baths to etch and highlight the surface finish of the ground section. We would look at it visually then, for any thermal damage from the grinding process (called grind-burn). If it showed any indicators, we would cut a cross section and polish it out to a mirror finish, then etch it with nital and look at it under a microscope. Really bad thermal damage would cause rehardening of the steel, which is a kind of work hardening. In our case, we'd see a &quot;white layer&quot; almost like on a nitrided part, of rehardened material. It was very rare because all of our ground parts were done in an automated process with oil coolant, so very little chance for thermal damage, but it did happen.</p>
<p>TL;DR  abrasives work like cutting the material, and will have the same effect on the microstructure. Aggressive sanding or grinding can cause thermal damage, the same as cutting / milling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if you mean from thermal damage? I've never worked with H13 but I think it's like most other tool steels. Depending on how you bake, temper, work, or burn it, you can get all kinds of different colors out of it, anywhere from straw to cobalt to pink and everywhere in between. It comes from an oxide layer. A lot of the bright colors probably come from chromium oxides, as there's a good bit in those steels IIRC. With some processes on tool steel, people will use the color of the part to ballpark the temperature when they are tempering after heat treatment. As far as the reason those oxides refract light differently after certain heating processes? No idea, I'm a college dropout ðŸ˜›</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and with grinding, the whole surface is being brought to brittle fracture.</p>
<p>steels will work-harden when sanding, and this can be very problematic if you are not taking off enough volume with each grind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think you could get even worse work hardening by grinding over milling. I work in applications for a carbide tooling company, and when we're dealing with materials that work harden, you actually have to be more aggressive in certain areas, as counter intuitive as it sounds.</p>
<p>Proper end mill design creates chips in a way that &quot;wick&quot; away the heat generated by the cut, keeping the majority of it away from the tool and the material.  When people back off on the tool too much and make smaller chips, more of that heat is going into the material and causing WH.  Grinding creates chips with very low volume, so I could see an unfavorable heat transfer occuring. </p>
<p>If you have any questions let me know! I'm just happy to finally be relevant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that not deal with thermal issues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even flooded with coolant, the grinder still throws hot sparks. Even flooded with coolant, you can burn your surface.</p>
<p>The OD grinder I used to use had more coolant flow than any other machine in the shop by a lot. Even still, I had to worry about burning my parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely helps, and with certain materials it's necessary for you to even consider machining.  However if it's anything like milling, it doesn't solve all your problems.</p></div>		</li>
