			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. Sleep has evolved in all or nearly all animal species. When man evolved into who he is, he necessarily has to carry all that baggage/improvements made by all the animals that came before him in the evolutionary path. </p>
<p>Its like saying there has to be a reason we have molars or an appendix or even two legs. No there doesnt. the species only needs one small advantage in one area to adopt. Everything else he carries over from before</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know why we need sleep, we die without it. We begin to degrade as our mental faculties become stressed from processing information constantly and begin to shut down from overuse. </p>
<p>We don't know the specific processes behind why we die from lack of sleep and how sleep actually combats that path of death, nor the purpose of dreams. </p>
<p>It's not hard to see that being awake and functioning causes stress and damage to the brain. That's what working things do, they take damage and breakdown as they produce results. From a general understanding and quick study, it's easy to figure out that the brain needs it's maintenance time for proper function. What it does during is anybody's guess, but we definitely know why we need it. </p>
<p>Guess work leads me to believe that dreams are a result of your brain being repaired, getting some neurons reconnected and the test fire causes the dreams, which is why they are typically senseless and can suddenly change. It's a fun idea, at least.</p></div>		</li>
