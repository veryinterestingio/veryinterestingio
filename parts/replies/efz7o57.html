			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I am almost certain that I have sleep apnea. I always feel sleep deprived whether I get 12 hours of 6. My brother in law has it but now has the respiratory mask for sleeping. He said the first night he woke up afterwards and felt as though he only slept for the first time in his life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got tested for one of those and they told me I didn't really need one but wouldn't hurt to try one. Didn't get it though because I feel like having that thing on my face would kill my sleep quality a lot faster than my breathing would. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time I slept with a cpap, the day after was amazing. Now, I can’t seem to replicate it. I’ve tried taking a break from it for a year, still hasn’t been the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of the same here.  It was great at first, but the benefits seemed to taper off.  Then I started having all kinds of weird stomach and other problems... acid reflux, chest pain, heart palpitations.  I went through hell for almost a year.  Finally I decided to stop the CPAP for a week or two and it all went away.  Nobody believes me, but I swear the CPAP was the cause of it all.  I was a borderline case to begin with so I ended up just not using it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your mask may have not been tight enough or put together poorly.  You’d need a new sleep study since it’s been a year. </p></div>		</li>
