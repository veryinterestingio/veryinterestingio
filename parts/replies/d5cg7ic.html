<p>This is brilliant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former army signal corps member, I'd always get asked questions like this by some of the infantryman/paratroopers in my unit, and I'd always be at a loss of words on how to explain the differences between AM and FM in a way that the non-techie, combat arms guys (and now, girls) will understand.</p>
<p>This is great! Gonna use this if you don't mind? Lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because with interference (shining through the leaves of a tree), you can't really see how bright it actually is, but with color, it doesn't matter how bright it is, you can at least detect if it's blue or red or green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the interference affects one (brightness/AMplitude) more than the other (colour/FM frequency)</p>
<p>It's simply a matter of identifying a method of codifying the information that is less affected by the interference. </p>
<p>I don't think I've said anything new here, I just hope it can help clarify the concept a little.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is missing a key peice of info, which is that the amount of 'leaves' (AKA noise) would be constantly changing over time. This is what makes it a bit difficult to determine whether a percieved change in brightness is a result of an actual change in brightness or a change in amount of leaves. If the leaves were simply constant, you'd be able to perceive changes in brightness just fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comparison to light isn't accurate. The reason that FM broadcasting is superior to AM is that FM broadcast occupies a lot more bandwidth and has a high modulation index. Narrowband FM (walkie talkies) sounds worse than AM broadcasts. AM's narrow bandwidth limits the frequency response to about 5 Khz vs FM's 15 Khz. </p>
<p>Analog TV used wideband AM for the picture and FM for the sound. </p>
<p>In a fair comparison between AM and FM using the same bandwidth, FM would win because FM receivers use limiters to remove the effect of noise amplitude from the signal. FM can still suffer from noise, but its spectrum is less annoying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of frequency bandwidth (in this case measured in KHz) like data bandwidth.  There's 3x more bandwidth on an FM channel than there is an AM channel. A 192 Kbps MP3 sounds a whole lot better than a 64 Kbps MP3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AM broadcast signals have to fit in a smaller space than FM broadcasts do. If you make the space for FM smaller it sounds just as bad as AM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His comparison is accurate for radio. AM radio waves pick up a lot of interference on the way while FM is more resilient. Stand right outside an AM radio station and most won't be able to tell the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a strong AM signal can be as quiet as an FM one. However AM broadcasts have much lower frequency response than FM (5Khz vs 15 Khz). That is a function of the allowed bandwidth and does not improve no matter how close to the transmitter you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't ELI5, but the first correct answer to the original question: &quot;why FM sounds better.&quot;</p>
<p>FM may have better noise rejection, and AM may go longer distances, but those aren't as big of a deal to sound quality as the allocated bandwidth.  </p>
<p>Governments decided FM would sound better when they gave each FM channel more bandwidth when compared to AM.</p></div>		</li>
