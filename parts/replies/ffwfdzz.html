			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the torque converter is an automatic car's equivalent of a clutch. It's always engaged, but it provides just barely enough torque when you're not pushing on the gas that you can overcome it with your brakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is to much resistant, for example standing on the breaks the torque converter disconnects the crank shaft from the transmission. When you release the brake it reconnects them just like releasing the clutch in a manual car...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of automatic.</p>
<p>Standard Autos (epicyclic Type) and CVTs typically use a Torque Converter in place of a clutch.  This is kinda like a fan (impeller) in oil directly connected to the engine, which drives another fan (turbine) in the oil purely from the movement of the oil. The turbine is connected directly to the gearbox.</p>
<p>This allows the engine and the gearbox to move at different speeds but at the expense of creating a resistance proportional to the difference in speeds between the two. This is the reason for OP’s question. It’s called creep and is really useful for slow speed control. </p>
<p>If they didn’t do this, the engine would stall every time the car stopped.</p>
<p>DSGs / DCTs and semi automatics have normal type clutches like in a manual car. However these clutches are computer controlled. They tend to be engineered to drive the same as an automatic for consistency and ease of use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Automatic does in general not have clutches but a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_converter" target="_blank">Torque_converter</a> where you transfer the rotation hydraulically. The input and output can move independently of each other so if you apply breaks to the wheels the engine can still rotate.</p>
<p>The car move when you do not press the accelerator with an internal combust engine because even when it is not pressed down you provide to the engine so it can still on.  It happens both on the automatic and manual engine. It is more likely to happen on an automatic because you only need to stop pressing the break in any way, on a manual you need to stop pressing the break if it is pressed and gently let off the foot of the clutch. If you release the clutch to quickly the engine will just stop. The same is true of the force to move the car is higher then what the engine provides at idle like on an uphill incline.</p>
<p>In some modern engines, they do cut the fuel when no accelerator is pressed and you are stationary after a short time. This is to reduce fuel usage. You need a larger starter engine to get it going quickly when you start to move again.<br />
I assume that the control system look at engine temperature so it only stops the engine is if is warm and is easy to start and not if is cold and hard to start.</p></div>		</li>
