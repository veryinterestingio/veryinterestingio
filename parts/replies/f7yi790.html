			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that its not necessarily sadness but stress or high emotion states that trigger tears/watery eyes. Thus sadness has the ability to create these feelings much easier but even happiness can put some people into these high stress high emotion states if strong enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone pointed out that tears are there, when something scary or unexpected is happening to us.</p>
<p>Well, extreme happiness is one such thing.</p>
<p>You don't expect a large amount of happiness in a single go, you expect it when you need it the most.</p>
<p>But, things like becoming a millionaire, winning a grand competition, getting that dream job etc are all unexpected circumstances and which you are not so sure of experiencing, the things which you achieve after a large amount of hardwork, these things often feels like a burden being removed and thus tears flow out.</p>
<p>Becoming a parent, holding your child at these moments you are scary AF and don't want to lose these moments, thus again triggering tears.</p></div>		</li>
