			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite Taoist writer Benjamin Hoffman(The Tao of Pooh) explained it best: often times scholars hold their knowledge above people simply to just hold themselves higher. If we made information easily understood for anyone, maybe there would be more educated people? But alas, we must explain things in such a way that a large portion of people can't bother with it. </p>
<p>OP this was an amazing response! Thank you for taking the time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also not quite correct. It's not current that hurts you, but energy (which is Voltage x Current x Time) In a Van De Graaf, the time is tiny, meaning a high voltage and high current delivers very little energy to do any damage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Always be cautious of people who tell you &quot;it's the current that kills you&quot; Because current is dependant on Voltage and resistance. You can't have a high Voltage and low current unless the Resistance is very low (which a Human isn't) So if you pass a voltage over a Human, it <em>will</em> deliver a relatively high current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last section is not quite correct.  </p>
<p>You say high voltage is the result of low current and low resistance, but V=I*R. If current and resistance are both low, voltage is low. If Voltage is constant, higher resistance means lower current, just like more rocks blocking a river means it flows slower.  </p>
<p>To address the death from 120V in the original question..<br />
The human body is around 100,000 ohms when dry. 120 V / 100k ohms = 1.2mA<br />
This is a small amount of current. You'll feel it, but it won't kill you. Above 10mA <strong>really</strong> starts to hurt. 100-200mA is death.<br />
The human body when wet is around 1,000 ohms. This will deliver the 120mA needed to kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't quite answer the question and makes it seem like ohms law doesn't apply.</p>
<p>&quot;but if my body's resistance stays the same and according to ohms law a higher voltage means a higher current how does the lower voltage kill me but a higher one doesn't&quot;</p>
<p>It's because it's not just voltage or current that matters but also energy. The initial voltage and current of a Vander graph generator are very much lethal <strong>if they were constant</strong>, but as soon as the electricity has a path to ground the voltage quickly drops. The voltage (and by ohms law also the current) drops quickly enough that not enough energy is dissipated in your body to be lethal.</p>
<p>If voltage is the potential of the water to flow and current is the rate it is flowing then energy is like how much water there is to flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The current will be very high for a really really short time, then it basically runs out of electrons. The van de graph slowly sores high-potential electrons (it has capacitance), and dumps them all at once when it arcs. It's like how getting hit by a ping-pong ball going 100 mph would sting a little, but getting hit by a train going 100 mph will squish you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what can we measure that is different about a a Van de Graaf generator from a wall outlet? Like a wall outlet has 10,000 of X but a Van de Graaf generator only has 10 of X so it isn't dangerous. What is the unit of X here? It's not resistance, voltage or current that we talked about. But it is something that affects them it seems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power. If power supplied is constant, a higher voltage produces a smaller current. If you have an infinite resistance load i.e. no load, there is no current and the voltage can be as high as it wants. Once you attach a load e.g. your body, current begins to flow. The current draw drops the voltage significantly because it's not high power. </p>
<p>A wall outlet can supply many Amps (I don't care to find the specific amount; small appliances are allowed to pull a max of 12 A) at 120 V. The power isn't really the limiting factor but the circuit breaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charge, specifically the number of electrons. In an outlet, you have a constant stream of electrons from a power station. In a Van De Graaf, it's a very small amount stored in the capacitance of the generator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When talking about fault currents, there’s a term called “bus stiffness”, a bus simply being a point on an electrical system. The stiffness of a bus refers to how close it will stay to its design voltage during high current events like faults. If a bus has low stiffness then the voltage will sag quickly under a fault and the current will follow suit (such as with the Van der Graaf generator). If a bus has high stiffness then the voltage will sag only slightly under a fault and the current will remain high until something interrupts it (such as the wall outlet, since its voltage has the inertia of the whole electrical grid behind it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not the case. The current produced by a vandegraff is huge. But the pulse is so short lived that not much energy is transferred in total</p>
<p>Vandegraffs are effectively large air capacitors and they have a low impedance and thus can support large currents.</p>
<p>Their capacitance however is small so the total charge stored is low</p></div>		</li>
