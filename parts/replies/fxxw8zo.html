			<div class="markdown"><p>On point one, yes, losing water weight is a temporary measure. </p>
<p>From what I recall in anatomy &amp; physiology, you have a finite number of fat cells. When you lose weight you’re causing those cells to shrink, but not disappear. This is also why if you have the fat cells removed (liposuction), then gain weight again, you will sometimes see the area be lumpier. Because there’s less cells to hold everything. Like trying to fit 4 bags worth of groceries into 1. </p>
<p>(Again this is all just memory from classes taken a few years ago so I am open to correction.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost on the right track :) </p>
<p>Fat cells can be created, but not destroyed (they just atrophy). That's why it's easier to become overweight again if you previously have been. The liposuction thing is partially correct (the fat cells get removed), but it's also to do with connective tissues, and uneven distribution of fat cells, not because there isn't enough, as new ones can still be created.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>> you have a finite number of fat cells. </p>
<p>AFAIK, that's not quite right.  It's mostly right, but there is still some degree of new fat cells created when you gain weight and vice-versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to be pedantic here because they're using similar vague thinking. &quot;Low-nutritional&quot; doesn't really mean anything. Are those nutrients macro or micro? </p>
<p>On the topic of weight, calories matter the most and is then followed by macro partitioning. Micronutrients, although necessary for overall good health, would have virtually no impact on weight except in extreme cases.</p>
<p>A eating pizza after a run is eating a high amount of &quot;nutrition&quot;. It just happens to be more calories than they need and poorly partitioned to avor mostly carbs and fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. The % body fat is literally the % of your body weight that is made up of lipids. It is NOT counting the % of your body weight made up of adipose tissue. That is entirely different. It counts the triglyceride droplets in adipocytes, the myelin sheaths of nerves, and even the phospholipids of cell membranes.</p>
<p>Your &quot;lean mass&quot;, or nonfat mass, is mostly water. % water will vary substantially with body composition. That's how bioelectrical impedance analysis devices work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This!!!</p>
<p>All methods of measuring body fat percentage are literally calibrated against liquefying a corpse, centrifuging it, and seeing how much lipid separates out! (Okay okay, I don't know if they've done this with literal whole bodies, but it's the basic idea).</p>
<p>Adipose cells do contain water, but not that much, it's basically a thin layer of cytoplasm (which is mostly water) around a giant lipid vesicle. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Blausen_0012_AdiposeTissue.png" target="_blank">Here's an artist's conception from wikimedia; the white is fat, the blue is cytoplasm and cell wall</a>.</p>
<p>The actual answer is that everybody is an individual, and somebody with 50% body fat is a remarkable outlier, and yes, thus inherently has a lower percentage of water in their body (by both volume and weight) compared to a median human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adipocytes are about 70% lipid, nearly 30% water.</p>
<p>If you're 50% bodyfat you're about 71% fat cells. I.e., if you're 350 lbs and 50% bodyfat your 0% fat weight would be about 100 lbs.</p></div>		</li>
