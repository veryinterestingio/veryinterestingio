<p>it's that modern birds (including chickens) are literally the descendants of dinosaurs.</p>

<p>One small correction:  they aren't just the &quot;descendants&quot; of dinosaurs, they literally <em>are</em> dinosaurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So many times <del>archeologists</del> paleontologists find a dinosaur skeleton and see another physiological connection to modern birds, and I keep hoping they find a vocal connection that indicates the largest dinosaurs featured some kind of mega-call or mega-song. Like blue jays definitely sound like shrunken versions of what we imagine a dinosaur sounded like, but I'm hoping/terrified that 50 million years ago there was a deep mockingbird song you could hear from eight miles away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright. This just confirmed I have no idea what the hell Dinosaur means. I figured if you were an animal and you were alive back then then you were a dinosaur. Now you’re telling me there are dinos, and there were things that were next door neighbors to Dino’s but considered something else entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, I see your confusion.  Dinosaurs were a specific group of animals.  They were specific families of reptiles that shared some similarities in their body structure, especially in their hip/legs (someone more informed can probably share the specifics, but it's probably not important for an ELI5).  But living alongside the dinosaurs at that time were gazillions of other living animals - early mammals, fish, amphibians, insects, crocodilians, etc.  </p>
<p>Sharks, famously, are considered &quot;living fossils&quot; because the sharks that were present in the oceans in the time of dinosaurs probably didn't look all that different from the sharks living today - many species' evolutionary paths have hardly changed them in all those millions of years.  If you found a shark fossil from 66 million years ago, we wouldn't call it a &quot;dinosaur&quot; even though it's from the time we call the Age of Dinosaurs - it's just a really, really old fish.</p>
<p>So modern birds are the last living descendants of those specific groups of reptiles that we call dinosaurs.  All of the creatures on this planet can trace their ancestry back to other animals that were alive at the time, but only birds can claim relation to the dinos.</p></div>		</li>
