			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response. Funny i came across this, i quit drinking, or at least am trying, since Tuesday. This morning im sober as a judge, but have been hungover every morning for 3 years. So right now my body is thinking it should be hungover, so i feel pretty poopy. By lunch time the fake hangover should turn into a craving, then the battle begins. But i never knew about the homeostasis being the reason. Thanks. </p>
<p>Edit: reddit, your the fuckin best. I didnt expect the love and support, thanks a shit ton. I hope my two cents on what happens to the body <em>after</em> it has built up a massive tolerance to something can help someone. Cheers ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also trying to quit drinking.  Went from daily to taking a couple days off a week to drinking on the weekends.  I still have my moments of weakness but I absolutely refuse to drink during the week anymore.  This past week I bought a half pint after work and instantly regretted it.  Ended up throwing it out the window on my way home.  The worst is the weekends and getting invited to do things that involve drinking.  I used to be able to have only a couple, but for the past few years I just keep drinking until I get tired enough to go bed.  And that almost always means blacking out.  I wish it was simpler but it's not.  Good luck to you my friend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you sir! Im where your at, trying to get through a full week without. I was just at a monster truck throwdown event and there was beer everywhere. Its funny how much easier resisting something is once the decision has been made. Like, a week ago, i would have went knowing that yes i am drinking beer tonight. But today it only crossed my mind once and was easy to push away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isnt advice, but i drank for 4-5 years. Dont remember when i started anymore.</p>
<p>I quit thrice. First was when i decided, fuck it, i shall. Told myself ill be the best gamer ever (drunks arent pro gamers), and gaming solved it for me. Well had a relapse when parents told me to fuck off with gaming.</p>
<p>Tried again when i hit rockbottom poor. The kind i couldnt afford to buy food to eat. That was pretty suicidal. </p>
<p>Now recently, as of may, im quitting cuz uhm... &quot;Its cool to quit&quot;. </p>
<p>Weird but it's uhm, nice to tell people &quot;oh i used to be an alcoholic, ive quit for a month now, so thanks for the drinks, can i have a mocktail?&quot;</p>
<p>I feel idiotic bragging, but sometimes what keeps you off the bottle could be as dumb as looking cool. Hahahaha.</p>
<p>Cheers to us to stay clean!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey dude I quit 3 years ago. I was full blown so I went to rehab, and the first few days are so rough. Then the next few weeks the endorphins kick in and you're on that pink cloud and you feel incredible. Then you come down and have to remember how to deal with normal ass emotions. It's difficult but it's easier to do it with help. Be it AA, smart recovery, group or individual therapy, just remember other people are the key to individual sobriety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congratulations on taking the first step!  I have seen firsthand how much alcohol can tear apart your life, and how challenging it can be to quit.  I hope you have the mental strength and conviction that many in my family have lacked.  I wish you the best of luck, and I hope that you have people around you who are helping to lift you up and get through this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.. happened to a friend of mine, she started hitting the bottle after her divorce, got fired and spent the next 5 years in increasingly shorter sober periods. She passed away recently.  I didn't ask how but likely suicide after she lost her house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good example of how your perception is affected without realizing it is smell. You never smell yourself or your house unless something is really different (new deodorant or dog popped in the living room, etc). But the moment you walk into a strangers house, bam weird smells everywhere.</p>
<p>Also vision and this one is always fascinating to me. What you see in your peripherals when it comes to stationary objects is just an illusion created by your brain. It focus all eyesight towards your central gaze and only movement is filtered through your peripheral vision. Which is why it can be so frightening when you look at a coat rack in the dark from the corner of your eye as opposed to straight on. Your brain isn't expecting &quot;human-shaped object&quot; So it throws off your balance of what you're used to and what you're not used to.</p>
<p>A note on painkillers too: your body actually gets used to them because, since they bind to endorphin receptors, the body stops creating endorphins on it's own. That's why oftentimes quitting narcotics can cause more pain than you originally had before, since your body has stopped producing it's own drug that fights the more minor pain that we don't feel all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>peripheral vision is an enormous amount of our vision too. i think the non-peripheral part of our vision is about the size of your thumbnail if you hold your hand out as far away as you can from your face. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except, not everything. Barring medical intervention, it takes decades for the body to remove the mercury it is exposed to. </p>
<p>Continued exposure to small levels of mecury doesn't build up a tolerance, it just builds up more mercury and more damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that because mercury sticks around in your body? Most substances are either broken down or expelled from the body,but mercury is absorbed, but not expected the normal way (urine, feces or sweat). </p></div>		</li>

<p>I also commented describing how conscious awareness of the effects will decrease but not the actual impacts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think psychological effects will become more externally apparent but the person's awareness is what decreases. The body is still dying regardless but there will be tolerance. First you'll have the most mindblowing anxiety but later it gets normalized but anxious behaviors will continue almost like unconscious. </p></div>		</li>
