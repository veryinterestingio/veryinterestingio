			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this that while this is true and ten years ago might have even be prevalent for things like social media this is generally not true for anything but the simplest of websites. I am pretty sure that no bank will have ever had online banking that was vulnerable to this sort of attack.<br />
Now-a-days any website worth a damn uses encryption for at least their login details and most now force it for all communications meaning, so long as there are no security blunders, the above attack will not work because all the messages are encrypted and can only be decrypted by their intended recipient.<br />
If this encryption were to be broken then the internet is effectively broken as all online commerce and sensitive transactions would be open to interception.  </p>
<p>As a footnote that is not to say there are not ways that someone on your wifi cannot hack you but it is a lot harder than it used to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, encryption (https) is commonly used.  So when you're listening on the airwaves, you'll see all the data but it won't make sense.</p>
<p>However, this assumes that the wifi network you're connected to is trustworthy.  If you're in a bar or hotel and you're connected to the first random &quot;FREE WI-FI&quot; network that your phone finds, this won't necessarily be true.  In which case, the wifi network might be running what's known as a man-in-the-middle attack.  There's an encrypted connection between your device and the wifi network.  And there's another encrypted connection between the wifi network and your bank.   In the middle, the operator of the rogue wifi network can see everything you do.</p>
<p>Have a look, for example, at a device called the Wifi Pineapple.  Makes it very easy to set up a fake free wifi network, which anyone can connect to, and which gives you full visibility into whatever users are doing.  Even when the users are visiting https protected sites.</p>
<p>The wifi pineapple has another neat trick up its sleeve.  When you walk into the bar, your phone sends out a signal to the local wifi saying &quot;are you the network I connected to last time?&quot;  Because if it is, it won't bother asking whether you want to connect again this time.  It'll just do it.  The Pineapple answers &quot;yes&quot; to all these queries automatically.  So if there's a Pineapple in the room, chances are that most devices will be connected to it and the users won't even know that they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually referring to SSL encryption on the sites themselves rather than the WiFi encryption. Mitm attacks will result in a certificate error unless you can install a root certificate on the users device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are confusing WiFi encryption with HTTPS.</p>
<p>HTTPS gives end-to-end encryption between your computer and the device holding the private key (Usually web server or Load Balancer). A man in the middle can't understand this traffic.<br />
Encryption between your Computer and the WiFi router can stop people receiving the signal from reading any unencrypted data.</p>
<p>Both can be, and are likely to be used simultaneously (WPA and WPA2 are pretty standard defaults on WiFi these days)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they spoof the root certificates? How do they sign the fake SSL certs if they don't have access to those? Most modern browsers are going to warn the shit out of you if there's ANY sort of certificate problem (anybody whose certificate has expired can tell you that). Sure, some people might click through and keep going, but it's pretty clear when it happens.</p>
<p>DNS requests, sure, though those are starting to get encryption, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the big issue with HTTPS everywhere is that even highly technical people (developers and lower tier security auditors/pen testers) believe it's enough.</p>
<p>Nope, it's not! While in the SSL tunnel nothing can be altered, before and after it, it can!</p>
<p>While your browser will display the lock etc, once your data enter the tunel, you have no control on what is sitting after that tunel.</p>
<p>Perhaps your request do some hops in various systems in the remote site. (Common with ESB!)
And perhaps it is now clear text because the systems need to work with the content (auditing, routing internally...ESB!).</p>
<p>So, if one can break into that, put his own service to alter the request, every other system will comply with the tempered data!</p>
<p>Now, if loggin is protected with WSSE/HMAC and the body signed properly, any system can check that nothing has been tempered and the alien service can &quot;only&quot; inspect the data!</p>
<p>Need more security ? Here comes a second layer of encoding!</p>
<p>Yep, SSL is not the final answer!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree however the attacks you are talking about are extremely sophisticated and while I wouldn't say they should be ignored are not the highest priority.
For instance much of the mitigation for this can come from the vendors such as Aws who can implement end to end encryption in their systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure i understand what you mean by &quot; So, if one can break into that&quot;.</p>
<p>Break into what? If someone &quot;breaks into what is sitting after the tunnel&quot;, then wouldn't they likely already have access to all the private data they're after? Or are you saying it's possible that someone can hack into a company's servers, intercept/decrypt their incoming encrypted requests, but not access their internal encrypted data?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true. You can have logs that store information (any parameters in the url) and cached pages and browser history that can be referenced later.</p>
<p>Also, if the session ID doesnt expire (like how you never have to resign into an application like gmail), an attacker is able to use that session id until the server deletes the session id.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They should expire and you be logged out if inactive. Your bank ought to have some sort of 2fa making an attempt to  gain access harder. Though there are ways to steal your 2fa and password etc, but requires access to your hardware and setting up a clone of your banks login page etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally not, mostly these interceptions happen live. But if you are authenticated with a certain site and this is somehow stored locally in a cookie which isn’t expired yet it might be possible to send a request with your authenticated cookie. To do this the hacker will make you try to visit a site or click something which will execute said request. This is known as a cross-site request forgery attack.</p>
<p>Also, be very cautious when connecting to public wifi networks. A hacker can set up a network with the same name or something like it and you will be connecting to his device instead of the wifi you intended to connect to. He might or might not pass it through to the intended network but from that moment all your communication is intercepted. This is called a man in the middle attack and isn’t even that hard to execute. There are even devices, e.g. pineapple who do most work for you.</p>
<p>A tip is when in public use mobile data as much as you can, certainly for mobile banking or other sensitive online activity.</p></div>		</li>
