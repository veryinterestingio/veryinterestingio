			<div class="markdown"><p>I make up a story that I tell myself. It's just one long story, and I pick up where I left off the night before (as best I remember) and add a little more to it each time. </p>
<p>In the beginning it would take a while of me going through the story to fall asleep, now I'm so comfortable with that story it takes moments to fall asleep once I start it.</p>
<p>I've now been adding to this same story for almost ten years worth of bed times.</p>
<p>I think it gives my mind something to focus on, instead of all of the other stuff going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is different. Back in the day, my sister could fall asleep mid sentence, and it took me hours. </p>
<p>I have since trained myself that bed means sleep. No phone, no tv... Get into bed and unless otherwise stimulated, I fall asleep quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I had a shirt made by some cool unknown gen x company called drunken monkey. A teacher saw the shirt and said to me, just like the idle brain! The teacher further explained to me that the idle brain is like a drunken monkey, wandering from room to room with no real aim or purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My trick now is to turn the TV on, and leave it just loud enough that I can hear it but not well so I really have to focus. I also don't watch, I just close my eyes and try to figure out what's happening. It  works best with a show or movie I'm familiar with, so that I'm not trying to watch it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some tvs (like my Vizio) have a blank screen option in the sleep timer menu that kills the panel and just plays audio.  Its a lifesaver trying to sleep next to my pregnant wife who apparently needs about 5 times more air then she did before baby. Like sleeping next to a air matteress pump.... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Works well using YouTube as well!  Which is also great because it's like a timer is on so then my computer goes to sleep some time after the video stops playing so it's not running all night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I count to ten over and over again. Don’t have a tv in my room and have found counting works. Falling asleep on the couch with the tv on is a breeze though. I think the counting might work in the same way? You’re just focused on that one task? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds pretty reasonable. I get bored very easily, but I love puzzles, so I like math riddles or brain teasers, since they hold my attention better than counting. Either I work out an answer or I fall asleep; either way I'm happy </p></div>		</li>
