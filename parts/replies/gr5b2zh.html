			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that seems to make sense. Bread has a leavening agent, so there is more surface area contact with air. I wonder if there is a way to compare the moisture level of the two products. Bread seems more moist, but I think it is really the airiness that gives that impression.</p>
<p>The fridge significantly affects the flavor and texture of both bread and tortillas, so I try to avoid that. Tortillas keep at room temperature for months so I will continue to leave them out. Thanks for the feedback.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat content is the biggest factor. Tortillas are made with lard. Brioche has a ton of butter and will last weeks. A baguette has none and will go hard in a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I have frozen baguettes and break off a piece,dump warm water on it,microwave it a scant minute,take out when soft.dump cinnomen,Splenda,diet cream cheese and a little hi quality honey. DESSERT WITH COFFEE ! Freezing and microwaving very hard bread is fun and experimental.Sometimes I just bless an unfrozen baquette with good extra Virgin Olive Oil after microwaving..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that!  I have always wondered how brioche rolls stay good for so long.  Even the sell by date is up to a few weeks out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on how long you take to eat a loaf of bread. If itâ€™s just you, invest in a quality bread box and keep it dark and cool in your pantry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wanted to compare the moisture content, find out from the nutrition label the total amount of carbs, fiber, fat and protein in each. Then subtract that from the total weight of the serving, and what is left over is (mostly) the water. If you live in a country where the serving size is by weight, it shouldn't be too hard. If you live in the US, you have to convert some things from serving to total package weight, and some things from Imperial to metric, and FML</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No! Keep fresh bread in a wooden bread box. Plastic bags make it go bad faster. It also definitely doesn't need the fridge unless it's very warm and humid (I.e. a really hot summer). If you have more bread than you can eat in a week, freeze it to keep it soft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the bread box vs plastic bag is I think a question of shelf life vs quality. The airtight plastic bag will definitely make it go bad faster, but will keep it the freshest. The bread box will keep it good longer but it might get stale faster, I think. So it kind of depends how fast your household goes through a loaf of bread. </p>
<p>Also homemade bread without preservatives will go bad super fast so then I would say wooden box.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I assume you are using some other metric besides fresh/stale to measure quality? Otherwise how would something be kept good longer while going stale faster?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stale bread makes the best french toast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ELI5 please, why would bread stored in a bag in a cold place go moldy faster than it would in a room-temperature box that is far from airtight?</p></div>		</li>
