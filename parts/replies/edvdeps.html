			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine 1km square of central New York City, that's around 20 by 20 blocks.
Now imagine going into every building, every level and every room in that area.
Considering the height of the buildings as well that's less than an eighth of 1 cubic volume.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A 1km square would only be around 12.5 blocks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 km^3 is about 400,000 olympic swimming pools. Lake Erie is about 500 cubic kilometers.  The oceans are millions of lake Eries in volume.  I hesitate to even say how much of Lake Erie has actually been &quot;explored&quot; in the way we talk about exploring the oceans, but it isn't going to be 100% even if the lake is fairly shallow for the most part and been the object of a lot of diving expeditions.  They still find wrecks on the bottom once in a while, I think. A number of known wrecks have not yet been identified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A follow-up question to that: what does explore mean in this context? Say you have a cubic kilometer of water in front of you.  At what point does it turn into &quot;explored&quot; from &quot;unexplored&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
