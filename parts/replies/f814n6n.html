			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to remember our adaptions for endurance. We are mostly hairless and sweat so that we can lose excess heat from running. Having thick insulating skin would be a problem when what you want is to get blood vessels as close to the cooling effects of sweat evaporation as possible.</p>
<p>Who needs thick skin when you can just run away from your problems, that's my motto.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we are endurance runners - we aren't going to be outrunning any predators. But if a predator shows up, and is met with 10 humans, wielding sharpened sticks or spears, maybe even one with a burning torch, bellowing and stomping, maybe even advancing slowly. Well, thats going to be enough to drive off anyone looking for an easy meal - no predator wants to get injured, its basically a death sentence in the animal kingdom. As a whole, our best defence mechanism as pack animals was always intimidation, much like larger herd animals like elephants or cows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was also our most effective hunting strategy. Humans do two things better than just about any other animals. Stamina, especially on warm flatlands, and intellect. Turns out, those two make up for quite a lot of other shortcomings. Most other things we're pretty average or below in for a mammal of our size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also consider the fact that we're bipedal, we stand as tall as grizzley bears while weighing like 10x less, but most animals don't realize that we're that much less powerful, they just see a bunch of really tall apes, screaming, with fire and spears</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ape_hypothesis" target="_blank">aquatic ape hypothesis</a> has been characterized as pseudoscience. It remains highly controversial and is generally more popular with the lay public than with scientists; it is generally ignored by anthropologists.</p></div>		</li>
