<p>Not OP. Not an EE. But here's a link discussing this often confused topic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way of thinking about the current and electrons is to imagine a pipe filled with marbles.<br />
The marbles fit right into the pipe and are stacked next to each other without space between them.
If you push an additional marble into the pipe - it only moves as fast as your hand - all the marbles move at this slow speed - but on the other end of the pipe a marble falls out as soon as you push your marble into your end of the pipe. (plus some light speed lag / not zero space between marbles / not zero space to the wall of the pipe, etc...)  </p>
<p>The same is true if you push on a rod (a really really long rod) it will bend a bit because of inertia (how much depends on stiffness and length) and even though you only move the pipe 1 cm in one second - the other end can push a button with more or less light speed.</p></div>		</li>
