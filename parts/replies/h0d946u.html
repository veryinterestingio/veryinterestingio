			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for the great answer.
I think I was able to follow everything, but I still have a question.
I understand that the EUA requires everything to say that a vaccine is safe, produced well, and effective.
I understand that the BLA is a big amount of work and very formal procedure. But it seems to me that all that information that needs to go into the Form FDA 356th is essential to evaluate the safety of the vaccine, right? So, wasn't it already made available for the EUA? Or is it just that the information was handled, but that in this formal way?
Also about the scheduled inspection of the facilities - doesn't this happen for an EUA? I mean, it would be legit to be worried to get a vaccine from a company which facilities were not inspected? But maybe I'm interpreting this wrong (?)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup. There's a duplication. The same information has to be submitted for both. </p>
<p>The difference is like a courthouse wedding vs. a 300-guest wedding. They both <em>fundamentally</em> require the same things (a bride, a groom, not related, not coerced, wanting to be married, witnesses, an officiant, etc etc.) but the 300-guest wedding comes with a lot of extra formality.  </p>
<p>In general the 300-guest wedding is preferred, but if a wedding needs to happen, and all the elements are there and verified, a courthouse elopement is fine.</p>
<p>Lack of hors d'oeuvres and a $5,000 gown doesn't make it not a wedding. </p>
<p>In this case -- the couple is getting married immediately at the courthouse for health insurance purposes, then also having a massive church wedding for the families in six months.</p>

<p>Manufacturing safety and consistency record is a pre-requisite. </p>
<p>&quot;Part of FDA’s evaluation of an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine includes evaluation of the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information for the vaccine. Sufficient data should be submitted to ensure the quality and consistency of the vaccine product. FDA will use all available tools and information, including records reviews, site visits, and previous compliance history, to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the wedding analogy, but it doesn't really get at why the BLA takes so much longer.  Like...I see the list of stuff and it's a longer list, but I don't see why it's a longer process?  Are they just like sitting on each item in the list?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything needed for the BLA was already submitted for the EUA except long term follow up (6 months). Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J have all submitted requests for full authorization for the 16+ age group.</p>
<p>Really, the only difference is the need to go through the absolutely mind numbingly slow and tedious dance with the FDAs bureaucrats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget that there are usually follow-up questions from regulatory agencies after the BLA filing. It could be questions about data or the methods used to manufacture the vaccine or something even more mundane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last sentence holds the key. Is it literally the case that the full-bore bureaucratic review is designed in such a way that it cannot, or will not, tease out any subtle or heretofore undetected flaw in the vaccines; that, in fact, we already know as much as the FDA would ever care to?  If “yes” then perhaps the very cautious FDA process has been a bit over engineered. If “no” then what kinds of potential risks remain (even if very remote)?</p>
<p>Thanks for this whole discussion in any event -</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget expensive!  Can't have a process where anyone could discover, produce, and sell an effective and safe drug.  We need to make it take 10 years and millions of dollars so only J&amp;J, Pfizer, etc, can afford it.  </p>
<p>I'm ok with requiring a 6mo follow-up, but I am not ok with the number of drugs that could be helping people, but are stuck in red tape for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I would add to the post by u/lupicia is that drug stability requirements were likely shortened in this EUA.</p>
<p>Typically you have enough data from clinical programs and pilot batches to establish that the product is stable (reading back to potency and safety) over a specific period of time, in order to establish expiration dates, and you would hit your preferred timing on the first submission.</p>
<p>For this hyper speed process, and knowing the vaccines wouldn't be just sitting around very long, they likely only submitted something like 6 months expiry on the product, and will be submitting for a full year or more on the full approval.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important (I feel) addition I'd like to make is that the EUA is also manufacturing site dependent, and each individual site must receive it's own EUA before vaccine material produced at that site can be distributed to patients. </p>
<p>Generally there are three high level processes to vaccine production that can occur, and they can occur all at one site or different sites or some combination thereof.  That is: drug substance, drug product, and packaging.  Each process is approved, but each site doing these activities must be approved to do it appropriately, separate from any other site.  In other words, even if the vaccine and process is proven to meet the previously described criteria, the individual manufacturing sites need each prove they have the process and controls in place to produce vaccine product in a consistent, qualified manner before it is allowed to hit the market.</p>
<p>For example, the publicized issues with Emergent producing J&amp;J's vaccine drug substance.  </p>
<p>FDA provided audit observations.  Until these issue are proven to the FDA to be systematically resolved, they will not provide an EUA for Emergent material.  Therefore J&amp;J vaccine material produced at Emergent's site cannot be supplied to patients.  Even if they do provide EUA approval to Emergent, any batches produced prior to the observations at Emergent that are not proven to meet that criteria cannot be distributed to patients (important distinction: Not just that there were no known issues, but that they can prove that the audit observation concerns did not impact those particular batches).  In other words, those batches that cannot be proven to meet the criteria (even after changes are implemented) will be scrapped.</p>
<p>TL;DR Only sites that have filed for and have been approve for EUA within the supply chain can be supplied for patient use.</p>
<p>EDIT: I note you touch on this at a high level below, but I think this is important to make a distinction, so I'll leave it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was going to add.  It sucks that that facility wasn't able to put vaccines into the supply chain but, the fact that their deficiencies were accounted for is important.  The FDA remains just as stringent with eua product as they do with licensed ones.  EUA doesn't mean anything goes, it just mean everything goes faster.  They weren't ready to produce high quality product there so the FDA won't let them until they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is partially true. The EUA's for vaccines were very carefully monitored and audited - with trials meticulously run. </p>
<p>This was NOT the case for the EUAs issued for a myriad of testing protocols, many of which had questionable efficacy and EUA documents provided by companies with little to no IVD experience.</p></div>		</li>
