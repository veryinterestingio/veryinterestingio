			<div class="markdown"><p>Dc, the motor in your house that's turning is doing so because the top of it is constantly being pushed, like a person pushing the wheels of a wheelchair. One direction of force (push wheel from back to front, repeat) keeps the system going.</p>
<p>Ac, the motor in your house that's turning is doing so because it's being pushed two alternating directions, like the wheels on a steam train. First push down, wheel turns, then push up, wheel keeps turning. Down up down up down up. </p>
<p>Some really clever clogs figured out how to get ac to become dc. You have push down up down up... But need it to be push down down down down... Well, you make it like a bicycle. You push down on the left, then on the right (whilst left spins back up) and repeat. By basically switching sides in time with the up down force, it can be changed into effectively always down force, helping the wheel to keep spinning forwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To extend the &quot;rotating axle&quot; analogy, have a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_and_pinion" target="_blank">rack and pinion</a>.  The rotational force is now a directional force.  Some things that run on DC need to be pushed, rather than rotated.  The transistors in electronics are DC, and act like push-button toggle switches.  While pushed (or energized) electricity (or &quot;force&quot;) is now passed on, pushing other transistors.  Two to five transistors in a particular configuration can answer any binary question, and out of that comes Angry Birds.</p>
<p>... in this analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good analogy.</p>
<p>As an engineer myself, who has struggled with electrical engineering, this is the first time things have made sense to me.</p>
<p>Books would usually answer this question as, &quot;sure there are no electrons that ever leave the cable, but the energy does.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I loved it when a book went &quot;because conservation of energy&quot; and left it at that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me it’s more the idea of the “holes” that the electrons move into, like a bubble moving through liquid sort of.</p>
<p>At least that explains why the - side of the connection has the electrons and the + side is the direction “they’re moving to” (they do eventually move, but it is very slow).</p></div>		</li>
