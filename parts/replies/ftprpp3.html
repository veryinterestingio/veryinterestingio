			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know why some nurses keep looking for the 'right' vein, and sometimes they use terms such as good/bad vein?</p>
<p>i have one very prominent vein on my right arm which I thought would make it easy to extract blood from, but my nurse wasn't quite 'satisfied' with it and kept feeling around my arm before she eventually opted for other arm where my veins are much less visible. And there are nurses who just don't question whichever arm you give them, so I'm kinda perplexed by this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has more to do with the nurse’s confidence level than anything. Their goal is a first-time successful stick so they’ll window-shop until they find the best vein. But the best veins aren’t just visible; the best veins are big and feel kinda rubbery like they have a bit of a bounce when you push on them. My best vein is completely hidden by tattoos but I’ve never had someone miss when starting an IV, even students sticking someone for the first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best vein got so used up it's covered in scar tissue now.. the last nurse that stuck me restabbed the same vein 6 times and wiggled it around before finally going to a different vein.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer, for me atleast. I don't care what it looks like but how it feels when I push it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, superficial veins are often the most visible, but they’re also more mobile and generally smaller. We want to feel good rebound when we palpate the vein, also a straight vein that doesn’t split is obviously better. Personally, I prefer the vein on the lateral aspect of the wrist/forearm for lab draws and forearms for starting IVs. I’m actually worse at placing IVs in the inner elbow (antecubital fossa, AC) because I use it infrequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The “right” vein will vary by nurse and what their preference is and what they are looking to do with it. Just getting labs? Any one will do. Need a big needle to infuse a lot of fluids into, you want a big vein but also not one placed where you naturally bend your arm or the pump will beep. All night long. Also you want to rotate where you poke so that the veins can heal. Always going for the same one will leave scar tissue making it no longer a viable option in the future. So that nice juicy one you can see a good IV nurse might look for another option to save it. But also sometimes big ones you can see have a lot of valves in them making them not good for infusing medication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really depends on alot of factors without seeing the area I couldn't really tell you.one example would be if the vein isn't very straight. I prefer the left arm for ivs bcuz it's a better angle for me and usually less in the patients way ( if they are right handed)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back of the hand is the go to if you cant find one in the antecubital area of the elbow. It is more sensitive than the elbow but it's the next best place to go as far as easy to find veins that you don't have to take clothes off for or worry about other contraindications like diabetes. Most places require a doctor's permission for staff to use legs (which still <em>usually</em> isn't a big deal) because you're more likely to develop clots if there's damage done during the draw/ after iv insertion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm from personal experience. I have shitty veins and the phlebotomists consistently go to the backs of my hands when they give up on the insides of my elbows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has to do with medication dispersion.  Veins drain back to the heart where it is pumped to all areas of the body.  Arterys flow directly to one body area where the medication would sit in concentration possibly damaging the tissue at the very least delaying efficacy onset by having to filter through the capillaries back to the veins and then on to be dispersed.</p></div>		</li>
