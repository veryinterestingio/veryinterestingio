			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars' atmosphere is almost entirely CO2. Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely not CO2. So on Earth you have to not just set up an air intake but separate out the CO2, probably via compression and cryogenic cooling. Then the actual high-temperature splitting happens; <em>Perseverance</em> has to be protected from the heat of this device with gold insulation. It's pretty energy intense on Earth, a lot less so on Mars. Really on Earth efforts usually end with CO2 capture, and no one bothers to crack it, just inject it into the Earth, or artificially form limestone with it. But the problem with Earth isn't engineering or physics; it's telling white guys &quot;no.&quot; In this case you have to tell CO2 polluters to pay up, and you have to tell the entire energy industry to decarbonize (if you release CO2 for energy to capture CO2 you are not an intelligent species). You can't solve this problem with some gadget. You have to tell the ruling class of privileged men they are doing a shit job and need to change or get out of the way.</p></div>		</li>
