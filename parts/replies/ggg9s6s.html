			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider is this is a good thing for the virus. It doesn't &quot;want&quot; to kill people, it wants to replicate. If it could do so in 100% of people it comes in contact to and cause disease in none that would probably be the ideal virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a few ideal strategies, depending on population size and density. What you describe - infectious and innocuous - is the type of strategy the herpes simplex viruses have. People can be infectious at any point after they contract it, most people have by symptoms, and symptoms are dangerous, just annoying. These viruses co-evolved with us in part bc the strategy works well for small populations that are not super dense and don’t come into
contact with other groups that much. But when they do - they might be contagious at any point for the rest of their (not shortened) life and pass it on. </p>
<p>Ebola has the opposite strategy. Very contagious but deadly. You need to spread it quickly bc the person with it dies quickly. In the example above, of a small tribe or hunter gatherer community, it would probably kill just about everyone and the few survivors wouldn’t have it. So when they mix with other groups, it won’t spread through those populations. Ebola relies on dense populations and rapid and frequent population mixing. Both effective strategies in an evolutionary sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But killing the host seems so...counter productive no matter how you slice it. Because 1. The virus usually immobilizes the person, meaning less chance to spreading the virus. 2. It kills the host meaning it will die in due time as well. Also like 1, the host being dead definitely means they aren't moving and spreading the virus. </p>
<p>Just seems it would be 100'x more to be Ebola that has a very small death rate and high transmissible.</p></div>		</li>
