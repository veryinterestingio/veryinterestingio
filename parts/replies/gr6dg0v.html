			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there are some gimmicky systems that rapidly apply slight electric shocks so as to contract and relax the muscles a lot in a short period of time. I think it mimics repeated motion of the specific muscle, but it doesn't provide the same effect as resistance training and would be more akin to extending your arms hundreds or thousands of time without holding anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that Estim was for definition and toning and didn't really affect strength, my query is much more concerned with the use of artificially tearing the muscle tissue in a way that promotes all round improvements in muscle. So if muscle improvement/growth is directly caused by micro tears in the muscle fibers, through (strenuous) use, then is it possible to surgically manipulate/cause micro tears throughout  a particular set of muscles, that would mimic to some degree natural usage, you know so you could just be pretty strong without all the lifting weights, and looking like a twat at the gym</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not directly caused by tearing. The one and absolute rule we know is that muscles need progressive tension to increase in myofibril hypertrophy (the growth of muscle fibers) and actually “muscle damage” is lower on the hierarchy of what causes muscle growth. Progressive tension comes across in a multitude of ways and is still super debated. If you want to look for a rabbit hole of what truly results in muscle growth you would need to look up “mTOR”. I can give you a TL;DR We don’t know everything yet but we roughly know “progressive overload” is the heart of muscle growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So fun thing about “toning” is that that is all related to fat gain/loss. Regardless of if you do a heavy 5x5 or a lighter 3x20, your muscles builds the same (adaptation is different obviously) but it’s the same stuff in there. </p>
<p>The “tone” or “definition” comes from a lower body fat percentage.</p>
<p>In regards to estim, there are certain protocols that can indeed help with muscular development (check out the Russian protocols) but as I mentioned above, the method of muscular adaption doesn’t change the cellular structure or type of muscle, unless you get into the nitty gritty of fiber types.</p>
<p>To answer your original question, I have never heard of anything about surgical growth of muscles due to micro tearing, it may work once but then you’d need surgery again after everything healed. Seems like an endless cascade of surgeries if you wanted to get yolked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t mimic anything, they cause actual muscle contractions. To gain meaningful amounts of muscle you would be contracting muscles as forcefully as with weights</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something about fast muscle fibers and slow muscle fibers, and that young people have more fast muscle fibers. I also recall that you'd have to hook up nodes and stuff inside the muscle so it's not practical to do it via electrical signals.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aging is associated with a fast-to-slow fiber type shift, affecting mostly IIx fibers. As mentioned above, these muscle fiber changes are associated with age-dependent changes in motor unit composition [40].</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think muscle growth (hypertrophy) also requires stimulation of the nervous system that recruits the muscle fibers to contract in a more coordinate/forceful way. Without the neuromuscular adaptation to go along with it I’m not sure how effective surgically tearing a muscle would be for growth (although morbidly curious as to what extent this is true)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're right, it's an adaptation so you would require the stimulus for you body to compensate, if you just cause a bunch of micro tears on your muscle you will basically just produce scar tissue.</p></div>		</li>
