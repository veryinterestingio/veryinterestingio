			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I mean a person can experience stomach symptoms when they eat gluten, that’s about as much proof as I need. That’s a lot more than vaccine to autism connection. A person can say “I am feeling ok. I will eat this bread” then an hour later realize their stomach is upset. If this happens 3-4 times in a couple week period, that’s all the proof I need that the person might not do well with gluten. I have a couple of friends who aren’t diagnosed as celiac and one friend who is. They’re reactions to gluten are wildly different, but it is clear than the ones without celiac still suffer a bit. </p>
<p>Cannot do the same with vaccines and autism.</p></div>		</li>
