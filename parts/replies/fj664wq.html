			<div class="markdown"><p>Also we don't know if given statistics are accurate. Honestly, we almost surely know they aren't. How many people confused corona with regular flu and just stayed at home? How many of them didn't visit a doctor because they don't have money for this? How many cases China didn't report for various reasons? We've already read enough about that &quot;keeping the face&quot; cultural thing. It's horrible to say, but we'll get more accurate numbers in like a month because corona reached numerous other countries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Italy is likely going to be the best indicator of spread.</p></div>		</li>

Not numbers, but shows pretty clearly what the situation might be in the neighbouring countries. Overreaction or not, it's a pretty important thing for Muslims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have family in rural parts of SE Asia that have been telling me there are hundreds of infections that aren’t being reported. The last time we talked about it was almost a month ago, there are probably thousands of unreported cases by now. Maybe even some unreported deaths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the main issue.</p>
<p>In italy we're already hearing the thing break down. We've got our first clues.</p>
<p>- regions asking central government to re-hire medics and nurses that are on pension.</p>
<p>- hospitals telling they have no more space</p>
<p>- regions evaluating reopening of old hospitals and the usage of military ones </p>
<p>- regions buying new ventilators as emergency procedure. </p>
<p>This is going to be bad if it isn't contained this week. In my region alone, if the numbers keep more or less like this, we're going to be done for by the end of the week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly doubt the actual COVID-19 death rate is accurate. The thing about this virus is that there are plenty of people who show either no symptoms or extremely minor symptoms that are mistaken for a cold. Those cases are not being accounted for. The actual death rate is probably well under 1%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The WHO and everyone in the medical field knows that number isn’t accurate. They didn’t get it wrong, but they also know the number is a moving target and the stats are changing day to day. Try not to sound so condescending if you’re not informed.</p></div>		</li>
