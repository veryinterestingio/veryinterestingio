			<div class="markdown"><p>Your second point is an excellent one. It's not like lots of us were sitting there with research ideas in our back pocket thinking, &quot;If only there was an unprecedented shut down of normal human activity, then I could finally answer this question!&quot; The majority of funding proposals that fuel scientific research are built on years of planning, months of writing, and more likely than not, years of refining the ideas / writing as the proposal is rejected again and again and again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Unless you have a patron willing to immediately throw thousands or millions of dollars at you, AND you are able to get hold of all the equipment and lab space you need extremely quickly, AND the experiment itself can be completed (or can at least collect the necessary data) in a very compressed amount of time, it's not going to be happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some research teams are agile, such as being able to write programs to gather data from online sources.  Experimental research is mostly halted, at least in DoD.  Itâ€™s a bit short sighted, but experiments were shut down when facilities closed and people transitioned into a telework status.  There will be substantial delays spinning everything back up and setting up/designing new experiments to keep projects going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that field work is extremely difficult right now. I work for an Australian marine research institute, and almost all field work has been cancelled. That's across government agencies and universities.
There are some really interesting questions we'd love to look at in these times - impacts of reduced marine traffic etc. - but conducting social distancing compliant field work is not simple.</p></div>		</li>
