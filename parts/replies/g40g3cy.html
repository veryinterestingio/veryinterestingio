			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly the corn used in Corn Flakes has the germ removed, which is the bit with the most nutrition.  If it were left in them the corn flakes themselves would rot.</p>
<p>Because it's removed they add vitamins and iron to compensate.</p>
<p>Corn flakes, by the way, can be moved (when floating on milk or water) with a magnet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I did a science experiment with corn flakes as a kid. If you stir corn flakes mush around with a magnet long enough, you'll start to see little iron shavings accumulate on the magnet. My little brain was blown when I realized food iron is actually metal iron lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown rice is not lighter in calories, if you count the same amount of grains, when comparing to white rice </p>
<p>It may be lighter in calories per the same weight, as unlike white rice it is not almost pure carbs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown rice is is bulkier than white rice as it still has the husk and the germ of the rice seed. That is extra volume and weight, and the husk is indigestible by humans. So for a given volume of weight of rice brown rice will contain fewer grains and less digestible matter, and thus fewer calories. Additionally some grains of brown rice if you do not chew them will pass undigested nearly intact with the digestible insides  protected from  your digestive tract</p></div>		</li>
