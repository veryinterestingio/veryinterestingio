			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably referring to beer cans, which have a plastic interior lining. It's not poisonous, at least according to the current science. Some folks are leery of any plastics because other types have turned out to be harmful after previously being considered safe, I'm not that cautious but I can't really fault the reasoning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For more specifics: afoxolaner (the drug in NexGard, the most common oral flea and tick treatment) effects the neurons of your dog. It can lead to GI issues like vomiting or diarrhea, loss of appetite, etc., as well as a few other things like muscle tremors. It's just WAY WORSE to the fleas than it is to the dog.</p>
<p>Why do we not have similar for humans? No one really bothers to make them, because we don't need them. We have less hair, spend less time frolicking in tall grass, etc. There are plenty of treatments that you can use, but they're all poisonous to some degree or other. I personally permethrin-treated all of my hiking clothes and gear when I was actively hiking. Rather than applying it to skin, where it can be absorbed, I put it on my clothing and gear, and never got another tick. Lasts 4-6 washes or a few months.</p>
<p>Why bother ingesting something when I can just treat the outside of my clothes and have basically no risk?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of all the answers in the thread, this is the actual correct answer. The flea and tick medications we give to our dogs and cats are toxic and cause minor, but permanent and cumulative liver and kidney damage. The rate of damage done is slow enough that it doesn't <em>normally</em> cause serious problems because the lifespan of cats and dogs is short enough that they've usually died of some other natural cause before the kidney damage does it. Humans live long enough that we'd all start dying of kidney and liver failure in our thirties if we took the same medications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, or at least not the main reason. </p>
<p>Cats have a tendency to not drink enough water since they get all their liquids from prey in the wild. So if a pet cat is eating dry food, they get no hydration from that. This is only made worse by the fact that cats don't like to drink where they eat (again, in nature you don't want to drink from a water source that just had a rodent/bird corpse in it) so that's why cats seem to always be drinking from glasses that you bring for yourself, straight from the tap, etc and not from their bowl. </p>
<p>They also prefer running water, so for cats that chronically don't drink enough, you best bet is to get them one of those cat fountains and to put it away from their food bowl.</p>
<p>Also I don't know the exact science behind it, but neutered male cats are a lot more prone to kidney stones and other issues. Afaik it's diet related and one of the main reasons why you should be switching your cat's food to one that's specifically for sterilized cats as soon as you get them neutered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes me wonder... most of the cats I've had that died &quot;from old age&quot;, it was because they got some sort of kidney damage, and all of them had their flea treatments up to date. Still beats dying from a flea infestation, but I wonder if they wouldn't live longer with some less toxic treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal, but my 3 genetically related cats that all developed kidney disease as seniors maybe got flea treatment once or twice in their life. They were indoor with no exposure and I was a kid most of their life without an income so....</p>
<p>Anyway I think it could be genetics for some and the fact that cat kidneys are really kind of garbage. </p>
<p>Granted,  these cats lived to 21, 19 before passing from stuff that wasn't kidney related (cancer, stroke), and my 18 year old is sleeping next to me right now.<br />
I won't flea treat her now unless absolutely necessary,due to advanced age and CKD, but yeah.</p></div>		</li>
