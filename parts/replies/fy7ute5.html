			<div class="markdown"><p>And talk with them and provide them lots of other stimulation too. Their brains are exploding with development, but it's shaped by their environments and experiences. Many parents think their job is to just keep the baby alive and maybe clean and possibly not crying, but it should involve cognitive stimulation as well. They're learning at a rapid pace right from the beginning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sudden thought: maybe this is why elephants never developed human-level intelligence? They have the smarts right now for tool use and limited language. Unlike octopuses, they have the social structure. And unlike cetateans and corvids, they have the dexterity to manipulate their environment pretty effectively. But since their young have to be ready to run pretty soon after birth, they can't let the head be big enough to contain sufficient brain, or it would get stuck?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human intelligence is squarely founded upon linguistic capability, possibly more so than we even know. It's not often mentioned in regards to human intelligence but our linguistic capabilities are an insane outlier in the animal kingdom. The sharing of information between individuals is already pretty rare in the animal kingdom, and we blew it right the fuck out of the water.</p>
<p>I'm not necessarily trying to take away from the point about relative brain size, but size alone isn't really sufficient. To reach a human-like intelligence, you would need the specialization of the human's neurodevelopment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TL;DR There is more evidence to suggest that it has to do with metabolic rates and how expensive it is for the human body to carry a baby than hip size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I see this factoid peddled around reddit from time to time as if it's just a fact. </p>
<p>But there's significant assumptions and question begging going on.  </p>
<p>E.g. why didn't we simply evolve wider hips?  It's usually presented as if hip size is totally fixed for all time, which doesn't even sound right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that hip size can't change, but that there are competing pressures in different directions. A narrow pelvis is better for bipedal motion, but worse for childbirth (hence why this is a sexually dimorphic feature). </p>
<p>Wider average female pelvis size might up the survival rate of childbirth slightly, but it might decrease female survival rates post puberty by making us slower or requiring more energy to move around, or making us more vulnerable to injury that prevents us walking altogether. And dying in early adulthood before you've had many/any children isn't conducive to passing on those genes.</p></div>		</li>

		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gekuu9" target="_blank">Gekuu9</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, pretty much. It’s cheaper for the body to care for a baby outside of the womb than inside, so the baby must be born early enough that the cost of breastfeeding doesn’t pass the maximum sustainable metabolic rate before the baby can start eating other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other hominids are thought to have been intellectually equivalent to ourselves, yet some of them had wider birth canals than humans. It's thought that our narrower hips gave us an advantage in covering territory, which gave us the ability to range much further than prior hominids. It's thought that we didn't outhunt other hominids so much as our bodies allowed us to be more nomadic and versatile, and we essentially were able to better exploit resources to increase our numbers. We didn't out-survive our cousins. We outbred them and covered more territory. Because we were more places, we survived the local pressures that drove other species to extinction, even if our own communities in those localities died out too.</p></div>		</li>
