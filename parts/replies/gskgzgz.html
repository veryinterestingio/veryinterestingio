			<div class="markdown"><p>Variance is used mainly for two reasons:</p>
<p>It’s the square of the standard deviation (although you could equally argue that we use standard deviation because it’s the square root of the variance).</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, it’s nearly linear: if you multiply all your data by some number a, then the new variance is a^2 times the old variance, and the variance of X+Y is the variance of X plus the variance of Y if X and Y are independent.</p>
<p>It’s also shift invariant, so if you add a number to all your data, the variance doesn’t change, though this is true of most measures of spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... if variance is more convenient and is just a square of standard deviation, why use standard deviation at all?</p>
<p>Does the latter have some kind of useful properties compared to variance?</p></div>		</li>

<p><del>SD is also linear though. It's just multiplied by a. And they are exactly linear?</del> SD does follow a<em>f(x) = f(a</em>x).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Same is true of SD.</p>
<p>Edit: yes SD is not linear because in general SD(X+Y) /= SD(X)+SD(Y). SD(X+a) = SD(X) + 0 where a is a constant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you explain the logic behind this? I'm not able to understand why its a^2</p></div>		</li>

<li>Variance is used as it belongs to a larger family of means to characterize   a distribution, called moments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics)" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment\_(mathematics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment\_(mathematics</a>)</a></li>
<li>Standard deviation is used because it is in the same unit as your original data (while variance of data in euros is in euros² for instance)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What numbers like mean, variance, standard deviation and such try to do is to sum up some of the properties of a given distribution. That is to say, they try to sum up the properties of a distribution without exhaustively giving you each and every point in that distribution. The mean, for example, is &quot;where is the distribution?&quot;, while the variance is &quot;how spread out is it?&quot;. Turns out there are infinitely many such numbers, and among them there is one specific family of such numbers called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics\)" target="_blank">moments</a>.</p>
<p>Moments, however, have different units. The first moment is the mean, that has the same units as the distribution so it's easy to give context to. The second, variance, has units of the distribution squared (so, the variance of a position has unit length²) so it's not as easy to interpret. Higher variance means a more spread out distribution, but how much? So what you can do is take the square root of the variance, and that preserves the &quot;bigger = more spread out&quot; property of variance, but now it has the &quot;correct&quot; unit as well! So in a sense, variance is the &quot;natural&quot; property, and standard deviation is the &quot;human-readable&quot; equivalent of that property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What confuses me is: How do I interpret an SD value? Let's say I know nothing about the original dataset and am just told the SD is 12. What does that tell me? Is that a high or low SD? Or is it entirely dependent on the context/the dataset itself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well even if I know the dataset and have all the context, how do I interpret the SD?</p>
<p>Let's say 50 students sit an exam, and the mean mark achieved, out of a possible 100, is 70, and the standard deviation is 12. But is that big or small? What does this really tell me?</p>
<p>I get (I think) that it means the average spread about the mean of marks achieved is 12, but... Now what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the SD is useless without context, since it is in the same units as the data.</p>
<p>Using your example, if you knew your dataset was the average height of adults measured in inches, then that SD is 12 inches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolute value of SD gives you nothing if you don't know anything about dataset. Sometimes SD is given as percentage of mean value. I'd say it's more of supportive number than statistic itself.</p></div>		</li>
