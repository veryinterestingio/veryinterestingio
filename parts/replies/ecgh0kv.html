			<div class="markdown"><p>Suing is how you get their attention. Nobody said it has to be successful. Most successful lawsuits don't even make it to trial; they settle out of court.</p>
<p>In some cases, the lawsuit, in and of itself, is only meant to grab headlines. Once the initial papers have been filed at the courthouse, a headline stating &quot;Google has been Sued for YouTube Drama&quot; is no longer false. This is why most news articles with headlines similar to this can't get any comment from the company being sued -- it was filed earlier that day and the company probably hasn't even received the official notice and summons yet.</p>
<p>It would cost me around $500-$1000 to get a headline in a major newspaper that Reddit is being sued for slandering and libeling Russians as a whole. The lawsuit would be immediately dismissed and my attorney could be sanctioned for wasting the court's time, but the Los Angeles Times would have a fun headline to print.</p></div>		</li>
