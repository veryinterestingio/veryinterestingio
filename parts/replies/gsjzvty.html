			<div class="markdown"><p>Epileptic seizures around video games can be a lot scarier, though.  With a movie, most of the people affected would probably be in movie theatres which are at least full of people who could react to that.  From there once you know that a certain movie is a higher risk, you can put up warnings and the like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, video games are often played in solo settings, and where you might watch the same movie 20 times in a row and never have an issue, with video games you could play Minecraft 20 times in a row and then on the 21st time screw up a redstone contraption and accidentally create a strobe light that triggers a seizure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, and they are capable of bugs which can produce flashing images that are never even intended to appear, however, warnings like that are not actually implemented by the government or any medical professionals, but rather through &quot;voluntary&quot; ratings boards, which derive their regulations from how best to dodge criticism of the medium. More criticism = more regulation.</p></div>		</li>
