			<div class="markdown"><p>Following up on beam sizes, the transverse size of the LHC proton beams at the collision points is on the order of microns. Electron beams can be made to have extraordinarily small emittances (nanometer-radians), and therefore can be focused to very small sizes. On the other end of the spectrum you have secondary beams produced in various kinds of collisions which can be millimeters or centimeters in size.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If anyone reading this phrase really wants to learn about some cool stuff, look into free-electron lasers, synchrotrons/synchrotron radiation and storage rings. These are among the most incredible and mind-boggling devices humankind has created.</p>
<p>One of the people involved in the early stages of high-energy collision physics was Gerard O'Neill, the person who a lot of sci-fi fans might recognize as the originator of the classical O'Neill cylinder concept for space habitats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting read, thank you. You mentioned that an electronic circuit decides whether a collision was 'head-on' or not, based on sensor data. Is that done using FPGAs or is there some custom hardware that makes this decision? Can I read more about this somewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know for modern systems.  I worked briefly on, if I recall correctly, the &quot;level 2 B&quot; trigger for the CDF (fermilab) 30 years ago.  It was a large set of large circuit boards with hardware gate logic in a neural net (yeah, I think it was literally cmos  boolean gates hardwired into neural nets across a rack of a dozen cards, which is mind-blowing.). I didn't stay on that team to see it completed, though, and it was long ago so my memory could be wrong.</p>
<p>I also worked on much simpler trigger setups for nuclear accelerators.  Typically, these would be fairly simple combinations, like &quot;at least 10 of these style detectors in this range of angles plus at least this much total signal strength in all of these other style detectors, etc&quot;</p>
<p>You're probably right that modern rigs would use fpgas, probably wired in a neural net architecture.  There's typically multiple time scales, so a 10 nanosecond-ish simple circuit to reject 90% of garbage events, then a microsecond circuit that reads out the very fastest stuff and rejects 90% of the remaining, etc, until you get to a rate where the slowest detectors can be ready and reset and events written to tape.  Back in the dark ages, we'd have a tower of GB tape drives running in parallel, and you'd have to swap in blank tapes every hour or so.  You'd end a 5 day run with a large cardboard box that had the start of half a dozen PhD dissertations in it.</p>
<p>It's probably much faster now.</p></div>		</li>
