			<div class="markdown"><p>Can (kind of) confirm. I've been intermittent fasting now for about 15 months. Very rare that I feel hungry now. Have tried a few different types of IF, but have ultimately settled on fasting from 8:30PM until 12:30PM the following day, so 16 hour fast every day. Also tried full day fasting once or twice a week and a 20 hour fast window every day. It's purely the body producing a hormone called ghrelin when it thinks you're about to eat. If you change your eating schedule, your body will adjust and stop producing ghrelin as often, which is what makes you feel hungry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Hunger goes away completely by day 4. You need some supplements though such as potassium otherwise you will feel very shitty quite soon.</p>
<p>The hard part of a long fast is missing the pleasure you get from food (and drink, and food/drink based socialising). For me, the psychological desire for food gets pretty strong after about 12 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gone roughly 2 and a half years of fasting 16 hours daily. I stop eating after dinner, then don't eat until lunch time.  After a couple of days in I found that it's no issue, I just don't get hungry in the mornings anymore.  </p>
<p>The odd thing is that everyone once in awhile when I'm staying at friends or families house and they make me breakfast (of course I eat it,  I'm not going to be like &quot;no sorry I don't eat breakfast&quot;) it doesn't change my hunger at all.  I still get hungry at lunch even though I ate breakfast like 3 hours ago.  It's funny how the body adapts to routine.</p>
<p>Edit- side note,  it is SUPER handy not having to worry about making food first thing in the morning, my mornings are much less rushed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve noticed this too. I skip breakfasts these days but if I eat, I’m just as hungry come 11 as if I hadn’t eaten anything. </p>
<p>Fasting makes me sharper in the mornings for sure. I’ve come to the realization that there are no healthy American breakfasts. They are either sugar or fat and nitrates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because your brain is used to you eating every twenty minutes, so it sends out hunger pangs more frequently than you actually need. If you stop doing that, like if you're trying to lose weight and cutting calories, you'd be surprised how quickly your body adjusts to the new schedule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medically supervised weight loss is hell.  I'm tired and hungry a lot, even though my belly is feeling full from eating the right foods, simply from calorie debt.  but the losses are awesome.  I lost 40ish pounds in the first month.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimers</strong>: what's true in my case probably won't be true for you, and it won't be true again for me on Tuesday, when I go for the second monthly update with the doc.  I have a VERY high maintenance caloric level, meaning that I can eat at normal levels for the 'average' person and still require medical supervision; my calorie counts would likely have required medical supervision for that theoretical average person.  Other than Christmas and a birthday party, I didn't cheat at all that first month; cheating WILL affect your losses.  I'm also undergoing exercise and nutrition tutoring, to alter my eating habits permanently, so hopefully I won't need to try to diet like this again.  Having said that, that 40 pounds was about 1/9 of my bodyweight, and I was hoping to lose about 1/3 overall.</p></div>		</li>
