			<div class="markdown"><p>math is a different topic than everything else. with math, simply remembering the information isn't always enough as with other topics. it requires actual understanding to grasp it. memorizing in math rarely works. if you're having to devote that much time to learning the math, and still not understanding it, you need a different approach. From experience, i refused to take notes in math class. because all the time i was spending writing down the WHAT of the material, what equation, what whatever, was time spent not learning the WHY it was like that. and i rarely had to study math because of it. and if i did study, it was just memorizing the equations, but i fully understood why the equations were what they were, and what the point of the equation was. but the good math teachers let you have a sheet with the equations on it anyways.</p></div>		</li>
