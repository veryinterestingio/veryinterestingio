			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't heard of H2N3 but there is H3N2, which is one of the viruses in the seasonal flu shot. Another one of the strains in the shot is H1N1. Both of these are Type A influenza viruses. A third virus in the trivalent vaccines is one of two Type B influenza viruses that have been circulating. Quadrivalent vaccines include another Type B.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes I forgot about type A and B as well.  So you only get 2 of each, your coverage really depends on how accurate they are with which strains will be big for the season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New flu shots are generally available around November.  If you haven't gotten one since March, you should go ahead and get a new one.</p>
<p>I don't think they vary by country.  There are a few different types (trivalent, quadravalent, nasal spray) but they spread globally every season so there shouldn't be regional variations.</p></div>		</li>
