			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if this was covered in the article, I'm going by what you've quoted as I'm at work right now but your quote doesn't specify music or rhythmic sounds? Does this imply that there are physical responses to any sound? I don't think I've ever bobbed to having a conversation or tapped to my dogs inconvenient barking.</p>
<p>Surely there's something distinctive to the rhythm factor? Maybe it's to do with the heart beat? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good observation! It did not get much deeper in the article unfortunately. It mainly focused on the music aspect of rhythm. Though, if we look at the definition of rhythm &quot;a strong, regular, repeated pattern of movement or sound.&quot;, most dog barking and human conversation is not in a normal 4/4 time signature. Though, if we look at the rap/hiphop genre humans can perform rhythmic speech, accompanied with a musical instrumental, it can induce head-bobbing and tapping. I would even say if someone created a dog bark over a music unstrumental with a nice beat, I would bob my head to the dog barking in an actual rhythm. Phew long response here. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's this compelling theory called something like &quot;the human ambipedality theory&quot; that argues that out brains like bobbing and thus we walk on two legs (and other animals capable of it don't do it for longer stretches of time unless they have to). It also explain why we tend to like rocking chairs and rollercoasters, and that toddlers love being thrown up and down (animals don't like this very much, try it with your cat).</p>
<p>It's also been proven that the parts of our brain that works with motor stuff (i.e. movement) are incredibly important when it comes to processing rhythm too.</p>
<p>Sorry for not linking studies, and just paraphrasing, but I'm on my phone here. I work at RITMO, though (the research centre at the University of Oslo that researches rythm, time and motion), so my colleagues talk about this stuff a lot.</p>
<p>Edit: switched ambipedality to bipedality, since I'm dumb and a liar. ??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally just watched a Netflix Documentary called &quot;Explained&quot; by Vox that discussed how in depth animals comprehend music (beat, timbre, rhythem, etc), but Cockatoos are the only bird that seem to understand beat.</p>
<p>They played different songs at different BPMs and the Cockatoo would beat its head at (nearly) the same BPM. Seals can do this too, according to them and are the only other mammal that can seemingly do it.</p>
<p>The first episodes all about Music, and while I wish it was longer, its a pretty good ~26 mins</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can't fault them for that, humans can't hold a beat for shit either.</p>

<p>I'm a bit wary about these kinds of statements. There are between 9,000 and 10,000 bird species. I doubt they tested all. I doubt they tested even 10% of bird species. But if they did, I'd be curious to know who funded the study and why.</p></div>		</li>
