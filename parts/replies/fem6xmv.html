			<div class="markdown"><p>ATP is a protein with 3 phosphates attached ATriphosphate ADP is this same protein with 2 phosphates attached ADiphosphate. A third molecule exists called AMP AMonophosphate. One phosphate.</p>
<p>Some ADP is used to re-create ATP with the assistance of breaking sugar molecules to overcome the energy gap.</p>
<p>Some ADP can be turned into AMP to create more energy for the body.</p>
<p>Basically your ATP ADP and AMP is in a constant cycle of breaking to give you energy and becoming replenished by breaking sugar molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, your body isn't going to burn more calories to create water for you to sweat, it's just going to sweat anyway and dehydrate you. The body's reaction to not having enough water is not too burn precious energy to get it (which would be like burning money in your fireplace rather than buying firewood) it will just make you thirsty to go use that energy to seek out more water to drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Sweating is controlled by thermoreceptors. If you had to get rid of water because you had too much you'd piss it out instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The weight you burn lose from sweating is replenished when you drink again. I'm pretty certain that the cycle of making and then using ATP is water neutral.</p></div>		</li>
