			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently I walked with no swing in my arms until I was about 23 when a coworker noticed and commented. Nothing mean, he just remarked he knew something always seemed different when I walked and that was it. </p>
<p>Now it's more natural but I had to think about doing it like an alien fitting in for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely you always had a tiny tiny swing in your arms, as the change in momentum your legs exert and the rotation of your hip would make your arms move a bit. It's just that &quot;normal&quot; swinging of arms is usually a semi active motion, wherein the walker doesn't necessarily actively swing their arms, but they do actively let them limp enough to swing due to the legs moving</p></div>		</li>
