			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one of the old belt drive turntables, a Conneisseur, where you just pulled the belt over an extra long pulley to change from 33 to 45. It also included a strobe disk you would place on the table, and shine an electric light on. If the stripes were stationary, your speed was correct; if they were off one way or the other, there was a variable speed control you could adjust until they were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a Dual 701 with an electronic switch for the 3 speeds, and an adjustment knob, and the edge of the bed had the strobe stripes, with a little amber light. A whole built-in setup for messing around with speeds. Loved it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Audiophile record players do it the same way more often than not, since many audiophiles also tend to love minimalist design. You just move the belt from one size of flywheel to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several modern turntables change speed by lifting the belt into a different pulley. All Rega turntables do this.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like you have some of this backwards. Slower moving disks hold <em>more</em> audio than faster moving ones. So your statement that 33s held &quot;just as much audio&quot; as a 78 is wrong. That was one of the drawbacks of the 78.  78s required albums of discs because they couldn't fit all the audio on one disc. </p>
<p>Unless by saying &quot;just as much audio&quot; you don't mean the audio length and instead mean audio quality (analogous to bitrate). If that's the case, then maybe find a less ambiguous way to phrase that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I did get that backwards, In my defence, it was late and I was rushed to finish the comment before going to sleep.</p>
<p>Thank you for the correction.</p></div>		</li>
