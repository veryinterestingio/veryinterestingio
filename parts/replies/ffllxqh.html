			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, if you sleep less than 6 hours, your fatigue will generally catch up to you later in the day. Trust me, I've had moments where I naturally woke up after 4.5 hours, felt better than I ever did with 8 or 10 hours, then crashed less than 6 hours later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started to follow this rule last year, and when I wake up early, I go back to sleep if I have more than 90 minutes of time left.  It has greatly reduced the amount of times I wake up tired.</p></div>		</li>
