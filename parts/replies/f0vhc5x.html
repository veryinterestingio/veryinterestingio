			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup I think so too. We try to sort out cans and plastic bottles and take it to a recycling center but that doesn't account for paper and other recyclables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually more efficient, since laypeople suck at sorting and the &quot;sorted&quot; recycling had to be resorted anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once the trash goes from your curb to the disposal facility, they throw everything into giant pools of water and sifters. All the stuff that floats is skimmed off and sent to the recycling facility. This first step sorts out most of it right away. It's surprisingly efficient</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, outside my house I have 5 different trashcans. Glass/metal, paper/cardboard, plastics, bio/foodwaste and one for unrecycable. They rotate what they empty every tuesday. And bio/foodwaste they empty weekly in a smaller compartment in the garbagetruck. (Norway)
Bio/foodwaste is used to make biofuel, buses and the garbagetrucks run on it locally in my town atleast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I did this for a job... No prison involved. It was a private recycling company. I worked there in the winter, so the half frozen garbage/recycling mix that came out on to that conveyor belt was so cold that even with three layers of glove on my hands were always in pain. And my manager was a damned whip so I'd be trying to pick out and sort all the different recyclable materials as fast as I could, with frozen hands, and a 5'4 50 year old lady yelling at me to hurry up. This was for maybe 11 dollars CAN an hour. We had containers for all the different recyclables set up as close as possible so that when you saw a piece, you would sort of grab and flick it in to the proper container. Definitely took some practice to be quick and accurate with both hands going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former Dump/recycling  center employee. There were about 10 of us lined up among a conveyor belt, and we would all be pulling a certain material from the belt, and dropping into a large bin below. For example, there was someone assigned to all the brown glass, and then someone who did clear and green class. The conveyor belt had a giant magnet toward the end of the system so your canned food and metallic items would get pulled. Following that, a paper sifter that pulled paper. So at the end of the process,  you have bins full of the same material ready for processing, while the trash goes to the end and sent to the dump site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a small item it usually end up with the trash. However, if the works see a big clump of items that they know wont get separated in time, they will shutoff the belt and allow the works to sort through the material. For hazardous material such as used needles, we are required to pull an emergency stop lever that turns off the belt so we can carefully remove the hazard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to do community service at a recycling plant and that's exactly what happens. I'm on the east coast of the US. A big ass truck backed up and dumped a load of shit on the floor. We shoveled all of it into a pit where a conveyor belt took it up and across the building. Then we went up to the top of the conveyor belt and manually sorted everything. There were dumpsters under the belt that specific items were thrown into while sorting. It was absolutely disgusting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was forced to do 260 hours at a recycling plant. Exactly the same process as you describe. It was the worst thing ever. So dirty, constant dust in the air, disgusting smell. I had to work the conveyor for most of my time. Eventually I wised up and developed a whole kit. I would wear latex gloves underneath a pair of heavy duty gloves so my hands wouldn't get contaminated with wet garbage. I worse a full respirator because paper masks didn't do shit, I wore lab goggles to protect my eyes. And a hoodie over everything with the hood always up.</p>
<p>The only good thing that came of it was two red dot gun sights I found in box. They worked just fine, managed to sell them on Ebay for some decent cash!</p></div>		</li>
