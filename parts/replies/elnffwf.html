			<div class="markdown"><p>Saskia here:  My field is psychology applied to genomics, and a lot of the research in my field is about how new genetic and genomic information impacts people’s health behaviors as well as their psychological well-being.  Behavior includes “lifestyle” behaviors such as diet, exercise, and smoking.  It also includes more “clinical” behaviours such as taking medications, monitoring, screening for diseases, and in some cases even surgery.  What’s important to understand about this field is that the research on the behavioural impact of genomic information is really in its infancy.  People often think that the big question here is whether genetic risk information that only has a small impact on disease risk motivates people to change their lifestyle behaviors (it doesn’t).  But actually the behavioral questions that really matter now include: as people get more and more genetic information about themselves, can they and do they act on the information in ways that reduce their disease risks and increase their wellbeing? Do people respond differently to genetic information about their traits (e.g. eating behaviour) and psychology (e.g. depression) compared to genetic information about their physical disease risks (e.g. cancer, heart disease)? How can we best communicate genetic information and support people to make sure we maximise the benefits and minimise the harms of emerging genomic technologies? It is super important that people are aware that, in addition to doing the <em>discovery</em> research (e.g. to find new genetic causes of diseases), we also have to do the <em>translational</em> research to make sure that those discoveries are translated into benefits for all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laura here: Like Dr. Sanderson, my field is psychology applied to genomics.  A meta-analysis by Julianne Holt-Lunstad [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316</a>] showed that social relationships yielded a stronger association with mortality than lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and physical inactivity.  Unpacking <em>how</em> these interpersonal ties impact health is an important next step and will guide the development of future medical interventions. In my lab, we look at family systems and how interpersonal mechanisms within the family relate to health outcomes, with a particular focus on inherited disease.  We consider interpersonal ties from a health promotion perspective - so, can we leverage family relationships in meaningful ways to improve family members’ health through genomics.  We also look at these mechanisms from a disease management and caregiving perspective - so, can we identify patterns in how social resources are exchanged within the family that are associated with optimal coping when providing support and care to someone diagnosed with an inherited disease.  What we find is that family relationships are critical to members’ health.  It is through the intergenerational transfer of information that family members learn about their family health history - information that is important to personalized health care. Encouragement from family members to engage in healthful lifestyle behaviors can make the difference in whether members take up those behaviors.  In addition to providing support resources, family relationships can also be sources of interpersonal stress - particularly in the context of negotiating caregiving roles - and stress is associated with numerous health outcomes.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alex: People often think of the impact of genetics on health as deterministic, like “If I have a variant in Gene X, then I will definitely get Y disease.”  While there are cases where that is true, most often genetics is much more probabilistic.  Genetics certainly play a role in health and disease, but it is one factor among many.  Even for variants which we know are pathogenic and “disease-causing,” such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants linked to breast cancer, there are a wide range of clinical outcomes and many people who carry such variants will never actually develop disease or will have vastly different manifestations and severities of the disease.</p></div>		</li>
