			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a correction: Neptune has very striking weather patterns too. What's powering them is actually heat from the interior. However Uranus, for reasons that aren't yet understood, is the only one of the giant planets that does not have a net internal heat source, and so cannot generate the same weather patterns. Having said that, a lot of the 'calm' Uranus images date back from Voyager times, which were obtained at a time when Uranus was calmer. But Uranus also has seasonal changes in behaviour that take decades to become apparent due the the incredibly long orbital period, and more recent observations of Uranus show that it actually has more dynamic weather than previously thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall that Uranus has an axial tilt of almost 90 degrees. However, does that (north?) pole that faces the sun <em>always</em> face the sun? Or will Uranus' axis eventually be pointed 90ish degrees away from the sun? </p>
<p>That make any sense?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does not. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/RGuN1aD.jpg" target="_blank">This diagram</a> might help you out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranus has very extreme seasons, so that the equivalent of the Arctic circle extends to the equator. So at solstice, one hemisphere is completely dark and the other fully illuminated. But at equinox, there is still a normal day and night time across the planet, and the year swings between these extremes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My own theory for why Uranus doesn't have interesting weather features is because I feel like the sun heating up one side of the planet would probably try to cause winds to blow horizontally (more or less in line with the plane of the solar system) but the rotation of it being at pretty much a right angle to that means it's also got that energy going a different direction so not continuous movement of air in any direction can really be obtained at a significant level. While with the other three it can since they spin more or less in line with the plane of the solar system. I feel like Uranus might have a banded pattern at its most obvious when the equator is lined up with the sun since then it's basically the same dynamic as the other gas planets (only vertical rather than horizontal) where energy from the sun can be conveniently carried around the planet in a continuous one-way flow (with the direction of its rotation) but when it's got one of the poles facing the sun the energy distribution wouldn't be as linear and any banded storms running parallel to the equator would be blown out from air movement coming in at a perpendicular angle to their flow, neutralizing the whole atmosphere. Maybe this is what Voyager saw when it passed? But I could also be over-estimating how much solar energy even makes it that far.</p></div>		</li>
