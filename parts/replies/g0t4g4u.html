			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s absolutely wrong. For starters the warmth in injured places comes mostly from the increased blood flow and/or bleeding. </p>
<p>Second, we cool down the brain for completely different reasons. Most of the detrimental effects of TBI come not only from bleeding but mostly from glutamate storms. Muscle cells don’t have gaba and nmda receptors. Finaly, cooling the brain in TBI cases is controversial with evidence pointing both ways. In any case the brain is way WAY different thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair. My jump to cranioprotection was probably a leap - been some time since I looked into the science around that and don't deal with it day to day. Made an inappropriate connection there. I'll edit my original comment!</p>
<p>As an aside I have a (friendly) question:
It's been some time since I actually read up on protective hypothermia in TBI but still thought the advice on the ground was routinely to cool trauma patients? What complications are of concern when doing this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think it's from increased cellular activity. Getting stung by a bee on the tip of your finger doesn't automatically make your hand or arm get hot. But your finger will be. Yes there's also increased blood flow which will have some impact especially the closer the injury is to the heart. But in the extremities blood has already cooled down quite a bit and can't explain the sudden increased temperature to an injured or inflamed area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, inflammation changes over time. If it was still inflamed it would feel cold and not like normal muscle. My guess is that you had increased vascular regeneration so you have a little more bloodflow there than in the surrounding tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's wrong and has nothing to do with swelling. swelling is the dilation of blood vessels and the warmth that comes with it is because blood is warm and there's a lot more blood per square cm in an area with dilated blood vessels than other areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My comment wasn't tackling swelling as such, just adding some additional interesting (or so I thought) information to the discussion. </p>
<p>Increased metabolic activity of cells in an injured site is going to generate some heat in tandem with increased blood flow. One of the key principals of cryotherapy is the reduction of metabolic load to the site. Aiming for temperatures between 5-15 c is the ballpark that I've heard touted, but difficult to truly quantify. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not a biologist and haven't done extensive research into the area. But I'm fairly certain there is some evidence for that out there surrounding metabolic process in injury</p>

<p>This is just a cursory scholar search (I don't currently have access to true literature search engines) and I haven't read those full studies so they may be FULL of holes. Please don't shoot me if that's the case!</p></div>		</li>
