			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but there's tens of kilometers of thick atmosphere between the ground and space. Useful for aerobraking, not so much if you want to get something up there with anything approaching orbital speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No we just need large, reusable rockets. Mass drivers aren't much use on the Earth, they'd be too long and would ram you into the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass drivers need to be either almost impossibly long or your payloads need to survive really high accelerations. Not to mention the heat shielding needed during the ascent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically you only need to maintain the same mass fraction to get the same Delta V. Practically the increasing structural weight of your rocket makes it require more than twice as much fuel to lift a 2x heavier payload but it's pretty close</p>
<p>Delta V = v_e ln(mass_initial / mass_final) so if mass_final doubles then doubling mass_initial gives us the same value inside the log</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you're right, for some reason I read your comment as 1 extra kg of payload requires 1 extra kg of fuel, which you didn't say at all :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, fuel needs scale exponentially with required Delta V, only linearly with payload mass. (That was my first reaction too, though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other problem is you can't just keep throwing fuel at it until you have enough because there's also a hard limit on the payload for any given rocket thrust, right?  For example if a rocket produces 100,000 LB of thrust, then the payload (including fuel and the rocket itself) cannot be more than that or else it will just sit on the pad burning fuel until its weight is &lt; 100,000 LB and it can lift off.</p></div>		</li>
