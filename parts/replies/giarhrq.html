			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 4 fundamental forces in our universe:  gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force.</p>
<p>As a star <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/system/avm_images/binaries/14/larger/ztf20190208c.jpg?1549503142" target="_blank">gets more and more mass</a>, gravity increases, so it shrinks.  The gases it's made of get compressed more.  At some point the gravity is so strong that the nuclei of atoms in the gas (plasma) in the star are squeezed so close that it's possible for them to combine into one giant (star-sized) &quot;nucleus&quot; - a neutron star.  </p>
<p>When this happens, you can think of it as gravity (the squeeze) winning against electromagnetism (protons in the nuclei of atoms repelling each other).</p>
<p>If the neutron star continues to accumulate matter and gravity continues to increase, eventually gravity will &quot;overcome&quot; even the much stronger nuclear forces.  </p>
<p>At that point, as far as we know from physics, <em>there is no other force</em> to oppose gravity, and the material of the star is squeezed &quot;infinitely&quot;, until its &quot;size&quot; reaches 0.</p>
<p>That's a singularity.  An object with the mass of stars (planets can be in orbit around it just like with a star), but all of it squeezed into a &quot;mathematical&quot; point - size 0 (not even micron or nanometer scale, literally 0).</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot see a singularity, because gravity bends space  and time at quite a distance around this singularity &quot;center&quot;, and light from it can't escape to reach us.  We can observe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_hole_-_Messier_87_crop_max_res.jpg" target="_blank">black holes</a>, but all we see is the region of black from where light can't escape.</p>
<p>What happens inside this region is theorized, but impossible to observe.  And that's why they use the term &quot;singularity&quot;, which is more of a mathematical term.  As far as we know there's no other force to oppose gravity, so logically the material of the star will shrink down to 0 size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, while this is a great intuitive way to describe the process of matter collapsing into a black hole, it should be added that gravity is <strong>not</strong> a force according to general relativity, as we are dealing with highly relativistic contexts here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Brcause that fills the definition for all of them doesn't it ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly because in both physics and mathematics we can predict what happens ‘beyond’ the singularity for all points other than the singularity itself.
In maths the function 1/x has a singularity at x=0, it’s behaviour is undefined. But all all points on either side of exactly x=0 it is perfectly well defined and understood.</p>
<p>In physics the Event Horizon of a black hole is also a form of singularity, but we can make predictions about what happens in either side of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>In math, it refers to the point where a mathematical model or object ceases to follow the 'normal' rules of math - such as being finite or differentiable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you've got the right idea, but putting it as &quot;violating the normal rules of math&quot; might give people the wrong idea. A singularity is a point in a mathematical structure which is undefined or not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_(mathematics)" target="_blank">well-behaved</a>.</p>
<p>I'd describe a singularity as &quot;violating the normal rules of a mathematical object&quot; rather than the whole &quot;rules of math&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
