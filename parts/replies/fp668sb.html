			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually how I like to watch my movies. I know some people watch movies or shows twice in a row because they like it but I cannot do this. If I watch a movie or show I incredibly love or enjoyed then I just deprive myself of watching that movie or show for a long time until I can forget the the plot of the story. Yes I retain what happens during it but I forget the details, the backstories, the general shaping of the plot and then time has passed when I can watch it and I feel happy to watch it again because it's like watching it fresh again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I used to watch TV shows over and over when I was a teenager, but around the time I went to University that stopped completely. Now I have no interest in watching something again unless it's been long enough that I barely remember it. It also doesn't make sense anymore to me, I can't comprehend why my old self liked to do that.</p>
<p>(One exception from this is that I used to smoke weed at that time and I get super forgetful on weed, but that would explain only some of it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a bunch of great movies in college stoned off my ass, enjoyed the hell out of them, and completely forgot that I watched them. Since then I've been able to rewatch them with fresh eyes like I'm watching them for the first time. It's been great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've actually shown that people enjoy movies etc more on the second consumption. Your first watch your brain is busy trying to figure out what's going to happen. The second watch you know, so you can pick up on details and foreshadowing you likely missed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I can do this too. If I watch a movie once and then don’t watch it for a year or two I completely forget what happens in it and can watch it again like it’s the first time. Sometimes I’ll remember things as I’m watching it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gotta say the term &quot;dopamin detox&quot; is kind of hilarious because dopamine isn't just used in the limbic system's reward pathway. It's also one of the primary neurotransmitters for movement and motor control, so I guess if it were possible to truly detox you'd likely develop symptoms akin to Parkinson's disease and also possible depression, a la patients taking first gen antipsychotics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quote &quot;the chemical addiction changes the brajn&quot; </p>
<p>Dopamine is also a chemical.  Yes it is natural but isn't it still possible for it to cause regular activities to be more addictive than usual?? For instance i know someone that said quitting meth was easier than quitting porn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Habits can be hard to quit, but it’s not “dopamine” that’s to blame. Porn is not more chemically rewarding than fucking crystal meth, that’s insane.</p>
<p>If you lack self discipline, anything habitual is difficult to stop, dopamine levels be damned. If the habit you’re trying to quit is largely benign (like porn) and doesn’t have a strong negative feedback loop to help reinforce discipline (like a hangover for alcohol) then I imagine it’s very difficult to stop. But that has nothing to do with “dopamine”. </p>
<p>Breaking the habit is a function of not doing it, not altering your dopamine levels in some fashion. I also had trouble stopping from biting my nails, that has absolutely nothing to do with dopamine though.</p></div>		</li>
