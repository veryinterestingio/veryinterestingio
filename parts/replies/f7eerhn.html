			<div class="markdown"><p>This for sure. Watching Foxâ€™s pregame show this weekend taught me a lot about West Point and the fort that was there during the revolutionary war. They call it West Point because it was on the west side of a kink on the Hudson River. This gave it a great vantage point and firing lines for any ships moving up the Hudson. Those ships would be forced to tack (basically move against the wind) to get around the kink. This would slow them down and open them up to be fired upon by the fort. That and there were also two massive chains draped across the River. British ships never got by it. </p>
<p>The fort in St. Augustine, Castillo de San Marcos, was set up as a deterrent to British trying to establish a beachhead in that area of Florida. It was besieged and passed ownership between the British and French several times. </p>
<p>There is also Fort Nassau in the Bahamas which was there to protect the bay from both attacking European rivals and pirates. It also changed hands several times including be held by pirates and fell into disrepair quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. My home town is located on a rock above the confluence of two rivers. Even if you managed to cross the river, you still have a very steep hill to climb.</p></div>		</li>
