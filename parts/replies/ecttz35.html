<p>This seems like a very strange way to phrase this. Is there some reason to think he didn't do it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No it does not.</p>
<p>It is considered <em>alleged</em> because there no evidence it took place, it was a he said/she said case and Tupac (and the two co-accused) were found not guilty of all the serious charges. Nobody did prison time other than Tupac because he admitted touching her buttocks with his hand, saying that type of intimacy was normal due to a prior sexual relationship. That's the only charge that stuck, and then while in prison he was granted bail due to a re-trial. People seem to forget that, that he was granted a re-trial and died on bail. It is very likely, that he would have had his conviction squashed given the evidence. He was granted a retrial because the prosecution withheld evidence that backed his story.</p>
<p>Here are the issues with the case:</p>
<p>She went to the police and Tupac and the two other men where arrested within an hour of the alleged incident, where then she received a medical examination due to saying she was gang raped, the conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>No DNA evidence.</li>
<li>No evidence of forced entry to the Anus.</li>
<li>No evidence of bruising even though she alleges she was held down and gang raped. </li>
</ul>
<p>There was zero physical evidence that Tupac raped her. None. Three men allegedly gang raped her, including anally, and there was zero evidence, very odd considering she even stated they &quot;set upon me like animals.&quot;. Not even a single bruise.</p>
<p>Not only that but her actual statements changed multiple times, to Tupac raping her, then maybe Tupac didn't rape her but held her down, to maybe Tupac wasn't in the room but he encouraged the rape. Given this, and the zero physical evidence, this why the jury concluded all 3 men had been <strong>not guilty</strong> of rape.</p>
<p>He was convicted of the most minor charge and got jail time due to his priors.  Nobody expected Tupac to actually do time for the charge he was convicted of. The charges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sodomy (Rape Charge) - <strong>Not Guilty</strong></li>
<li>Assiting Sodomy - <strong>Not Guilty</strong></li>
<li>Attempted Sodomy - <strong>Not Guilty</strong></li>
<li>Sexual Assualt via forcibly touching the buttocks - <strong>Guilty</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last charge was an ass-grab.</p>
<p>His conviction was for forcibly touching the buttocks with his hand. Tupac went to prison because of an ass grab. It was his own statement that the Jury found him guilty. He admitted touching her buttocks with his hand because he was in a prior sexual relationship with her. Due to that, that sort of intimacy wasn't unusual and certainly not assault.  The woman denied this, and said just because they had a prior sexual relationship does not mean she went over for a sexual encounter or consented to sexual touching, she visited as a friend.</p>
<p>Tupac was immediately granted bail and offered a re-trial when it was found out the prosecution withheld evidence, including a voice recording of the woman saying on the hotel voicemail &quot;I can't wait to see you, I love the way you fuck&quot; on the morning of the incident. This conflicts with her statement in court that she was visiting as a friend, and puts the entire ass-grab conviction into doubt. That's why he was released after a few months instead of serving the 4 1/2 year sentence. </p>
<p>It's been 20 hours since your post so nobody will probably read this, but it's always been a controversial conviction. So controversial he was actually granted bail and released from prison given that there was evidence withheld from his defense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Into convicted territory. &quot;Proven&quot; implies it is factual and the person actually committed the crime. And yet, plenty of convicts are later on proven innocent.</p>
<p>This is also one of the main points of contention against the death penalty.</p></div>		</li>
