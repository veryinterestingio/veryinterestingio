			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - Most of the common strong acids aren't really &quot;poisonous&quot; (that's a great big broad statement and you should <em>always</em> know the properties of anything you're working with!) outside their corrosive effects; you could add small amounts to your beverages and sip them all day long without much problem (not that I'm <em>recommending</em> you do that, of course).</p>
<p>And it's actually a lot harder to cause serious acid burns than most people think - You can let a splash of 10M HCl sit on your arm for over a minute before you even feel it, and even when dealing with nasties like (room-temperature) AR, it's not like in the movies where your flesh instantly melts off the bone, you have a few seconds to calmly but quickly get to the emergency shower / eye-wash station.  Usually when people get seriously burned, it's either because they have no way to quickly rinse it off (such as in the &quot;acid attacks&quot; you hear about every now and then), or it's because of a lab/industrial accident like a beaker full of boiling SO₃ exploding in their face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of a powerful acid that is toxic in its own right is HF (Hydrofluoric acid, chemically a weak acid but nonetheless extremely corrosive). It rapidly absorbs through skin and body tissue and immediately disables nervous tissue making burns painless. It then completely destroys the entire affected area over the next few days by interfering with cellular chemistry causing severe necrosis. If it gets into the blood it will cause cardiac arrest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aqua Regia, a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid in a 1:3 molar ratio.  I mentioned it since it's often used instead of cyanide for leaching gold from ore or e-waste.</p>
<p>Which is actually kind of apropos to this discussion - AR is seriously caustic and evolves NO₂, and yet it's <em>still</em> considered a much safer alternative to using cyanide.  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tbh kinda hard to say. most of the places i've ever heard that cyanide poisoning is really painful is anti-suicide sites. the gas form of hydrogen cyanide is said to take up to 10 minutes to be lethal, where pill form and injecting it have differing results.</p>
<p>its also mentioned that, given it cuts off the cell's ability to absorb oxygen, it causes a lactic acid buildup, which basically makes it feel like you worked out hard where the effect is.</p>
<p>basically it'll still sort of feel like you're suffocating, most likely, and take longer to die than just strangulation, but dunno about 'really painful' given we're talking about poisonings and suicide attempts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given it takes over cell communication, doesn't the brain sometimes take no signal as pain? Who knows how a brain will interpret the nervous system shutting down, I bet pain can be a big part of it.</p></div>		</li>
