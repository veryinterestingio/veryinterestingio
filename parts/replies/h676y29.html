			<div class="markdown"><p>But really it doesn't have to change. The vast majority of people that eat unhealthy and die of obesity, hypertension, and other food related causes live long enough to breed. Evolution's &quot;purpose&quot; is to ensure genes are passed on. This is not being thwarted by our bad eating habits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is still some evolutionary pressure if you die after reproducing. Look up The Selfish Gene for more info.</p>
<p>You're right that a condition that kills you in your 40's and older will have a lot less evolutionary pressure against it than something that kills you before breeding age, but definitely not zero pressure.</p>
<p>Babies whose parents die before helping them mature are worse off. It's even thought that perhaps the reason for menopause is that women at that age can promote the survival of their own genes better by helping take care of grandkids (because your grandkids carry some of your genes) than by having more kids of their own.</p>
<p>Also there's the face that obesity causes fertility problems in both genders, so even if you don't <em>die</em> of obesity before reproductive age, you will have a harder time having kids so evolution will act on that as well.</p></div>		</li>
