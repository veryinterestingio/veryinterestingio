			<div class="markdown"><p>HOCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) is also an inherited heart muscle disease. HCM is often associated with mutations in sarcomere genes--structures in the muscle cells. HCM causes thickening of heart muscle, especially obvious in the septum, which is between the right and left sides of the heart. ARVC is often associated with mutations in genes for the cardiac desmosome--you can think of the desmosome as the molecular glue that holds heart cells together. ARVC causes enlargement of the right-side of the heart and thinning of the muscle. ARVC and HCM look very different on cardiac MRI and EKG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physical exam; don't forget those step 1 and 2 buzzwords because they're often actually meaningful. HCM is problematic because of LVOT obstruction unlike ARVC. So in HCM you'll hear a systolic murmur at the LLSB particularly when you worsen the obstruction under conditions of decreased preload (e.g. sudden standing) and improvement when you facilitate venous return (e.g. squatting, leg raise). I'm less familiar with ARVC but--if the name is accurate--you might hear signs of right-heart dysfunction (e.g. a right-sided S3). Of course, many of these things are occult but physical exam is (at least in the US) the difference between getting that screening echo and not. And, of course, if all you have is a hammer everything looks like ARVC, so keep that differential wide (especially for sudden syncope in a kid/young-adult) e.g. congenital and acquired LQTS, HCM, ARVC, anomalous coronary arteries, and plenty, plenty of non-cardiac causes (e.g. seizures).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May also be interesting to know that there is a similar risk calculator for HCM utilizing some similar characteristics as this risk calculator for ARVC. This is one of the big conundrums with these infrequent but certainly important genetic cardiac diseases - how best to risk stratify the risk of a dangerous heart rhythm leading to sudden death.</p></div>		</li>
