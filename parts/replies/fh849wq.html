			<div class="markdown"><p>In reality it's probably impossible for a terrestrial planet to orbit there naturally.   The radiation emitted by the accretion disk would have burned away the atmosphere and ocean.   So you can either assume that a) the planet wasn't created naturally, but is an artificial construct made by the future humans or b) the movie writers took a few liberties.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it in theory possible that the planet was one of those planets with no solar system and it just “recently” was flung to/arrived at that spot?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So while the planet itself may have been in a stable orbit, there's simply no way their ship could have caught up with it to land on it.</p>

<p>Wouldn't the ship reach that speed simply by falling towards the black hole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It actually would be faster than the orbital speed.</p>
<p>So it would need to declarate!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Momentum is conserved. If you fall down towards a celestial body, you will go up again. Unless you hit the body, or in case of a black hole, come too close to the event horizon. It is actually twice as hard to shoot a rocket into the sun than it is to shoot a rocket out of the solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even basic science would have known about the time difference between the surface and where the ship was beforehand. </p>
<p>They would have known that the person who landed there had technically only been there for &quot;a few hours.&quot; </p>
<p>The frequency of the data signal coming off of whatever was there would have been extremely red shifted because of the time difference, and the scientists would have had to account for that to even RECEIVE the signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/collegiaal25" target="_blank">collegiaal25</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The frequency would be down from Gigahertz to dozens of kilohertz. You'd need an entirely different type of antenna to receive it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other part that broke Interstellar for me was that they'd even consider Miller's planet to be worth investigating as habitable.  It may have liquid water and an oxygen-rich atmosphere, but you'd think that extreme time dilation would take it right off the table.  After 24 hours on the surface, everyone you know and probably their kids are dead.  How do you maintain contact with the rest of humanity, receive supplies, etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't. That was the point of the mission, to start a new colony and leave earth behind. The issue I had was how close the planet was to the black hole. If I was sitting in a meeting discussing the lazarus missions I would have said &quot;That planet is extremely close to Gargantua, we probably shouldn't waste time and resources to check its viability.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, <em>recieving</em> supplies and colonists wouldn't be difficult.  The time dilation means Earth is sending supplies far faster than they're being consumed.  </p>
<p><em>Maintaining contact</em> would be a challenge. After an initial frenzy of receiving decades worth of stuff in a single day they'd simply lose contact with Earth as it died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the part where the rather sleek shuttle thingy can descend to and ascend from a planet larger than Earth, with an atmosphere and an orbit close to a black hole all by itself. Yet they still bother strapping a big conventional booster to it when launching from earth?</p></div>		</li>
