<p>Chewing exercises the masseter muscle, so if this article is correct, then there could be a relationship between food toughness and maxillary width.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm not disputing that chewing may have developmental effects on the width or size of the jaw, these studies have a hard time providing conclusive evidence that there is causation. In dental school, they certainly do not teach a causal relationship between chewing tough or hard foods and wider jaws as a well proven fact as of this time.</p></div>		</li>
