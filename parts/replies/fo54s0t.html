However, a true pandemic would require the disease to be easily contagious, which usually means spread by respirated droplets (flu, Covid19) or skin lesions (smallpox), or spread by animals that can't be easily controlled (plague, zika, hantavirus).  Not everything on that list spreads easily.  Lots of good candidates on that list, though!</p></div>		</li>
