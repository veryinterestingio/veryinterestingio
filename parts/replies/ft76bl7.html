Some medications arent metabolized, some arent even absorbed in the gut and work in the GI tract. its very hard to generalize it in that way. The easiest way to &quot;generalize&quot; dosing is the start low and titrate up method, where they start someone on a low dose and increase until it either works as desired or the patient gets side effects.</p></div>		</li>
