			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason LOCKR is such a powerful technology is that it can be genetically encoded. Once the proteins were designed, we codon optimized the proteins and synthesized the genes using a service such as IDT gBlocks. We then used a variety of different technologies to integrate LOCKR into the genome of our cells, including old-school homologous recombination and CRISPR/Cas9 in yeast, to lentivirus in human cells. The expression of LOCKR proteins can be regulated in a variety of ways using synthetic biology techniques. Our lab has developed a set of inducible systems for controlling gene expression in yeast (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00251?src=recsys" target="_blank">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00251?src=recsys</a>), as well as human cells (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/506188v2" target="_blank">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/506188v2</a>). Finally, because LOCKR is completely genetically encodable (in contrast to other synthetic systems for regulating proteins), we were able to use degronLOCKR to construct a feedback circuit that self-regulates the expression level of any protein of interest! -AN</p></div>		</li>
