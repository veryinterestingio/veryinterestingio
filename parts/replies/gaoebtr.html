			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on culture: in Japan you can walk in a bar and sit among dozens of people wearing the same Pyjama. That is because of a capsule hotel nearby (no space) that provides Pyjamas to their guests. Everyone is fine with that. </p>
<p>The restrictions are arbitrary local rules. Nothing more, nothing less. There is no „reason“.</p>
<p>A reason would be something: free hanging tits/dicks are at risk due to rotary machinery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just reminded me of my ex-roommate. American Indian elder, enjoyed his booze. I heard him come home one night from the bar right next door. He got ready for bed with his blue snowflake pajamas. Next thing I know, he's not home anymore. He went back next door, in his snowflake pajamas, to do more shots.
At least he didn't come home again with his hair down from his ponytail - cause that meant he got pissed and into a fight with someone. Thanks for the memories lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about the swimming In underwear it's the stigma of seeing me in a bikini is fine,  but oh you saw my underwear ? That's completely different. They are literally the same thing. They provide the same general concept. They cover the groin, and genitals, and the same with bras/bikini tops. </p>
<p>We have have broken concepts about being dressed, and different garments having different ideas. If I want to wear PJ'S out so be it. Clothing has a single basic concept. It is to cover up our skin. Thats it. If you are fine wearing a bikini for thousands to see it should be zero different if you were to wear the same underwear in Said place. Same goes to guys.</p></div>		</li>
