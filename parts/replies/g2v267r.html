			<div class="markdown"><p>And then there's Atara Biotherapeutics anti-EBV adoptive T-cell therapy. It's not FDA approved yet, but you can get it on a compassionate basis. They isolate EBV specific T-cells from healthy donors. They create a library of T-cells with different HLA alleles. They then infuse people with EBV an HLA-matched EBV-specific T-cell. Since they're HLA-matched, you don't get rejection of the T-cells and you get proper antigen recognition. Since EBV infection is so prevalent, you have a huge pool of donors. Since they're EBV-specific, you don't get graft versus host effect. They've essentially created something akin to a blood bank where, rather than having a pool of red cells with various ABO subtypes, they have a pool of T-cells with various HLA subtypes. It's a really cool, and yet so simple, technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is Epstein Bar Virus. The company that does this is called Atara Biotechnologies. I have no idea where they get their donors from or if they are still collecting T-cells from them. My guess is that they are paired up with a variety of apheresis centers, usually blood banks or academic centers. They will pay people for their cells and then sell them to Atara. It's probably advertised on the inside of buses, etc: &quot;We need blood donors! Compensated for your time.&quot; The donor probably doesn't even know what their cells are going for. They just want their $250. The blood banking world is strange and sometimes sketchy. Don't ask me how I know this...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doing research on this sounds completely badass (but also probably stressful af most times honestly so props). Honestly I was hoping to find a comment about exactly this. I remembered enough about like HLA matching and T cell therapies from immuno my first year of med school to know that they were probably involved in the answer¿ but I had no clue about the specifics. So thank you for that!
It must be absolutely fascinating to watch this stuff in action and be at the front end of research like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. It has been fascinating to see the progress we have made as a field in immunology. It is indeed very stressful, we are in constant state of anxiety since experiments either work or fail, which might impact patient survival, and the ever looming threat of someone scooping your research work you've done for past few years. Having said that, don't thank me !! I get paid by taxpayer (yes) to do research, and study what I love, I'm always thankful for that (although I wouldn't complain if I got paid more lol).</p></div>		</li>
