<p>I haven't been following the technical details but from the standard news coverage I got the idea that mRNA vaccines as a whole are quite novel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cells normally produce tens of thousands of different mRNA all the time. If the huge normal mRNA production doesn’t get broken, this one added one isn’t going to change the risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The process where ribosomes use the information from mRNA to form proteins is called translation. For an mRNA to be read by ribosomes and translated into protein, it has to have a certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA#Structure" target="_blank">structure</a>. This includes a so-called 5'-cap on the &quot;head&quot; end, a certain start codon and a stop codon. If an mRNA for any reason would be &quot;broken&quot;, it would no longer have this structure and so couldn't be translated into protein. </p>
<p>Even if it was, the resulting protein would likely be non-functional. Malformed proteins aren't &quot;toxic&quot; as you might think. Instead, they're non-functional, and will eventually be broken down by the cell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking well outside my understanding of biology here but isn't there a tiny risk that a malformed protein is toxic / harmful. If I'm not mistaken vCJD is caused by a malformed protein that catalyses the misfolding of other proteins. Considering how complex the folding of a protein is I would assume the risk you accidentally make a functional protein is miniscule but it's surely not zero.</p></div>		</li>
