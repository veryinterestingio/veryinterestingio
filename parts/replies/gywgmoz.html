			<div class="markdown"><p>I think because it falls off much more slowly than the others. A tiny magnet can overcome the gravity of an entire planet...but the magnet's pull drops to nearly zero at just a few inches away, while the planet's barely changes at ten thousand miles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the same initially, but once you even out the variables, it really shows gravity's relative weakness. Not counting black holes, you need like a planet-size object to exert a reasonable force. Imagine a magnet of that size. </p>
<p>I think what makes gravity such a prevalent force in the universe is that every object with mass or energy exerts it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is really weak though. The weight of the entire planet is pulling on you. The earth is roughly 6*10^24kg, literally gazillions of times the mass of a human. And yet we walk upright and even the average person can jump into the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>gravity being extremely weak comes from using a measurement system that comes from mankind. if you use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units" target="_blank">planck units</a>, which are based on universal constants, gravity is just as strong as the other forces. its just that the proton has about a single unit of charge, but only a fraction of a single unit of mass.</p></div>		</li>
