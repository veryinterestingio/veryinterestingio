			<div class="markdown"><p>That's some of it, but there's also that when we're looking for things, we're used to &quot;discarding&quot; most of our environment because it's irrelevant noise, in the same way that you can drive a familiar route on autopilot and not actually remember your drive. So you're &quot;looking&quot;, but you're not actually looking, because this is how you always do things in your house--you know what you're doing and just do it without noticing everything else around you. It's not &quot;distraction&quot; per se as much as it's routine disengagement in a familiar place. You can be having all those thoughts while you still pull yourself out of autopilot, and &quot;mindfully&quot; search, ie take notice of where you're looking, what you're seeing, and how you're doing it, instead of scanning. It's like the difference between scanning the daily weather like usual, and stopping to take the time to actually LOOK at each of the numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kept a journal for a year and got very good at expressing thoughts with exactly the right words in very compelling terms. It came of giving <em>a lot</em> of thought to the words I wanted to use because the journal was an intentionally therapeutic endeavor.</p>
<p>In short: practice makes perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I often do in order to mitigate the &quot;routine disengagement&quot; effect is to grab a flashlight and to slowly and methodically sweep it across every inch of the room(s) I'm searching in. I find that doing this forces me to focus on everything in the beam instead of discarding the familiar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that totally makes sense. Especially in this situation that made me post... couldn’t find my smokes and I was def thinking “this sucks, I’m gonna have to go to the store, I don’t want to have to go to the store” etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this is why turning off the lights and using a flashlight helps, since you are only focused on the spot the beam hits, limiting the extraneous visual info your brain needs to process</p></div>		</li>
