<p>So, SpaceX went for a commodity strategy - build one really really good motor to serve first and second stage, rely on modern control electronics to regulate 9 motors operating together in the first stage, and engineer for reusability, and get your reliability that way, and dramatically cut costs to fly the rocket and use that money to pay for the new R&amp;D. Digital feedback control wasn't the only thing that had dramatically advanced since the 70s, so had manufacturing techniques and materials engineering. So SpaceX could build simpler rockets that performed better than was possible in the 70s. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the definition of a &quot;really good motor&quot; is a flexible one.  To be sure it is a good motor but it is good in its kinda middle of the road performance (meaning it is a good all-around engine).  But that is ok...you can build a space shuttle engine which has notably better performance but costs waaaaay more to build.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong at all with the SpaceX engine.  It is an excellent rocket engine for what they want to do.  And it is very complex and pushing the envelope, particularly in material science to be able to run at the temperatures they want.  Something they could not do in the 70s.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbH1ZDImaI8" target="_blank">good rundown if you are interested (it is interesting).</a></p></div>		</li>

They were using RP-1, they knew that they couldn't compete with hydrogen's efficiency so they focused on something else for the design. Having such a ludicrously high TWR is what has allowed Falcon 9 to use nine engines in its first stage without massive increases to dry mass which would kill cargo capacity for reusable hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree - SpaceX was running circles around the launch capability NASA had before they had reuse capability. And, as OP mentioned, there are many other companies out there, without reusability, that are developing rockets that would be cheaper than what existed when they started.</p>
<p>Reuse is obviously a huge boon, but the reason private industry is able to outpace NASA has more to do with the ability create a clear, consistent mandate and not having Congress in control of their entire budget. Reuse is just the icing on top - it's what NASA would be doing were they not stuck with a mandate that changes every 4-8 years, having to source parts of various Congressional district, and having to worry about Congressional backlash if they failed repeated in the development process.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Apples and oranges. NASA is not Space X's competitor. Space X competes with the United Launch Alliance, for instance. ULA flies the Atlas V launch vehicle family, which has a very nearly perfect reliability record. NASA's mission is research and exploration, not commercial launch services.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. The manned spaceflight division of NASA was essentially captured and diverted into becoming a jobs program, rather than focus on the tasks at hand. Space colonization advocate Robert Zubrin (in a recent talk on the YT show Event Horizon) called this (paraphrasing) a &quot;transaction-driven program&quot; rather than a &quot;purpose-driven program&quot;, i.e. simply serving to distribute taxpayer money rather than serving to accomplish anything.</p>
<p>No worries -- Spaceflight <em>will</em> generate jobs, magnitudes more than the few inefficient disposable rocket supply chains located in strategic US states provide, once we get enough capacity to get to orbit by routine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SpaceX wouldn't have even started if the aforementioned technological changes hadn't taken place. SpaceX was hardly running circles around existing launch capacity. They had a cheap rocket with a limited utility. That utility expanded considerably as the Merlin engine got better, as they developed the Heavy, and as they got reusability. </p>
<p>The Atlas V was a more reliable rocket, with comparable capabilities. But they like everyone else were production limited. Reusability is what allowed SpaceX to dramatically up their cadence. But the RD-180 in the Atlas V is 20 years old, and there's no incentive to refine that motor because of that reliability - instead they want sales to pay off the R&amp;D involved. </p>
<p>Reusability provides a new incentive to continue to invest. It's a completely different approach to rocket building. Nobody gets up in the morning and builds the exact capacity car they need to get to work. I drive to work every day with 3 empty seats. That's fine, because the fuel cost to carry the extra seats is minimal, and when I do need 4 seats, I don't need to buy a different car. That's SpaceXs future. More rocket isn't a problem because fuel is extremely cheap. That guides their design. It doesn't guide anyone elses - at least not yet. </p>
<p>Your argument would make sense if NASA was the only customer, but SpaceX didn't have them as a customer for a while. They had private customers - the same customers that ULA was going for. ULA could and should have built the Falcon 9, but they didn't, and that's not NASAs fault, it's ULAs fault.</p></div>		</li>
