			<div class="markdown"><p>Google mRNA decay</p>
<p>But I'll give you the cliffs notes version:</p>
<p>It gets chewed up by one of two things: Xrn1 or The Exosome</p>
<p>Xrn1 is a 5'-&gt;3' exonuclease (front to back) that will destroy mRNAs once they lose their special cap.</p>
<p>The Exosome is a complex of multiple proteins that, with help from the Ski7 complex, will degrade mRNAs from 3'-&gt;5' direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, this poly a tail is not in the DNA sequence.  There is a poly a signal sequence at the end of the gene that recruits a polyA polymerase that adds a distributed amount of As, usually 100-300</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, for our genes there are poly A signals in each gene that recruit special machinery. This cuts the nascent transcript and adds a poly A tail.</p>
<p>For some viruses, like SARS2, the tail is genetically encoded (in the RNA, since it's got no DNA)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s protective and helps regulate translation to some degree. The poly-A tail is coated by an RNA binding protein named PABP that coordinates a lot of the cytoplasmic lifecycle of an mRNA from its regulation, translation, localization and eventual decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-poly A transcripts actually still can get translated in vivo. The tail is mainly for PABP binding in order to regulate its stability. But good explanation otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
