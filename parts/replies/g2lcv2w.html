			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of kidneys... I am on peritoneal dialysis and recently had an issue where I was becoming dehydrated and causing my blood pressure to drop too low. I didn't feel thirsty at all so I didn't immediately associate it with dehydration. I've since been drinking more water and my blood pressure has gone up. </p>
<p>It sounds like because my kidneys aren't working right my body didn't get the memo that it was thirsty? Or is there more to it than that?</p></div>		</li>
