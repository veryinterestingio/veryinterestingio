			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry that you had to go through that ,I wish I could help more but the main thing that helped me calm down was telling myself what happens ,happens so just focus on taking your meds which is now my safety blanket particularly in the evenings. Other things like being aware of your surroundings , like I’ve had a few fits now where I hit the kitchen or bathroom tiles so limit time spent in water. Tbh stairs/escalators are still anxiety inducing , I know this advice isn’t helpful but it’s my coping method . There’s the r/Epilepsy page that’s been a great support when I feel alone in this, maybe ask your neuro about other meds for quelling anxiety if it becomes too unmanageable. Stay safe x</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thnx for your reply, main problem now is that I was really strict with my meds when I got the seizure so that's kind of unsettling. Neuro wouldn't up my meds yet, but maybe the anxiety is something that has to wear down over time as well.. </p>
<p>Once again, thnx for the advice, I'll definitely visit the subreddit soon. Stay safe as well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that too , sometimes your brain just wants to ruin your day , meds only do so much unfortunately. I still have seizures even on 2 meds but they’re a lot shorter and infrequent than before. I think seizures whilst on meds is called a breakthrough seizure?
My neuro’s response to my seizures is to just keep increasing the dosages which I don’t think helps as I still have at least one every 2 months. I got diagnosed 4? Years ago now so over time you just get used to it being a dark cloud over you. It’s still in the back of my mind constantly so I’m probably not the best one to comfort you but it does become your new normal which is seriously depressing so I try to avoid dwelling on it. I think stress , sleep deprivation and electrolyte levels are my main triggers so at least I’m aware of those. And no worries , do check that sub out tho it’s become my open diary of sorts lol it’s been a great relief to me knowing others have the same worries and issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, someone who has the exact same triggers as me!
Alcohol is a big one. I still have a few beers or wine every now and then but if I get drunk, my hangovers are fucking wild and I feel like I'm on the edge of having a seizure for about 24 hours. I constantly get absent moments during physical activity. It doesn't stop me and I find the fitter I am the less severe, but man they can be a real inconvenience when training.
I haven't had a fit for over 10 years but I've had recent EEGs including sleep deprivation ones and MRIs. All show no irregularities but I'm scared to go off the meds.</p>
<p>I've noticed in the last few years my memory, communication, and alertness has really deteriorated. I'm in my 30s now and I'm a bit worried the meds are slowing my cognitive function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically for fear of a seizure, ask your neurologist what the chance of you having another one will be. After around 5 years without one, you're down to less than 10%.</p>
<p>Just avoid things that increase your chance of a seizure - alcohol, lack of sleep, grapefruit (grapefruit interacts with pretty much every medication around) and accept that if you have a seizure, you are gonna feel like crap at minimum - just try to alert someone if you can.</p>
<p>or at least lose consciousness safely (I usually lean forward if I feel one coming on) - better to break the nose that slam my back on something</p></div>		</li>
