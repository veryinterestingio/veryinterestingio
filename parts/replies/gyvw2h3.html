<p>So one of the most elegant aspects of these mRNA vaccines is that they present something to the body and then vanish.</p>

<p>In addition, the instructions they contain are &quot;only what we needed&quot;, unlike vaccines made from dead or attenuated viruses.</p>
<p>Metaphorically speaking... We don't need to scare our cells by dropping a corpse(?) of <em>Friday the 13th</em>'s villain Jason on their doorstep and hoping that the serial killer won't come back to life. </p>
<p>Instead we just take a hockey mask and dangle it in a darkened doorway. Much safer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read and spoken with some biochemists who have echoed the synopsis below - any other info or analysis?</p>
<p>Most vaccines (Type 1, e.g. subunit and inactivated virus) are essentially “MHC-2 only,” get taken up by dendritic cell phagocytosis and presented to CD4 T-cells in lymph nodes, so little to no CD8-mediated cytotoxicity against presenting cells. Attenuated virus vaccines like MMR (“Type 2”) do have some cytotoxicity mediated by CD8 lymphocytes attacking target cells presenting viral epitopes on MHC-1 cell-surface molecules, <em>but still limited to the tropism of the wild-type virus</em>. That’s where the lipid nanoparticles make mRNA vaccines elementally different from both, with a likely much broader tropism. Even if they’re not omnitropic, it seems that they can enter a much broader tissue range compared to even attenuated virus vaccines. Since the mRNA vaccines would induce SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein expression, that seems to mean that people who get the mRNA vaccines are going to have a much greater range of cells and tissues vulnerable to cytotoxic attack, since they’d be expressing the spike protein on MHC-I molecules. While this may prove to be more immunostimulatory, it also seems to indicate that the mRNA vaccines pose a greater risk of systemic and critical tissue and organ damage than other vaccines, especially if multiple booster shots are needed, with side effects that may not manifest for years (with cumulative damage and chronic inflammation). </p>
<p>The nightmare scenario would be if e.g. the mRNA vaccines’ lipid nanoparticles are, indeed, crossing the BBB and getting endocytosed into critical glial cells, like oligodendrocytes, or even worse, into neurons themselves in the brain and spinal cord, putting a bullseye on these critical cells for cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes. If so, we’d be setting the stage for a rash of multiple sclerosis and ALS-type clinical scenarios down the road with multiple boosters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;nightmare scenario&quot; is just very unlikely.  ALS and MS are diseases where there is a CONSTANT assault on these neural support cells by the immune system.  </p>
<p>These cells do regenerate and I don't think, even with regular boosters, you will see a clinically significant amount of irrepairable damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s tough to paint autoimmune or immune-mediated issues as ‘well understood’. Of note - military, and in particular, gulf war veterans suffer from MS and ALS-type conditions at much higher rates than the general populace. </p>
<p>There is only a small part of the MS/ALS/autoimmune affected population with potential hereditary links. </p>
<p>That means the genesis of these disorders is largely exogenous, and not well understood. </p>
<p>To your point, I don’t like using inflammatory language, and “nightmare scenario” probably qualifies as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given mRNA's transient nature I think any suggestion of a &quot;down the road&quot; scenario is implausible. You would either see an immediate effect or none at all.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that it is only cells that <em>get caught</em> making (via class I MHC) or expressing spike protein on their cell surface (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570024/#:~:text=This%20figure%20increases%20to%200.5,3%20and%209%20days8" target="_blank">average protein turnover is about 3-9 days</a>) which will be subject to cytotoxic effects. I am not aware of any known biological mechanism which would result in any trace of spike protein or its mRNA remaining anywhere in the body for more than a week or two after vaccination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The discussion is not whether the actual vaccine ingredients or spike proteins created as a result of the mRNA will live on in their initial forms - but rather if the priming mechanism meant to stimulate the peripheral immune system and provide systemic immunity, could potentiate deleterious effects upon secondary exposure (post-priming). </p>
<p>Here is some further reading re: neuroimmunology and microglia, CNS, priming and post-priming second immune stimulus:</p>
