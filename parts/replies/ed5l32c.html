<p>It's really not up to you to decide if it's simple enough.<br />
It's the OP and the people who waste time reading something they can't understand who should have the say.    </p>
<p>If you're not the OP, why should it matter if <em>you're</em> satisfied?    </p>
<p>ELI5 seems like it's for people who tried google and Wikipedia, but need things made <em>more</em> simple.<br />
If the ELI5 requires the reader to go to Wikipedia to understand the explanation, then it failed.   </p>
<p>If the reader can <em>then</em> go to Wikipedia and finally <em>begin</em> to understand, that's an achievement unlocked.   </p></div>		</li>
