<p>Here are the &quot;minimum requirements for technical performance&quot; for 5G as of this moment (notice &quot;5G&quot; isn't mentioned in this literature). All this is subject to change as well. As mentioned above, 5Ge includes &quot;Real&quot; 5G wireless technologies. I'd say that makes it &quot;Real 5G.&quot; </p>
<p>There is going to be some overlap and revision as the ITU arbitrates the standardization. </p>
<p>The ELi5 = All those things (4G, 4G LTE, 5G) mean that the companies that provide your cell phone service are coordinating to make it better, while making it similar enough between them to make it efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had thought this was the case, thanks for your answer. I saw some comments about why I care for faster mobile internet and the answer to that is because when capability scales so will data and we'll get much cooler stuff over the internet. Which will be pretty dope. </p>
<p>Also I thought this was the simplest answer so thanks again :) </p></div>		</li>
