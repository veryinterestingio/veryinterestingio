			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems it is saying, &quot;I grew up in Florida, and got accustomed to it always being so humid that I cannot imagine dry heat, for me if I visit somewhere and the temp reads 106F but it's not crazy humid, for me it really <em>feels like</em> 90F from what I'm used to&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Minnesota and visited Phoenix a few times.  One time I was helping set up a Halloween party so had the opportunity to do a little physical work outside. I still sweat like a pig and was miserable in direct sunlight but out of the sun and in the evening it's a lot nicer than in humidity.</p>
<p>The 2nd night there we were just sitting outside in the evening, no direct sun.  I was pretty sure it was about 75 degrees when in fact it was 89 degrees.</p></div>		</li>
