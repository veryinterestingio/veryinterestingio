<p>Something that I've used to great effect is a win list, or whatever you'd like to call it. I have a notebook, and every night, I write down 5 things of any kind I need to and can realistically do tomorrow. Anything from a project at work to laundry to wishing a friend a happy birthday. If I check off everything that day, I write a big W on the page. If not, a big L goes on it. If I can win 5 or more days of a week, that week is a win, and if I win 3 or more weeks in a month, that month is a win. The goal is to win some and lose some, because we're only human. The numbers are arbitrary, so if I legitimately can't think of 5 things to do, I'll write less, but either way, writing that big W still feels nice.</p></div>		</li>
