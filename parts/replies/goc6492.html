<p>Your body actually has several minutes worth of oxygen stored up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;stored&quot; I guess but really it's more that your body just isn't perfectly efficient. You don't have the ability to store oxygen in your body in the sense that you can create oxygen reserves, your body just doesn't extract and use all of the oxygen in a single breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have several stores of oxygen. In your lungs (relatively small reserves) and you have various forms of oxygenbinding hemoproteins (the majority in hemoglobin in the blood, and then myoglobin/cytoglobin/neuroglobin in various cell tissues). Which is why you can &quot;not breathe&quot; for a few minutes and you're fine (when diving for example), but an aortal rupture and you'll go unconscious within seconds as blood pressure drops and the hemoglobin becomes depleted or unusuable to cell tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean that you can set it aside like your kitchen pantry storage, just that you don't use all of what you breathe in immediately. Takes time to either build up or deplete what is in your system, exactly how long depends on what the problem is. A small bleed or decrease in respiratory status would take longer to cause unconsciousness etc than a major bleed or full airway failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thereâ€™s enough oxygen to prevent cellular decay for a few minutes, but not enough to maintain consciousness or brain activity.</p>
<p>I think the OPs question pertains more to whether or not you are conscious or can perceive anything after your heart stops, rather than being legally dead at that very moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When your heart stops, the blood stops going through the lungs for gas exchange and stops bringing oxygen to your brain. You lose consciousness faster when your heart stops than if you were to stop getting oxygen (like if you're choking for example), so really you wouldn't be conscious for very long at all. Most of the time you're &quot;alive&quot; from the residual circulating oxygen you are unconscious or very confused if awake at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not as much as with providing artificial ventilations via BVM. Also the term &quot;passive ventilation&quot; in regards to CPR protocols (in my area) actually refers to placing an oxygen mask on the patient but not ventilating, compared to manually ventilating the patient with a BVM. Chest compressions do have an effect regarding the recoil however your lungs would normally expand. It's more like if you were being squished and the weight comes off rather than being able to take an actual deep breath.</p></div>		</li>
