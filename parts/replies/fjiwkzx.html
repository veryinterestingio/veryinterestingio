			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, but for the most part not enough to ruin a study. Itâ€™s usually a secondary choice. Doctors will do it if it means we get data. Theyâ€™d rather have the slight chance that you sleep harder than usual, than you just not sleep at all. Plus we have sleep questionnaires that ask all sorts of questions about your normal and your sleep history. It gives us the general idea of what youâ€™d sleep like without the sleep aid. But yeah, like I said itâ€™s generally just to get data. Canâ€™t diagnose anything if there is no sleep, but we can potentially get a great idea for diagnosis if you do sleep with a single night dose. </p>
<p>Also, long term usage of medications, alcohol, drugs, etc changes your sleep chemistry over time. One night of ambien or trazodone or melatonin isnâ€™t going to do too much.</p></div>		</li>
