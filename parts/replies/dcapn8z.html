			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, this still isn't the best example, because gaslighting is never related to just <em>one</em> example. From my own experience, the abuser would always make such a big deal about not being trusted that I would start acting like I believed her lies in order to stop the fights. Eventually these incidences accumulate and then you start questioning your ability to tell whether or not she was really lying. </p>
<p>No one really lies that much, right? Maybe I am overreacting to the fact that she did something or that she might be lying? Oh, I'm freaking out a lot? You're right maybe I am Borderline Personality Disorder. Oh everyone else is telling you that my temper is awful and im abusive? You're right I can't trust any of these people except for you. I have no friends now, but I guess they were never real friends anyway if they were talking badly about me to you....</p>
<p>And then you end up getting a therapist and taking psycho meds until your therapist realizes that you're actually the victim of an abusive relationship. I probably would have never gotten out if it wasn't for the fact that she convinced me that I was the one that needed help. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just don't feel like this is because of some sort of character flaw in yourself. Everyone is susceptible to this sort of manipulation, and the fact you were manipulated says more about the person that did this than it says about you.</p></div>		</li>
