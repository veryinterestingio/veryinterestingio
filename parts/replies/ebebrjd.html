			<div class="markdown"><p>Artists are expected to be able to adapt to any production and create art that looks like it came from a single artist, and directors are no different. While each director brings his own individuality to the series, because they're hired by producers to make the show, unless they're specifically given free rein like in Pop Team Epic there are certain stylistic boundaries they will not mess with so it still looks like the same show</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lighting is literally that, designing the light sources to convey the emotion and story of a shot. The way you set up your lights in a shot deeply affects the colors and the mood of the scene. For example, imagine that there's a character in a room and he's supposed to be a scary mysterious killer. Dim flickering lights that turns him into a mysterious silhouette and creates a dark oppressive atmosphere would work much better than full fluorescent lights that creates comfortable colors. That's the kind of stuff you can lavish time on in a movie but not so much in a tv series. I hope that answers your question </p></div>		</li>
