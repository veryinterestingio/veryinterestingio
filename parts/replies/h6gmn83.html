			<div class="markdown"><p>My uncle raised chickens for a few years, the feed store recommend 'Rocket Fuel™' brand chicken feed. I don't know what was in it but they grew FAST.  Every now and then they had one that one leg would grow to twice the size of the other over the course of a few days, so they had to cull it.  Never been much of a fan of chicken since then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a phenomenon known as &quot;woody breast&quot; that has been bred into modern chickens - the chickens develop breast tissue with unpleasantly flavoured and textured streaks of fat through it. It significantly reduces the nutritional profile and also gives it a raw, tough texture even when well cooked.</p>
<p>It's particularly bad in Australia and China, due to the sharing of chicken breeds between the two. </p>
<p>Attempts to breed woody breast out of the population are failing because the woody breast chickens weigh more and nobody gives a shit that they taste bad and are fattier with less protein</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GMO typically doesn't refer to selective breeding. Instead it refers to direct genetic manipulation, i.e. taking a gene for a specific trait from one organism and inserting it directly into the genome of the target organism. This often involves genes from extremely disparate species, something that can't be done with selective breeding. Selective breeding will change the genome in many ways at once, often unpredictably, but always very slightly for every generation. One concern about GMO is that the single gene transfer may have unintended consequences due to how genes interact with each other. Selective breeding mixes and matches genes that have already evolved to work with each other, GMO inserts what may be a wildcard into the deck.</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear, GMO is not inherently bad. Most anti-GMO rhetoric is simple fear-mongering, marketers and politicians preying on people's fear of the unknown. There are legitimate concerns, but not enough to select a product specifically for its &quot;GMO-free&quot; label, or to stop the research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO the biggest problem with GMO discussion/definition is that it isn't just transferring genes between species, but it also includes making any changes, including just single nucleotide modification, so basically a precise way to do selective breeding. Instead we mutate genomes blindly and go with what we get, only really looking at the genes of interest, who knows what else mutated. Not that it would suddenly start producing poison, just like transferring known genes from other species wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GMOs get caught up in the abhorrent business practices of Monsanto and the like.</p>
<p>Many years ago California had a proposition that would require all GMO foods to be labeled as such. (I voted against it because it would lead to a prop 65 scenario where all food in the U.S. says &quot;this product may contain GMO idk really good luck I guess&quot;.) The full text on the ballot was all about pesticides, and how GMO promotes the use of pesticides, how pesticides are bad for you, you need to know if it's GMO so you can wash off the pesticides, etc etc. I thought damn, if the problem is pesticides then let's cut out the middleman and label the pesticides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fear mongering mostly.</p>
<p>Notice how some products label themselves as &quot;natural&quot; (this means nothing, by the way.)
This is because people are under the wrong impression that natural things are better for us.</p>
<p>This comes with its own set of boogeymen such as people dismissing food because it is full of &quot;chemicals&quot; or whatever other buzzword people are using to sell you their shittier but more expensive product.</p>
<p>There are some things that are a bit more valid though. Meat from farms where animals are treated better actually can justify a higher price by not cutting corners in humane treatment. But unless YOU personally have any allergies or sensibilities to look out for, most of the vague labellings that products have mean nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. GMOs can be just crops with some genes edited out... but they can also have genes from something else added, like maybe from a jellyfish, some insect, or some other crops.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily bad, but it is somewhat risky: crops that haven't poisoned anyone for the last century, can be presumed to have genes that don't lead to mass poisoning... but adding genes from other organisms, which have never been used in crops, &quot;could&quot; cause some interaction that &quot;could&quot; have some nocive effects. Researchers are supposed to test GMO crops exhaustively, but currently the testing is based on &quot;not finding anything nocive during testing&quot; instead of &quot;making sure that nothing nocive can ever develop&quot;, so some people would rather only eat the&quot;have been safe for centuries&quot; crops.</p>
<p>Then... some people don't understand any of this and only care about protesting, what can you do.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That applies to almost every protest, 95% (and I am being generous with that number) don't really understand what they are protesting and just follow their leaders, either due to ideological conditioning, or financial considerations.</p>
<p>Having said that, you mention that there has been no long term study of whether these are safe, requiring such certification isn't fear mongering, it is a prudent strategy.</p>
<p>The other point that isn't mentioned here is that most GMO are sold as a &quot;service&quot; to the farmers, they can grow only if they buy the seed from the company every cycle, i.e. they can't replant the seeds from previous crop. This makes the farmer dependent and at the mercy of the company. Sure if the farmer chose to go with it, you can argue that they chose to do so, no body pointed a gun on their heads to go GMO route. But....</p>
<p>You know what happens in the nature? Pollination. You can't fully control that, so winds, insects, birds may crosspollinate a GMO with non-GMO, thus contaminating the non-GMO crops. Now, the farmers who want non-GMO can't get top dollars for their crop. Unfortunately, they can do nothing (like, sue the company) to recoup their loss. </p>
<p>Now the double whammy for such farmers, since their crop now has the GMO component, companies forbid them from planting seeds from their own crop as they claim it is a patent violation, they have been sued and due to immense financial resources of these companies, the farmers have lost. </p>
<p>These two (cross pollination, and patent enforcement) will eventually lead to a monopoly and lack of bio-diversity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the problem, the idea that a GMO crop could be harmful to eat is just complete conjecture at the moment. </p>
<p>However while that's the point that most anti-GMO people hang on, there is actually some valid points. </p>
<p>For example GMO crops resistant to certain pesticides (like roundup) lead to farmers using these toxic pesticides more commonly, harming the environment.</p></div>		</li>
