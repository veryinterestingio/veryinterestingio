			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, some networks abuse this. Thereâ€™s a reality show I used to watch which was about 1h30 to 2h00 long but there was only 45 mins of actual contents. I swear ads were taking more screentime than the show. Good thing I mostly used to watch it on-demand thereafter so I could skip all the ads.</p></div>		</li>
