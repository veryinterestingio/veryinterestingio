			<div class="markdown"><p>As for your second question about my biggest setback, I would have to say it was when my graduate advisor sat me down a few weeks after I had my second baby in graduate school and told me he thought I wasn't cut out for academia. It made me very depressed for a about two weeks and then I realized that I didn't necessarily need his support to be able to be successful and I started developing working relationships with other professors (both at my university and beyond). And I had a great 'shadow' mentor who was a very successful female professor who had had children during her PhD and post-doc who supported me. My advice would be to seek out many mentors so that you can get multiple perspectives and support when you encounter setbacks, problems or conflicts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of reasons why some species are more susceptible to cancer than others. But most of them come down to this simple fact: Some organisms have evolved to have more cancer suppression mechanisms that others. So then you might ask, why did some evolve more cancer suppression mechanisms? </p>
<p>One reasons is that some organisms are larger and longer lived than others, which would, everything else being equal, lead them to have a greater risk of cancer (because they have more cells that go through more divisions leading to a greater chance of mutations, this is known as Peto's Paradox). These larger and longer lived organisms have to have cancer suppression mechanisms to live long enough to successfully reproduce, so they are under strong selection pressure to evolve these mechanisms (like elephants evolving multiple copies of the cancer suppression gene, TP53).</p>
<p>Another reason is that having a body that is good at suppressing cancer can come with tradeoffs, like slower wound healing, impaired fertility, and even tradeoffs with other diseases.  This is because cells have to do things like moving, dividing and switching around their metabolism to keep us healthy and fertile. And having cells that are more able to do those things also means having cells that are closer to a cancer-like state.
