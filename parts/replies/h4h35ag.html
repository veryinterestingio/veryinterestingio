			<div class="markdown"><p>Believe it or not, it’s pretty common for people to have a missing toe nail or two. I’ve seen two people with no toe nails in my years, and they both still loved getting pedicures. </p>
<p>For a wedding, on my one client, we tried out the fake toe nails, filing them down a bunch so they fit her toes, and nail gluing then strait to her skin. I tried to tell her no, but she was going to do it anyway. I figured I better help. They looked pretty great! She had never worn open toe shoes before. The bad part? They started to pop off throughout the night!! We had a good laugh about it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no actual toenail but these little nails that grow out of the corner of my big toe. And I noticed that I’ve lost fingernails and they never grew back right or at all. My dad and granddad had toes just like mine so it must be some genetic thing involving nail beds. As a kid I was so self conscious about them at the pools I would curl my toes under my feet so no one saw.</p></div>		</li>
