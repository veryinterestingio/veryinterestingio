			<div class="markdown"><p>The phrase I often hear is that in future it is likely you will die 'with' cancer, not 'of' cancer meaning we will manage it to the point of being a chronic disease (in those who don't go in remission).
As you age your cells accumulate mutations, and cancer is caused by cells gaining mutations and starting to ignore their programming and grow uncontrollably. It's basically inevitable if you live long enough - in fact little mini cancers might be starting in your body through your life, but your immune system kills it before it grows into a tumour. So in that sense advanced cancer is both accumulation of mutations and a failure of the immune system. (PHD immunology, worked with cancer researchers)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The interesting thing to think about is that ultimately, if we get really good at treating all the other things that kill you, cancer is likely the thing you will die from.</p>

<p>If you think about it, this could be said for any kind of pathology, therefore, while i think generally you are right, i don’t necessarily agree with your interpretation of cancer as a “catch all mortality disease”. The body does have built in self-destruct mechanisms but i wouldn’t consider cancer one of those. As a matter of fact there are countless ways for the body to fight its own cancer, and if you take everything into consideration, developing cancer is not as certain as it might seem. It is also important to keep in mind that developing cancer at an old age is very different than developing it at a young age - if you are old, cancer will grow very slowly, to the point that often people end up dying from other causes while having cancer, because the progression of the disease is so slow that it is almost irrelevant at an age where cardiovascular disease has a much bigger impact. The true mechanisms of “self-destruction” are rather related to cellular biology and immunology. As you get old, the whole body becomes less and less efficient in its tasks and therefore more vulnerable to any kind of disease. If you consider the human species as a whole, this could be seen as an advantage because, when old “animals” die, young individuals have more resources at their disposal and the genome of the species gets to be “updated” more frequently, resulting in an evolutive advantage for the species.</p></div>		</li>
