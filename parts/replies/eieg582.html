			<div class="markdown"><p>That is hard to say. It will probably not have a huge effect on us directly, though hybrid navigation software and gnss will have to be adjusted (former for the magnetic field, latter for changes in the ionosphere). Not much relies only on the magnetic field for guidance. </p>
<p>The bigger issue is that it is possible the magnetic field will weaken significantly during the reversal. That's not end-of-the-world-bad but it's not particularly good for us, our electronics and our satellites. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic fields is mostly created by the spinning molten metal core, which is itself created by the spinning motion of the earth. That explains why the field has more or less the same axis as the earth. Even if the field flips sometimes, the axis stays the same. It should be the same for all planets that have a spinning core.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would the magnetic pole most likely be at the north or south pole, or could it be along the equator? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t the magnetic pole determine where those are, and the equator is halfway between them? If your looking at a planet isn’t there visually no north and South Pole, until you determine what the magnetic pole is? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's the magnetic poles. If you know the planet's axis of rotation, you know where the poles are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the axis of rotation changes sometimes as well because of wobbling (nutation).  Learned that one not too long ago.  </p></div>		</li>
