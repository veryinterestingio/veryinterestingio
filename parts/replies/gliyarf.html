			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you ever read the story about the doctor who discovered the bacteria that caused ulcers?  He theorized the bacteria was the cause, infected himself with the bacteria, got an ulcer, took antibiotics and the ulcer was cured.   He was part of his &quot;proof&quot;.  Pretty cool dude!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So according to the article at the link, he didn't get an ulcer. Only very, very nasty gastritis. He stopped the experiment then and treated himself. I mean it's cool either way, but it's yet another story that mutates in retelling =)</p></div>		</li>
