			<div class="markdown"><p>CRISPR has been a remarkable new tool in our arsenal to gene edit human stem cells. It does allow us to add, delete, or generally modify genes at a level that was just not possible before. We are using an approach with our stem cells that was published by Danwei Huangfu and her colleagues. Danwei figured out how to integrate the CRISPR system into an accessible place in the human genome and how to activate it at will. We have already removed certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes that code for proteins recognized by the immune system. While we are still optimizing this approach, first results are encouraging in that cells seem to be somewhat protected from immune assault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you instead encode the stem cells with patient tailored genes so they produve only proteins that the individual's immune system already recognises as 'friendly'? Rather than just remove the encoding, change it to one compatible with each individual? Or is that too tricky/expensive/impossible with current tech?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on a couple other responses I've seen here, it seems like the goal is to produce something that can go out to anyone. If they tailored it to each patient, &quot;refills&quot; or maybe just the initial.... Item may take months to receive and be far more expensive. </p></div>		</li>
