			<div class="markdown"><p>My ELI5: yeast eats sugar and pees out ethyl alcohol, a thing we like for what it does to us so much that we just call it alcohol. But that is not the only thing that the yeast can make when it eats sugar, and the different things it makes can do different things to us. Some people are affected quite heavily by some of these random other things, some people not so much. Different types of yeast and different brewing techniques used to make different drinks will make different types and amounts of things other than (ethyl) alcohol, so even though two drinks might have the same percent by volume of ethyl alcohol they might have very different percentages of this other stuff that also can do something to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the American Civil War there was a persistent rumor that the Confederates fought better because they were being given alcohol laced with gunpowder, which turned them into berserkers (for Christ's sake don't try this, it will probably kill you).</p>
<p>That was almost certainly untrue but the Confederates fighting on their home turf in the Shenandoah could not be kept from the lavish quantities of &quot;apple jack&quot; that was available, and they generally did fight better, eventually winning virtually all of the several hand-to-hand combats that took place at Cross Keys and Port Republic in the center of apple jack country, including the disgusting bloodbath of The Coaling in which some Louisianans were accused of being roaring drunk.  (Hell, General Richard Taylor himself might have been drunk; he sent in his marching band as a combat unit, using instruments as clubs.)</p>
<p>Apple jack was made by leaving hard cider on the freezing mountaintops in winter and then the ice was dumped, making it pretty strong, and then it was &quot;spiced&quot; with individual secret concoctions.  Who knows, maybe someone really did hit upon a berserker cider loaded with something awful like Jimson weed.</p>
<p>God, I hope not.  I still remember Four Loko.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, that’s pretty interesting, thanks for the info! The ‘fortification’ process (not sure if that’s the right term, but it seems to fit) is the opposite to how acetic acid was historically strengthened from vinegar, which is why it’s called glacial acetic acid. Because it has a higher melting point than water, the solution can be placed in extremely cold environments and the acetic acid will freeze out, relatively pure as well. I’m not sure on figures, but I’d say that you could easily get to 30-40% ABV that way, going off the fact that vodka will start to freeze at about -25C.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if bootleg drinks historically were enhanced with dubious botanicals, I mean that’s just experimentation for you. Deleterious examples like Jimsonweed can be used for psychoactive effect in low doses, due to the presence of tropane alkaloids like scopolamine, which can result in hallucinations and delusional/suggestive thinking. Those would certainly have an effect on someone in a combat environment, especially with varying amounts of additives, as well as varying concentrations of alkaloids in the plants themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this argument many times before, particularly the focus on 2M2B but IIRC the concentrations of it are far too low to make a substantial impact on psychoactivity. I also believe this is the case because (at least according to <a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2m2b" target="_blank">psychonaut wiki</a>) 2m2b creates psychoactive effects that last up to 14 hours and is rather euphoric. I have never experienced 14 hour long euphoria and drunkenness from alcohol. </p>
<p>Plus, a combination of 2m2b and ethanol can be lethal. If varying 2m2b concentrations created substantial differences in types of drunk, we would see much higher toxicity from certain alcohols (relative to alcohol blood content). I just simply do not buy into the idea that 2m2b is a large contributor to psychoactive effects of alcoholic beverages. </p>
<p>I'm also pretty certain the concentrations of isopropyl alcohol are highly regulated in the alcohol industry so I doubt that you would be getting large concentrations of it in your drinks.</p>
<p>I'd propose that the primary differentiating factor between getting different kinds of drunk from different kinds of alcohol is entirely dependent on the context in which they are consumed.</p>
<p>Having a few beers after work, going wine tasting, downing shots while club-hopping and consuming fancy whisky in a networking discussion are all completely different mental contexts that allow for different aspects of the alcohol experience to display themselves. This is where I believe the mixing drinks = more hangover myth comes from. In which context are you mixing drinks? When you get shitfaced at a party and aren't paying attention to what you consume. That's the kind of context you will experience a hungover after. This is not because of drink-mixing but because of context.</p>
<p>As with all drugs, alcohol's effects are highly dependent on the mindset and experiential setting that the user consumes it in. We don't frequently treat alcohol as a consciousness-altering drug and this can lead us to deny the very psychology-dependent nature of its properties.</p>
<p>Apologies for the rant, I'm procrastinating a project for uni and find this much more enjoyable to write about than reviewing research articles :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it’s not so much about a standard recreational dose, but the synergistic effects of sub-perceptible doses with alcohol - since depressants (especially GABAergics) will add to each other. Of course, you wouldn’t be consuming a few mL of 2M2B when drinking alcoholic beverages, but in the tens to hundreds (?) of milligram range it will still exert some effect pharmacologically, and not enough to cause significant side effects with respect to the ratios of compounds present.</p>
<p>But yeah, I’m inclined to believe set and setting as a major factor, as it is with most other recreational substances, however that doesn’t diminish the <em>slight</em> differences in effect between beverage types. I mean I used to be a pretty heavy drinker, and have drank a wide variety on my own in the same set and setting, there are subtle differences even when the ABV is the same. More noticeable when you compare ‘white’ and ‘dark’ spirits of the same type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've now been caught in a research loop where I can't seem to find any evidence for the presence of 2m2b in alcoholic beverages. I'll look into it more later but all of the sources for this claim seem to lead to dead ends or are cyclical. The only reputable place I can find this claim is psychonaut wiki but it doesn't have a source for it.</p>
<p>I'd also suggest that the mere knowledge that you are drinking dark or white spirits is enough to sway your expectation of the effects. I'd like to see a double blind trial on this (quite the literal name there because the participants would literally need to be blindfolded).</p></div>		</li>
