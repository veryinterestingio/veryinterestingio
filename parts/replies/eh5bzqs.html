			<div class="markdown"><p>I am confused as to why the specle pattern is static. I would expect my hand to move, dither the angle; hence change the pattern from surfaces by the angle, and see at least a changing pattern. It looks very static, which amazes me.</p>
<p>But thank you, the wikipedia article seems informative enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pattern looks static because the interference bright/dark zones extend out from the laser, and they don't change with distance. It is similar to the pattern from a double slit.</p>
<p>Amusingly you can actually use the apparent parallax of the speckle pattern to perform a very sensitive measurement of the near/far sightedness of your eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s nothing to do with the shape of the laser. Speckle is specifically due to the random phase factors picked up on reflection from a surface. </p></div>		</li>
