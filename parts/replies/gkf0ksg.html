<p>You know how your phone has a backlight so you can see the screen when you are outside on a sunny day? Well, the glass plate on the back of a view camera doesn't have enough light shining behind it to see the image. (The only light is coming through the lens at the front of the camera, which is bright enough to expose film over a length of time, but not bright enough to outdo direct sunlight.) We can simply turn up the backlight on our phones, but back then they didn't have that option. So instead they would cover the camera and their heads to block out the daylight so that they could see the image, and then be able to compose the shot and manually focus the camera. Fun fact, they had to focus the camera with a special magnifying glass called a loupe. üßê</p></div>		</li>

<p>the photographer hides, with the ground glass, under a kind of dark &quot;tent&quot; to be able to see the image on the glass, orienting the camera, setting the focus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>By &quot;ground glass&quot; do you mean some sort of frosted glass?</p></div>		</li>

<p>By &quot;frosted&quot; I meant the effect, not the process.  After all, eyeglass lenses are ground, as are telescope mirrors.  Neither is something that I can imagine forming a visible image on.</p></div>		</li>
