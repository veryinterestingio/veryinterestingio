I can't vouch for the sauna claim because there is no physical work involved, but maybe it is different because it's the heart's reaction to a physical environment (heat) instead of a chemical one (caffeine/taurine cocktail). Again, the second part is just a guess, as I haven't read anything about that.</p></div>		</li>
