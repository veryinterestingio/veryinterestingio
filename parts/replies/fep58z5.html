<p>I don’t super understand what the top rotor does, even after the video, so I’m going to have to do some research</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tthink the top rotor is primarily used to achieve lift during takeoff, and then perhaps generates some lift passively during flight when it's unpowered(?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top rotor generates all of the lift for the aircraft just like a helicopter.  But in the case of an autogyro this rotor is unpowered, it's not connected to the engine at all. This is a bit simplified, but the general concept is that as the aircraft moves forward, air passing through the rotor spins it, which in turn generates lift.</p>
<p>It's a concept called autorotation, and helicopters can use it to land when the engine fails.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the primary lift-generating mechanism. Rotary-wing aircraft have a nice property of when air is moving through them (and the blade angle is right), the blades will speed up. This is the phenomenon of Autorotation, and is kinda the rotary-wing aircraft analogue of gliding. </p>
<p>An autogyro takes off by rolling forward on a runway. This pushes air through the blades and gets them moving. Once they're moving fast enough, you can use that motion to produce lift. This'll put some resistance on the rotation of the blades, but since air is still flowing through them because it's moving forward, they're not necessarily going to slow down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like a plane/helicopter hybrid almost. In a normal helicopter, an engine drives the top rotor to generate lift. In an autogyro, forward momentum causes air to flow through the top unpowered rotor. As air passes through the rotor, it spins, which generates lift for the aircraft. </p>
<p>A standard autogyro has to be moving forward in order to take off, it cant lift straight off the ground like a helicopter can.</p>
<p>It's a concept called autorotation, which is really tough to wrap your head around at first, it's super counterintuitive. Helicopters can actually use this to land when the engine fails.</p>
