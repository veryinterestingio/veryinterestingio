			<div class="markdown"><p>My Dad’s a funeral director and can turn it off in an instant. My cousins even used to call him Uncle Flippy. I think I ended up with a pretty dark sense of humor from it. Was the family business in Brooklyn until our generation haha. If you’re around so much death constantly I think I gives you a pretty grounded perspective on the rest of life. One of the most important things he has ever told me: “They only people on the planet who can’t hurt you are the dead ones.”</p></div>		</li>

The guy went over to try to manually shut it, looked awkward and said “I don’t think she wants to go” which made us all burst out laughing.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works for all people. It's a trick called &quot;anchoring&quot;, which is similar to Pavlov's dogs conditioning (which is another technique called &quot;priming&quot;). There are scientific studies, unfortunately I don't have them at hand. I own a book with the citations, but a friend borrowed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Classical conditioning</strong> (also known as Pavlovian or respondent conditioning) refers to a learning procedure in which a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell). It also refers to the learning process that results from this pairing, through which the neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response (e.g. salivation) that is usually similar to the one elicited by the potent stimulus. It was first studied by Ivan Pavlov in 1897.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pavlov never actually used a bell. It’s a myth that had become accepted as fact. He did indeed do classical conditioning, but never specifically with a bell. Here are a few sources but there are many  more. The bell idea comes from a translation error</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called stimulus control transfer. Basically, you're transferring the control of the behavior from one stimulus (whatever normally makes them calm) to another stimulus (the hand gesture) you can do this with just about any behavior in your life. I don't all the time with my children.</p></div>		</li>
