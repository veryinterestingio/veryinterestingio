<p>In winter, temperatures are usually 60-70F (15-21C), but some days, like today, it might get up to 85F (29C) and when cold fronts come through it could go down to 30-40F (\~0-5C). [Thank you, Canada.]</p>
<p>In summer, it's usually 80-90F (27-32C). You'd never get a day below 75F (24C) in the middle of summer.</p></div>		</li>
