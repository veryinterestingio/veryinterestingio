			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know if this is entirely true. I would have no problem agreeing if interest did not exist. But because there is interest on all loans that requires money to be created out of nothing. </p>
<p>In other words interest creates a world where more money is owed than exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, remember that we are <em>producing</em> value all the time. That's the key to interest. I don't have the money to buy a house all at once, but as I work over time, I will produce enough value to buy it. So I borrow money to buy it now, and then pay them that money plus some interest for the benefit of being able to buy it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. My understanding (maybe because the government prints money this isn't the case) is that because there is so much interest on most purchases that the added value from the world doesnt out weigh or something. I might just have the wrong impression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s true that if there is a hard limit to resources, we’d end up in this place where we owe more than we can ever have. If we instead add value to things, we create more wealth than previously existed.</p>
<p>The John Locke example: I picked an apple, I have added my labor so now the apple belongs to me. If someone wants an apple, they can put in their labor into finding one and picking it or buy one from me at the cost of my labor to gather and transport.</p>
<p>Gold: Let’s say I spend borrow $50 today to buy a pickaxe, dig up gold, and sell it. The loan enabled me to produce gold and add it to the global pool of currency. There’s now more money in the world and we made more money ourselves by borrowing money and investing it. </p>
<p>Manufactured goods: The most real world example, things like phones, computers, etc are worth far more than the sum of their parts. The processors are worth more than the sand the silicon was produced from, the circuit boards worth more than the copper placed on them, etc.</p>
<p>The last thing to consider is that not all loans are paid back and that value does disappear as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They US gets its &quot;loans&quot; for such a low interest rate it would almost be stupid to not take advantage. Theoretically the dollar amount doesn't really matter until it gets to a point where the US can't make its payments. Which has never once happened in the history of the country. Its a major reason why the US can incur vast amounts of debts from its people and foreign countries without it being a big problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused by the gov owing you money that they generated for a bond.</p>
<p>So, the gov creates money, you buy a bond with that money, lend it to the gov who created the money and pay you back more for the bond, from money they created.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In modern governments, we separate the entities who create the money from the entities who spend the money. So the US Treasury doesn't &quot;create the money&quot; - they have a budget in which they get some taxes and spend some money. They have to make up any shortfall by selling bonds to get that money. (And when they have to pay back bonds, they sell more bonds to get the money to pay those back.) </p>
<p>This is completely separate from the Federal Reserve, which is the source of money. </p>
<p>Also important to remember that money isn't synonymous with wealth. Most of my net worth is in my house and stock holdings, for example, not cash. Money is a convenient shorthand for <em>transferring</em> value, so when I do valuable work for my company, they pay me some money, and then I use that to buy video games and Cheetos. It's nice that it stores value over time but that's not really its main function. Its main function is to supplant the original barter economy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The thing that is confusing you is that you're thinking of the government as a single entity. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the US, and they are responsible for creating (and destroying) money. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp" target="_blank">https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp</a></a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The US Treasury Department, which is part of the Executive Branch, is responsible for the spending that the government does. They take in taxes, issue bonds, and control spending in the federal government. They don't create money. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, <del>the gov</del> <strong>the FED</strong> creates money, you buy a bond with that money, lend it to  the <del>gov</del>  <strong>Treasury Department</strong> <del>who created the money</del> and pay you back more for the bond, from money <del>they</del> <strong>the FED</strong> created. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern Monetary Theory is an economic theory that essentially points out that by coordinating control of those two roles, you can dramatically change the operating principles of the federal government. Since the government can create money, it can spend as much as it likes. The risk that comes with that is that it causes inflation, and so to control how much inflation its spending causes, the government would have to implement policies to remove money from the economy. The most common one is taxation.</p></div>		</li>
