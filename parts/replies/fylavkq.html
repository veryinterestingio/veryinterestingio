			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to this. Helped a buddy load up some gravel from some of the DOT piles. We were on our way back from work so we'd put on our hardhats and gloves and shovel like we were on the clock. For some reason the hardhat makes you look super official.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some crims walked into the front lobby of a large hospital where I used to work and unbolted a gigantic ticket machine (for car parking fees) from the floor and dollied it out the front door in the middle of the day. It must have weighed at least 150Kg.<br />
It was in a poorer area where everyone pays with cash, so it was a big score for them.<br />
Nobody noticed because they were wearing hi-vis vests and I think they taped off the area where they were working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pentester I know always starts by just walking onto a site in bizcaz, with a clipboard and a toolkit and tells front desk they are here to check the servers. They get let into the room way too often, normally only gets stopped when they push it and ask to talk to the guy with the keys to the racks (if they aren't just sitting on a desk). According to the locksport types, most of those locks really aren't worth shit if you have 5 quiet minutes anyway.</p></div>		</li>
