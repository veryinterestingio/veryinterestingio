<p>Have a look at Polycythemia Vera for more ideas about the implications of too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I remember reading about biking athletes who would store their own blood, and then inject it back into their system before they competed to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity. Always wondered what would happen if they injected too much. I wonder how much of too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think pathogenicity means what you think it means. But as to the overall harms caused by polycythemia, basically your blood becomes too thick for your body to pump efficiently. Clotting risk increases (because when blood doesn’t move enough it clots), so stroke and heart attack risks increase. </p>
<p>It can be a serious complication for people undergoing certain cancer treatments, e.g. those that affect bone marrow, not just people taking T supplements. </p>
<p>Interestingly (perhaps ironically) it was tests for artificial erythropoietin (EPO) levels in cancer patients and tests for artificial testosterone levels to monitor this complication that ultimately led to the downfall of Lance Armstrong. </p>
<p>edit: additional clarifying info</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lol. I know, but I just wanted to use a big word so I could feel smart plus I was hoping no one would know the word because this is Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many men that do therapeutic “donations” because they are on testosterone supplements. They can range from the norm of every 8 weeks to donate to every 2 weeks. (Earlier only with a doctors prescription) Most don’t know why they are there, just their doctor says they have thick blood. When I’ve explained that they are at much higher risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism they are blown away.</p></div>		</li>
