			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your logic, but most mammals have poor eyesight. Some internet searching shows that cattle have poor depth perception and hippos are optimized to see under water. A more direct comparison would be to the primates. A bit more searching on gorilla eyesight indicates they have similar vision to us. Their bodies are bigger than ours, but I don't know if their eyes are bigger. Birds have really good eyesight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cattle, and most other herbivores, don't bother with depth perception. They need to watch as much of their surroundings as possible to spot predators, regardless of how close they are. Predators need depth perception to properly time their attacks and avoid getting too close while stalking their prey, and birds obviously need to be excellent navigators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It's not the lens that matters for digital cameras, its the sensor. A bigger sensor will generally allow more detail. </p>
<p>A wider lense would probably have the opposite effect, because while capturing more, it makes things smallers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially but probably not, bacteria are very very very tiny. At that scale even if you can see the detail light itself will not always be particularly helpful. You might be able to see general shapes but if it's light enough to see them then normally they are mostly transparent. It's a paradox present in microscopes, it would be no different for eyes.</p></div>		</li>
