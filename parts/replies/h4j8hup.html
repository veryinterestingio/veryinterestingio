While risking that some might just bounce off and others might explode like a stick of dynamite on impact and theres no way to know until you try.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same experience and it led to my bipolar I diagnosis. I have been on carbamazepine for my bipolar and recently within the past two years (due to other comorbid diagnoses) I had to start taking an ssri which absolutely terrified me but it has helped marginally at this point. That SSRI induced major manic event was terrifying and eye opening and I hope I never experience that again. But it truly does illustrate the lack of understanding of the medications interactions with the diagnosis and the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Fuck SSRIs. And fuck the doctors that prescribe them like sweets instead of actually trying to find the root of the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. However, staying awake for three days straight while obsessing over something uncontrollable to the point where you feel the only way to make it stop is to end it all? Yep. I’m going to need something extra for that. Hence, why there’s a spectrum that can vary from mildly irritating to completely disabling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes so much sense . Also I think, we have certain indications for physical pain, professionals can look at the characteristics ( swelling, bleeding) but since they can't do that to our thoughts, until and unless we go all clear to them about the exact root cause it gets really hard to find what is triggering it. And probably this is why mental illness, depression is still a taboo in a large part of the world, cause people can't actually see it, empathise to it.</p></div>		</li>
