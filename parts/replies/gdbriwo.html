			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question. I own a little piece of the mesh from the old <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/300-foot-telescope/" target="_blank">Green Bank 300-foot telescope</a>, which collapsed a few decades ago. I probably spent too much money on it but it was a fun little purchase from the gift shop that I could display. Note that while the collapse sounds similar, it's a different situation as the telescope was designed to be quickly constructed while the more-sophisticated 140-foot telescope was being developed. So, it wasn't really meant to be the longest-lived structure, though of course it was't meant to collapse either. - Michael L</p></div>		</li>
