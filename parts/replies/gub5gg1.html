			<div class="markdown"><p>While I have no scientific evidence, I’ve noticed as I’ve grown older the likelihood of this occurring has increased. Whether it’s due to age, or simply the more often it occurs the easier it is, I’ve no idea. I’m more inclined to believe it’s the latter, similar to how your brain creates more and more synapses related to eachother (read, stronger connections) with each similar interaction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure if depression or brain damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof, I feel that. I noticed I got chills more easily once I got on antidepressants, so it might be that. This reaction is also linked to the “reward center” of your brain, so it’s probably just depression</p></div>		</li>
