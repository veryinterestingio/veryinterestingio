			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is total dogshit. You get the feeling due to a rush in dopamine along with other NTs. Go ahead, remember the song in your head. Did you get the chills? Of course not, because it isn't linked to memory, it's linked to physical sensation. Some people are way more auditory than they are visual in terms of experience. Your brain likes what it fucking likes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's goosebumps all the way down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Instant watery eyes as well, for me. I distinctly remember seeing Joe Satriani live for the first time, I was so touched and filled with emotion. Which is something I definitely didn't have when listening to the records.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I'm the same. Nothing to do with memories or some kind of attached emotion for me. It's definitely an in-the-moment experience.</p>
<p>Same thing happens when I watch TV shows/films. The soundtracks get me all the time and I rarely watch anything more than once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Emotion of the instrumentation&quot; is close to this though. I get the same thing and its hard to pinpoint what does it, but I always know it when I hear it.</p></div>		</li>
