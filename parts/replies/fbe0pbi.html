			<div class="markdown"><p>At that point indeed it would not be well defined, or all three phases are present at the same time.</p>
<p>The triple point is actually very useful, because it will always be at 273.16 K. It is therefor used to define the Kelvin: 1 Kelvin equals 1/273.16 of the total temperature difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water.</p>
<p>If you would use the freezing point of ice to define the Kelvin, it would change depending on the pressure when you are measuring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically that is no longer true, it was changed in May when they also changed the kilogram definition. Now none of the base units depend on physical things just universal constants. </p>

<p>The kelvin is defined by fixing the numerical value of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant" target="_blank">Boltzmann constant</a> k to 1.380 649×10−23 J⋅K−1. This unit is equal to kg⋅m2⋅s−2⋅K−1, where the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram" target="_blank">kilogram</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre" target="_blank">metre</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" target="_blank">second</a> are defined in terms of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant" target="_blank">Planck constant</a>, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" target="_blank">speed of light</a>, and the duration of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium-133" target="_blank">caesium-133</a> ground-state <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfine_transition" target="_blank">hyperfine transition</a>.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin#cite_note-1" target="_blank">[1]</a> Thus, this definition depends only on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Constants" target="_blank">universal constants</a>, and not on any physical artifacts as practiced previously, such as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPK" target="_blank">IPK</a>, whose mass diverged over time from the original value.</p>
<p>One kelvin is equal to a change in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_temperature" target="_blank">thermodynamic temperature</a> T that results in a change of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy" target="_blank">thermal energy</a> kT by 1.380 649×10−23 J.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin#cite_note-2" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 16 November 2018, a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redefinition_of_SI_base_units" target="_blank">new definition</a> was adopted, in terms of a fixed value of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant" target="_blank">Boltzmann constant</a>. With this change the triple point of water became an empirically determined value of approximately 273.16 kelvin. For <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_metrology#Legal_metrology" target="_blank">legal metrology</a> purposes, the new definition officially came into force on 20 May 2019, the 144th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_Convention" target="_blank">Metre Convention</a>.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin#cite_note-draft-resolution-A-8" target="_blank">[8]</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to take away from your excellent comment, but to add to it I have a small nit pick.</p>
<p>There's still latent heat of fusion and vaporization at the triple point, so ice, water or vapor can each exist in a well defined phase there.</p>
<p>A block of ice at the triple point (TP) is definitely ice. You have to add heat to it to melt it, and the melted part is definitely water at the TP. You have to add heat to the water to vaporize it, and the vapor is definitely gas at the TP.</p>
<p>Phase diagrams are a little misleading as they don't account for this hidden energy, which leaves some conceptual ambiguity in understanding the phase borders.</p></div>		</li>
