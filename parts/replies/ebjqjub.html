			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays, the sides are used less in regards to liberals and conservatives, and more in regards to the extremes (i.e. communists on the far left, fascists on the far right). This has to do with both state power and economic system. In that case, socialists are the far left,  and liberals (even by today's standards) are the center right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The politics slightly nudged left for the past centuries, even if now we’re going the other way. Basically there’s always a new more left side party coming up and switching the stuff around. It may change in the future again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because economic liberalism ended up benefitting plutocrats, so it got adopted by a lot of the right (more recently as an even more stringent &quot;neoliberalism&quot;) and socialism then came out of the left, along with other ideologies like anarchism.</p></div>		</li>
