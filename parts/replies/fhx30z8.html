<p>For a tsunami, I'd expect most of it would flow back without leaving much salt behind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evaporation in the Netherlands is probably not a big issue (We’re further north than Newfoundland).</p>
<p>But in Holland much of our land is below sealevel, so if a flood happens the land is inundated for weeks before it is pumped away. </p>
<p>However, we’re basically living in a swamp, so all the ground is already very wet. It’s hard to say what the impact is from a much much briefer salt water inundation in a very dry and porous area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated question from a Newfoundlander, do you guys ever get things mixed up because you search for a Netherlands specific topic using &quot;NL&quot;, and results turn out to be for Newfoundland instead?</p>
<p>It happens far too frequently that I search for something specific to Newfoundland and come across information relevant to the Netherlands instead haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember it's not just how far North you are, you have the jet stream over Europe/ Scandinavia that makes further Northern climates more liveable (which is why people live all the way up in Northern Norway but no cities are that far North in other places) :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume as much as a normal drenching would. There is going to be a max amount of water that the land can absorb. The rest is runoff like normal into streams and back to the sea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that the bigger problem would be the salt water in the top soil itself. evaporation doesn't really have much of an impact on the damage done by the salt. Over time minerals bind with each other and create layers of sediment. this is why you can break open some rocks and find salt formations inside of them. for instance some stone counter top companies specifically use stone near sea areas because the stone will have salt formations that shine and make it appear more aesthetically appealing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use gypsum on turfgrass near roadways and sidewalks. In the winter the roads and walks get salted and the gypsum helps keep the salt from binding to the soil. It really does help.</p></div>		</li>
