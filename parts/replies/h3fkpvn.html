			<div class="markdown"><p>fantastic explanation! one question on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two blade turbines have a few issues which results in three being the default choice:</p>
<ol>
<li>They cause &quot;pulsing&quot; shadows when the sun is side on which is really disturbing to any houses/cars that end up in the shadow. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>why doesn't this also apply to 3-blade systems? aren't the blades also evenly spaced and create pulsing rhythms of sun and shade? just more rapidly? I would think that's more disturbing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the turbine from the side, as it spins, a two blade design will have the largest side profile when both blades are pointed straight up and down.  But when they are both pointed side to side, the profile of the blades is very small (effectively the width of the blade), which is the pulsing they are talking about.</p>
<p>Now when you have a three blade turbine, the side profile will always be about 1.5 times the length of one of the blades, though it will move a bit.  You still may get some side pulsing, but it will be a lot less disturbing.</p>
<p>You are correct that from the front and back there are other issues with light pulsing, which is part of why they try to locate turbines to minimize this effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference only matters for a really narrow range for a really narrow time frame each day. Most of the area sees pulsing shadows with any number of blades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in environmental impact assessment and ‘shadow flicker’ is one of the key considerations when designing a wind farm. Generally speaking, UK guidance notes that the fickering shadows can only be a nuisance for properties within 10x rotor diameter of a turbine. So if you had a RD of 100m, any property within 1000m could be impacted. Then it depends on the time of day and the angle of the sun etc. You can mitigate these impacts by automatically turning the offending machine(s) off at certain times of the year (I.e for an hour on March 28, 29 and 30th from 4-5pm) to avoid the flicker, or make sure no turbine is within 1000m of a property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't apply to 3-blade systems because the blades aren't arranged in a straight line. The amount of shade a 2-blade turbine with 50 foot blades throws will go from a 100 foot line to a zero foot line and back as the blades turn. (Assuming the sun is right in line with the blades.) A 3-blade turbine with 50 foot blades will have a shadow between about 75 feet and 80 feet long. Much less of a difference.</p>
<p>This is not going to be a major consideration in the design. But put a bunch of turbines next to a road and I guess the drivers could get annoyed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is resonance. Turbines/impellers/propellers etc with a prime number of blades have far fewer resonant frequencies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This is also true of gearboxes, which are often designed to have mutually prime or prime numbers of teeth. Reduces noise, reduces oscillating mechanical loads, and improves wear characteristics.</p></div>		</li>
