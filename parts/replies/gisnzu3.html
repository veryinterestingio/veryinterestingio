<p>Maybe we could fill in the gaps with reptile DNA? Let's not think too hard about whether we should or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh you can't just &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; where you're missing the DNA. It just doesn't work like that. You can't fill something in if you don't know what it is that you're replacing. The missing nucleotides/genes/chromosomes likely did and would encode for so many proteins, enzymes, etc. that would have so many diverse and dynamic roles that it would be near impossible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can get a very good idea of what we're replacing, especially if we compare the genome or a closely related species, which is something we do all the time. Between a mammoth and an Asian elephant you're looking an order of similarity comparable to comparing different species of ape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it's consistent with his plot style of &quot;scientific realism&quot;, as in a parallel to &quot;magical realism&quot; - you have to accept the single premise (you can clone dinosaurs from mosquito blood, magnets can shrink people, etc), but everything from there is played straight</p></div>		</li>
