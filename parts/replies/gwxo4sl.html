<p>Describes the last time I had Carrabas perfectly. After puking my brains out I called them to let them know they have bad seafood so they don't poison other people, but the doctor working as a host at Carrabas insisted that it was impossible that it was them because it takes 24 hours for food poisoning to hit..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Food poisoning from toxins hits as soon at your intestines and stomach figure out whats up. It would be hard to mistake it for anything else. I have trouble eating meatball subs bc I got food poisoning from ones at subway and I could tell EXACTLY what happened and why lol. It only lasted until I was basically purged of it, so like a day, so it wasn't bacteria doing the poisoning. They are mistaking bacterial infection food poisoning, which at that points is named something else, like salmonella, ecoli or botchulism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, fuck Carrabas. I had them one time. My plate and the filling of my pasta, think it was cannelloni but not completely sure, were scorching hot and the actual pasta was cold as the deepest circle of hell. Don’t know how they managed that. My wife’s seafood meal had a couple big ass chunks of crab shell in it. </p>
<p>Some people say they’re good, but after that one time years ago I ain’t bothering to go back. I guess I was lucky enough not to get poisoned. Only overcharged for a shite meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect,  most incubation periods are longer than a couple hours,  some can be weeks. Because unless you test the food or you are part of an investigated outbreak,  food borne illnesses have an incubation period just like anything else.  </p>
<p>If you get sick 30 minutes after eating tacos, it's very possible that the sandwich from 2 days ago is the culprit.  Some can have an incubation period of over 2 weeks. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points, thanks!  </p>
<p>I think that chart is for the second type of food poisoning -- the stuff where the infection is still alive.  I believe that kind of poisoning is way more likely than the first type because it requires less contamination.  Still, some infections can have a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/symptoms.html" target="_blank">short onset</a>.  Being an avid traveler, I've gotten quite a bit of food poisoning over the years and it's almost always been that second type.  I have, however, gotten the first type and the presentation is much more rapid onset and much shorter in duration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like it's a chart for live bacteria though, am I right? It's one thing to be poisoned by bacteria which the have to produce enough toxins, and different by toxins after bacteria are dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not the bacteria that get you. It’s the bacteria’s poop. It’s toxic and not “alive” so you can’t just kill it. Kinda like drinking bleach, you can cook it all you want but it’ll still make you sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it is the bacteria itself that gets you. Illness caused by bacterial toxins is food poisoning/intoxication. Illness caused by the presence/growth of bacteria is an infection. Both can be foodborne. botulism can cause food poisoning while salmonella can cause foodborne infections. The stomach doesn't kill everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that most cooking methods won't break down botulinum toxin even if they do kill the bacteria that makes it. In contrast, Salmonella and E. coli are rendered safe by heating to \~60C for any length of time. EDIT: Yes, I realize 85C for 5 minutes is enough to break down botulism toxin. Most meats and veggies would taste like crap if you cooked them this hot for this long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a bit off topic but your last sentence is something I’ve wondered about recently: Does the “good” bacteria in yogurt die in the stomach given the acidic environment? If it does, then all these “probiotic” yogurts mean nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that compared to vultures, human stomach acid is weak. Human acid ranges from a pH of 1-3. Some vultures are almost 0. Since pH is log10 based, that means, vulture stomach acid is 10-1000 stronger than human stomach acid. Vulture stomach acids can dissolve metals.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons they can eat spoiled food that would kill us. The other is vultures are noted as having one of the “strongest immune systems of all vertebrates” and there are few food-borne diseases that truly pose a threat to it.</p></div>		</li>
