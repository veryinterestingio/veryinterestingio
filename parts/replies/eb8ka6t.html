			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to know a thing or two about lettuce/farming, I've been so curious to know why is it only romaine? Do farmers only grow one type of lettuce, or do they only use one type of water on that lettuce? Since it was water used to wash the romaine that was contaminated, I wondered why that water wasn't used to wash other crops/types of lettuce. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a supply industry to lettuce companies. They have very specialized facilities for whatever type of product they produce because the handling of different types of lettuce is very different. There's very little overlap. </p>
<p>Spinach is the biggest culprit for contamination because it's so delicate you can't really scrub it clean without destroying it. They wash it in flowing water troughs that recirculate the water and dry it in huge spin dryers.</p>
<p>The whole head products are very difficult to clean effectively because bacteria/parasites can get into the nooks and crannies so if they get contaminated irrigation systems the whole crop has to be destroyed. </p>
<p>These companies talk about cleanliness and contamination day in and day out. It's a huge issue for them and they have insurance policies that help cover events like this. Lettuce suppliers are more like contamination experts who also supply lettuce. Millions if not billions of pounds of it every year in North America and usually only a handful of people get sick from it every year. It's really quite remarkable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow - I am honestly learning so much about lettuce today from this thread and I'm loving every single fact. It's all super interesting for something I never thought much about until I couldn't get my hands on my weekly romaine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lettuce is especially vulnerable because its produce that isn't cooked. Lettuce is a very fragile leaf vegetable. It can't be frozen, it can't be cooked, processing needs to be very delicate, and it has a super short shelf life.</p>
<p>Contrast that with a root vegetable like a potato. Potatoes are almost never eaten raw. They can be stored for a very long time and are cooked before being consumed. The cooking process (boiled, mashed, stewed) kills most anything harmful on or in the potato.</p>
<p>The other issue is that lettuce has an enormous surface area on which to collect things. Its like a sponge for anything and everything. Most other produce is vaguely round in shape. A minimum of surface area for a maximum of internal volume. Apples don't have a huge surface area to collect contaminants. Apples are really easy to wash. Other produce, such as oranges, has an inedible skin. Oranges have their own natural packaging which is peeled and thrown away, taking with it any contaminants on the outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for taking time to reply - I'm finding all these lettuce facts very interesting! Now I'm secretly hoping someone brings up the romaine recall in conversation so I can casually drop all this leaf-knowledge on them. </p></div>		</li>
