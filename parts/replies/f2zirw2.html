<p>&quot;The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there’s a [wikipedia article](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_purism_in_English" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic\_purism\_in\_English" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic\_purism\_in\_English</a></a>) on it.</p>
<p>I had a professor who used to lament how English was devolving through technology (this was back in the days of lol, and omg). I’ve seen art exhibits, articles, lectures. Not specifically mentioning ”purity” per se, but definitely outlining the detriment languages evolution is making to communication and culture.</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify since some people seem to be under the impression I'm against language evolution, my personal belief is that language always has been, and always will be fluid, just like culture. As an aside, the Icelandic word for computer translates roughly to &quot;number wizard &quot;, such I think is amazing (in an effort to avoid language appropriation, Iceland actually invents words as needed rather then simply using the English word, for example)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that this is not specific to English.</p>
<p>This is the norm for all languages - they all borrow, adapt, etc. Russian has plenty of loanwords too. Even with nominal attempts by the Academy to keep French &quot;pure&quot;, the language is full of features that come from contact with other languages, it is changing as we speak, and some of the change is a response to contact with other languages.</p>
<p>English is not &quot;practical&quot; or &quot;adaptive&quot; or &quot;eclectic&quot; in any qualitatively unique way. That's just how languages work. To the (debatable) extent that English shows more signs of language contact than other languages, that's just because it's an economically dominant language over such a wide and linguistically diverse area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And all this is exactly as it should be.</p>
<p>Language is a collection of memes (in this case, words) competing for survival as within any memeplex. Their selective pressure comes the language users need to express their specific concept, and as that need waxes and wanes over time, so too the meaning of those words shifts and evolves.</p>
<p>With each iteration of language and addition there in we gain vibrancy and nuance, and through use and dis-use we collectively tune the language to better express ourselves with.</p>
<p>Demanding &quot;purity&quot; from this kind of evolutionary process is quite nonsensical.</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Especially</em> Russian. It was in suspended animation from Peter the Great to the Communist Revolution while the Russian upper classes were speaking French, then had to import words wholesale...&quot;rocket&quot; became <em>raketa</em>.</p></div>		</li>
