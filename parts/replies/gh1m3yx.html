			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like i learned something back in Patho about it also being the fact that during this “fight or flight” mode, your sympathetic nervous system draws the blood away from your stomach to more important “fighty and flighty” organs such as heart, muscles, brain etc...so therefore you have very little blood flow to your stomach, causing nausea. Same reason u puke if you went for a hard run/exercise after a meal...your body is drawing blood away from non-vital organs into your muscles and heart etc. The puking to empty your stomach seems..i guess logical, but it seems the time it takes to puke wouldn’t outweigh the pound or so food in your stomach slowing you down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. I glossed over that aspect, but I did say “so [your body will] stop digestion”, which is at least partially due to redirecting the blood supply. The “fight or flight” response also causes many other bodily processes to be temporarily suspended, such as hair growth, gamete (sperm / egg) production, and just about everything else related to body maintenance. Essentially your body says, “the kitchen is on fire! Let’s focus on putting that out. For now we can skip vacuuming the living room and repairing the leaky faucet in the bathroom”. Note that this response is intended as a crude one-size-fits-most emergency measure, and as such, the details often won’t make sense in a specific situation. This is part of why people who will work in stressful environments undergo extensive training: to give those people more tools to respond, rather than a single hammer with witch to nail down all problems. </p>
<p>The “fight or flight” response is intended to be used for infrequent, short-term emergencies, and leaving it active for an extended period (longer than 15 minutes or so), or using it frequently, means that your body’s maintenance continues to remain suspended / drastically reduced. When the body experiences stress for an extended period of time, that neglected maintenance causes bad things to happen (suspending hair growth can cause hair loss, suspending skin maintenance can cause premature wrinkling, suspending gamete production can cause low libido, suspending maintenance on your immune system reduces your immune capacity and can result in illness, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>was the weight of a partially digested meal really a factor in survival? that feels questionable. vomiting also can take time and energy, make you feel weak and disoriented, etc.</p>
<p>if anything it seems like it could just as easily be a hindrance as a boon in a predator prey situation. we can observe plenty of mammals who still regularly encounter those situations and i’m not aware of vomiting being a common trait.</p>
<p>many traits are passed on through natural selection purely because they were not detrimental to survival, not necessarily because they were beneficial.</p>
<p>unless we can evidence that strongly suggests that vomiting was a successful strategy for evading predators, it could have stuck around as a fear response for any number of other reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about other people, but whenever I'm vomiting, I'm literally unable to do anything else, let alone running away. I would be a crippled sitting duck for any nearby predator.</p></div>		</li>
