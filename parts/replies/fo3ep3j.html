			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea it would be great to get into the etymology of how new words are developed in sign languages and how it changes.</p>
<p>I wonder if there are words were the pun is lost, and gets reinterpreted based on the build of other languages?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Folk etymology doesn't mean &quot;wrong&quot; etymology.  A folk etmyology is some kind of development that is linked to the change of a meaning of a word.</p>
<p>Most linguists don't think words are inherently meaningful and so folk etymology can be a vector by which a word changes meaning over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a visual language, you need to know what the subject is before you can have it do anything. Starting with a verb isn't going to work unless you already know the subject.</p>
<p>Also you might want to know the object too.</p>
<p>&quot;So do you want to go to the store with me&quot; becomes</p>
<p>You/me,  store (signed over here), go (act out from where you signed you/me to where you signed store).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a great reconceptualization for me. Makes it a lot easier to understand why someone who is signing on tv has big pauses or delays. </p>
<p>Gives me some food for thought to how to make new fantasy or simplified being languages.</p></div>		</li>
