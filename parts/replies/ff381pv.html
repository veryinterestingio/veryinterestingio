			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a quality comment, but assumes a familiarity of electrical circuits and components. Not unreasonable at all in r/askscience, but maybe I can give a further interpretation. </p>
<p>u/zanfar says that wall chargers are devices whose circuits are already completed. Now normally when a circuit is completed or <em>closed</em> the thing happens (light turns on, speaker sounds, motor spins). However, this might not be the case for many circuits. </p>
<p>Taking, for example, a transistor, has a source (input), drain (output) and a gate (which is like an electrical switch). This component is designed to work with minimal losses of power (which it does pretty well), but because everything is connected in a solid state package, electricity leaks where it isnt supposed to (namely from the gate to the drain). </p>
<p>Many <strong>I</strong>ntegrated <strong>C</strong>ircuits require extra power to run their logic, and are called &quot;active circuits&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
