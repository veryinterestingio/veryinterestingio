			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the cancer you are talking about originate specifically from oxidative damages, I don't think it's possible. These pigments are designed to absorbs excess light and re-emit it as heat through what is called the xanthophyll cycle (for most green plants and algae). This system will prevent excess light to overstimulate chlorophyll molecules and transfer its energy to nearby moleculat dioxygen which will in turn create reactive oxygen species that can, if left uncontrolled, damage pigments and membranes.</p>
<p>Sadly, cancer initiation/promotion/proliferation is a much more complex issue. It's very hard to say how each specific case of cancers originate. Although cancerous cells might spawn (initiation) from oxidative stress --&gt; DNA damages -&gt; errors during DNA repairs, I'm having a hard time imagining using the plants protectives mechanisms against light (which necessitate actual light to regulate itself) to slow down and prevent cancer formation. I wouldn't say this idea is completely far fetched as It might be possible to engineer something to slow down cancer initiation using this knowledge but that is way outside my field of expertise. I hope this answered your question!</p>
