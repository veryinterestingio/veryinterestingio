			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right in some respects. You’re thinking of this from a ph perspective and you’re on point there. </p>
<p>However In the initial research and development we look at titers as evidence of immune response and take samples to see if/when a booster may be required for continuing immune memory. If most the data is suggestive that the immune system needs a primer, that’s the data that’s presented for this to be licensed (and recommended by ACIP in US for immunization recommendations).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaccine efficacy is only part of the equation in determining the required level of vaccination coverage for effective herd immunity.</p>
<p>This is why the CDC has language like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles, 78% effective against mumps, and 97% effective against rubella.</p>
<p>Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 88% effective against mumps.</p>

<p>Is that okay?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank">Here</a> are the CDC's recommendations. Short answer is, yes, you are assumed to be immune. There is a small chance you would not be (some people are non-responders even after two doses; mumps antibodies wane), and the CDC goes into detail for each disease about high-risk groups and outbreaks.</p></div>		</li>
