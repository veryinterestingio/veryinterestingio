			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the species. A number that is generally accepted is known as the &quot;50/500 rule.&quot; Under 500 individuals and you get genetic drift (which is not <em>technically</em> bad but not the goal of conservation efforts) and under 50 you get inbreeding. However, the real number can vary widely by individual species' unique characteristics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At this point, preserving enough individual of a species seems like the easy part. How are you going to rebuild their ecosystem for them to thrive in? </p>
<p>They're just not coming back except as zoo exhibit. We simply outcompeted them out of existence. We keep a few as souvenirs and that's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not always the case.  For example, rare species of fish and molluscs have been restocked from reserve populations into streams where they were eliminated by high levels of pollution that occured specifically because of factories and poor pollution laws in decades past.  The water has been cleaned up, the habitat is very available for them and they thrive in it now.  </p>
<p>Similarly, relatively small changes in hunting pressure and presence of specific pollutants have allowed rare birds like the California condor and peregrine falcon to make something of a comeback.</p>
<p>Sure, sometimes the issue is just general habitat destruction or direct competition with humans or introduced species, but many other times the main threats are rather specific and may well disappear over time...but if it's too late for the species you can't bring it back.</p></div>		</li>
