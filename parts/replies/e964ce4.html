			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, if the house remains under Republican control, and the senate does as well (this one is likely), then that means that essentially the voters are agreeing with the way Trump has been running the country for the last two years and that there's no reason he should change course or slow down. This may be one of the most important elections in our lifetimes, and it's sad that half of the potential voters out there won't even participate or don't understand what's going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As much as it is kinda sad, it adds a lot of perspective to the matter. </p>
<p>The same thing that has people frothing at the mouth over has basically no effect on the daily lives of people that don't care. It goes to show that, overall, the presidency (despite being the most publicized office) has little to no impact on the average American. </p>
<p>That being said, what's even worse is the midterms, the officials that matter on local and state matters, are basically an extension of the presidential election, and can get elected based solely on their support or non-support of the president. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Because he couldn't do that in his first two years. With complete control. <a href="https://youtu.be/b_8UFNQqk7k" target="_blank">&quot;Nobody knew healthcare was so complicated&quot;</a>. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a frightening thought, regardless of what you think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Significant gains by Trump&quot;, while <em>theoretically</em> possible, is unlikely in the extreme. You'd have to see polling errors <em>way</em> bigger than in 2016 for that to happen. </p></div>		</li>
