			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly asking: how is actual soap supposed to be better for your skin when it's alkaline, as opposed to a body wash with a PH of 5-6 (like skin)? I don't think I've ever seen shower gel without some kind of humectant or fats/oils, so I don't see how that'd make a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll admit here, I’m not like the lead scientist at Dove or anything, just someone who has been making and running a handmade soap biz for nearly a decade, so as to the pH thing, I’m not sure of the science. </p>
<p>However, handmade soap has much more glycerine and oils than most manufactured soaps. There are two ways to legally list ingredients: by what went in or what is left at the end.  Either way, they must be listed in order or how much goes in(or comes out).  You’ll often notice on commercially manufactured soaps/washes that there are a lot of things at the end of that list, which means a much smaller amount. Many of those are also chemicals with other purposes (for example, you’ll see tetrasodium edta on a lot of stuff: it helps prevent scum in your shower). Whereas, on my soap fir example, there are maybe ten ingredients, and they are basically the oils, the lye (sodium hydroxide), water and milk, color and fragrance. That’s it.  Nothing to clean your bathtub.  No preservatives. </p>
<p>Or maybe I’m just biased because all I’ve used is my own soap for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are still made with surfactants, probably just a different combination of other ingredients.  I used these for my kids, because of the tear free formulas.  They are definitely more stripping on hair.  My daughter’s hair had so many tangled until she got old enough to use regular shampoo/conditioner.</p></div>		</li>
