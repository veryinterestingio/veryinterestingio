			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other comments are noting, the ISS is really close, but that leaves out the even cooler part: the ISS is going really, <strong>really</strong> fast. <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/" target="_blank">As XKCD has noted</a>, if you fired a bullet from one end of a football field at the exact moment the ISS passes overhead, the ISS would cross the field before the bullet made it past the 10 yard line.</p>
<p>You know that song <em>I'm Gonna Be</em>? AKA, &quot;AND I WOULD WALK FIVE HUNDRED MILES, AND I WOULD WALK FIVE HUNDRED MORE&quot;? By fantastic coincidence, in the playtime of that song, the ISS has traveled about 1,000 miles, in 3 and a half minutes.</p>
<p>Getting high enough to be in space is one thing. Being fast enough to <em>stay</em> in space is even cooler.</p></div>		</li>
