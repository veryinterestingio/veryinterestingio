<p>In short, they can use inorganic materials such as iron or carbon monoxide to generate energy (ATP) much like how we use organic matter (food) to make ATP. The energy gained from said inorganic matter is enough to suffice for the organism to stay alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really an interesting point when considering space exploration and intelligent alien life. When viewing us as a whole throughout history, humans seem like militarized cancerous beings that will annihilate anything in our path. But when it comes down to it, space exploration requires such intricate planning, and the people doing it are so intelligent and thoughtful, they spend extra time and resources trying to protect even alien bacteria. You'd think any alien race advanced enough to travel to earth would behold our sentience as too valuable to destroy. </p></div>		</li>
