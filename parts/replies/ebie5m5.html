			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is there, but the explanation isn't quite correct. Instead of thinking about a straight line (<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/files/2018/08/shutterstock_550488199.jpg" target="_blank">like this depiction of human evolution</a>), it's better to think of a tree (<a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/images/evograms/hominid_evo.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>).</p>
<p>Just like you and your siblings are related, mammals and reptiles are related. Both of you have a common ancestor. Reptiles and amphibians are related in the same way. Amphibians and fish are also related. Saying &quot;humans came from fish&quot; implies there's a direct relationship between them. In reality, humans and fish have a common ancestor, but humans don't come directly from fish.</p>
<p>If you're willing to go as far as possible, you'll end up finding the common ancestor of <strong>all life in Earth</strong>, named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_common_ancestor" target="_blank">LUCA</a> (Last Universal Common Ancestor).</p></div>		</li>
