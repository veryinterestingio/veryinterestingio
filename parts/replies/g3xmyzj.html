			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't a physicist still be interested in shorter lived elements to some degree? It might not be relevent to chemists but I would think even short lived stability would have some impact on more fundamental physics if for no other reason than to understand the nature of such instability?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right. A nucleus having a very small lifetime is called a resonance. Despite not living much, you can detect them by searching for an increase of the production probability of that given nucleus at the energy of the resonance.</p>
<p>As to why this is important I will give you just a simple example. Stars usually burn hydrogen to produce helium. So how do you produce the carbon we are made of? Two resonances! First two of this helium nucleus form a beryllium-8 nucleus, that exists only as a resonance. If, by chance another helium nucleus interacts with the beryllium, there is a very important resonance called the Hoyle state that allows to produce an excited carbon nucleus with a very small lifetime. Nonetheless there is a small chance this carbon doesn't explode back to helium and stabilises himself by emitting gamma rays. Notice that if it wasn't for that resonance to be at just the right energy, we wouldn't be here writing this post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, nuclear half-lives go down to about 10^(-22) seconds, and nuclear physicists are interested in those. We don’t care too much whether it can form an electron cloud, because we’re interested in the nucleus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But is does not really matter if you call it atom or not, if you study it just the same, which means only physical, because to unstable to do anything chemical.</p></div>		</li>
