<p>Lastly, I think the spinning nature also has to do with it. A spinning disc and all that stuff that supports it is more complex than the solid state memory we have these days. There's a limit to how small we can feasibly make them, and I think it's just not a viable option to keep making these mechanical drives smaller when solid state media can be as fast or faster, and still smaller.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdrive" target="_blank">Microdrives</a> (made by IBM &amp; Hitachi) used the physical form factor of CompactFlash, but were actually full hard disk drives in a tiny <strong>1&quot;</strong> form factor. At the time, disk platters were faster than SSD, and so this was useful for things like digital photography.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And if anything they want to start getting bigger. The 3.5&quot; format physically limits how large the drive can be, which wasnt a problem all that long ago because innovations in making the spinning platters denser was relatively simple and cheaper than manufacturing a drive with multiple platters.</p>
<p>Now were finding it really difficult to innovate more in making the platters denser and its coming with tradeoffs, so were making HDD's larger capacity by having more and more platters in them, which takes up physical space. So to fit ever more platters in they have to get thinner and closer together, while fitting a read head under every platter, while they spin at 7200 rpm... Drive manufacturers would probably enjoy a bit more room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big use case for that level of storage in hds is server storage and we use 36 bay servers for that, and have ways of linking storage that is as fast as being in the server itself. Debdity isn't a huge problem anymore. For home use, some use case of wanting more storsge but it ends up being a case size problem not density. Making a bigger hd would just mess with an established standard and not give anything more by chopping it up differently. I dont know why they would want that.</p>
<p>If anything in the storage world we would want smaller form factors like 2.5&quot; so we can do smaller server sizes, but thebindustry is going a different route with attached storage vs onboard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So after a certain point in time, the expression &quot;there is no replacement for displacement&quot; would ring true?</p>
<p>That even though things get smaller and more compact, more crazy efficient, they still somehow have limitations that their bigger brethren simply breeze through?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This works for SSDs as well. Most SATA SSDs are mostly empty inside. They just need a larger case so they are the same size as other SATA drives.</p></div>		</li>
