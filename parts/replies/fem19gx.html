			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a couple years ago when there was like a live streaming video of a McDonald's hamburger that went viral because it was several years old and never molded or anything. The claim was something like &quot;because there's so many preservatives and <em>chemicals</em>, but Serious Eats did an actual experiment and showed it was just due to water loss.</p>
<p>I also like how they leave them in a sealed environment and keep watching for something to magically grow as if the theory of spontaneous generation wasn't falsified 400 years ago</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the food coming out of a proper McD kitchen is pretty much sterile, so there's not much fungus/bacteria to begin with. Add that on top of the sealed environment and water loss and you have <a href="https://www.icelandreview.com/news/icelands-last-mcdonalds-order-just-turned-ten/" target="_blank">a timeless cheeseburger</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright. I think it was Virgil who described a Roman surgeon successfully fixing a fracture on a legionnaire, after they set the bone right they would bandage the leg with a mixture of wine and honey. So I assume the alcohol was there to help prevent bacteries to thrive.</p>
<p>Damn the romans were advanced for the time. They did that before even the germ theory was made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just that bacteria doesn’t like honey and that honey is a barrier to an infection as a result. Honey does have actual antibacterial properties. It also has a pH balance that promotes oxygen and healing in wounds. It is sometimes still used to this day in the treatment of chronic wounds.</p>

<p>EDIT:  And <a href="https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1702-how-honey-heals-wounds" target="_blank">here is another article</a> that goes more in depth. I forgot that honey also produces hydrogen peroxide and the high sugar content draws out bacteria-containing fluids through osmosis where the bacteria is then essential dehydrated to death by the honey.</p></div>		</li>
