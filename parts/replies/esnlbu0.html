			<div class="markdown"><p>Common phrase among EMTs, &quot;... better than being dead.&quot; If CPR is done correctly, ribs tend to dislocate or sometimes break. If something needs to be done medically that's not ideal (amputation, pulling someone with fractured spine out of a vehicle...) they will absolutely do it if the alternative is having to inform next of kin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's way outside of an EMT's scope of practice. If there was stome wild situation in which the only way to free a trapped patient was amputation, I have heard of (exceedingly rare) cases where a surgeon or two was flown or driven out to the patient to perform the surgery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine no, or rather, not in any situation they are trained for. Amputation isnt a very complex surgery, but it is still something that youd want a doctor for. Eventually, an amputation is just lopping off a limb, but before that, you need to make sure all the blood vessels are tied off. If a person is just going to bleed out, youll probably be in a worse situation than if you just left him pinned--and if youre working with the legs, those vessels are huge and a person can exsanguinate in seconds.While EMTs are very useful for picking people up and getting a rough workup on a person before they reach the hospital, they probably dont have the anatomical education or surgical training to safely do such procedures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that you only perform CPR on what is technically already a corpse. Once the heart has stopped beating, it's not an issue if you break some ribs - Theres not a huge chance to successfully revive someone anyway, and if you do, broken ribs are a reasonable price for not being dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was my understanding that performing CPR on a heart that's doing anything <em>but</em> not beating is basically a huge problem. Like, a heart that's stopped can be &quot;manually actuated&quot; by force, but that same pressure could stop a working or partially malfunctioning heart. </p>
<p>It's one of those &quot;you do it because it might revive them or keep oxygen flowing until someone can revive them&quot; not a &quot;stop them from dying&quot;. Because... you know... you'd kill them if you tried it while they were alive (or at least severely injure them for no apparent gain).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The purpose of CPR is <em>not</em> to revive someone. The purpose is to keep blood flowing and oxygen circulating (what little there is left im they're system anyway) until paramedics arrive. </p>
<p>You're basically keeping the body &quot;fresh&quot; until emergency services arrive.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>When I first learned CPR that was one of my questions:  How can you compress the heart without the ribs breaking? </p>
<p>The answer from the EMT surprised me at first. Done right, you'll feel and hear them crack on the first compression.  After that you shouldn't feel any resistance, that's how you know.</p>
<p>That type of emergency compression isn't a choice between having broken ribs or the risk of a perforated lung due to the bones.  It is a choice between 100% dead due to heart failure, versus about 80% who die after receiving CPR.</p>
<p>Given the choice between 0% survival and 20% survival, most people would take 20%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for mentioning the whole not allowed to eat when coming in the ER. I get yelled at all the time by patients for not allowing them to eat or drink after I just CT scanned them. I try to explain, worst case scenario, if you need to go to surgery, they can do it right away. Then I bring them back to their room, family member gives them a Big Mac and fries. Then I get yelled at by the patient’s family member for trying to stop it. It’s all so lovely...</p></div>		</li>

<p>that expalins why I was sent home with a broken collarbone to sleep exactly not at all, in order to be get the surgery at around 10am, roughly 20 hours after the accident. I was a little pissed at the time but I guess it makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya people tend to get the wrong idea with broken bones that they are an injury that has to be treated right away. You'll be fine for a couple days with a broken bone yes it will hurt but no you're not dying (unless the bone shattered or broke in such a way to harm organs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine did lose a couple of splinters but the doctor said it wasn't anything to be worried about based on location and the size of the splinters. And they put me in what felt like half a straight jacket anyway which already helped with the pain. Don't get me wrong, it sucked, but I'd rather spend a sucky night then potentially breathe in my own vomit and die.</p></div>		</li>
