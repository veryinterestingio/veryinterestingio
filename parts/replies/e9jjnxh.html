			<div class="markdown"><p>well if the person you said you killed was actually dead and known to be murdered, or has never had a body found, then ya i imagine they would at least look into it</p>
<p>but no, i do not think they would count a comedians stand-up bit as a confession unless it led to them finding actual evidence, in which case a confession doesn't really matter anyway. i feel like at worst it could lead to a warrant to search their house/car, but i'm also talking out of my ass so don't listen to me. but it seems logical in my mind</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn’t only be a suspect if that person was actually murdered. That means there was 100% a crime committed. You also wouldn’t be prosecuted if the DA didn’t believe there was a chance you were the actual killer. Saying you did coke doesn’t provide any evidence. They can’t prosecute you without any evidence. If you got on stage and confessed to a murder you committed, they would prosecute you because someone was actually murdered and you are a likely suspect</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not true. The TSA are not law enforcement officers, and have no authority to detain you, arrest you, or search your personal devices. All the TSA does is screen you before you board a flight. U.S. Customs searched her device (as any customs official does when you land in a foreign country). They are allowed to due to the border search exception. Customs can bar you entry to a country you're not a citizen of for quite a few reasons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been to lots of different countries and I have never had anyone request access to my phone.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't questioning or debating whether they are allowed to or not. The person I replied to stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>same reason comedians like jim jefferies can talk about doing coke. just because you said you did it doesn't really mean anything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet this scenario shows that you can be held accountable for what you have said.</p></div>		</li>
