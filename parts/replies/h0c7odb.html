			<div class="markdown"><p>Gödel's incompleteness theorem is, at it's base, a way to translate the sentence &quot;This statement is unprovable&quot; into actual math. The most interesting part to me is exactly how Gödel does this, but if you just want a layman level understanding, that is exactly what it does. The existence of this statement implies that there is at least one math problem which cannot be solved, no matter how hard one tries.</p>
<p>The reason this is significant is because every mathematician was under the impression that mathematics can do everything, but Gödel proved that there is at least one thing you can't prove no matter how robust and powerful your system of mathematics is. It's sort of like a Pandora's box in this way, as once you've proven that one thing is unprovable... how many other things are? Mathematicians often dedicate their entire lives towards proving <em>very</em> hard problems, but what if one of them is just like Gödel's statement and cannot be proven? They will have wasted their entire lives on a pointless effort, which seems frightening to just about anyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little less scary than that - it can be proven that a statement is unprovable, and this is a valid solution to a problem.</p>
<p>The truth of a statement depends on your 'model', which mathematical world you live in. The simplest example here is geometry. If you take Euclid's first famous four postulates, you get something where you can prove some geometric theorems about triangles. But the parallel postulate, or, to take a different example, the sum of the angles in a triangle - that's unprovable with only these 4 axioms.</p>
<p>Why so? Because there's different mathematical worlds where the statement can be true or false. In a flat plane, the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. But on a sphere, this statement is false, you can draw triangles with larger angle sums: on the earth, draw a line from the north pole down to the equator. Move along the equator 90 degrees in longitude. Now go back to the north pole. This triangle you've walked has an angle sum of 270.</p>
<p>Given Euclid's first 4 axioms of geometry, the statement &quot;the angle measures of a triangle sum to 180 degrees&quot; is unprovable, and we've just proved that! Because there's models where it's true (the flat plane) and models where it's false (the sphere). Both are consistent (don't lead to contradictions).</p>
<p>Godel's incompleteness theorem states that in (almost) all logical systems (eg our set of Euclids 4 axioms of geometry), there will be some statement (eg &quot;the angle measures...&quot;) that is unprovable.</p>
<p>The &quot;almost&quot; expands to something like &quot;all sufficiently complex logical systems&quot; and the bar is very low - if you can talk about the natural numbers, and add them up, it's complicated enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but there’s also a counterpoint to consider—one very famous example of this is Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. The final proof took advantage of proof techniques and other constructions that were practically infants in math-years, so for most problems that seem like they cannot be solved, there is a general awareness that there’s no way of knowing whether it’s because they’re actually unsolvable or just not solvable <em>yet</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's useful to understand it in its historical context.
At the time that Gödel was going through his education, Russell and Whitehead (two of the biggest names in philosophy/mathematics at the time) were developing their magnum opus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica" target="_blank">the Principia Mathematica</a>.</p>
<p>The Principia Mathematica was a bold attempt to prove <em>all</em> of mathematics from first principles.
<em>All</em> of mathematics.
&quot;From first principles&quot; means that it takes them several hundred pages of (extremely dense) proofs before they even get to the concept of a &quot;number&quot;.
Leading up to the Principia Mathematica, mathematicians had been drilling down further and further into the fundamentals of mathematics, down to what they thought was the bedrock (e.g., Zermelo-Frankel axioms) and Russell and Whitehead believed it was time to show that all of human mathematical achievement for the past 4000 years could be laid out in one unbroken chain, no t uncrossed or i undotted, of objective mathematical truth.</p>
<p>They got pretty far.
If you have access to a moderate sized university, your university probably has a copy of Principia Mathematica (or however much of it was completed) in their library.
Go check it out to get a feel for what they were trying to do and how much work they put into it.
They did actually accomplish a lot.
Just not everything they hoped for.</p>
<p>Kurt Gödel was a young whippersnapper who went up to the biggest giants in all of academia and said &quot;Oh you know that thing you're devoting your life to? Lol it's impossible. Can't be done&quot;.</p>
<p>In essence, Gödel's work focuses on logical systems.
These &quot;logical systems&quot; may be simple proof systems or complex mathematical systems like calculus or set theory.
He proved that, for <em>any</em> logical system that was powerful enough to encode the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, ...), you can't give a (correct) proof for everything that's true, within the system itself.
You <em>can</em> prove everything that's true, if you give those proofs from an external (more powerful) system, but you can't prove everything that's true just from within the system itself.
So, you can't prove all mathematical truths using mathematics.</p>
<p>The Incompleteness Theorems are often described as giving a choice between two properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Soundness. Every proof is correct (it is impossible to prove something false)</li>
<li>Completeness. Everything that is true can be proven (there are no true statements which are left unproved)</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to choose between the two of them.
You can't have both (unless you petition to a more powerful external logical system).</p>
<p>Almost always in philosophy, mathematics and computer science, we value soundness over completeness.
I.e., we would like that everything that is proved to be true is actually true, even if it means we have some statements which remain forever unproved (or some computations that remain unhalted).
So, our logical systems are all &quot;incomplete&quot;.</p>
<p>Russell and Whitehead were pissed, by the way.</p></div>		</li>
