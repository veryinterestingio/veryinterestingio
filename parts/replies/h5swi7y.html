			<div class="markdown"><h1>2. People forget that during normal sleep people lose about a liter of water naturally (sweat, breathing, etc.). This is why you weigh less in the morning. Now, couple that with a substance that dehydrates you and you have a recipe for a hangover. If you aren't taking in fluids while you sleep then you're going to get double dehydrated (made this DD joke up, but seriously). My best advice for staving off a hangover is to take a multivitamin, and a few glasses of water before bed.</h1></div>		</li>

<p>(lemon water, or sprite, my friends. stay hydrated - less hangovers)</p>
<p>Sobering up means ingesting other liquids. So you fare better &quot;sobered up&quot; (more hydrated) than without hydrating before sleeping (which dehydrates you more).</p></div>		</li>
