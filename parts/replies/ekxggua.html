</blockquote>
<p>I'm curious, could you expand on this? Like, how is the experience of trying to hear a song in your mind?</p>
<p>For me I can hear songs so clearly that it could be real. I can hear all the instruments so well that I can identify things like effects used on the guitar, the characteristics of the drums, the notes of the melody etc. (should be noted I am a musician). Honestly, there are only a few signs as to tell it is not real. First of all, real sounds always come from a direction. In my head it feels like it is somehow really deep into my brain, like it bypass the ear. Secondly, it is always the same volume. I kind of know what my &quot;minds volume&quot; is by now. It's like how you can use your inner voice to whisper and scream, but the actual volume stays the same regardless.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's how I experience it, would love to hear more about how it is for you, since most of this thread deals only with visualization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me I have to make up the sound of the drums with some kind of vibration from within (like my teeth hitting each other to make a sound, or back of my throat to make some kind of beat) and then use my inner voice for stuff like lead guitar and the rest is basically like my visual imagination unfortunately. I think with this process I can safely say that imaginary visualization is simply a tool to process information which some people like me dont possess. I know what I want to hear, like the chords and beat of the drums and vocals but I have to choose one over the other because I can only express them inside my mind with vibrations and my inner voice. So it doesnt sound like the real thing at all I guess, simply an imitation.</p>
<p>Im not much of a musician but I play guitar for about 2 years and that maybe helps me a little? not sure. </p>
<p>Also something to do with sound, I dont know if everyone can do this but after a while of maybe living with someone in the same place or simply being around the same people for a while I can tell exactly who is walking next to me without smell/vision, Doesnt even have to be a pattern of walking they usually have, its like I can sense it through vibrations or some shit like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think i'm not far off on what OP has i think, and i used to think i could &quot;hear&quot; a whole song, but ever since i delved in this a bit more i realize the furthest i get is humming the melodies for myself. But because this is all i used to know this was rememberring music for me. And i've been playing music for over 20 years, write my own music as well. </p>
<p>You tend not to think about how you think, as for you that's your only reality. They only found out about aphantasia very recently because someone lost his minds eye after an accident. Because you tend to think that the way you think is normal.</p>
<p>I had been thinking about it for a while, as my girlfriend is the complete opposite, she has very vivid pictures of everything she thinks of. And i would tease her with gross thoughts, then she would try and do the same with me. But i am completely unphased by that. I then thought she was weird for thinking with images!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some reason I used to subconsciously conduct a mini symphony orchestra when i day dream. Very strange considering I mainly listen to hip hop and know basic guitar.
Sound would be extremely high quality but vanish when i attempt to focus on it at all so it could only be subconscious yet real good quality.
Sometimes i also mimicked talk back radio, lol no idea whats up with that thought it would be a fun story like all yours here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can remember it as in I can describe it in my mind (as in literally tell my self the facts about what the objects consists of with my inner voice) but when imagining it or trying to recall it in my mind nothing pops up. My memory is good but when trying to imagine a memory or imagine an something infront of me its an absolute nothing</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can others see color with their eyes closed?</p></div>		</li>
