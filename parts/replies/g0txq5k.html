			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Usually what you do is you have a physical basis for why a certain small step of time is good enough.  If you don't know what timescale is fine enough, what you can do is run the simulation twice at different timesteps. For example, if you run the simulation in one second increments and it gives the same result as if you ran it with millisecond increments, you're solution is probably accurate at the second scale (since the solution is not changing). If you run the two and they are different, now you need to compare millisecond scale with microsecond scale to see if millisecond was accurate enough, and so on and so on. Eventually you will run out of resolution (precision) in your computer, and you come to the conclusion that the system is not solvable this way. This is a real error that happens not irregularly, and rounding precision in your calculations can hurt you just because of the finite size a 64 bit number can store.</p></div>		</li>
