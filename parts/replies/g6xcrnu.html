<p>Edit: Make sure to put them in a water tight container, thanks u/coldBrewSeattle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily enough, Silica Gel is actually non-toxic. It's not good for you, still don't eat it, you don't digest it easily so it'll some out the other end more or less the same (For this self same reason, it's a choking hazard). But it won't kill you, contrary to popular belief.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.</p>
<p>Used to work as an IT Technician so I always had a few of the big ones from laptop boxes. They were great for keeping in the car to prevent the windows fogging up in winter.</p>
<p>Also another tip: if you car fogs up in winter and it has air con, turn it on and set the air source to internal and temp to full. This will suck in the cold damp air from the passenger compartment and replace it with hot dry air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or use a baby diaper. Way better absorbent.</p>
<p>Edit: It's a real tip. The crystals in diapers absorb crazy amounts of liquid/moist. I think it's the same stuff as in those Sica-gel things you get in packages.</p></div>		</li>
