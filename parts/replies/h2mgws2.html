<p>Empathy: ADHD individuals tend to feel emotions stronger and are more empathetic than others. People with ADHD can make very strong leaders in fields where genuine empathy is valued as an important skill</p>

<p>That's an interesting one. People seem to always find me distant and somewhat unsympathetic.</p>
<p>RSD rings extremely true to me though. Failure at something I've put genuine effort in, like dating or academics, has been enough to put me out literal for weeks. Doesn't help my parents weren't aware of my condition and just thought I was emotionally weak lmao.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing.</p>
<p>I think that's partly due to inattention and thus being unable to show a proper reaction when needed. Partly to hyperactivity and impulsivity which might look like rudeness. Partly to RSD which makes us afraid to make contact. Also, maintaining a connection requires quite a discipline which is hard by itself.</p>
<p>So even though we may feel deeply for people we find it really hard to make people comfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for mentioning it. Yes, that’s where I probably fell into a few traps. More research needed, not specifying some nuance, and perhaps some projecting a bit in this instance.</p>
<p>Looking more into it now at a glance, I am seeing sources for both greater empathy and reduced empathy, so there’s some conflicting stuff on the surface that I think will both make sense once I read and put into context. </p>
<p>Besides that, something that I also forgot to be specific on was the variable factors. Before more research on this, I believe that empathy is a capacity that could be had if it’s facilitated and harnesses correctly. For me, I feel things so strongly myself that it’s easy for me to empathize with others when things go wrong because I can imagine exactly what it feels like. That being said, there are no absolutes with anything in diagnosis besides a general “is the person affected by symptoms that affect their life in 2 of the 3 in home, school,  or personal life”. The diagnosis super broad and there’s a LOT of factors even beside specific brain chemistry that could affect some differences like this, such as family upbringing, past experiences, schooling,
cultural shaping of what it means to share feelings, etc. For me, my upbringing combined with teacher education and working with great people to support me has allowed me to utilize empathy very well with others. </p>
<p>For reference, I had heard first in a conference  I had for professional development on working with ADHD students about empathy being a strong point for a lot of people with ADHD, but did not research too far into it because I knew several examples of it with people I know personally and it rang so true with myself as well. Before I research more, I do believe still personally that the connection to feeling emotions strongly gives a high capacity for empathy, but the output from that into empathy requires using that input correctly to do so. Depending on some of the above factors I mentioned above that could be attributed to the range of difference between one person to the next, ability to tap into this could absolutely vary. For those seeking to harness it, therapy could potentially help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>@I_P_L yes, learning about RSD changed my entire life because it allowed me to take a step back and recognize when I was over reacting, that it was normal, and remind myself to get some perspective and some time to process it.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert and you would know better than I would. In my head it adds up logically to me that growing up and having your feelings dismissed when you took something particularly hard could actually be related to that difficulty tapping into the empathy. Nature of having the capacity of high emotions conducive to empathy vs nurture of being shown the framework of how to utilize it with others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does make a lot of sense. I kind of internalised the whole tough love mentality and end up needing to catch myself mentally when I feel dismissive of someone else's feelings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's define sympathy and empathy a bit more precise for this post:</p>
<p>Empathy: The ability to know what others are feeling.
Sympathy: The ability to feel what others are feeling.</p>
<p>My (24M, diagnosed with adhd 2 years ago) empathy is absolute crap. I'm a bit on the spectrum, and my ability to read facial expression, body language or other social cues is basically non-existent. I'd rate it 1/10.</p>
<p>My sympathy on the other hand is very high. I love reading love/fluff stories (preferably first person) because when I read about happy people, I am happy. However the inverse is also true. I have never rewatched &quot;The Luck of the Fryirish&quot; or &quot;Jurassic Bark&quot;. In fact just writing about them makes me tear up. I also skip embarrasing/cringe scenes when possible or I hold my ears and close my eyes when I'm in company. Sometimes when it's especially bad I simply leave the room. I'd rate it 9/10.</p>
<p>So from my personal experience, it's not empathy that's unusually high, it's sympathy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria - I’m putting this first because this is the one you don’t hear about, and it’s perhaps the most important for you supporting your friend. TLDR, ADHD peeps take criticism especially hard, and can often break down because of rejection. I haven’t read into it in a while, I believe the figure was 90% of people with ADHD say it’s a factor, and 30% say it’s the most difficult part of having it. Simply knowing this was a part of it and putting a name to it CHANGED MY LIFE, and has made it so much easier to cope with. This is the flip side to the empathy piece. This is a piece that therapy helps with a lot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is such a major thing that is important to know about.  I got someone a super bright light bulb for their garage because their old one burnt out.  They didn't like it and put a normal light bulb back in there instead.  It <strong>destroyed me</strong> to the point where I didn't leave my bedroom for 24 hours afterward, and it took several more days after that to shake the feelings of worthlessness.  Over a light bulb!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, it's even possible to RSD yourself. A strange chain of events lead to me scuffing the fender of my car on a concrete pillar of an IKEA. Locked myself in and refused to drive for a week or so. I'm probably the most careful driver I know, but <em>man</em> did it hurt when I found out that apparently I'm not careful <em>enough</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES! It feels absolutely insane some time. Of course, just knowing about it doesn’t mean that I don’t still feel the rejection hard, but it’s done wonders for reframing my mind, feeling confident again quicker, and refocusing my energy instead to make the situation better. I know, it’s about the worst feeling in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all, my panic attacks started a few months ago and I am going to try and work out why they are occurring in the first place. I stumbled on your reply and a lot of things seem very familiar, but it's hard to tell if it's a good path to go down to or that I should first invest in finding out what is bothering me and creating those attacks.</p></div>		</li>
