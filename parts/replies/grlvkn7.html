			<div class="markdown"><p>Most animals will bite and lick at wounds way past the point of just cleaning it. There is a reason dogs get cones and such by the vet, they will re-injure themselves more often than not. Serious injuries are just rare enough that it doesn't cause any serious evolutionary pressure on a species to select for being &quot;smarter&quot; about recovery. Traits that reduce the risk of serious injury in the first place are more likely since even a minor injury can be a death sentence if your ability to hunt or flee is impaired in any way.</p></div>		</li>
