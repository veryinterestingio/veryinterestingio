			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  Specific heat capacity (Q).  </p>
<p>This is the reason your tile floor feels cold vs your rug.  They are both the same temperature (test it).</p>
<p>Edit: others reminded me that my memory has failed me.   Read on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure the cold feeling is because of different thermal conductivity, not heat capacity.</p>
<p>Heat capacity defines of much heat transfer you'll need for thermal equilibrium. That tells you how long it will feel cold.</p>
<p>Thermal conductivity defines how much heat is lost per second. That tells how much cold it feels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more precise, Q for aluminium is about 900 J/kg째C, whereas for water it's 4200 J/kg째C.</p>
<p>If we assume that aluminium foil is 200째C, it would feel like touching a very thin layer of water at 70째C. It's not cool by any means, but the amount of heat in the material is just not that big.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it's been a while since thermo, but isn't C or C_p the notation for specific heat and Q is the total energy transferred?</p></div>		</li>
