			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been walking around anxious the last couple of days to hear about the job I went on interview for last week. I've yet to experience that crash. It's just permanent cold and sweaty anxiousness.</p>
<p>Ninja edit: If you <em>are</em> feeling anxious (like me) here's a pro tip - eat something. As stated above adrenaline redirects blood from digestion. If you eat something you'll force the body to handle the digestion and thus feel a bit more normal for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adrenaline is an acute stress hormone and with it cortisol is released as well. Adrenaline fades away quickly, but the cortisol system stays over a longer period of “milder” stress. I cannot tell you exactly how it works but you can look it up online. A lot of usefull information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, so it's kind of like your body is saying &quot;We're about to fight or run, either way we'll use our muscles heavily and overheat, so just start sweating already and get a head start on it!&quot;, and then you do neither and underheat instead</p></div>		</li>
