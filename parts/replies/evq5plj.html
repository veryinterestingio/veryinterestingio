			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey bud i dont know if this is a question that you can answer without me sitting in your chair, but here goes nothing. </p>
<p>I have pretty good vision in my left eye almost 20/20 its just barely out of focus for me, but my right eye the optometrist scrolled the chart up and i still couldnt read it. Pretty sure it was the 20/70 line. He said that it was due to my eye being flat instead of curved and said the only fix was contacts. From the minute i walked in the nurses(?) Were pushing contacts while i was looking at glasses and then before he even saw me he kept asking if i had ever tried contacts. He then said i had the flat eye thing which was &quot;1/10000&quot; and only fixed by contacts. His machine was down to tell if i had it or not but he said to come back. I didnt feel comfortable with how  pushy they were with contacts after telling them i didnt want them so i never went back. My insurance only pays for 1 screening a year so ive just been living with no glasses waiting till next year. I get lot of small headaches and driving at night is really hard. Is what he said credible? And if so is the only fix contacts? Im fine close up but anything at a distance is like i have double vision one part being clear but its like there is a fuzzy blob covering the clear text.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but also an eyeguy. What you might be describing is keratoconus, it's a bit like astigmatism but a lot more extreme (the front part of the eye is more cone shaped than a dome). It's really hard to correct with glasses. However, you can put a hard contact lens over the misshapen cornea. Since it's a rigid contact lens not all of it will be in contact with the cornea, these spaces will fill up with tear film and effectively simulate a normal shaped cornea. Kind of a simplified explanation but that's the gist of it, there's a /r/keratoconus subreddit that's quite supportive.</p>
<p>That being said this might be off, since you said it was a &quot;flat eye&quot; problem which seems like an odd layman explanation for Keratoconus. I really should be asleep rn so maybe my tired brain is forgetting an obvious alternative lol, but your description seems to fit keratoconus the best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats the word he used, he just described it as the top layer of my eye was flat instead of spherical, he also went off on some tangent about how it was more common in people with allergies. </p>
<p>If it is keratoconus will it get worse if i wait until my insurance renews to get treatment? Or should i iust suck it up and pay out of pocket for an exam at a different optometrist? Ive lived with this for about a year already before i caved and went into the eye doc. I wont go back to that guy though, awful office experience.</p>
<p>Edit: i forgot to say thank you :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey eyeguy! Pardon me for piggy backing here but I’ll give this a shot, i can’t find answer anywhere. Recently ordered glasses online and ordered an anti-scratch lens. Once it arrived I noticed they added ADD +0.50. My prescription is 0.00.. after contacting them, apparently the anti-scratch lens comes automatically with ADD +0.50.
The first time I wore it I had a headache, figured I was just adjusting. Next few days my eyes are very tired, but then again my physical condition wasn’t that good too (lack of sleep etc).
I was wondering if I should be worried? Does this have a negative effect to my eyesight and others? They said to give it a week and if not return it. But I’m afraid my eyes will adjust to it instead. Any insights are appreciated and my apologies I’m just desperate and worried. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real question. How easy would this test be to perform at home with a set of lenses and a chart/rubric/instructions for arriving at a number?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not as simple as you would think. Typically exam lanes and equipment are calibrated for specific working distances. I am sure you can get close to ones prescription but it will not be as precise. You would need to invest in proper equipment, at which point you are better off going to an optometrist. Also its not all about the glasses prescription, theres way more to an eye exam than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish you guys wouldn't use the autorefractor, it seems on more than one occasion I got glasses that didn't work well for me.  Slight improvement but nothing close to what I'd call good vision.  I read better with just magnifying glasses I get at the pharmacy.  And I go to a reputable eye place, one of the largest in the country, I won't name but you can likely guess from that clue.</p></div>		</li>
