			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question, if I have fallen asleep once on the couch and wake up, then go to my bed, I'm just as tired and almost immediately fall asleep. Wouldn't the activity wake me back-up or is the momentum of sleep too great at that point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this in college. There was a class right after lunch time I ALWAYS fell asleep in. I even tried sitting in the front row to pay attention and that just resulted in me falling asleep in front of the professor. Eventually I thought about drinking water when I felt sleepy to get some blood flowing (maybe not stay focused since i tried so hard to pay attention to the water I was drinking but at least not fall asleep).</p>
<p>It didn't work, i still fell asleep, but a little more hydrated than before</p></div>		</li>
