			<div class="markdown"><p>+1  In addition to the pivot-point answers here, a major factor that exacerbates this effect is known as the <strong>&quot;bore-axis&quot;</strong> and it's relation to this <strong>&quot;pivot-point&quot;</strong> (your hand/wrist, or shoulder with a long gun).</p>
<p>If you checkout competitive practical pistol shooters you'll notice a big lack of diversity in the handguns they shoot <em>(practical meaning time-based shooting sports, IDPA, USPSA, etc and not bullseye or PPC)</em>.  Most are 1911/2011, Glock, or CZ pattern pistols.   The common feature among most of pistols is the very low bore-axis.</p>
<p>A low bore-axis makes a pistol more controllable to shoot fast &amp; accurately.  Competitively, we describe that as a 'flat shooting' pistol design.</p>
<p>This same feature is why you see very few pistols that go the other direction in compition,  say a HK USP pistol,  a higher bore-axis (and slide with more mass to boot), makes it a less competitive pistol when you're on the clock and keeping score.  And even further down the 'high bore-axis' spectrum, look at a single-action revolver in 454 Casull for brutal recoil and pivot effect.</p></div>		</li>
