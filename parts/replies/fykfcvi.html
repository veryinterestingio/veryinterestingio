			<div class="markdown"><p>It is.</p>
<p>White is the reflection of all colors. Black is the absorption of all colors. All colors in-between are absorbing some shades and reflecting others. A blue object predominantly reflects blue light and absorbs orange light as orange is the complementary color of blue. An orange object predominantly reflects orange light and absorbs blue. Blue light has a shorter wavelength meaning it is more powerful than orange light. So the blue object reflects the more intense light, and the orange object absorbs the more intense light. Consequently orange fades faster than blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep this is the real answer. The other answers sidestep the actual reasoning, essentially just restating the question with some technical detail as if that were the answer. &quot;Some pigments degrade faster than others&quot; doesn't explain <em>why</em> blue sticks around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the top couple of answers are literally just reframing the question. The question is asking why some pigments stay around longer - the answer &quot;some pigments stay around longer&quot; isn't helpful</p></div>		</li>
