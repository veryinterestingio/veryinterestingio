			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there are any more, but if a word ends in -ung (think Wohnung, Apartment for example) is feminine, if it ends in -chen it's neutral (think Mädchen, Girl). There are of course exceptions, but in doubt, this is a fairly safe rule.</p>
<p>Maybe there are more, but I remember these two. I studied German and surprisingly enough a lot of Germans do not know these things. They &quot;just know&quot;.</p>
<p>Pro tip: if you are unsure of the gender, add -chen to the end of the word. This suffix gives the word a notion of cuteness/friendliness (?) (Bier vs Bierchen). Ta-daa! Now it's neutral!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are rules, I'm pretty sure about that. Because I can easily tell if a &quot;new&quot; words is m/f/n, so my brain seems to derive it from a secret set of rules. But I'm honest, I think there are <em>a lot</em> of rules necessary to cover everything. </p>
<p>For example *almost every alcohol is &quot;Der&quot;. So although it's &quot;Das Korn&quot; (the corn on the field) but &quot;Der Korn&quot;, the alcohol.  So in this way I think that often it depends on the ending but sometimes on the meaning of the words. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I am aware, many of them are heuristics rather than actual rules. Of course, words formed by word formation rules that are associated with a specific gender are quite clear, but with other words ... not everyone agrees always. </p>
<p>It's 'der Computer' because the ending -er, which English and German share, denotes a person who does something, and while in English it's not linked to gender anymore, in German it still is. (Computer used to be mostly a women's job, as far as I am aware.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think gender is assigned by whether it rhymes to words that are usually one particular gender, whether the word is associated with a gender in its language of origin, and whether there are concepts with a similar meaning already in the language.</p>
<p>For example, I say 'die E-Mail' because it's 'die elektronische Post', my mum says 'das E-Mail' because it's 'the e-mail' and a new loanword in German. Mum and I say 'das Joghurt' because it's a relatively new loan, my grandma used to say 'der Joghurt', I guess because it rhymes with the male given name Kurt. </p>
<p>You even get loanwords that change number, for example 'der Keks' (cookie, bisquit) which is said to stem from 'the cakes' and has since developed a new plural form. Older loans often have different gender associated than it would get if it was introduced right now - maybe influenced by the languages people actually speak and their local dialect of German. Also, it seems that younger people choose the -s plural form much more frequently than older people do. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Ouch, that hurts lmao. Der Joghurt all the way.</p>
<p>Another (extra) reason that Computer is masculine is because it replaced Rechner. The Germans would've been crazy to make Computer anything other than masculine!</p></div>		</li>

<p>In French, new nouns are assigned a gender by the Académie Française, which is the legal authority on the French language. New nouns are masculine by default unless there is a logical reason they should be feminine.</p>

<p>That is totally untrue, you really should edit your comment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By default, but not always.</p>
<p>Words borrowed from other languages can be feminine: it's <em>una Rolls-Royce</em> because the words for &quot;car&quot; (<em>automobile</em>, <em>autovettura</em>, <em>macchina</em>, <em>vettura</em>) are feminine, and <em>una password</em> because the word for &quot;word&quot; (<em>parola</em>) is feminine.</p>
<p>New nouns coined by Italians can also be feminine if they refer to a woman or if they are formed by modifying an already feminine noun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in Italian even after one word is borrowed, it may pass a lot of time before it is settled.
I swear I heard few people constantly referring to “email” as masculine term, although it is commonly and officially perceived as a feminine noun (because of the feminine noun “posta”, which means “mail).
But still they handle it as if it was  masculine, which kinda messes up things sometimes in formal situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same in Spanish, you can say &quot;una password&quot; (femenine) or &quot;un password&quot; (masculine). When a word comes from a neutral gender language sometimes it remains neutral and you can use it both ways. Other timea it takes the gender of the word in Spanish but by default masculine. Also in Spanish there are some neutral gender words like &quot;mar&quot; (sea) you can either say &quot;el mar&quot; (masculine) or &quot;la mar&quot; (femenine), although the femenine version is dissapearing in this case.</p></div>		</li>
