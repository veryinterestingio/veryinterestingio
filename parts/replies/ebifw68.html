			<div class="markdown"><p>I seem to read on reddit a lot that inbreeding is ok and it's a human rule we invented that makes it taboo. It's not genetically a good thing for animals to regularly breed with close relatives (sisters, brother, parents, offspring). Of course it can happen occasionally, but populations generally have ways to avoid close matings. For example in pack animals (lions, wolves, apes etc) either males or females will leave the group once they reach sexual maturity and join another pack. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why did humans make it so then?  Is it natural from
An animal perspective to be attracted to family or have we different biology that makes it much more perclverse
For humans to do so? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many animals have behaviors which, while not a direct taboo against incest, works that way in practice. For instance, young male horses, after a certain age, tend to leave their herd of origin and form bachelor herds. </p>
<p>Also, in many species, males and females reach sexual maturity at different ages, and this tends to discourage mating between siblings. </p>
<p>Once domesticated, however, animals tend to lose these characteristics, as humans are in control of their breeding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are some other neat anomalies like with <a href="https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/questions/do-wild-animals-avoid-incest" target="_blank">mice.</a> They’ll actively avoid committing incest unless absolutely necessary. But if a non-family member is introduced after incest, the female can actually abort her pregnancy to made with the non-family mouse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small experience : take a dog, play fetch with him and a tennis ball. Make the ball bounce in front of you 3 times before throwing it, do it a couple of times. Then, change the pace, like make it 2. You'll surprise him. Or make it 4 and watch it getting ready to run. (Yes it won't work with all of them, some just watch your reactions and are able to  guess you'll be throwing it).</p>
<p>Maybe they don't associate numbers with anything, but most animals are able to count. We just happen to have a word for it while they don't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Math is our abstraction of the physical world.  Animals don't understand the abstraction, but they absolutely understand the physical world.  Just like a baseball player, or a dog, can predict where a ball is going without knowing any of the complex math involved.  Which is all so say that seeing a missing child requires no math.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was hoping to see something like this upon reading the title.</p>
<p>Counting ≠ Math</p>

<p>Approached the idea but didn't explain it as such.</p>
<p>You did will with a couple of examples and I'm going to expand or reiterate the same concepts:</p>
<p>Similarly, animals often don't understand mechanics, but they practice physical movements nontheless.</p>
<p>Math is a <em>description.</em> You don't need it to operate in the physical world to get a general idea of how things work.  It enables communication, efficiency, accuracy, etc, but it's not necessary.</p>
<p>A creature doesn't count calories, it eats until it's full.  They don't calculate weight and leverage so much as push the object until they get it where they want it.  They may gain familiarity over time and know about how much force to use, but it's not a calculation, it's <em>conditioning.</em> And it's extremely present in humans as well.  From the way we send or receive signals through our nervous system to how we stand and walk and do most of anything in our lives.</p></div>		</li>
