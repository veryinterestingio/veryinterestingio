They will however get damaged more easily, struggle with camouflage and (this is just me guessing) maybe also courtship rituals where they kinda fly/dance around each other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I catch the big Mothras all the time to toss at people or release into my house &amp; pet their lil fuzz bods, so soft. Just too bad they eat my clothes. Anyways, they always seem to fly away normally. Dust tastes like shit, too, do not hide one in your mouth. Their wings are clear-ish if you rub the dust off, but they can still fly w/out it in my experience. I'm sure they could fly w/ both wings completely wiped off, but I don't know how well they could fly. Probably not a good idea, but you can still catch &amp; release like I do.</p>
<p>Moths are good bugs (best bug?), they're cool with it.</p></div>		</li>
