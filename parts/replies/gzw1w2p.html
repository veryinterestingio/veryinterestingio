			<div class="markdown"><p>Not many scientists are in it for the money. For the amount of training you have to go through — 3/4 years undergrad degree then 4-6 years of postgrad before you’re even starting your career, you could’ve trained to be a lawyer, or setup your own business, or become a financial trader, or go be a doctor in a private health company, or work as a consultant in any number of fields that are far more lucrative. </p>
<p>Having said that, it’s all relative. You can be a marine biologist and have a perfectly comfortable living, it’s not like you’ll be destitute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What an oddly specific piece of advice. There are definitely far more obscure and underfunded fields of science. In fact, some aspects of marine biology tie directly to assessment of fishing stocks and marine policies, which can be quite well paid. Not all marine biology roles of course, and I’ve emphasised elsewhere that research science is comparatively underpaid compared to any legal or industry jobs which require a similar amount of training... but it’s not like you can’t earn a decent living on an average marine biologist’s salary. I could pick far more unlikely jobs for someone to successfully achieve: an astronaut, a political leader, a prosthodontist, manager of a zoo, a navy seal, a Hollywood actor etc. etc. etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think the advice was supposed to be more general, like be you but also be realistic, she just didn't word it elegantly. My older siblings all got the same advice so we just suspected she had a bad experience with a marine biologist at some point in her life. Heart break can change a person!</p>
<p>I'm just bummed I have to give up on my dream of becoming a prosthodontist.</p></div>		</li>
