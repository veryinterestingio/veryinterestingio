			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that drinking cold stuff when your body temperature is high, makes it worse and actually increases your body temperature. So when you feel hot, temperature wise and not sexually speaking (although these two go hand in hand too at times, but I digress), if you drink something cold, your body apparently senses the drink temperature which is a lot colder than your body, and it apparently heats up further to compensate for the sudden drop in temperature. I believe in random articles and conspiracy theories (without any scientific backing whatsoever, as long as it convinces me), so my words should never be taken at face value. Although I think this is true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting.  I always feel colder after drinking iced drinks. But maybe my body temp is actually rising to the point that the ambient air temp feels cold, similar to the effect that a high fever might have on you.</p>
<p>I think you might be onto something ?</p></div>		</li>
