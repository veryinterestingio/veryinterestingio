			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, that's a good bit of condensed wisdom.</p>
<p>If you get a wound on dry land you'll remember to make up some salt water for the rinse.</p>
<p>If you get a wound at sea you'll remember to clean the wound with clean water instead of water out of the ocean</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, seawater is usually around 3% w/v salt while saline isotonic to body fluids is 0.9% salt. The rest is probably true, but sea water is quite different in terms of salt concentration to the stuff in the human body.</p>
<p>ETA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The salt concentration is similar to what's in the body...</p>

<p>Is what I was replying to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also quite different in each sea depending on latitude. Mediterranean sea is so salty that it hurts your eyes if you open them under water. Blacksea which is located in the north has much lower concentration. It still tastes salty but more tolerable if you swallow some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 3% figure is a rough average across the large oceans, and inland seas take that figure all haywire - the Dead Sea for example. I'd have to check if the Mediterranean is considered saltier than average!</p></div>		</li>
