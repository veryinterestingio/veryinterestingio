			<div class="markdown"><p>When we think about lenses, we usually think about then as &quot;focusing&quot; the image, but we can also think of them as collecting lots of copies of the same image.</p>
<p>If our goal was just to have an in focus image, then there's a perfect solution for that, a pinhole camera. With a very small and sharp pinhole, you'll get a nearly perfect (inverted) image with everything in &quot;focus&quot;. I put focus on quotes because it's not actually doing anything, it's just letting through over ray of light from every point in the scene.</p>
<p>But we don't just want an in focus image, we also need a lot of light to expose or film (or image sensor) quickly so that motion doesn't cause blurriness. A lens collects way more light than a pinhole. In fact, we can think of a lens like a whole bunch of pinholes all stacked up next to each other. Each point, or &quot;pinhole&quot;, on the lens sees the entire scene, a ray of light from every point in the scene is hitting every point on the lens. </p>
<p>If we just let that light go, it would create thousands and thousands of slightly overlapping images. We don't want that, we want all the copies of the images to line up on top of each other. That's what lens do, they're designed so that the &quot;image&quot; fitting every point on the surface of the lens will be refracted and bent so that it ends up on overlapped on the sensor.</p>
<p>Thinking about it this way makes two things very obvious to me, that I always used to find confusing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closing the aperture makes the image darker, but doesn't crop it. It would seem like if I closed off part of the lens, that the image shuttle look cropped? But what's actually happening is I'm blocking off copies of the image, the ones closest to edge, so the film/sensor is seeing fewer overlapped images of the scene</li>
<li>Wider aperture makes the depth of field narrower. This is because it's relatively easy to get the images lined up correctly (or in focus) when they're coming straight on. When they're hiring the edge of the lens and have to be bent/skewed back to the middle, it's tough to get everything exactly lined up. Often, it's only possible for certain distances from the lens. So, closing off the outer edge gets rid of those difficult cases, and the lens can get more of the image looking sharp, without them ruining it. </li>
</ul>
<p>When taking pictures of small objects the light is at larger angles hitting the lens, so bending it back is hard, even with a very tight aperture.</p>
<p>Although actually, if we reduced aperture by blocking off the middle of the lens (like with a sticker or something), would the depth of field get worse instead of better?</p></div>		</li>
