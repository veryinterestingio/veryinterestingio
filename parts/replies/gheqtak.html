			<div class="markdown"><p>We know for sure it was a flu strain because scientists managed to reconstruct the 1918 virus in a lab (from lung samples taken from the body of an Inuit woman, preserved in the permafrost, that succumbed to the disease) in an attempt to find out why it had such a devastating impact. More about that on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/reconstruction-1918-virus.html" target="_blank">this CDC page</a> (it's a long read, but a fascinating one).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The last section was kind of sadly ironic given the current covid pandemic and the USâ€™s shitshow response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sure is, but I'm afraid the same will happen the next time we end up neck-deep in a pandemic, having ignored the very same conclusions and recommendations that were given after the Covid pandemic. For the most intelligent species on the planet, we sure display some remarkable stupidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When actual tissue samples from the time period can't be found, there are two other ways that the viral species/strain involved in a past epidemic can be deduced.</p>
<p>One is to study the immune responses in the blood of people who were alive at the time - &quot;seroarchaeology&quot;. Their immune systems should still retain memory of the virus in the form of trace levels of antibodies that bind to it.</p>
<p>The other is to study the genomes of contemporary endemic viruses to determine their evolutionary history and when they likely made their most recent zoonotic jump or genetic reshuffling, and line this up with historical events, called a molecular clock analysis.</p>
<p>The 1889-90 Russian Flu pandemic is of interest, because seroarcheaeology points to an influenza H3 subtype (possibly H3N8) being more common in people who were born in the 1880-1900 time period, while molecular clock analysis of the human coronavirus species OC43 points to a common ancestor with bovine coronavirus around 1890.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! Thanks, it seems very interesting, I didn't even know &quot;seroarcheology&quot; existed.</p>
<p>I thought at this point I'd have seen about it in some sort of criminal procedure TV series where perhaps there's a character with some atypical personality, who's some sort of genius of seroarcheology and uses it to solve or prevent crimes, maybe terrorist plots, somehow.</p>
<p>I think I heard someone (I guess it would have been Nicholas Christakis, but it wasn't so much a key point he was making) posit that the 1918 flu could have well been a coronavirus, it didn't cross my mind it could have been one of the pan-endemic ones of the &quot;common cold&quot; &quot;sociovirome&quot; or whatever would be the word, I thought it could have been something that actually extinguished itself, more like SARS-1. Even though perhaps it could evolved the more mild form, at the same time people would end up having mounted adaptive immunity in a way that could hide its true latent virulence, like everyone in childhood getting infected with it. Some people mentioned cross-immunity with common-cold CoVs could have been the reason why children were almost unscathed by SARS-cov-2, with symptoms worsening with age. By 2003 or so, Canada had a &quot;false alarm&quot; of SARS, but it was really just this oc43 common cold coronavirus, that can still be deadly to the elderly, and tested falsely-positive for SARS antibodies.</p>
<p>&quot;Astrology&quot; was a topic in another thread I'm discussing (actually zodiacal job discrimination), I actually wrote &quot;seroastrology&quot; here without noticing. It's not everyday I end up accidentally inventing a whole new bold, revolutionary pseudoscience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This, IMO, is unsupported by evidence now, even though it was a popular hypothesis back in the spring. We now have direct counter-evidence for cross-reactivity, eg: <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20209650v1" target="_blank">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.08.20209650v1</a></p>
<p>A broader naive immune cell repertoire that's better equipped to respond and adapt to a novel pathogen explains the age stratification of SARS-CoV-2 much better, when we can even see that effect just looking at the variation in the population within an age group: <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31235-6?rss=yes" target="_blank">https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31235-6?rss=yes</a></p>
<p>This also fits with a virus like OC43 shifting from a pandemic virus to an endemic one without a major attenuating mutation, wherein people with previous exposure have long-term disease-attenuating immune responses but short-lived infection-preventing ones.</p></div>		</li>
