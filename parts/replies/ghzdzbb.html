			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a common misunderstanding. The main source of &quot;nasty gasses&quot; from a cow, comes from its burps. Cows swallow their food whole, then burp it up later to ruminate (not sure if this is the correct use of the English word).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but capturing said methane would require a lot of infrastructure and society and cow owners would not do it because they will lose more money that the money it would cost to do so</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The carbon cycle has been destabilized, because there have been more CO2 released in 200 years than the carbon that earth can absorb. And Methane (the nasty gas) is worse, because it helps the atmosphere absorb way more heat that CO2. Luckily it can decompose faster, but the fact that there is more carbon containing gases that absorb heat in the atmosphere than earth can process makes the gas nasty.</p></div>		</li>
