			<div class="markdown"><p>I described this to a psychologist and he called it a hypnagogic hallucination.  I actually hear voices in addition to physical hallucinations.</p>
<p>You seem to be not yet asleep but the dream has already begun.  It's weird but harmless.  Not a sign of anything.</p>
<p>Edited to add:  All of this is my experience and reading the link posted above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I too hear the voices. Was freaky as hell before I self diagnosed hypnagogic hallucinations, but now I look forward to it and kind of hope I get visual ones so I can meet my shadow demon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you say that.  I thought about saying something about liking them, finding them pleasant.  They can mess with your sleep habits but they seem like nice little &quot;appetizer&quot; dreams.  I thought nobody would understand.  Now I know, there's you!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also hear voices a lot of the time. And a lot of the time those voices are extremely distressed and cause a lot of physical fear and anxiousness for me. I usually canâ€™t pick a single word out though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep have suffered from these for a long time. They can vary alot from person to person. </p>
<p>Mine is very visual when attempting to fall asleep; seeing some kind a horrible monster in the shadows, something running across the room, something creeping on the ceiling. </p>
<p>But I also get auditory rarely, mostly when I am awake and slept horribly the night before, typically hearing my name or someone saying somethin inaudible to me. The worst ever though was when I was laying in pitch black and could've swore I heard teeth just chattering less than a foot away from my face. I totally froze until I was so freaked out I punched outward and scrambled for the light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, that sounds awful.  Mine are pretty tame.  What I hear is more like the secretary at my doctor's office!!</p>
<p>I'm almost embarrassed to admit it but I don't think I have enough of an imagination to have hallucinations as vivid as that.</p></div>		</li>
