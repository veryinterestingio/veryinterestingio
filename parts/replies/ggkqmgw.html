			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happened to me once. Sometimes you get caught in a blizzard so bad you can't even see your own hands when you hold them out in front of yourself. When that happens, you don't really know if you're moving or not, so you just kinda have to hope you're not moving when you sit down, but if you are then you'll just catch the edge of your ski or snowboard then face plant into the snow.</p></div>		</li>
