			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, Tom Petty stated publicly that he doesn't think Sam Smith ripped him off and that it was just a coincidence- a &quot;musical accident.&quot; He wasn't the one who decided to sue and if it was up to him he wouldn't have. It was the record company who pursued legal action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with Tom Not-So-Petty. It's not obviously a rip-off at all. It is a very simple melody and simple melodies usually sound like other simple melodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to imagine Sam Smith sitting there thinking, </p>
<p>&quot;hey you know that Tom Petty song about not being a pushover and standing your ground when someone steps to you?</p>
<p>I'm gonna use that as the basis for my song about how if my lover leaves me, I'm going to fucking kill myself.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The Strokes also had a very similar song to American Girl and Tom just laughed about it because the Strokes admitted to doing it. It happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Dani California&quot; by Red Hot Chili Peppers is very similar to &quot;Mary Jane's Last Dance&quot; (melodically, rhythmically, even lyrical content) and he similarly was chill about it. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tom-petty-doubts-chili-peppers-similarity-had-negative-intent-98814/" target="_blank">https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tom-petty-doubts-chili-peppers-similarity-had-negative-intent-98814/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am out where I can’t listen to the music, but how does a song having the same chord progression as another, let alone only for an intro, constitute a copywrite violation? </p>
<p>In that case, every three to four chord song would be in violation of the first song to use the same chord progression. There is a ton more to it than just chord progression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. Again, see the above rant on how every popular song uses Pachelbel's Canon, or watch that Axis of Awesome 4 Chord Song I can't link cause I'm on mobile. Point is, you can come up with a lot of unique variation while using the same chords. But also, we've been using those same chords in similar ways for all of modern music, about to get into our 8th decade, so themes repeat.</p>
<p>The problem only comes when you repeat melodies or lyrics, not the chords. Chords are the foundation, melodies and lyrics are the architecture and building. No one cares if you copy a foundation. Hell, we make them a certain way cause they work. But if your unique building on top of it is actually just a copy of the one across the street, that's a problem.</p>
<p>As for intros, it's a bit foggier again, and again the burden of proof falls on the accuser. But chords can still make distinct melodies based on rhythm, type of chord (regular, power, 7), or octaves of the individual notes within the chord. Similar can be fine, the problem is when it's identical.</p></div>		</li>
