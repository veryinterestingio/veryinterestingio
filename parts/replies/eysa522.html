<p>Washed-away soils can also drastically reduce visibility underwater and change fish behaviours in tributaries as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right.</p>
<p>However, much of this knowledge is highly specialized and no single major will necessarily teach you all these details to the point that you know them &quot;off the top of your head.&quot; In my case, I majored in physics first and now am going to graduate school for physical oceanography (meaning <em>physics of the ocean</em>).</p>
<p>The field is highly interdisciplinary and also includes people whose backgrounds are in math, engineering and even some biologists, as long as they have strong mathematical training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oceanography, I did oceanography joint honours with Marine Biology and it is really fascinating to learn how all the different physical and chemical components interact to influence biology. You’ll likely need to carry on to Masters or to PhD level for a career in the field though. Which is not what I did unfortunately</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly, depends on the depth it’s traveling at, as explained much better in a post below. There’s a suction effect of the hurricane which causes upward and downward currents (the closer to the eye and the shallower the depth the stronger they are) which in turn affect the sub.</p>
<p>I was watching someone on YT (former submariner) that said all they did was go deeper and all motion effects disappeared (except the noise, he worked sonar).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the submariners, in normal storms you go under the waves, big hurricanes that's not possible. And submariners are mostly round and very unstable, in rough water they rock a lot and their crew isn't that experienced with rough water as it's normally so easy to avoid.</p>
<p>With all that said, they are completely sealed, there isn't really any risk of taking on water, so it's pretty safe.</p></div>		</li>
