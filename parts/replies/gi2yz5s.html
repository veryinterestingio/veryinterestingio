			<div class="markdown"><p>That output most likely doesn't include anything that happens inside of printf. Printf is a system call. Most of the time compiled programs will not include the machine code for system calls as those are delegated to the OS kernel. What that machine code probably includes is a bunch of operations to locate the memory address for the printf function and telling the CPU to start executing those instructions and where to find &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in memory. So you're definitely not getting the whole picture of what the CPU is doing to draw &quot;Hello, World!&quot; on your screen.</p>
<p>There's a reason why abstraction is such a key concept in software. Something as simple as just making a function call actually involves dozens of CPU operations. Assembly programing is for masochists or the truly insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><code>printf</code> is not a system call. On Windows writing to console uses <code>WriteFile</code> system call, on Linux - <code>write</code> system call.</p>
<p>Depending on compiler options, it is completely possible to have <code>printf</code> code in the binary.</p>

<p>Not really, more like 4 for both call and return, +1 for each parameter passed.</p></div>		</li>

Managing/allocating data/resources so you don't immediately die (hunter-gatherer), setting up correspondence between 0s and 1s and meaningful symbols (writing), discovering the standard built in libs (universities, where knowledge is passed down), handling everything relating to outputting colored pixels on a different machine (development of anatomy/art), ...</p>
