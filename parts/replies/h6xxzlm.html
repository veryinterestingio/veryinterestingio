			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone can correct me, but I think that the longest tested survival time might be 6 years. An experiment where bacillus spores were left exposed to the space environment longer than expected when the experiment couldn't be retrieved due to the Columbia disaster.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot more space junk out there and it might be cool to &quot;grab&quot; it in a sterile way and search for microbes.</p>
<p>Who knows maybe some of the oldest satellites from the 1950's are still in orbit. I am sure those were not assembled with current clean room techniques (i.e. to prevent microbial contamination), so they might be interesting microcosm experiments amongst the space junk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a payload called LDEF (long duration exposure facility) launched in 1984 that was in orbit until 1990. The free-flyer biostack experiment was part of this payload and it contained <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> spores that were viable after spending over five years in space. I think this might be the current record for maximum observed survival time in space.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may not be the maximum exposure time ever registered for survival in space, but I will mention this anyway because I think this is such a cool experiment.</p>
<p>In 2008, Cockell and colleagues exposed rocks containing a bunch of dried microorganisms outside the ISS for 548 days. When the samples came back to Earth, they checked who survived, and discovered that only one cyanobacterial species (Chroococcidiopsis) survived to the harsh, unattenuated space conditions.
