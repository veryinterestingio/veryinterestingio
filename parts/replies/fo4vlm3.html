			<div class="markdown"><p>COVID-19 is in this list so it's unclear how similar this list is to the original 2016 publication.</p>
<p>Edit: Found the original list from 2015, emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The initial list of disease priorities needing urgent R&amp;D attention comprises: Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease and Marburg, Lassa fever, <strong>MERS and SARS coronavirus diseases</strong>, Nipah and Rift Valley fever.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, as this pandemic was predicted almost to the letter in 2007. Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The medical and scientific community demonstrated marvelous efforts in the understanding and control of SARS within a short time, as evident by over 4,000 publications available online. Despite these achievements, gaps still exist in terms of the molecular basis of the physical stability and transmissibility of this virus, the molecular and immunological basis of disease pathogenesis in humans, screening tests for early or cryptic SARS cases, foolproof infection control procedures for patient care, effective antivirals or antiviral combinations, the usefulness of immunomodulatory agents for late presenters, an effective vaccine with no immune enhancement, and the immediate animal host that transmitted the virus to caged civets in the market at the beginning of the epidemic. <strong>Coronaviruses are well known to undergo genetic recombination (375), which may lead to new genotypes and outbreaks. The presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb.</strong> The possibility of the reemergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why Taiwan and South Korea are handling this current outbreak of COVID-19 much better than most other places: they've learnt their lessons from the previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS respectively.  Taiwan for example requires that all hospitals have at least a month's worth of PPE stockpiled for when the next outbreak happens (which did) and South Korea acted early on with mass testing and contact tracing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>had to look up why it's called Crimean-Congo H. Fever. Apparently in 1944 it was found (but not isolated) in crimea by soviets, named Crimean Hemorrhagic fever, and 1967 a publciation out of congo named something the Congo Virus. Also in 1967 a soviet virologist registered a fatal case of a virus, which another soviet in 1969 verified was the same as congo virus.  </p>
<p>The international taxonomy committee then proposed to name it the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever virus due to the order of publications, but the Soviets insisted to name it Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus which was controversially enough accepted.  </p>

<p>Is that Crimean as in the Crimean peninsula? I was a bit baffled because the Crimean peninsula is pretty far away from Congo.</p></div>		</li>

On 2020-02-06 the number one disease was &quot;Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC The movie Outbreak (1995) started by investigating a possible case of the second virus on the list, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. Turns out to be a different (fictional) virus but shows we knew about it 25 years ago.</p></div>		</li>
