			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, the baby-like features of cats and some dog breeds aren't an accident. Cats evolved to mimick infants with their meows so that we'd feed them more - they vocalise differently to each other than they do to humans. Dogs, on the other hand, were primarily bred by us (unlike cats, who largely domesticated themselves), and the softening of their features was often part of how we selected which dogs to breed - sometimes intentionally, sometimes subconsciously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study done that selectively bred tame wolves for suitability factors like ability to train, social response to humans, etc, while ignoring physical traits like larger eyes and floppy ears.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered that selecting for suitability also selected for the physical characteristics.</p>
<p>I'll see if I can find it...<br />
Nope, haven't found it. Anybody?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about that! There was a hypothesis that the genes related to domestication had a side effect on facial features, and that what we recognise as cute animal features may actually be subtle cues of domesticatability. Super interesting. I wonder if there's been any corroborating research. I vaguely recall a group in Russia (I think) trying to domesticate foxes, studying the genetic changes occurring on the way...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh god, this makes me feel better.  When I was a kid I promised myself I would never talk baby talk to my pets.  Grew up and found myself doing it (not excessively, but definitely the high-pitched voice).  Now it appears it was just the instincts kicking in!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This type of language is known as Motherese (although now also called Parentese to be gender neutral). When you speak like this to babies you usually use exaggerated body and facial cues as well to help them learn language. </p>
<p>Motherese has been documented in a wide variety of different languages (including sign language) and appears to have the added advantage of helping the baby and caregiver build a strong attachment.</p></div>		</li>
