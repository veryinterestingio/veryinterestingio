			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I'm now imagining the opposing heralds just sitting on a hill next to eachother with tea and baguettes talking about which side is winning while their armies are fighting to the death.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh look there, 1-0 up for the French&quot;, &quot;nonsense, those archers made it at least an even trade&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;It looks like the English have chosen to use the field of agincourt for its thick mud!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a bold move, sir Cotton.  Let us see if it pays off for them.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a story of them being too close or getting in the way of the Union. I’m thinking it might have been a more common thing to watch battles up until then. Like maybe they thought it was okay because people have always gathered to watch battles but now of course we were getting into some more powerful weapons. Of course too, way back in medieval times they would have families and other followers with them that wouldn’t fight.</p></div>		</li>

In this telling, Henry just let them know he was the victor.</p>
<p>Did they really need to agree? Do you have something I can read that explains how they came to this agreement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be a stupid question and is greatly off topic but may I ask how you were able to find that comment you linked? I try to use Reddit’s search features but find myself ignorant to know the best way to actually find something. Did you just go to the subreddit and look up “heralds” and that comment came up?
You being able to add that comment gave so much more context and info and I would love to be able to search similar things by myself!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I googled it. I wasn’t looking for information on Reddit specifically but that’s what came up when I searched for stuff about the heralds at agincourt. The other commenter’s idea about site search makes sense if you need to find something on reddit.</p></div>		</li>
