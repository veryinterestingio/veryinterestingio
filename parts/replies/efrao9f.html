<p>Note that for oscillating fields the state of the art is more in the order of 100 MV/m, i.e. high gradient x-band etc; for plasma wakefield acceleration it can actually be in the GV/m range. However that isn't very practical for bending...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Besides &quot;death ray&quot;, what's the practical use? Just for its own sake / research purposes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shorter and more compact particle accelerators, which can be cheaper to build and operate.</p>
<p>Obviously great for high energy physics (you'll get 3-4 times the collision energy in the same space) which is what really drove the initial development, but there are also other applications such as smaller/lighter/cheaper/more flexible radiotherapy machines, and similar for XFELs (x-ray lasers for (bio-) chemical and materials research. Basically it's making high performance accelerators available outside of big national/international labs and for universities/hospitals/etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow 2.4 GV/m? I imagine that at that field strength electric discharges would become a big issue, right? Or does the vacuum stop that from happening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, at that field strength there's no material with a high enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_strength" target="_blank">dielectric strength</a> to keep from being ripped apart into a plasma.  Vacuum gets 20–40 MV/m, Teflon can manage 60–173 MV/m and the highest any material can manage is diamond at 2 GV/m.  Your accelerator would be destroyed by uncontrollable electric discharge at 2.4 GV/m.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a phrase one is unlikely to write in any other context:</p>
<p>So if you make a diamond wall 1 meter thick, it could probably hold off 2 GV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the equation for the Lorentz force you get an idea why the latter is true:
the magnetic force is proportional to a particles velocity.
As the particles velocity is very high (very close to c), the strength of the magnetic field must not be as strong as an electric field which exerts the same force on the particle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about this... It would certainly be better to increase the strength of a magnetic field linearly instead of using an electric field and having to deal with the centripetal force being proportional to v^2</p></div>		</li>
