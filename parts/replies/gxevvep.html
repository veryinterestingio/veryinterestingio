<p>This is the biggest problem. If the spacecraft doesn't slow down enough and just goes back up out of the atmosphere, it has to potentially complete another entire orbit before it hits the atmosphere again and can take another attempt at landing. Depending on how badly they miss, this could be a very long orbit, like <em>days</em> long. The spacecraft might not have life support supplies for that much extra time.</p>
<p>Even if they don't miss super badly and only have to do a short arc before they take their second attempt, they'll still be way out of position. Apollo was designed to land in water, not on land, and even on water it could land upside-down, so they need rescuing fairly quickly, so there needs to be support personnel in the landing zone.</p>
<p>Could you imagine coming back from the moon, landing out of position, like in the jungle somewhere, with tigers and whatnot and no-one around to help? Fun fact: Russian space missions carry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TP-82_Cosmonaut_survival_pistol" target="_blank">a shotgun-pistol hybrid</a> onboard after one early cosmonaut landed deep in the Russian steppe wilderness and had to deal with bears and wolves before he was rescued.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All true, but the couches the astronauts lay on were sprung to help with a landing on a solid surface. The CM could come straight down under parachute and theoretically make a better landing in jungle than a helicopter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing as how the module was designed to land in water and not on land, would animals you might encounter in the landing area even be a concern? Would landing on land even be survivable?</p></div>		</li>
