			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that shocked me too! It kinda makes sense though, since you can think of the innermost part of the Earth to be its own dense metallic &quot;planet&quot; with the upper layers and crust being the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of this planet. This is analogous to being high up in the sky and having gravity increase as you come back to the surface, the densest part of the earth-atmosphere system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woha, that's fascinating to think that the ground we walk on may be someone else's atmosphere. Makes me wonder if there is life walking around on that inner metal surface.</p>
<p>Also, I too was shocked that our surface doesn't feel the greatest acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is made complicated by the composition of the planet, but still it can be understood easily.</p>
<p>If you dig down <em>x</em> Km, then you can mentally strip the first <em>x</em> Km from all around the planet. Only the smaller sphere which is left, and is still below you, pulls you downward now; the rest has zero effect on you. For example, if you dig down half of the way toward the center, you will feel the same gravity that you would if you stood on the surface of an imaginary planet half a radius of Earth, made just like the inside of Earth.</p>
<p>So, how much does a planet, imaginary or not, pull you down when you stand on its surface? Again, that's surprisingly simple. It doesn't depend on the complicated mass distribution (assuming the barycenter is in the middle, which is a safe assumption with any planet). It only depends on the <em>total</em> mass (direct proportion) and on the radius (inverse squared proportion).</p>
<p>Normally, this means that you expect less gravity from a smaller planet: the radius is smaller (therefore <em>more</em> gravity), but the volume, and therefore the mass, is <strong>way</strong> smaller (therefore way less gravity).
(to be accurate, reduced radius increases the gravity quadratically but decreases the mass cubically). But this assumes equal mass density. If you increase the density (more kg in the same volume), you can increase the mass leaving the size of the planet unaffected and the gravity goes up.</p>
<p>If you put it all togheter, this is what you get. After you dig down, its like you now are on a smaller planet, therefore normally less gravity. But, this imaginary planet is not only smaller but also denser (its the core, heavy parts only!), which can reverse the effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also means that if you’re anywhere inside spherical shell, such as a Dyson Sphere, the shell imparts zero gravitational force upon you.  </p>
<p>That’s one reason why Dyson Spheres are impractical because they would tend to drift into the star without constant orbital adjustments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong but I feel like that's mis-applying the principles at play here. </p>
<p>The matter of a hollow object should still be part of a gravitational system including anything inside of it. My understanding is that part of the reason that burrowing into a uniformly dense planet woodsy reducing gravity is that not only is there now less mass at the center relative to you but that the mass opposite the center is exerting a partially offsetting Force helping to reduce the net gravity you experience from the core and the matter on the far side of it from you.</p>
<p>As far as I can figure, a Dyson Sphere is still going to absolutely have a gravitational interaction with whatever Celestial body it is built around. Just like how all the matter of Earth would still be exerting gravity on you if you went inside it, but it's just that your experience gravity would be different depending on where you are because some of the forces would offset each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't the matter above you still have a pull on you? just in the opposite direction.  so it actually makes you lighter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you follow the link labeled “shell theorem” it goes into the math — but yes.</p>
<p>In fact (assuming equal density in all parts of the sphere) it works out such that the part “above” you exactly negates the gravity from the opposite side.  So if you’re <em>r</em> meters from the center of the sphere, in terms of gravitational pull it’s exactly like standing on the surface of a sphere with radius <em>r</em>.  And if you’re anywhere inside a hollow shell (like a Dyson sphere) the effective gravity from that shell is zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make things even more interesting, if the earth got smaller, but kept the same mass (denser), gravity on the surface would increase, because you'd be closer to the center, but still have all the mass below you, instead of some above you.  Common sense would lead most people to think that the gravity would be the same, because the mass is the same, but that isn't the case, because you'd be closer to all of that mass (ie the mass on the far side would be closer) and since gravity decreases by the square of the distance, distance is very important.</p></div>		</li>
