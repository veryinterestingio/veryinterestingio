			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only about varying thickness it's about the angle the light takes as it passes through it. If it's nearly parallel to the surface the distance is a lot longer than if it's perpendicular to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides variations in the actual thickness (which I don't know anything about), the angle at which the light hits the bubble is also a factor: If light hits the bubble at a very low angel, the path that light travels though the bubble film is longer than if light hits the bubble closer to 90 degrees. This makes the film 'appear' thicker or thinner to the light depending on what angle it hits. Since a bubble is round, light from a single source or direction hits the bubble at different angles in a circular pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Some lights designed for theatre and concerts use incandescent lamps and filters that take advantage of thin film interference to produce very deep saturated colors called dichroic filters.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do they still use incandescent lamps? What's wrong with LED?&quot; You may ask. While LED is very capable of producing intensley pure color washes and are very often used on stage, they don't work for every lighting situation, so there's a number of reasons to still use incandescent lamps and dichroic filters.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Multi point source lights like LEDs don't make very pretty shadows. Since the light sources are spaced apart, they create shadows at different angles. With multicolored lights, a white wash will have a gross mess of differently colored shadows behind anything called rainbowing. For this same reason, led based instruments are incompatible with gobos, which are little metal discs with shapes cut into them that sit between the light and the lens to block parts of the light making the beam into different shapes. When used with multi color led array instrument, the same rainbowing happens on the shadow made by the gobo and it completely ruins the intended effect.</p>
</li>
<li>LEDs and incandescents produce lights with different color rendering indices which is a measurement of how faithfully a given light source reproduces color compared to daylight. Compared to the standard white LEDs, incandescents can produce a light that more accurately protrays the color of an object, though this may not be the case forever as LED manufactures continue to refine their methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why the dichroic filters though?</p>
<p>Well, most basic incandescent stage lights normally use translucent sheets of special colored plastic called gels to color the light. These work by absorbing unwanted frequencies of light, rather than the dichroic filters which reflect those unwanted frequencies. Because of this, darker more saturated gels get extremely hot when in use and fade very quickly. Dichroic filters, also being made of glass instead of plastic, in turn last much, much longer. Additionally, it allows the light to easily switch between different colors. Since the filters are so small you can install multiple filters in a light quite easily.</p>
<p>To contrast if you have a traditional instrument using a gel and you want that light to change colors mid show, you have to use a gel scroller, which cycles sequentially through a queue of gels rolled up in a scroll on either side. This is rather limiting in practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some butterflies use thin film interference to create their wing colors. </p>
<p>From Thayer 2020:</p>
<p>“From iridescent blues to vibrant purples, many butterflies display dazzling ‘structural colors’ created not by pigments but by microscopic structures that interfere with light. For instance, the scales that coat their wings can contain thin films of chitin, the substance that normally makes the external skeleton of insects. In slim layers, however, chitin can also scatter light to produce color, the way that oil can create iridescence at the surface of water.</p>
<p>The thickness of the film, which is encoded by the genes of the butterfly, determines what color will be produced. Yet, little is known about how common thin films are in butterflies, exactly how genetic information codes for them, and how their thickness and the colors they produce can evolve.</p>
<p>To investigate, Thayer et al. used a technique called Helium Ion Microscopy and examined the wings of ten related species of butterflies, showing that thin film structures were present across this sample. However, the different species have evolved many different structural colors over the past millions of years by changing the thickness of the films.</p>
<p>Next, Thayer et al. showed that this evolution could be reproduced at a faster pace in the laboratory using common buckeye butterflies. These insects mostly have brown wings, but they can have specks of blue created by thin film structures. Individuals with more blue on their wings were mated and over the course of a year, the thickness of the film structures increased by 74%, leading to shiny blue butterflies. Deleting a gene called optix from the insects also led to blue wings. Optix was already known to control the patterns of pigments in butterflies, but it now appears that it controls structural colors as well.</p>
<p>From solar panels to new fabrics, microscopic structures that can scatter light are useful in a variety of industries. Understanding how these elements exist and evolve in organisms may help to better design them for human purposes.”</p>
