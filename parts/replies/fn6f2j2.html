			<div class="markdown"><p>On its own, there are none that come to mind, but there is a phenomenon called stimulated emission that accomplishes exactly this. An excited system (think an electron in a high orbital, or even just a molecule that is vibrating) can fall to a lower quantum state by emitting a photon. This process is random and happens all the time: a great number of atoms and molecules around you are in some sort of excited state due to thermal energy as determined by a Boltzmann distribution, and are constantly emitting and absorbing photons, trading energy with each other. This process is inherently random both in timing and in direction, although there can be non-spherically symmetric examples so although the direction is still random, it is more likely to emit a photon in certain directions than in others.</p>
<p>However, there is a second very closely related phenomenon called stimulated emission. In a surprising quirk that ends up falling out of the math, it turns out that if an atom (or some other excited system) is hit by a photon, with energy exactly matching the difference in energy between the current state and an available lower energy state (with exactly matching being a bit of a fuzzy thing to define, due to superposition, among other things), the atom will be stimulated to emit a photon matching the first incident photon. Crucially, this second photon has the same frequency, energy (an thus amplitude), and direction (nearly), as the first photon.</p>
<p>You've definitely seen the result of this phenomenon in your life. The word laser is actually the acronym LASER: light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation. This is exactly the process at play here, and is the reason that a laser beam is so coherent, both in direction (what most people are familiar with), but also in phase (which is the reason that the laser is so useful for so many sorts of crazy technology). Another example, if my memory serves me correctly, is a nuclear fission chain reaction. In this case, the incident particle is a neutron, and the binding force is the weak nuclear force instead of electromagnetism, but the result is the same: a higher energy state (the U235 nucleus for example) to a lower energy state (two smaller nuclei and two free neutrons, which are free to propagate the reaction). Here the directions are less exact, because in reality the light goes in nearly the same direction in the first example because of conservation of momentum, with the atom having a much higher momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunate I don't really. I've learned most of this in a formal setting, so I don't have many great references for a layman to look into. There are a lot of interesting phenomena like this in quantum mechanics, but the difficult thing thing about it is that while I could list a number of surprising results of the theory that we have observed experimentally, but it's often impossible to actually understand many of them without actually diving into the math to a level that most people aren't interested in. This is different from a lot of other types of science and even physics, where there are different levels of explanation that can help somebody to understand at some level without having to completely dive into the nitty gritty. Quantum mechanics really doesn't work like that. The math is the whole content.
I am fascinated by quantum mechanics for exactly this reason. However, I think that the stereotype about quantum mechanics as being really difficult is true for the layperson for this reason. For, say, a physics student, it's really not that different from other fields in the subject in terms of difficulty since they are typically approached at a similar level, but the difference is that they can be approached in a less technical way as well.</p>
<p>That said, there are some things in quantum mechanics for which this isn't entirely the case. One that comes to mind is Bell's theorem. There are parts about it that are still likely to be quite opaque to a layman, but it is actually amazingly simplistic in some ways. I think that if you look into it, you might be able to find some interesting paths to look down for yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A laser. In its most primitive form, it requires feedback through a gain medium to generate population inversion and which induces stimulated emission. You can try and make the case that in the initial moments prior to lasing, you're driven by entirely randomized omnidirectional processes, but once the stimulated emission takes hold, the generated photons absolutely have a well defined directionally and are not omnidirectional.</p></div>		</li>
