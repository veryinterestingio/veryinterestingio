			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Unfortunately, nowhere in the world has been able to provide optimum levels of accessible and effective mental health care. In this regard, the USA does as well as any other country, although the accessibility is uneven across geographic locations as well as with underprivileged groups, regardless of geographic location. There certainly needs to be a higher priority for the provision of such resources. In terms of non-pharmacological approaches, I agree that other interventions, particularly individual and group psychotherapy/counselling, are very appropriate. One challenge, however, is that such interventions are very resource intensive and time-consuming and therefore can be difficult to access. RW</em></p></div>		</li>
