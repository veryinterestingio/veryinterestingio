			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that antibody tests would come back positive post-vaccination, according to the CDC - <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html</a></a> - but this hasn't been systematically studied yet. (There are also a variety of antibody tests, so the answer would likely vary depending on the test and the vaccine.)</p>
<p>More generally, the use of an antibody test--if one were able to obtain one--isn't recommended as a way to verify whether the vaccine 'worked'. We still learning about the level and nature of immune response that provides adequate protection, and until we have knowledge, an antibody test wouldn't provide much useful information.</p>
<p>A much higher public health priority right now than large-scale antibody testing would be continuing to focus on widespread PCR-based testing for active infection, coupled with vaccination and adherence to public health measures like mask-wearing and physical distancing and limitations on large, indoor gatherings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If antibody test is not an accurate way to test if the vaccine worked, then is there another way to test for it? The Sinovac vaccine has a much lower efficacy rate, so how can someone who has taken the vaccine know if they have gained immunity (complete or enough to have a mild infection)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As we work in a medical setting, my better half and I both had our antibody levels monitored after receiving vaccination. My IGG response appeared between 7 &amp; 20 days after the first dose, while her antibodies didn't appear on the test until 16 days after the 2nd. Others we work with have had wide ranging responses, including nearly no detectable antibodies several weeks after the 2nd dose. None of these results necessarily indicates a better reaction to the vaccine or different levels of immunity.</p></div>		</li>
