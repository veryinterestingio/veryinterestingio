			<div class="markdown"><p>Was that the one having &quot;fun&quot; with the guy who wasn't Stephen Fry (I know that's unfair, as it was the other guy's book [his original partner was Douglas Adams, I think?], but I can't remember his name offhand)?</p>
<p>If so, yes, it's an amazing scene. And kakapos are adorable. Many NZ birds do seem to have lost the ability to fly, it seems. They probably regret that now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to fly when there was no predators. NZs only native land based mammal is a bat. The Maori brought kuri (dogs) and kiore (rats) which was less than ideal for the bird populations. Then the Europeans came and introduced stoats, weasels, ferrets, possums, cats and more rats, they have since devastated the native bird populations. There is now several predator free islands which have populations of some critically endangered species and intensive predator control schemes on the main islands which unfortunately by necessity of the terrain are often conducted with aerial 1080 poison drops. </p>
<p>A desire for a fur industry in the 1800s has caused a legacy of expensive, environmentally unfriendly and divisive predator control techniques. I believe even Wallabies were recently declared an invasive species so it's open season on Australian imports...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a nature miniseries with Stephen Fry that searches the world for the most critically endangered species before it's too late. The original 90s series starred Douglas Adams; the new one has biologist Mark Carwardine. </p>
<p>Stephen and Mark go on an adventure to find a kakapo, a giant flightless bird that looks like an old man with a monocle. They find one, and he takes to Mark with a certain affection.</p></div>		</li>
