			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but if I give those kids 20 chocs each they’ll vom and reach their absorption limit. The blue plastic on the paw patrol lookout tower in front of me doesn’t get to a point where it’s absorbed too much light and starts reflecting everything essentially turning white.... or actually is that what happens if it’s left in strong sunlight? MY BRAIN!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blue plastic gets warm as it absorbs light (the light energy is converted to heat), and warm objects release energy in the form of light according to their temperature. In this case, it's not that warm so it's emitting low energy infrared light that you can't see.</p>
<p>If you beamed light at it faster than it could radiate the energy away, it would heat up until it was glowing red-hot or even white-hot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is glowing “white hot” essentially the material can no longer absorb light and so all wavelengths are being reflected and appear to be white?</p></div>		</li>
