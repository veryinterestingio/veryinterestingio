			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. The simplest way to visualize it, is to replace all the air with water. </p>
<p>Inside the train is filled with water. If you swim upward a little bit (jumping) and float back down you will be in the same spot, as all the water is trapped inside the train and therefore not moving from your perspective. </p>
<p>Outside the train, the water is all rushing backwards (from your perspective on the roof of the train) so when you swim upward and float back down you will be further back, as you are carried by the water.</p>
<p>It is really that simple. Anytime you are having trouble visualizing something related to air, often if you replace it with water, it will make sense. Air is just water that weighs less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a very tricky riddle much easier to solve.  It goes something like this: “If you are driving in a car with the windows up and you have a helium balloon on a string and take a left hand turn what does the ballon do?  Move left, right, or stay straight up?”</p>
<p>Replace air with water since air is more dense than helium and it’s simple to figure out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point, since gases can be thought of as fluids. It helps with visualisation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not &quot;thought of as fluids&quot; gases are fluids, fluids are anything that flows and gases flow. </p>
<p>All the same equations to figure out flow rates of liquids are the exact same as flow rates for gases, usually they just use different units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All gases <em>are</em> fluids. So are all liquids.</p>
<p>Remember, a fluid and a liquid are <em>not</em> different terms for the same thing, there's an important difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, assuming that the train was moving at a constant velocity you would land back in the same spot without air to resist your forward momentum.  </p>
<p>If the train was accelerating, then when you jumped you'd stop accelerating and your position would shift slightly depending on how high you jumped and what the acceleration of the train was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. We know that air can exert considerable force on stuff. Just put your hand out of the window of a moving car. Or look at trees during heavy wind. And just like with the car, it's the air that's still relative to the Earth, but moving relative to the vehicle. So if we remove that air, then there is nothing to push against your body, meaning there is no other force impacting you, besides gravity.</p>
<p>Now, there may be a small difference if we account for friction inside, but that should be negligble.</p></div>		</li>
