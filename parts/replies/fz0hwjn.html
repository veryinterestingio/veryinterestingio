			<div class="markdown"><p>Hehe, no bashing at all. T-Cells are very important but a full immune response is needed to effectively fight of a nasty viral infection :) </p>
<p>All the immune cells are worthy of praise and necessary for their niche roles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think about the research that found the coronavirus actually infected t lymphocytes? I know the paper was withdrawn due to concerns about their methodology but the fact remains, something has to be the cause of the lymphocytopenia associated with the coronavirus infection. The retraction notice said they should have used primary t cells instead of t cell lines so why has there been no further comment or research ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since covid I have become deeply interested in understanding the immune system, and this is definitely a big question. It was observed that covid symptom severity is correlated with low CD8 levels (cytotoxic T effector cells) while CD4 levels (T helper) are still there. Exotic drugs that inhibit CCR5, CD6, IL6, GM CSF seem to restore healthy T cell function are hinting at the bigger role T cells play, and how badly coronavirus is messing with the immune system. Restoring CD8 levels seems to bring down plasma viral load. Coronavirus is doing something to macrophages and T lymphocytes and it's still not entirely clear to me, but these drugs that modulate the production and movement of monocytes/macrophages seem to help calm cytokine storm. I read somewhere that monocytes could express ACE2 so they may even get infected or affected by coronavirus. Sorry for my ramblings I'm learning a lot and haven't figured it all out yet.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to add that from what I've read sars-cov-2 can't infect T cells. It might be able to infect macrophages but not much is written on this topic. What's unclear to me is how the virus affects the pathway that produces the killer T cells, what is causing the T cell exhaustion, and how the virus is causing over activation of macrophages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that can happen. COVID has an array of proteins that do unpleasant things to your immune system. The vaccine has none of those. Every single virus has something to deal with the immune system, the ones that don't have left the evolutionary tree.</p>
<p>The most spectacular example is the rabies vaccine for better than natural. Without a vaccine to rabies you are dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This excellent and I wanted to add, that infection acquired immunity is also inferior in that it may not be complete. If you get chicken pox, you may be immune from chicken pox, but you are almost guaranteed to end up with shingles later on. If you get HPV, you may spontaneously fight it of but you have an excellent chance of developing oral, penile, or cervical cancer later on. If you get polio, you may survive with no short term effect but you will be vulnerable to post polio syndrome later on. And if you get  Mono, you may never get mono again, but EBV has been implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome later on in life.
This covid so far has been known to cause cardiovascular changes in kids and adults, and many people who survived it complain of chronic fatigue etc afterwards.</p></div>		</li>
