This focuses on the eastern Australian coastline, but applies just as well to the eastern continental US for features such as sand bars, spits and tombolos that can lead to long barrier islands. Great detail on the wind action as well and not just wave and river interaction:<br />

<p>Additionally, he has an excellent video on the erosional processes in parts of Australia that are predominate on the western shoreline of North America as well. Though folks should understand that shoreline cliff erosion is dependant on rock type and is found at passive margins as well (i.e. isn't just typical of a convergent, subduction or transform boundaries):<br />
