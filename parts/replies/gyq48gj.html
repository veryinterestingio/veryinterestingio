			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the percentage of species of mosquitos that actually bite humans is pretty small, so the leading theory is that the competing species would just slightly expand to fill the gaps and the food chain would be largely unaffected. I am no scientist though, and I also understand that it would still have <em>some</em> unexpected impact. Probably small, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>what exactly are they competing species with? i dont really know of any other animal that competes for their resources and is eaten by the same prey. i assume you'd need replace it role as prey as well as its part as a hunter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Complex systems are also prone to redundancy and robustness.</p>
<p>It's a mistake to look at global ecology like a modern gas engine, where one little failure in a fuel gasket can lead to a complete shutdown of the system.</p>
<p>Ecologies are more like the human body. Eat some Taco Bell and you cause a change to the gut biome. Some gut flora is killed or starved, and other flora proliferate to take their place. No big deal. Kill some skin tissue through a sunburn? Resources are diverted and new tissue with more melanin moves in to replace the dead tissue.</p>
<p>Complex ecological systems aren't fragile, or they never would have survived the uncounted millions of abrupt changes like floods, wildfires, extreme seasonal temperature swings, novel pestilence, etc. </p>
<p>Nature adapts. If it's a &quot;stone-cold certainty&quot; that there is the noticeable knock-on effect of eliminating malaria, I can live with the decline of a few bat species (or whatever), and subsequent the rise of some other species that compete with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mostly a non-sequitur. I said nothing about &quot;complete shutdown&quot;. The so-called law of unintended consequences simply means that one change can have quite large, unanticipated and sometimes counterintuitive consequences within a system. And whilst the system will find some kind of balance point, there's nothing to guarantee that it will be remotely recognisable or desirable afterwards.</p>
<p>Sure complex systems are robust - for some value of robust. They're also fragile (for some value of fragile). You've only got to look at the recent <a href="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/" target="_blank">reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone</a> to see that the presence or absence of a single species, previously indigenous in this instance, can have big impacts on a local ecology (and that some of those impacts are counterintuitive). And that's before starting on the many cases where invasive species (often deliberately introduced) have devasted aspects of local ecologies. There's a reason that countries such as Australia and New Zealand won't allow you to import plants, foodstuffs and the like willy-nilly - they've seen what can happen, and they're not taking chances.</p></div>		</li>
