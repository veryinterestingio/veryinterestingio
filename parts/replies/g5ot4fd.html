			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't like things that don't &quot;belong&quot; there. For example, if a bug is on you, especially a parasitic one like a tick or leech, you're instinct will be to remove it.</p>
<p>The thing to remember with evolution is that persistence has to do with survival, not cohesiveness or practicality. Our ancestors who had the instinct to remove foreign feeling objects from our skin had a survival advantage. Our ancestors who had the ability to form blood clots had a survival advantage. Simple generic mutations and reactions are far more likely than complex and nuanced behavioral ones, so they need an even more significant survival advantage to persist, and not picking scabs apparently never met that bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about mosquito bites? You don’t even feel it when they bite, therefore there’s no sensation that your brain is distracting itself from. But it still feels nice to scratch them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't feel the bite as it's happening, but the mosquito will inject you with it's saliva as an anticoagulant in order to make it easier to suck out. This causes an immune reaction and the area swells up, it's the discomfort of this reaction you distract from, not the pain of the bite itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically the immune reaction creates histamine. The same stuff that causes a lot of the symptoms people with allergies get. A topical anti-histamine lotion or pill is a good defense against itchiness from anything causing a histamine reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a process known as inflammation. One of the most important topics in Pathology in med school. </p>
<p>The redness you see developing when you scratch too much. Think of inflammation as a nosy response. It always produces redness or swelling or one of it's cardinal signs whenever a foreign object enters the body. As if any intruder enters your house you try to push him away. </p>
<p>Similarly the mosquito injects a foreign substance (it's saliva) and inflammation almost always causes pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sat here right now with a flea bite on my ankle that has absolutely zero pain, or any sensation at all at rest. Yet when I scratch it it still produces the same addictive sensation being described. There's definitely something more than just &quot;big pain distracts from little pain&quot; going on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>I'm laid up with cellulitis right now because I went full ape and scratched the shit out of my bitten foot.</p>
<p>The drugs they give you to treat cellulitis are wicked brutal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah man.  When I was in my 2nd year of medical school, a bag fell on my ankles and was soon infected. The professors had a good laugh that I should have applied a topical medication. I was hospitalized for 5 days and couldn't walk for 14 more days. </p>
<p>And man don't worry, it will be fine. Edema might take months to resolve but with the right treatment you will be fine. </p>
<p>And just a general advise which you would've already received: While laying in bed keep 2-3 pillows under your foot/ foot higher than your &quot;chest level to reduce edema :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the advice - it's good to hear!</p>
<p>My foot still looks like a bit of a balloon, but it's way better than it was.</p>
<p>Got my pillows and an ice pack to keep the swelling/itching/pain at bay.</p>
<p>What would be a good topical for right away if you don't mind me asking - this is the 3rd time it's happened after a big bite :(</p></div>		</li>
