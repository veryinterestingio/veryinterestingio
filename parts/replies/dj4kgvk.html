			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a similar experiment when I was a kid and didn't want to finish my plate. I put meat, sprouts, and carrots in a planter by the dinner table. A few days later, it was crawling with maggots and the whole house stunk. There were a few possible explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The planter is not airtight. 2. My parents were upset. 3. I eat healthy now that I'm a big boy.</li>

<p>I'd guess most people don't realize that. What we're sold is an asceptic world in which it is easy to be safe and secure.</p>
<p>How those <em>safety guidelines</em> are determined, published, enacted and enforced seems to be nobody's business, save for the occasional recall of one gigaton of frozen spinach tainted by <em>e. coli</em>.</p></div>		</li>
