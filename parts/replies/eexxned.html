			<div class="markdown"><p>Do a quick internet search, and you can find horror stories of patients appearing to have been unconscious but it turns out they were still partly aware of what was going on during their open abdominal surgery etc.  You aren't trying to give someone permanent amnesia regarding events of the rest of their life, you just don't want them to remember their surgical procedure or getting their heart shocked during CPR.  People aren't always unconscious when we do unpleasant things to them, and there aren't always great ways to &quot;prove&quot; that someone is indeed fully unconscious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a growing corpus of evidence that even though you're under anesthesia, the body knows what's happening and it's traumatizing. Some people can suffer mentally after a surgery because of that. It's better not to remember it. </p></div>		</li>
