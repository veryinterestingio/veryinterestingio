<p>So gettings some side effects from a vaccine, such as feeling slightly sick for a day or two, is actually a good sign. It means it's working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to reiterate and say that people who don't have side effects from vaccines are just as protected as people who do experience side effects. Never think that not getting side effects means the vaccine is &quot;not working&quot;. Getting side effects is just one way of knowing that the vaccine is working, not the only way. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the adverse effects among the same age group have <em>any</em> correlation to how poorly they would respond the virus itself? Some of my friends were hit hard by Pfizer while I barely felt anything. Is there a higher chance I would have been less (or more) sick than them if we'd gotten the virus pre-vaccine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s really little or no correlation between the reactogenic side effects, and anything to do with the vaccine response or anything else. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a common belief that an injection-site reaction to a vaccine is a predictive sign of a desirable vaccine response (‘no pain, no gain’ concept). However limited data either support or disprove this concept.... However, despite parallel associations of reactogenicity and adaptive responses with early innate responses, no predictive association was demonstrated between reactogenicity and the adaptive response, which suggests that the ‘no pain, no gain’ concept may not be valid, at least at the individual level.</p>

<p>--<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-019-0132-6" target="_blank">The how’s and what’s of vaccine reactogenicity</a></p>
<p>On a population basis there may be some meaning - older people likely do have less reactogenicity, and do tend to both respond less well to the vaccine and have more severe COVID - but on an individual basis it’s really random - the fact that one person may have had reactions and their neighbor didn’t, tells you nothing useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so confusing. I keep reading over and over that side effects are a &quot;good sign&quot; of a stronger immune response and a sign that the vaccine is working as it should... but at the same time in contradiction to that, apparently side effects *don't* correlate with how effectively you're building immunity, and people with no side effects have the same immunity as people with side effects.</p>
<p>Which is it? Either side effects correlate with immunity success rate or they don't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But on average, there is a relation between „side effect“ and the effectiveness of the immune reponse (i.e. antibody levels).</p>

<p>But if you look at larger groups of people, there is a correlation between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You used the word correlation so I'm just going to use the famous line lol: correlation doesn't mean causation. </p>
<p>I get your point but for me, the important giveaway is just by reading the name &quot;side effect&quot;. It is not intended effect of the vaccine, it is just side effect. If fever is needed for the vaccine to work, it wouldn't be called &quot;side effects&quot;. </p>
<p>I think a lot of news articles made the effort to make people believe side effects are a good thing but at the same time a lot of people started believing that side effects are needed for the vaccines to work which is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Young people’s immune systems readily jump into the fight all guns blazing. Much like the ache after a satisfyingly hard bout of exercise, a decent amount of low level reaction post vaccine is a sign your body is putting up a good response to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the honest answer is &quot;nobody knows&quot;. Of course there are hypotheses.</p>
<p>The reported heart problems (cardiomyopathy and pericarditis) are rather common, as is regular thrombosis (but not the thrombocytopenia with thrombosis as seen with the AstraZenica vaccine), so it isn't even very clear that they are due to the vaccines. </p>
<p>Assuming that someone getting cardiomyopathy after vaccination is due to vaccination is post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. Cardiomyopathies can be caused by many things; heriditary (the most common cause in athletes), due to a viral infection, even due to life stress one can develop cardiomyopathy (e.g. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy).
Thrombosis is also very common, 1000's of people get hospitalized for it every day, so if it happens after vaccination, it's impossible to tell whether there is a causal relationship.</p>
<p>It's different with the thrombocytopenia with thrombosis due to the AstraZeneca vaccine. Thrombocytopenia with thrombosis is normally rather rare (and difficult to treat). So in that case the association is much clearer.</p>
<p>A hypothesis I've seen for the cardiomyopathy is that the damage is due to an out of control inflammatory response to the vaccine.</p>
<p>For thrombocytopenia, a hypothesis is an immune reaction to ones own blood platelets.</p>
<p>I haven't looked that much into it to be honest, because the side effects (if they are that) to the vaccines are very rare. And the fact is, covid-19 itself also has these effects, and with the virus these aren't rare at all. Blood clotting issues are extremely common with corona infections. (I have a relative who developed 5 separate lung embolisms due to covid btw).</p>
<p>So I don't worry about these rare side effects, seeing how common these problems are with the virus itself. Also the heart problems appear rather mild, and usually disappear after a few weeks.</p>
<p>I think it will take many years of research to come up with a good answer to your question, if we ever do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then how can people be so confident when they say they know how vaccines work and that they are safe? Data is one thing but not knowing how serious side effects can occur is another. Something like the Johnson and Johnson vaccine being linked to Guillain Barr’s syndrome, whether its a rate occurrence or not should be be known.</p></div>		</li>
