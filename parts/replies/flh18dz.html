			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a business, anything from the mom n' pop to an airline company.  Because a lot of people are quarantined and more have decreased the rate they go out, this business is not making much money (or possibly none at all).  However, they still need to pay out money to pay the rent, or keep their equipment maintained, or make payroll, or pay interest on loans, or any number of other constant expenses.  With no money going in, the business goes bankrupt, its assets are divided up and sold, its employees fired, etc.  This can cause downstream problems, because it's often hard to rebuild all that after it's been destroyed.  </p>
<p>No matter how much money you hand to the public at large, they aren't going to spend it at this business, because they outbreak is preventing them from using the services offered by it.  But if you give money to the business (one way or another) it can keep paying its bills until the crises is over and it can start making money in the normal way again.  The idea here is to avoid a lot of unnecessary business closures and keep things in stasis until things go back to normal, at which time the economy will hopefully be able to come back to normal more quickly.    </p>
<p>Now, none of this is to say that all businesses are worth protecting in this way, that there aren't potential downsides, that it will be implemented correctly, or that individual people couldn't also benefit from money for similar reasons.  But I think it does illustrate why  simply just giving the money to the population at large wouldn't necessarily solve all the problems.   </p>

<p>That is the most concise explanation of the non-stimulus stimulus package I've read. It's a life raft with only enough food and water to last until the rescue ship (business as usual) arrives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the stimulus package went directly to American citizens, it would translate to demand with an extraordinarily high degree of efficiency; especially if the bailout was strongly tilted in favor of the poor. The poor have the lowest incomes, a boost of $2,000 or $1,000 would be life changing for them. Also for the middle class, it would enormously helpful in helping pay off school loans. </p>

<p>The problem with giving it to businesses is that it creates an opportunity cost of demand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a traditional crash, banks can't lend you money. This is a huge problem. For example, if I'm a farmer and want to buy a tractor so I can increase my yield 500% but no one will lend me the money I'm screwed. So I am less productive, so food is more expensive and that hurts all of society.  </p>
<p>The big problem is that this is not a normal crash. If no one has a job then lending is going to be the least of our problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those who are not well versed on economic terms like me, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement" target="_blank">here</a> is the wiki article on repurchasing agreements. </p>
<p>Someone please correct me if I'm wrong but as far as I can tell it's functionally just a very short term loan. The government gives a company money who then has to pay it back shortly after, possibly with interest. </p>
<p>Doing this with the population at large would basically just mean people could take out loans, which I don't think is what people really think of when they talk about government aid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of cash injection going right now. There's a difference between the two. One is from the government ($1000 for everyone). One is from the Fed (massive purchases of bonds or QE as they call it). </p>
<p>The money from the government will not affect inflation. This is fiscal policy. The government merely takes your tax money and transfer it back to you. How they distribute this money is, of course, up to Congress. But fiscal policy does not deal with printing money, thus it does not inflate the dollar. </p>
<p>The money from the Fed <strong>could</strong> affect inflation. However, with a looming recession, prices might fall due to a lack of demand, creating deflation. So, we have to wait and see how QE will turn out this time. My bet is that the Fed will make a lot of purchases but will not let inflation spiral out of control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The money is used to repurchase treasuries, government bonds, and other securities on the open market, i.e. from investors. These can be individuals, corporations, pension funds, mutual funds, et cetera. It doesn't add any &quot;value&quot; to the economy, rather it trades cash now to the market in exchange for cash in the future. The operation is designed to increase liquidity today. </p>
<p>Being undertaken by the Fed, this is a form of monetary policy. Giving a check to companies or tax breaks is fiscal policy, and would be governed by Congress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This money ($2T) started at the Federal Reserve</p>
<p>They were given the green light to purchase different treasury notes from the US govt so that they may have money in their coffers</p>
<p>The way they use this money is what has been up for debate in the Senate these last few days.</p>
<p><strong><em> With the current deal, exact details of spending have not been formally released and are to be determined </em></strong></p>
<p>Though the numbers being projected are about $400b going to individuals and households in the form of stimulus checks and possible debt forgiveness.</p>
<p>There is expected to be at least a $500b fund that will go towards financing different companies that can’t repay their loans, of Gov choosing, likely those with large employee bases, and, with the current deal’s conditions for bailout, will go into exchanging Gov’s cash into equity stakes for the company</p>
<p>There is expected to be some $350b in loan money to go towards small businesses specifically</p>
<p>Another $150b is expected to go to our healthcare systems to keep up with straining demand</p>
<p>Keeping score, we are at approx $600b left.</p>
<p>A slice of this can expected to finance an increase in the unemployment payments to individuals during the crisis</p>
<p>There are also provisions for about $150b to go towards State-level and Local-level stimulus relief, so it will be spent how those parties see fit.</p>
<p>And it’s likely we can expect slices of this remainder to go into loan repayment relief of different sorts.</p></div>		</li>
