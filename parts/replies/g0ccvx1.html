Cause &quot;very very very fast&quot; is like shaking at 300km/h(150miles/h) ...</p>
<p>And, there is an experiment you can make very easily, to check if water moves in a condensed space:</p>
<p>Take a tissue fill it up with water, fill a bottle with water, put the tissue in the bottle, now assuming you have a plastic bottle, shake it... as you can see the bottle &quot;&quot;&quot;expanded&quot;&quot;&quot; so when you open the lid water comes out.
So, the tissue still moves, this means sigle water molecules move???
Yes/no cause gravity...</p>
<p>Let's build a water pressure spaceship lol...</p></div>		</li>
