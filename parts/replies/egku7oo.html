			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm sure that the mindset involved in drinking different things makes a big difference. When I used to drink shots always meant I was out to get fucked-up. </p>
<p>Some drinks are easy to drink fast for maximum damage, some aren't. Alcohol is just alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has got to be it. If you removed the pure ethanol from every alcoholic drink, nothing that remained in the drink would lead to you feeling hungover. It wouldn't change your mood in any measurable way either.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But I would definitely think there was a correlation between different mood effects and the rate/quantity of ingesting alcohol. Along with what other fluids/foods are in your stomach at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
