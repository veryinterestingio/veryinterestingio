			<div class="markdown"><p>This is nuts to me because it makes total sense but I felt like the opposite was more intuitive at first - you're looking at an <em>image</em> of yourself five feet away. But obviously in contrast to e.g. a life-size photograph, you're focusing your eyes on light that is carrying an &quot;image&quot; over ten feet and is simply reflected off the mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try this. Write something on the mirror. Focus on yourself, then focus on the writing, then back to yourself. You will feel your eyes adjusting for the different images</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you are not looking at an image 5 feet away. Your image is not on the mirror. You are looking at yourself. So technically you're looking at where you are but the light has to go from you to the mirror and back to yourself so it appears you are looking 10 ft away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think I just had a confusion over where the image is being &quot;produced&quot;, so to speak, because it <em>appears</em> in the mirror. But on thinking about it for a few seconds that's obviously not the case. Hence why the &quot;image&quot; in mirrors &quot;moves&quot; depending on orientation, while that of a picture doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be really cool for mirrors to work that way. You could see everything without having to shift the focus in your eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean that watching VR all day is healthier for your eyes than being in front of a PC monitor all day? </p>
<p>Cause you make them focus on different depths in the VR, but in pc your are one focus all day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current VR headsets do not change the focus of the image depending on distance. So the eyes need to focus on a fixed distance while you have them on---typically they are set up so that you focus at infinity, but it's also possible to put a diopter adjustment dial on the headset so that you can set the distance yourself, in order to use the headset without wearing glasses if you are nearsighted. (Adding a dial is one more moving part, though, so I think the big consumer brand headsets don't have it in order to save cost.)</p>
<p>This is actually a problem, because in real life humans use both the binocular verge and the focus distance as cues to infer the depth of objects, and in VR you only get the verge. Different people rely more on the focus or on the verge, so for some it's not an issue, but some people feel it is uncomfortable and tiring, see <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/08/obscure-neuroscience-problem-thats-plaguing-vr/" target="_blank">The Obscure Neuroscience Problem That's Plaguing VR</a>.</p></div>		</li>
