			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not by much, I knew all that as a kid. As much as a kid could understand that. The constant mantra of, &quot;sugar will rot your teeth out!&quot; &quot;candy will rot your teeth out!&quot; &quot;those drinks will rot your teeth out!&quot; didn't seem to stop me or my peers.</p>
<p>It makes sense to me because they said all that but adults continued to give them to us so what the heck were we supposed to do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was the same but if I could actually feel the perceived effects of that, immediately and while consuming candy, I think it would have hit a bit harder</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, no idea why the same people who used to tell me to not eat candy were always the ones to give me some. Thankfully I was picky af as a kid and didn't eat ANY candy, which saved me from my tooth rotting completely since I didn't have the habit of brushing my teeth back then until I was like 13.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told this as a kid. It didn't stop me from eating candy. I just felt remorse after eating it. </p>
<p>It's similar to when Jamie Oliver (popular chef) showed kids that chicken nuggets are basically ground slaughter waste fried. While grinding bones, fat and ugly meat pieces all tye kids were &quot;eeeewww&quot; and after he fried them everyone was like &quot;weeee chicken tendies!&quot;. Guess he made a point: Moral Jamie 0 - 1 chicken nuggets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But having tobacco (dip) on one side of the mouth does this also. Has the weird rough texture after awhile and leaves behind the taste of the tobacco as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it's because of osmosis, implied but not explicit in the previous reply: your cells are basically a bag of water with dissolved salt and sugar, and they constantly try to keep the concentration equal inside and outside the cell approximately equal. Since the transport of sugar or salt is relatively complex, they achieve this by pumping water in and out of the cell.</p>
<p>Since there is now a high concentration of sugar (or tobacco) outside your cells, they pump water out in an attempt to achieve a new equilibrium by diluting the outside environment. As a result, your cells dry out and this might also explain the rough texture.</p></div>		</li>
