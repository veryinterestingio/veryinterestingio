<p>This problem is just a bit of a fun trick brain teaser but there are many that are very useful if proven. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to clarify this point.</p>
<p>Though a fun brain teaser, the real importance of this problem is our proofing ability.</p>
<p>There is something of a debate going on with the Collatz conjecture. Some mathematicians feel as though we, as a species, do not currently possess the ability to solve this problem. Furthermore, they argue that we're (potentially) centuries away from developing whatever we're lacking to solve such a problem.</p>
<p>Solving the Collatz conjecture would be proof that we're sufficiently advanced to solve problems of the same nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would impress upon you that both mathematics and physics are filled with this. There are whole worlds of knowledge in those fields that we know we do not know and we do not know how to get to them.</p>
<p>Imagine you're on an island in the ocean with a bunch of other survivors and you can see land on the very edge of the horizon. It might actually just be a mirage it's so dim and hazy, but it's the best hope you have of rescue. How do you get there? A boat won't work - there are too many people with you.</p>
<p>Well, you can try building a bridge, right? So you work on chopping down a tree and fashioning some boards and every single day you place another board, and then another, and then another.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like you're going no where fast. Enough people are working on this assembly line and occasionally the poor sod at the extreme edge of the bridge is taken out by a shark or freak wave or something, but with diligent work you make progress. As you make progress you learn more about the land you're building toward.</p>
<p>I'm just an undergraduate, but mathematics and physics, especially the theoretical fields, feels a lot like that.</p>
<p>Though, sometimes, the people following behind you who aren't contributing to the bridge feel like morons you need to bind and gag and carry across the bridge for their own benefit, but that's a topic for some other thread. =P</p></div>		</li>

Then you try to figure out what it did, and describe that in terms of math. Then you try to figure out <em>why</em> it did that, predict what the implications of that explanation are, and start prodding things related to those predictions to see if you're wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t this be brain teaser be doable with some sort of algorithm? Than again, would it ever be possible to proof right? Proving it wrong is “easy” once you have a number that doesn’t result in 1 you’ve disproven it, but when do you know you’ve proven this hypothesis right? Would it be possible to try every number in existence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like it should be!</p>
<p>For a mathematician, proofing this brain teaser means verifying it works for all positive integers. That means from [1, infinity).</p>
<p>However, in order to test an infinite number of numbers, we would need an infinite amount of time, which we neither have nor are we patient enough to tolerate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this proof must be logical and reproducible. This is what we call a rigorous proof.</p>
<p>Computer programs have been used to calculate very, very large numbers and so far no counter example exists to disprove the conjecture. But until a rigorous proof can be produced, mathematicians will continue to label this a conjecture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We wouldn't ever prove it by trying every number, because we can't try every number.  But we can prove things about every number. For example every natural number is either even or odd. Also every number is either a prime number or a product of prime numbers.</p>
<p>So we can definitely prove things without having to apply an algorithm to every number.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Math goes well beyond numbers in many cases, math is just the study of proving statements to be true or false with a set of rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, schools don't really do a great job of framing math like this. I would've been a lot more interested in math this way. Someone once explained to me that math goes like this--  </p>
<p>1.) We begin with a statement. This statement is totally and completely true, it is proven,  robust and you MUST agree with it, and you cannot disagree with it.  </p>
<p>2.) Because this statement is true, you must also agree, when I use the same proven and robust methods, that the next statement I make is also true.  </p>
<p>And using these rules, we can all arrive at the same final statement and our logic is infallible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the axiomatic method! Of course that’s incredibly simplified ( for one step 1 isn’t proven to be true it’s assumed to be true and there will always be some statements that can’t be proven using our system) but it’s okay</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the ways it gets interesting is when we encode that process into a formal system and then prove statements about the system of proof, such as whether all proofs made within the system are true, and also whether all true statements can be proven within the system.</p></div>		</li>
