<p>In order to do so, you would have to simulate quarks, to simulate protons, neutrons, and electrons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As that was written a bit ambiguously, I'll note that protons and neutrons are made of quarks (and are part of the group called hadrons), but electrons aren't. Electrons are fundamental particles (part of the group called leptons) according to the standard model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I'm not an expert in those fields specifically, but I do understand your question.</p>
<p>You're thinking about this the wrong way around. Researchers want information, not so they can predict what may happen, but rather, what <em>has happened</em>. From that perspective, you can more accurately calculate what happened based on likelihood, probabilities, and what is currently happening. You detect electro magnetic radiation out in space? You can tell by its frequency what likely generated it. By setting up a couple of atennas, you can detect where it's coming from, by observing differences in strength. You can tell how far it traveled by its power. You can calculate how long this signal has been broadcast by seeing if there are gaps in the wave form. You can tell if there were objects that passed through the field by seeing irregularities in the signal. You can tell if the signal origin is getting closer or moving farther away. All this information you can parse out.</p>
<p>That information is vital to all research we do now as far as astronomy, and the research into physical phenomenon. The probability stuff and quantum theory is not directly related to how we use information. If anything (and this is me stepping into territory I don't quite understand), what you're talking about is how information is generated, and how difficult it is to predict information.</p>
<p>Black holes basically convert items to radiation, but we cannot know anything about the item before it hit the black hole's event horizon, because none of that information makes it out. And according to a lot of our current understanding of physical sciences, that shouldn't be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s super helpful. Sounds like we can (or should be able to) wind back the clock, without saying anything about winding it forward.</p></div>		</li>
