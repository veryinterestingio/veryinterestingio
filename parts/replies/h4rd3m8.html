<p>And then you have the problems with <em>parallel networks that probably shouldn't be able to cross-communicate</em> but can due to a design error somewhere. </p>

<p>to expand on this a bit...</p>
<p>most of the US uses some type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA" target="_blank">SCADA</a> network for their control systems. these systems tend to communicate in a vastly different way then something like going from a Windows 32bit to a 64bit system...</p>
<p>can it be done? yep, but it's not quite the easy target like a typical windows box that there are millions (approaching billions) of boxes out and about in the real world.</p>
<p>a lot of the infiltrations you are reading about aren't on the infrastructure network itself, but a &quot;hack&quot; against a connected system like u/acustwinhammer said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some fun reading about cyber attacks against such SCADA networks, read into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a>, quite possible the largest cyber attack against a SCADA network, and caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear program (by interrupting their ability to enrich nuclear material).  </p>
<p>Only reason it got caught is it unintentionally leaked out onto the internet and big-time security firms started reporting on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>exactly. this is a great example of state actors targeting a specific set of systems.</p>
<p>it wasn't a target at <em>just</em> target A, or target A/B... it was if A, B, C, <em>and</em> D are true... execute. the vast majority of systems infected by Stuxnet were iranian...</p></div>		</li>
