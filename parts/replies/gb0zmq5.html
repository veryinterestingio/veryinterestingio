			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is all a bit. </p>
<p>But, when I was pretty young, my dad bet my stepbrother he couldn't eat an entire pizza. I'm not sure the size because I was pretty young. But it ended with him vomiting up a ton of pizza and not winning the entirely ridiculous (maybe) 5 dollar bet. He's barely older than I and was way too young to try something like that. </p>
<p>It was hilarious and I haven't thought of it in almost 20 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm supposed to be on a diet. My mom made chicken pot pie. Then she made apple pie. I ate a slice of chicken pot pie. Then I went back for a slice of apple pie. Then I went back for another slice of chicken pot pie. Then I went back for another slice of apple pie. So much pie. I hate myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I told my girlfriend early on in our relationship that I NEVER order a small pizza. Under no circumstances is it even allowed. If I eat the whole large, so be it, but I love snacking on pizza for 3 days after pizza night.</p></div>		</li>
