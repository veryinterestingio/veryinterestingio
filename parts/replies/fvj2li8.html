			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also more consistent in the heat it puts out. Each briquette in a bag is, essentially, identical and will generate the same general amount of heat over the same amount of time.</p>
<p>The heat and burn time for wood varies by type of wood, size and shape of the piece, and how dry it is.</p>
<p>Because of these features of charcoal, you can actually do fairly accurate temperature control using a chart like <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/Y5iPT23gFZGa8FhA6" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer and it's too low right now. Starting a fire with wood is often a lot easier but it's a lot more work to use wood for cooking.</p></div>		</li>
