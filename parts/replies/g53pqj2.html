			<div class="markdown"><p>Embedded engineer here, wrote my masters on digital signal processing, so let me just add a little bit more technical detail.</p>
<p>The moving, vibrating of air has frequency. The noise, outside sounds consist also of various frequencies.
The microphone picks up the sound, and then a fourier transformation is done on it. It's one of the basic mathematical transformations. The result will be the frequency spectrum of the sound, the frequencies of which the sound consist of, as well as the phase for it. </p>
<p>By rotating the phase and adding every frequency together (creating a new sound), you get the inverse of the original noise. Now if you add the noise and its inverse together, they both cancel each other out (with an error margin of course),reducing the overall outside noise. </p>
<p>Since you are adding some &quot;noise&quot; to the music, you degrade its quality somewhat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. A real eli5 might be more like “sound is like ocean waves, only in the air. Noise cancellation measure how high each wave is and fills in the gaps between the waves with extra water.  After filling in the gaps there are no more waves! If you want, you can measure all the waves, but only fill in some of the waves.  This is how you can hear music but not the washing machine.  You can decide which sound is which by applying a Fourier transformation to the matrices that represent the wave form of the signal, invert the hessian matrix, determine the Eigen vectors, apply the rotation transformations, counteract sheer, kill Schrödinger’s cat, and minimize the support hyperplane.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By wearing active noise canceling headphones in environments where inaudible pitches may affect your hearing, you could inadvertently be protecting yourself.  Just driving, or being on an aircraft, or mowing a lawn or operating a cordless drill are all acts where having any kind of sound damping is probably a good idea.</p>
<p>Natural animals don't usually deal with such loudness in their lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Driving is not a good time to use a noice-canceling device, IMO.  </p>
<p>There are a lot of audible cues you can use while driving. It can inform you of things from how your car is performing and impending mechanical issues.  </p>
<p>It can also alert you about that traffic-weaving crotch-rocket motorcyclist who is outpacing traffic by 50 mph coming up behind you as you consider a lane change and before you see them.  </p>
<p>I’ve had both. And the 2nd one has probably kept me from killing an idiot speeding motorcyclist more than once.  </p>
<p>There’s a highway through a large city where I used to live that attracts these types often. It’s already a 65 mph zone, and you will be passed like you’re stopped by some of these guys. I signal check mirrors and all the standard stuff when changing lanes, but they are going so fast and often swinging through cars to where they are so more often audible before they’re visible. I even shut off my music going through the main area of town to better hear these idiots.  </p>
<p>They don’t call them “Organ Donor bikes” for nothing, but I sure as hell don’t want to be part of the reason for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that active noise cancellation doesn't protect your hearing as you're being exposed to similar loudness in order to counteract background noise.</p>
<p>To protect your hearing you should wear unpowered ear defenders which dampen external noise.</p>
<p>Also don't wear noise cancellation when driving, you need to be aware of your surroundings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it was mostly theoretical, with hardware oriented stuff. What's the math, logic behind it, why it's done that way, and why and how hardware is used, optimized for the different tasks. FPGAs, DSPs, microcontrollers and GPUs.
Of course we had programming with assembly, C, verilog and a little java. I remember 3 different classes talking about real-time operating systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. </p>
<p>I would have to guess that people using noise cancelling headphones generally listen to them at lower volumes (likewise for just plain over-ear headphones versus earbuds) and that they are therefore generally safer for hearing</p></div>		</li>
