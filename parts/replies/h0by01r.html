			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello fellow mosquito lady! I used to work with mozzies for a couple of years down here in Malaysia before switching over to coral research because it became to painful. I'm also deeply allergic to Ae. albo and aegypti bites. I do suggest using some steroidal ointment and antihistamine pills to manage it.</p>
<p>I love your write up, it's very well sourced and written in clear layman terms. I've heard this question so many times that I have a default answer to this, and you basically said what I do, but a million times better. So amazing that you're passionate about mosquito work! I was working on breeding habits of vector aedes in urban settings, and basically cooking them in a temperature chamber to see how hot it gets before eggs stop hatching and shading them to see if it would affect it and their subsequent development time. What are you working on, if you don't mind me asking?</p>
<p>P.S. I love Toxos too, I think they're super cool. I have one tattooed on my arm and people ask me if it's a fly or a plant. I've even had someone ask if it was a house (?!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! So awesome to talk to another mosquito lady. I saw your other comment, I went from marine biology to insects! We are opposites. :)</p>
<p>I do need to get some ointment. I was out in Kentucky last week for a wedding and did a little hiking. I pulled 11 ticks off of me and I have a honker of a mosquito bite on the back of my leg. Mosquitoes love me.</p>
<p>Thank you for the kind words! It feels really good to have a fellow mosquito scientist feel the same way I do and compliment my writing. I love scicomm and try very hard to not jargon all over the place when commenting here or other places. </p>
<p>Very cool research! What were your findings? I'm going to sequence the genome of a local tree hole mosquito that hasn't been sequenced before. Then I'm going to compare it to a few other mosquito genomes and <em>Drosophila</em>. I'm specifically interested in genes responsible for diapause, thermal tolerance, and desiccation resistance. I'd also like to do some lab work with the tree hole mosquito but I haven't decided on a project yet.</p>
<p>What a cool tattoo idea! A house? wtf. I bet it looks awesome!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg that's awesome! Complementary science buddies! Scicomm is so important and I think we should all do it more! </p>
<p>We don't usually have a tick problem here, the main issue is  m o z z i e s. The Aedes fuckers here are so resilient I've found them in nasty ash trays, soapy water, polluted waterways, basically everywhere you can think of. Though I did have an issue with ticks when I trekked at the national park here, even got 2 on my right nipple and one on my shoulder that caused this weird long lasting injury that didn't fully close for 2 months and itched like crazy. I still feel it sometimes. But yeah, getting bitten by armigeres probably feels like that, like you can feel them digging in with a barbed needle. Had to ice those bites and pop antihistamines like they were PCP. Good luck with those bites! </p>
<p>For my research, it was found that hatch rates of Ae. Aegypti were not sign diff between 28, 31 and 34 deg C treatments (80-90%) but dropped off to about 50% at 37 and didn't hatch at all at 41. But the hotter it was, the faster they developed - at 37 deg they emerged after only 7 days after hatching, which is no big surprise as you know. In the field, shading is considered to be a factor for increased development times and survival rates - temperatures are more stable than if the container is under direct sunlight, and if located under a tree, there's an excess organic matter for the larvae. But we took out the issue of having excess food for them by standardising daily meals and water changes, and preventing temp fluctuations by using a growth chamber. It was found that shading actually increased developmental times significantly from 31 to 37 deg c. Its weird. We still don't know why because the effect of light on mosquito development is basically unknown, and we don't have seasons to explain it away to diapause. Aegypti don't diapause anyway.</p>
<p>Thats basically a very long gist of my paper. But it seems like you're going more into the genetics bits of ecology which is mostly a mystery to me still as a dumb ecologist. What genus is this tree hole mosquito? Did you find anything interesting?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well placed, and in laymanâ€™s terms. Thank you for the well thought out response. </p>
<p>I did not know they drank nectar at all! You have shed a new light on them. I would still get the skeeves if one was crawling on me, but I respect them greater from a distance now.</p>
<p>If you have time to spare in your day, do you have any more cool facts of note about mosquitos?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for reading my longwinded response! I very much understand getting the skeeves and I don't blame anyone for that response. I used to work in a lab where we had an <em>Aedes albopictus</em> colony. They frequently got loose and would bite me all day. I now have an allergy to this species' bites, I get huge welts. So I get how you feel!</p>
<p>Let's see, cool mosquito facts. I think I probably do!</p>
<ul>
<li>Mosquitoes go through <em>diapause</em> during the winter, which is like hibernation. Depending on the species they overwinter as eggs, larvae, or adults. </li>
<li>A study came out a while back indicating mosquitoes prefer biting people with blood type O. I think there probably needs to be more study on this, but it's interesting. They are also attracted to heat, CO2, sweat, etc.</li>
<li>Some have very short life cycles, going from egg to adult in about a week and others, who lay eggs in very cold water, have long life cycles of about 100 days.</li>
<li>Container or tree hole mosquitoes can lay eggs in very tiny and weird places. I've seen them lay in soda bottle tops, chip bags that fill with water, tiny compartments of outdoor children's toys, plant containers, soda cans, etc.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read another comment from an alleged ecologist a while ago that said due to the fact that mozzies hibernate during the winter, and that other animals in the ecosystem would have to do without them as food during that time, that they aren't all that important because there are clearly other food sources anyway. Is there much truth to that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly, yes to both questions. Some species are a real pain in the ass to rear in captivity though. One of the newer invaders to the U.S., <em>Aedes japonicus</em>, for example doesn't freely mate in capitivty unless they are at a very high density. Before getting to that point you need to force mate them which can be time consuming and costly. The technique I am aware of involves cutting the male's head off to force sperm transfer, so with each new forced mating you need a new male. Other species aren't so difficult and readily mate in captivity, so it depends.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you're telling me that there is at least one human who earns money by cutting mosquito heads off, scooping mosquito sperm into a mosquito female (dare i ask how?) and I only hear about this now?</p></div>		</li>
