			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and it's more difficult to contain a virus if it's more transmissible. Measles, mumps, and the chickenpox all have R0 values over 10 (Covid is a little higher than 3).</p>
<p>Initial R0 of 3 means that over 66% of the population would need to get Covid before herd immunity pushes it below 1. (You will infect 3 people, but 2 will be immune, so only 1 infection takes place). </p>
<p>Because the measles has an R0 of 12-18(Wikipedia) 92-95% of people need immunity for herd immunity to work. Some people unable to be vaccinated for legitimate medical reasons, so that's a few percent right there. It only takes a small additional percentage of the population to not be vaccinated for these diseases to erupt in pandemic, which affects the people who can't be vaccinated even more drastically, because they often already have compromised immune systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that even in people who can safely get vaccinated there also is a small but nonzero chance that the vaccine just... doesn't work, for no apparent reason. </p>
<p>Which is even more incentive for everyone to get vaccinated who can, because you have no foolproof way to know whether you are susceptible or not. So we must collectively do whatever possible to obtain and maintain herd immunity at the highest level that we can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is... All wrong.</p>
<p>We don't know long term impacts; and saying anything specific you can say you're wrong on just that assumption. </p>
<p>Regardless we are now seeing asymptomatic cases are still causing lung scaring; and blood clotting. </p>
<p>Being asymptotic =/= adamagetothebody; and we ARE seeing the same things in children.</p>
<p>You think COVID is bad? Nearly all people have blood clotting etc. Aneurysms etc will lead to premature deaths in a LOT of people in the next coming years.</p>
<p>Regardless moving on... There are more than 200 rhinoviruses for the cold... And you can catch the same strain more than once. Viruses mutate; rhinoviruses are decent at it. Which is why we have so many in humans; luckily they are relatively benign so we don't really exert resources to develop vaccines.</p>
<p>Moreover there are corona viruses that cause the common cold as well(15-20%) and it turns out they cause false positives in antibody tests in some cases. </p>
<p>EOD... Stop spreading misinformation don't listen to anything I typed either. Take what the experts are saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you mean embolisms rather than aneurysms? Do they think blood clotting is a long-term thing? How long does it occur for after someone recovers?</p></div>		</li>
