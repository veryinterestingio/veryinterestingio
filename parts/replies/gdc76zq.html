<p>If the file went ABCACBCA you'd have 1A1B1C1A1C...etc. no performance gain at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason that encrypted files don't compress... encrypted code is essentially random data, so no patterns exist to compress.  So compress first, then encrypt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct - compression works best when the file has predictable qualities/patterns, in &quot;compresaion-speak&quot; it is called entropy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your file might already be compressed a lot before you try to compress it.</p>
<p>If I tried to compress a folder of JPG images, it wouldn't get much smaller. Why? Because JPG is already a compressed format.</p>
<p>Most multimedia data is already highly compressed like images ( jpg, png, gif,..) or audio (wma, mp3,..) or video (wmv, mp4,..) and I guess even text files, and &quot;zipping&quot; it won't do much.</p>
<p>Also, media data is big anyway. A few pictures in your folder can easily be bigger than a nice pile of code. So the media format has got a lot of impact.</p>
<p>That's usually the reason why some things don't get much smaller when zipping. Uncompressed media can often be reduced 90%ish and program files like 50%ish. But compressed data is already compressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>We recognize sequences and express them in a shorter way.</p>
<p>Run-length: AAABBCCCC -&gt; 3A2B4C</p>
<p>Placeholders: 3.14159265.... -&gt; pi (your computer can calculate pi when unzipping)</p>
<p>Random data: AKWDNJK -&gt; AKWDNJK (can't compress it)</p>
<p>Media like pictures: &quot;whitewhitewhitewhite....&quot; -&gt; &quot;5 rows white&quot;</p>
<p>Lossy: AAAAaAA -&gt; 4A1a2A -&gt; 7A (if we don't need to tell &quot;A&quot; from &quot;a&quot;; maybe we don't care if a pixel in a picture is &quot;white&quot; or &quot;very-white-cream&quot;)</p>
<p>Save everything only once: &quot;A green tree is a large tree with green leaves&quot; -&gt; &quot;A green tree is [1] large [3] with [2] leaves&quot;. (we just &quot;point&quot; to the place where we saved something before)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why some lossless compression algorithms compress some types of data better than others. Modern compression algorithms are smart though and will use different techniques on different types of data to get the best of all worlds.</p></div>		</li>
