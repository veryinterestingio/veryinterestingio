			<div class="markdown"><p>wait, so you're saying that the eggs we eat (the white and yellow stuff) are actually nutrition for the chick and not some pre-version of the chick.</p>
<p>If that is so , you've officially blown my mind</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If you crack open an egg carefully, there is a little white (or sometimes red of fertilized) spot on the egg yolk. That tiny white spot is basically the cells that would have become the chick as it developed (if fertilized)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that is correct, I believe the eggs we eat aren't even fertilized, so they never even had a chance of being chicks. The way we selectively bred chickens is equal parts interesting and disturbing. We basically took nature into our own hands and abused the chickens life cycle to our advantage, I highly recommend you look into the domestication of chickens if your interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Its an amazing self contained nutrient pod with enough to grow a life. Sounds like good food to me.</p>
<p>Thats why I would get annoyed when people say eww don't eat eggs, its a chicken period. So wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why Americans put their eggs in refrigerators. Commercial eggs are washed and the bloom removed so the shells then are at risk of contamination. I raise chickens. I don’t wash off the bloom, this I don’t need to refrigerate them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rule 4: &quot;As mentioned in the mission statement, ELI5 is not meant for literal 5-year-olds. Your explanation should be appropriate for laypeople. That is, people who are not professionals in that area. For example, a question about rocket science should be understandable by people who are not rocket scientists.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
