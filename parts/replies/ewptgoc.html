			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a stress puker. I also have what I have clumsily described as <em>anorexia not very nervosa.</em> As in I just don't eat. Like, I'll eat once a day. </p>
<p>I'm gonna admit I should know better, based on my schooling and profession and stuff. </p>
<p>But I've dealt with mood problems, depression, disordered eating, and just being a basket case since I was a teenager and never, until now, really realized the extent of the connection between me being depressed and everything else and WHY I don't really eat. Why I'm skinny but not careful about it and not <em>healthy</em>.</p>
<p>My appetite is fucked up because my hormones are out of whack from a lifetime of having shit I should be dealing with. </p>
<p>When I was younger &amp; I'd read about someone so stressed they threw up, I'd think, that's weird; how the fuck? How naive I was.</p>
<p>Because that's actually me. Breakup? I cannot even look at food or dishes or think about people eating, or I will retch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i’m the exact same way! after several years of not being able to eat easily i discovered that weed works really well hehe. but my problem now is that i’m conditioned to eat with weed and when i can’t smoke it’s so hard to eat more than a couple bites. and i don’t want to be high all the time so i don’t eat for most of the day and then i have one solid meal when i’m zoinked. i wonder if there’s some hormonal thing i could change to get myself on a healthier track because i know everything is all interconnected and improving food would likely improve a bunch of things in my life. but it’s hard lol. stay fresh brother i’ll think of you when i’m eating my one meal of the day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on this exact situation rn, and what I'm trying out psychologically and dietary is to take super cold showers, so I can get used to being uncomfortable, and taking vitamin B complex liquids under my tongue, they are responsible of being ingredients to producing seratonine and dopamine to regulate emotions, I've tried CBD doesnt do anything for me but if you try it. It could benefit you, obviously weed helps me a lot especially thc wax. But I beg you to use it as a tool, not a crutch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes 3 of us.  Maybe a 2nd meal right before bed but usually 1 big meal daily.  Depression doesnt always make it easy to make the time for exercise and meditation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also my life. Didn't really start until after I had c.diff a few years ago. Successful professional life? Yes but the night before every big meeting, up throwing up. </p>
<p>I don't eat much either...or drink water like I should. I did find out that I have hashimotos hypothyroidism, which is now corrected and has helped a lot of my symptoms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'll get a physical. I'm just tired of going to doctors. </p>
<p>Last year I was diagnosed bipolar. I followed instructions and medicated and nothing was better. It was worse if anything. Zero appetite and the mood stabilizer made me dumb.  Can't take anti depressants by themselves because they make me manic. </p>
<p>So I stopped all of it and I still have all the crazy and all the food problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a week in an epilepsy monitoring unit having countless seizures whilst they tried a bunch of different medications on me and eventually decided that this is what I needed. They neurosurgeon was very honest with me though. She said it works amazing half of the time.</p></div>		</li>
