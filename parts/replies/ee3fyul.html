			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. This seems more like the real answer to me. I don't think the other guy is wrong about &quot;competition&quot; but it seems more likely that the tiny sliver of &quot;bad meat&quot; isn't going to do much harm no matter what. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Competition is not the whole picture, and can be misleading even (plus it’s not a game “where you play one off against another”). When your body is first exposed to microorganisms after birth you are colonized and <em>those</em> germs generally become the “home team”, we call those commensals. If you <em>happen to have strong commensals</em> they can act to protect you, as described above - you can even become a carrier of very dangerous germs that can kill pretty much anyone except you (see: Typhoid Mary).  </p>
<p>Now, when that meat is in your mouth, it is immediately starting to rot in situ. You might not be able to feel it (and feelings are deceptive), but the gums change color, texture, shape, and become inflamed as your body tries to fight off this danger to your body. Eventually (from 2-3 days), you start to bleed around the tooth, but this is only visible to clinicians with what we call “bleeding upon probing”. Later, 24-48hrs more, you start to spit blood, and <em>then</em> start to feel itchy or even burning gums. By now the germs are invading other areas of the teeth and/or gums. You are risking your health because these areas are merely the <em>staging ground</em>. They want in, they want to get to your heart, pancreas, arteries, and brain. By stimulating you to bleed, they effectively trick your body into opening up the gates to the rest of your body. This is why periodontal health status is linked to risks or heart disease, cancers, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes (amongst other diseases).  </p>
<p>Should meat persist in the mouth, it essentially becomes a microbial growth medium. Risks to you are dependent on what germs makeup the mouth, and the invaders you have newly introduced. This is a gamble not worth having, just ask anybody who’s had root canals, fillings, extractions, dentures, implants, or abscesses in the mouth.  </p>
<p>I would recommend a bacterial survey be taken, find out exactly what microorganisms you have, and how many. Then when your health changes you can see what caused it. No more guesswork people, work smart ✅ </p>
<p>Think about visiting a dental professional that understands you and communicates in a way that works for you. Ask all your questions, try different strategies - until you find something that’s effective. Transparency is king, it’s your body, become the manager it deserves!  </p>
<p><strong>ELI5:</strong> Meat is not to be left out of the freezer, your mouth is even warmer. It will rot your mouth and make your breath smelly like the toilet and make food taste bad. Later, you won’t feel well and need a doctor. Doctors might decide to use needles and drills, let’s rather learn how to get that meat out of your teeth.</p></div>		</li>
