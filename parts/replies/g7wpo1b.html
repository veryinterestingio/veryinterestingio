			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this the reason why people used to drink alcohol during the Middle Ages? Clean water sources were scarce so beer was the next best thing. Especially considering that the refining process of cheap beer is subpar, the alcohol content would be pretty damn low in comparison to modern commercial beer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were plenty of clean wells and suitable drinking water. People were also aware that boiling water purified it and that smelly foul tasting water wasn't good to drink. But when a water source went bad (typically getting contaminated from human and animal waste) a cholera or similar outbreak could devastate the community. This got way worse in places where population density exploded and sanitation technology stagnated. <em>Looking at you vast majority of London's existence.</em></p>
<p>Drunkenness is so ubiquitous throughout all aspects of history that it is difficult to imagine it wasn't widely available. Ancient greeks had entire gods of drunkeness, ancient religions all had their own take on alcohol. So even though how people lived their day to day lives changes massively depending on your specific century and parcel of land, it's still pretty safe to assume that access to enough alcohol to get blotto was not a rare part of the human experience. </p>
<p>People drank alcohol mostly because they liked to. There are a lot of places and times where attitudes and access to booze vary, but that's just because history is really big and people are really different.</p>
<p>But not so different that getting blasted hasn't been a huge part of our collective history.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Small beer was basically watered down beer,and was drunk as a cheap means to sanitize water.</p></div>		</li>
