<p>Starting in the 19th century, various texts claimed that the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus Africanus plowed over and sowed the city of Carthage with salt after defeating it in the Third Punic War (146 BC).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sowed the ground with salt, but salt was far too expensive in Ancient times to ruin large tracts of cropland with it.  Your own link describes the salting of Carthage as &quot;The Carthage story is a modern invention of popular history, probably modeled on the story of Shechem, which entered scholarly literature for a period after 1930 and was discredited and retracted in the 1980s&quot;</p>
<p>In the Ancient Near East, especially Mesopotamia, farming depended on irrigation, and all river water has some trace of salt.  In arid lands without rainfall, the salt builds slowly.  When an area begins to show noticeable soil salinity, the local city- state is utterly doomed.  Mesopotamia lacked forests or mines or other economic products other than food. Once the land became degraded, the kingdom became weak, and a neighboring kingdom would scoop the people up as slaves.  <em>Salt in the soil brought conquerors</em>, which led to it being used as a ceremonial curse.  It was never a practical tool of biological warfare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cloud seeding is unreliable.  What we need to do is make a huge intercontinental ballistic snowball cannon, and fire a few million  fresh water snowballs from the Antarctic onto those fires.</p></div>		</li>
