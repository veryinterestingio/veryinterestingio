			<div class="markdown"><p>It being cold doesn't mean the sun is doing less damage no matter where you are. This is why sunglasses are still necessary during winter. More so sure to glare from snow like up in Alaska. Where there is sun, you can get burnt. The difference between being at the beach ca normal stuff is that you're doing it deliberately and for a long time with zero cover, but you still have exposed skin anywhere you are outside.</p></div>		</li>

But no, I feel it starting to effect my skin even through clothes if they aren't SPF clothes. I don't feel it when im sunscreened and spf clothed, then its just warmth, not itchy skin crawly discomfort.</p></div>		</li>
