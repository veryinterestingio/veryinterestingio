			<div class="markdown"><p>There is direct evidence that mirror neurons exist in rhesus monkeys. This evidence was obtained by means that cannot be used on humans for ethical reasons. For years, articles continued to appear questioning whether the evidence from rhesus monkeys could be generalized to human beings. From reading recent surveys of the literature, it appears that this idea is fading. The idea of mirror neurons is an economical way of explaining a great deal, so that is a reason to suppose that it is right.</p>
<p>I think your use of the word &quot;theory&quot; here is a potential source of confusion. I think you are using it in a conversational sense, as something unproven. But in science, something unproven is called a &quot;hypothesis,&quot; and the word &quot;theory&quot; is only used after the hypothesis has been proven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing increases myelination that fast. Myelination is built up over time on the stem of neurons that are used often. It helps to keep the electrical signal from leaking out of the stem when signals are sent from one neuron to another, an insulation. When you use a neuron pathway often enough you've built up myelination and it makes that &quot;task&quot; easier, like learning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Can you further explain the correlation of why you have to keep the electrical signal from leaking to making a task easier?? Im not a science guy but would love to know the hows of this mirror neurons and myelination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An electrical signal degrades over distance. This is because electrical current &quot;leaks&quot; out of the desired path along the axon. To avoid this there are 2 common ways: 1. increase axon diameter (less surface to leak through) 2. wrap a fatty insulating tissue called myelin similar to isolating covers on electrical wires. Now next time a signal is propagated through a neuron, it doesn't degrade as much, and can reach the threshold &quot;easily&quot; where the neuron can release neurotransmitter to a subsequent synapse. In essence, degrading signal means it won't trigger the next neuron down the line, so it'll be more &quot;difficult to learn&quot;</p></div>		</li>
