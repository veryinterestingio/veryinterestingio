			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best simple explanation. The one thing I will add is that nature has been building these behaviors over millions of years. There have been billions upon billions of organisms that have lived and died without ever passing on their genes because they were not the strongest. When you think about the turtle example above just imagine the untold millions of individuals that died because they didn't immediately race to the ocean. </p>

<p>In the developed world we are not accustomed to seeing death on a massive scale but even a few generations ago half of human babies were dying because they were not the absolute strongest. Just think back to your own childhood and I am sure there is a moment you were brought to the hospital/doctor where you would have died without modern medicine.</p></div>		</li>
