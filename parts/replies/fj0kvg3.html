			<div class="markdown"><p>Rental car companies do this too. They always assume a certain percentage of people won't show, and then overbook. But it's even worse than airline tickets, because most places you don't have to pay in advance for rental cars, and there's no penalty to cancel or just not show up. So the estimated percentage of people who won't show up is always relatively high, and some days that doesn't work out, and then you have a bunch of angry customers wondering where their car is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a car rental company for 6 years, and if we didn't have your car (or better) available, it's because people kept their rentals for longer than they had planned. From my experience, THIS is the reason rentals (at least where I worked) weren't available when you showed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of that is really boiled down to statistics now. We know, regardless of when people say they will return, that there's a predictable percentage of types of cars that will return on a certain day. We almost never count on a specific car returning in order to use it for a reservation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe hotels have this same practice as well. They're always in the habit of making sure that every room is booked so that they maximize their profits. They also count on there being a number of no shows as well. So it's really on a first come first served basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya, they absolutely do. One trick to avoid being someone walked to another hotel is to book directly with them as opposed to a 3rd party site. They (or at least the one I have experience with) will only deny rooms to folks who used a 3rd party site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some hotels do, some don't. It kinda depends on how greedy the boss/owner is. Overbooking usually means more money in the long term, but a higher amount of stress for the staff (and some guests).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has to do with the cost of air travel. The trend over the last 20 years toward fewer and fewer flight perks (meals, free checked bags, more tightly packed seats) are a direct response to consumers' preference for the cheapest possible airfares over any other factor. As such, flight costs barely cover the cost to actually transport a passenger, and they rely on the other hidden fees to actually turn a profit. Since they're already making so little profit off the actual ticket price, it costs less to have to give a flight voucher to the occasional displaced traveller than to regularly operate non-sold-out flights. </p>
<p>If consumers as a whole were more willing to spend more for a pleasurable flight experience, there would certainly be fewer oversold flights. But, cost is king when it comes to air travel, and this is what we've collectively chosen to endure as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thing is, it’s not even the ticket itself that’s expensive but all the added taxes. But we’re still flying and we can’t pay more for perks when the taxes go up. So all this taxing of flight tickets really leads to shittier flights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The math is pretty simple, if you overbook every flight by the right amount there are always more people who didn't fly but still paid for their ticket, and won't get a refund, than there are people the airline has to pay to not fly.</p></div>		</li>
