			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. As someone who has owned hatchbacks, SUV’s and sedans, I actually like the clean rear glass window you get with a sedan. Sure it can collect rain drops but once you take off it clears up from the airflow. SUV and hatchback glass is always dirty just like the rear trunk and bumber of the sedan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate using the hatchback rear wiper anyway. Coz the first time I use it, dirt and grime just pours down and dries up all over the tailgate, making my car look like a horrible mess from behind. Not to mention the color of my washer fluid stands out like a sore thumb in my white hatch</p>
<p>As much as possible I manually wipe my rear window after every trip lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, they take great pains to reduce the effect as much as possible since SUV/CUVs became more popular (similar configuration to hatchbacks aerodynamically). But it really does just come down to separation down the length of the vehicle from the glass to the &quot;meeting edge&quot; where the top flow and bottom flow meet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree. This explains why every VW Golf and GTI has a dirty rear hatch &amp; windshield. It gets filthy instantly, no matter how often one washes the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s because of how close the rear tires are to the back of the car as well.  Mini Coopers and those little Nissan fleet vans have this problem baaaad.</p></div>		</li>
