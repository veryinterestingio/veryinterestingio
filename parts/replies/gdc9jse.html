<p>You could certainly compress ten random bits, e.g. 1111111111 to a smaller size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Randomness is property of thing generating those bits. If your process produces only bits 11111111, it's not very random.</p>
<p>So to phrase it differently, if you get random bits in a bag, there is no compression algorithm which allows you to expect you are going to squeeze those bits to a smaller size. Only if you know that the bits aren't really random, that there is a structure to them, can you start compressing with expectation that you get something smaller than you started with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you needed to phrase this differently, he just said that &quot;entropy&quot; is the word you were looking for to describe this phenomenon mathematically. It literally describes the information provided by the random process. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use &quot;uniformly random distribution&quot; to get a special case for maximum entropy.</p></div>		</li>
