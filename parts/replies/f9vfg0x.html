			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the best answer on here, but anesthesia doesn't turn the whole brain off. The higher level thought areas you are fairly correct on, but the lower level &quot;reptilian brain&quot; still keeps the body functioning (heart, lungs, nervous system, etc). This is why you don't get put on life support to have your wisdom teeth pulled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually no. On general anesthesia you are put on life support. When your wisdom teeth come out you go on what’s called twilight sedation. You’re never actually fully asleep, but you’re pretty out of it and you won’t remember shit, so when it’s over you don’t remember it at all and this gives the illusion that you were knocked out when in fact you weren’t.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my other reply. A ventilator is part of the anesthesia treatment and is regulating your breathing. As a ventilator is part of life support I see why this is seen as &quot;being on life support&quot;, but it isn't factually or strictly correct. Life support involves dialysis, feeding tubes, pacemaker/defibrillators, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>unconsciousness is an emergency shutoff, usually due to trauma - low blood pressure and brain swelling are the usual candidates. - It's (near) impossible to wake up an unconscious person (and usually it's pretty dangerous to do so)</p>

<p>I heard that its dangerous to be unconscious for too long, so what do I do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's the trauma that's making you unconscious that's dangerous.</p>
<p>If you are unconscious due to low blood pressure your brain damage is coming from lack of oxygen causing cell death, so you increase blood pressure through blood and saline IVs.</p>
<p>If you are unconscious due to brain swelling, this can cause cell death by physically crushing your brain cells against your skull. This is usually treated by actually drilling a hole into the skull to drain the pus and blood and relieve the pressure, combined with anti-inflammatories.</p>
<p>So basically for traumatic comas/unconsciousness you just treat it symptomatically, and then being unconscious is just another symptom, and a rather unimportant one at that.</p>
<p>if you are in a non-traumatic coma your brain is probably going to be fine, but it's hard to notice when things are wrong with an unconscious people, because they can't signal their symptoms properly due to being unconscious, so doctors might miss important things like say if you stop breathing, or have a heart attack, which is why you see coma patients hooked up to a lot of monitoring machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's what I thought--the unconsciousness is a symptom or signal, not a cause. The unconsciousness is the result of the cause.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So a light trauma will knock you out for a short time.</p>
<p>A big trauma, which is what the danger is, may knock you out for a long time. And the danger isn't being unconscious; it's the trauma.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Being unconscious for too long isn't necessarily dangerous (unless we're talking days or longer) -- the thing that made you unconscious is dangerous. The longer you're out, the more serious the damage is likely to have been.</p></div>		</li>
