			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be interested to see how the effects of the Pluto / Charon system affect a space elevator, since Charon is massive enough to result in the two orbiting a point between them rather than Charon directly orbiting Pluto.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would the purpose be?</p>
<p>Pluto's gravity is already half that of Luna. Charon's is like 1/4 of Luna's. I suppose every bit of lowered gravity makes launching cheaper. But in that case, why bother settling Pluto in the first place? Just do everything off Charon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how elliptic the orbit is. If the distance between them changes significantly that could pose some engineering challenges. But in principle yes, the elevator between them should work.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, the orbit is very circular, far more so than the Moon's orbit. The distance is 19,591 km, +- 4 km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The orbit does have some eccentricity which adds up to about a &lt;0.1% change in distance from peak to trough.  Less than 10 km for a semi-major axis of about 19,600 km.  Thatâ€™s definitely not something to sneeze at, but it may be plausible for a spanning object to be flexible enough to ebb with that across its whole distance so no single part varies by several kilometers.</p></div>		</li>
