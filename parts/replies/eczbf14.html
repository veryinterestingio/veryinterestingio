			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's a killer.</p>
<p>We used to breed silky terriers and one of the people we sold to was giving the puppy to their mother who'd just lost a dog to parvo. They promised they had cleaned everything up really good, but the puppy got sick anyways. He survived but just barely. Funny enough he was like a reverse runt of the litter, I had named him &quot;Jack&quot; when he was born and that quickly became &quot;fat jack&quot; which he lived up to. All that extra weight helped keep him alive when he got sick. He stopped being fat, but as much as they kept in touch they kept the name. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're going to start a classic Reddit debate here. </p>
<p>Do you get less sick in an ultra-clean environment or an ultra-dirty environment?</p>
<p>I gotta go with the dirty side (not that I really live it). If you are always in a clean environment, when the day comes you are in a dirty environment your immune system is befuddled. If it has already seen all these microbes, it can take care of them without much hassle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely agree with you. I was raised on a thoroughbred horse farm, and everyone in my household was always outside in the dirt and muck and other than an occasional cold, my family was always in good health. Even now, I take public transportation and I’m in contact with a metric fuckton of germs on a daily basis, and I have been sick twice in five years, but I’m still going to bleach-bomb my kitchen and bathroom everyday. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thing is, we aren't always in a &quot;clean environment&quot;. We're not sterilizing everything we touch and ridding our entire environment of germs. We're still breathing air that someone just breathed out, touching door knobs, putting our hands on a dirty table, grabbing things that have been sitting outside for days or weeks, wiping our mouths with those hands, getting all sorts of dust and pollen in our eyes and nose and mouth, and so on. Our lives are not sterile no matter how clean our house is, no matter how strong our cleaning agents are.</p>
<p>If you're the type to go out everyday with a dust mask, lab goggles and gloves then you're probably the kind that experiences that dangerously clean environment, but otherwise you're still getting bombarded with foreign shit no matter how well you wipe down your coffee table. Seriously, it's not about removing all contact with germs, it's about cleaning up particles of food that fell onto that coffee table and sterilizing it so the things we live with smell nice. It's about being able to wipe your arm across the table without it picking up grease and dirt and making your clothes look nasty. It's mostly presentation.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone is getting their immune system befuddled because they use bleach to clean their kitchen. They still go to work and have people talk right up at their faces and shake hands and breathe in poo particles in public bathrooms. They're getting a cocktail of nastiness every day, and after that it's just nice to come home to a clean kitchen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also I would guess that people who get sick from germs pick them up outside the home because that's where all the other (sick) people are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they are always perfectly clean and I have literally had guests comment on the cleanliness of my toilet. I wipe down sinks, walls, surfaces, and the floor everyday. I don’t mind public restrooms, but a less than sparkling clean bathroom or kitchen in a home is just gross. How often do you clean yours?</p></div>		</li>
