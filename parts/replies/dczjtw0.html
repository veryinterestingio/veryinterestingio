<p>There's also the problem that if you don't have at least a bit of noise on the phone, people think it is not working, so even if you are in a quiet room calling another phone in a quiet room, you're likely to hear some white noise to help you differentiate between an active call with silence on the line vs a phone without an active call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually due to Digital Signal processors and Acoustic Echo Cancellation most digital calls remove background noise <del>and I don't know of a single manufacturer that inserts white noise into a call for that purpose.</del> Edit:Apparently there are voip phones that have this option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the GSM won't encode the white noise, and generate it on the other end when there's no voice transmitted. </p>
<p>So the voice isn't encoded into the air, but you can still tell whether your phone is off-hook or not. </p>
<p>Or I could be wrong :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, on IMS systems some noise is generated on media gateways because most of the core systems are analysing RTP stream and when no data is going thru RTP, then call is considered as dropped and it is terminated.
