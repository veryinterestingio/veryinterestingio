			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it healthier than, in theory, if blood cells are not constantly being replaced? Or in other words, if smokers/COPD patients are constantly close to max production, that can't be healthy- so is it healthier if your body doesn't always have to replenish these cells?</p>
<p>Hope that question made sense :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully I'm answering the question you asked. The more number of RBC's per unit of blood the more viscous or thicker it is. Because of the increased viscosity the heart can't pump blood as far as it normally could. So, to make sure all the tissues get the oxygen they need the heart has to pump harder, which is more taxing on the heart. So the body tries to maintain minimum RBC counts (to make it easier on the heart) while still meeting the oxygen demands of the rest of the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your comment. I have a followup question: it sounds like you're saying that increased viscosity makes it harder for the heart to pump blood all the way, and that should cause a reduction in oxygen availability in 'faraway' tissues. Will this trigger further production of RBCs? I guess there probably are two triggers at play: oxygen availability as well as a measure of effort taken to pump blood by the heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking past temporary health of overproduction, the long term effects would lead to you aging faster. </p>
<p>The more your cells (stem cells being the most important here) divide the more problems that crop up in their DNA. These problems include but aren't limited to telomere shortening, double strand breaks, and mitochondria ceasing to function. These problems lead to more of your cells being non-functional but still alive (senescent state). This is the main driving force of aging, and your blood again faster is a particular problem because your blood affects everything in your body. There's an interesting study where they joined the circulatory systems of a young and old rat so the blood was shared between them. The old rat was revitalized as if it got younger and the young rat got &quot;older&quot; and didn't heal as fast. So even if it was just blood, the whole body would be affected long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered if whole blood transfusion would cause the immune system to flag cancer. With the idea being that our body flags cancerous cells and begins an immune response to attack said cells. But in the case where the immune system doesn't see the cancerous cells as a problem, a foreign blood source may see the cancerous cells and flag them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there’s evidence that donating blood regularly is healthy: <a href="http://redcrosslatalks.org/2016/03/03/why-is-donating-blood-healthy-for-you/" target="_blank">http://redcrosslatalks.org/2016/03/03/why-is-donating-blood-healthy-for-you/</a></p>
<p>It’s not entirely clear why, but the fact that it shows up in men and post-menopausal women suggests that it’s not just a correlation, since women only gain the benefit once they stop naturally bleeding monthly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! Lots of athletes actually train in high altitudes to compete better because this causes the red blood cells to have a higher threshold for oxygen, so the RBC (red blood cell) is bigger and fuller of oxygen. The benefits last the duration of the RBC’s, about 120 days. So when the athlete goes back to lower altitudes, their RBC’s are still bigger and have a high affinity of O2, resulting in better performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High altitude causes hypoxemia and triggers erythropoiesis, bringing up the hematocrit. This can be dramatic in the short term for visitors but super long term exposure is less dramatic because other things help accommodate. People who live there for generations have adapted some interesting things like blood flow modulation. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So...I donate blood every 3 months then make me wait.. They pull what they're calling a &quot;double red&quot;? I guess just yanking all the RBC out that they can. I get a bag of saline mixed back in and feel great after.</p>
<p>I smoke and have asthma. Is that why my count is so high?</p>
<p>I go to Colorado often and straight up to the 12k hills with zero ill effects as long as I drink lots of water. Is that because my count is high?</p>
<p>I have a regularly high heart rate. Is that also because of the same?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The arteries narrow as plaque builds up in them, leading to narrower pathways for the same volume of blood. Additionally, smoking makes platelets (the part of your blood that helps clotting when you cut yourself) more sticky, causing buildup in the veins which ends up  as DVT (deep vein thrombosis, or blood clots). These also narrow the pathways for blood to get to other parts of the body/back to the heart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood pressure and red blood cells are a little different.  The biggest driver of blood pressure is fluid load in the blood, regulated primarily by the kidneys.</p>
<p>What you are asking about is more that the body increases pressure in the pulmonary circulation to help out with getting oxygen.  This has follow-on effects of causing heart failure.  </p>
<p>Simplified a few levels but that should explain it.  For further reading look into COPD, Right Heart Failure, Renin-Angiotensin Cycle, and Pulmonary hypertension.</p></div>		</li>
