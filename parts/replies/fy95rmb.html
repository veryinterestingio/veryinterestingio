			<div class="markdown"><p>Also for anyone curious why there was such a love of the number 12, it was because that was how they counted on their hand. Look at your hand. Notice how each of your fingers minus your thumb has three easily identifiable parts to it. They used to count by using their thumb to count each part of the finger, much in the same way we count to 10 using our fingers today. So 12 was the max you could count on one hand.</p>
<p>EDIT: As some other commenters have pointed out, there are also other reasons for 12, it is both an easily divided number, and there are also 12 lunar cycles in a year. I doubt any one reason is why some societies used 12 so much, and suspect it to be a mix of all of them. Also, the &quot;they&quot; in this comment is primarily ancient Babylonians, although they are certainly not the only ancient society to use base 12. Plenty of Ancient Societies had base 10 number systems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In a largely illiterate and innumerate society, 12 is a more practical base than 10.  You can do halves, thirds, and quarters without resorting to fractions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the actual answer - 12 is easily divisible.  60 is also very divisible with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. </p>
<p>60 and 12 aren't random numbers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, people are making a number of mistakes. . . . Not that any one is going to read this.</p>
<p>Babylonians calculated in a base 60 system and was the first position system, but only had signes for 10 and 1. So to write 12 you wrote 1x10 and 2x1. A number like 94 would be written as 1x1 in the space for 60’s and then 3x10 and 4x1 in the place for 1’s.</p>
<p>After their base 60, they enjoyed putting things in multiples of 6. So a cirkle is 6x60 degrees. There is 4x6x60x60 second in a day and so on. </p>
<p>Enjoying putting things in multiples of 6 might seem strange, but there is several good reasons for it. First of it is easy to calculate with. 6 and 12 are easy numbers to calculate with, but it also come naturally from their base system. Remember that they only have signs for 1 and 10, so to them 60= 6x10.</p>
<p>It is an interresting system, because when you start using the sign you realise that it is easy to multiply and divide by 10 and 5, not something we would expect from a base 60 system that enjoys working in multiplies of 6.</p>
<p>I could write a novel about the number system, but everybody looks at it and goes “base 12 is easy to calculate in” without realising that there is really no proper base 12 going on and the things that they think are easy in the system, properly are not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Base' means 'this number of digits'. Base 10 has 0-9. Binary which is Base 2 has 0 and 1. The point of this is that it tells you when you're going to overflow and require a second digit. </p>
<p>A Base 60 number system would require 60 different symbols/names to represent 60 unique digits. This would be hideously unweildy, even in modern time the largest Base system used commonly is Hexadecimal which is 16 digits (0-9 and then A-F)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While they did like 12 base systems, the Egyptian actually structured 10 hour days 2 hours for each twilight. Then night was divided into 12 hours. They would look for 12 different stars throughout the night to tell the time. As seasons have different lengths of daylight vs nighttime hours were different lengths during different season.</p>
<p>The Babylonians did influence the 60 minute hours though it wasn't until the Greeks that that we started to measure minutes/hours like this. It still wouldn't be until the invention of the mechanical clock that the every day person would have fixed hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did do east on top, Egypt also had south on top on some maps as did China and Arab. </p>
<p>There is a theory that the compass changed the direction of the map, but the arrow on the compass could point south just as easily.</p>
<p>So it's probably more likely that the compass and Europe influence in the last few hundred years put the north on top.</p></div>		</li>
