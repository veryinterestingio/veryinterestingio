			<div class="markdown"><p>This was true in the days before computers. However, with modern computers, transactions can be done in seconds. See the modern apps on your phone, where you wire money from one person to another. </p>
<p>The actual reason is that banks reserve your money in a giant account of themselves. By keeping it for a few days, they create a giant buffer that they can use to pay for the transaction itself and lend that money to other parties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of those examples of &quot;don't assume nefarious intent when simply incompetence will suffice.&quot;</p>
<p>The Automatic Clearing House system, which is what OP mentions, took decades to negotiate between banks. Just about any bank has veto power over changes. It was invented in the day before computers, when batching transactions at end of day was more efficient.</p>
<p>However, just because we can now do things better with computers, doesn't mean that banks want to. They can't agree on the right inter-bank electronic standard, everyone can veto everyone else's proposal, and so we're stuck with the previously agreed 50 year old &quot;free&quot; ACH system for now.</p>
<p>In other countries, national governments have stepped in and mandated a shift to instant transactions, with a standard. But in the US, we leave it to the private market, which refuses to agree on a consensus. Instead, it's a balkanized set of individually negotiated and often wildly differing fees between a kaleidoscope of middle-men.</p>
<p>Those apps you're mentioning like Venmo, for example, are not actually doing instant transactions. They are faking it by effectively floating credit to the recipient for the time it takes for the actual bank to bank ACH transaction to happen in the background. Which is why there's usually also yet another fee associated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Purchase or refund, the bank immediately debits the account of the party that owes the money. </p>
<p>For a couple of days, the money is neither with your or the seller. They use it in their global liquidity pool - since they're not paying any interest on it it's a like zero-cost loan. They place it overnight for a few percentage points. Do this over billions of dollars and it adds up. A free profit for the bank.</p>
<p>The reason it takes longer to refund than to pay, is that your vendor (and not the bank) is taking their sweet time and using your money as a &quot;zero-cost&quot; loan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. The banks run on systems that are most likely older than you are, literally built in the 70's. These systems are not real time and process transactions at certain times in the day. The apps on your phone that do the fast transactions do not run on the same system and they work with a floating pool of money that lets them instantly transfer the money and do a batch transfer on the back end when they need to. They're basically faking the transaction and effectively make really short term loans.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive" target="_blank">Not in Europe they don’t</a>. When I transfer money from my account at bank A to my account at bank B, I actually get a push notification from bank B’s app that there was a deposit before bank A’s app has loaded the ‘order sent’ screen. </p>
<p>Even better, I can view my balance at bank B in the app for bank A (and vice versa) due to interoperability regulation. It takes about 3 button presses to authorize it and it Just Works. Press ‘add account from other bank’ button, select bank, app for other bank opens, I click ‘authorize’. Done.</p>
<p>Banking in the US is in the stone age.</p></div>		</li>
