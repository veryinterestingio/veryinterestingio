			<div class="markdown"><p>The ice cream machine is a robot designed to clean itself because humans were bad at getting all the bacteria out of the thing every night (worked crew in high school in the 80s and did this. So. Many. O-rings.)</p>
<p>The new machine self pasteurizes the internals by heating everything up to the bacteria killing temp. It takes 4 hours to go up and then back down to ice cream making  temp.</p>
<p>The humans failed <em>that</em> because someone set the clock wrong and it’s doing it at 2-6 pm instead of 2-6am.</p>
<p>Stupid humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer and should be at the top. </p>
<p>Microwave - That's a robot. Microwave with preset times for burger patties - specialized robot. </p>
<p>I think what OP might be asking is, why is there no end-to-end automation. Such as, why can't I walk into a restaurant. Click a touch screen menu, and have an entirely automated cooking process, from refrigerator to plate?</p>
<p>Well we are getting there: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfMZfxgbuCw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfMZfxgbuCw</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a bit of a stretch. Is a fry pan a robot? Perhaps a microwave has a turntable and a timer, but by most definitions, a robot would be perceived as something with mechanical movements that can manipulate objects.</p>
<p>If it had an autonomous door, and a mechanical way of inserting or removing food from itself, then you might call it a robot microwave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Robots are machines, but not every automated programmable machine is a robot.</p>
<p>These machines aren't robots by industrial standards. In manufacturing, robot refers to the mostly arm shaped industrial robots, they're distinct from other machines because they can move in 3 or more axis.</p></div>		</li>
