			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you tell me why you wish you were diagnosed earlier?  My son was diagnosed at 2 and a half (he’s 4 now) and seems to be quite high functioning. He’s very smart and has taken very well to early interventions and therapy. I don’t know when to tell him, how to tell him, if I tell him...I just would love a bit of insight into your thoughts about it, if you have time and would like to share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety. The single striking mark of autism in my life is anxiety, even as a child. Not knowing what comes next is difficult to deal with. I grew up very poor in a small house in Dublin. </p>
<p>Starting in my late 20s early 30s I started to drink alcohol a lot. I was using it as a way to calm my anxiety. By the time I was 40 I was a full-blown alcoholic. I beat that twice, and life would’ve been a lot easier if I had know the anxiety I was unconsciously suppressing, that was tearing me apart, wasn’t my fault. I was very hard on myself for not being able to do what the other kids did, like go into a room with 10 people in it. Walk into a store and buy some thing from the clerk behind the desk. Travel anywhere without major life planning in advance and god forbid if I’m late for anything !! Also if I don’t travel the same route to work every day and leave work at the same time every day I get very, difficult. </p>
<p>I wish I had not spent years thinking I was a bad person who was not good at being around other people. I’m alone in my life aside from my wife who is my constant companion and she my way of interacting with the world. Life didn’t have to be that way. I didn’t have to go through that self recrimination alone with no knowledge of what was actually going on with me. It’s been a blessed relief to give myself a break once in a while. I’m not a bad person who has trouble interacting with people, I’m an okay person who works really hard at being a good person, does that make sense ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m six years younger than /u/Oh_god_not_you, but I’m another high functioning adult who wishes they were diagnosed earlier. There are a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>One, I knew something was wrong with my social skills, I knew I liked to fidget (stim) with objects, and I knew my sensory calibration was different than most people’s (over sensitive to some stimuli, under sensitive to others). I got bullied in school because my social skills weren’t quite right. It would have been really nice to have a name for what was up with me- why I was quirky and couldn’t fit in even if I tried. </p>
<p>I figured out some strategies to compensate for some of the things I had trouble with. For example, I learned to make eye contact without staring because I knew that people expected that, although the only information I get from it is the person’s eye color. I learned to be discreet when I stim in public. But it took me a long time to learn those things. They do social skills training with autistic kids- if I had had that, I might have learned those skills earlier and more easily. There are accommodations that teachers and families can make for autistic people, but my parents and teachers had no idea that those existed or that I could have benefited from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow yeah that’s a big deal for sure, eye contact. I’m 6’3” 250lbs with a 61” chest. I’m physically intimidating and TOTALLY incapable of looking another human in the eye lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found out recently and am in my later twenties. I do quite well overall, get along with people, am social, learn easily... but i still wish i found out way earlier, because i have always felt different than my peers and all the mechanisms i learned to lead a &quot;normal&quot; live, to fit in at least a bit, take loads of my energie daily. It would have been so much easier if i had known why i felt different, why i tire easily. Then i could have taken measures to not get tired so much that i just break down, because i didn't know what made me so tired. I think it is important to tell your son in a few years and let him know, being different is not bad. Look at the positive sides of having autism. There definitely are. I'm good with rules, punctuality, good at stressfull, emotional situation and so on...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. My son is amazing. He’s handsome and loves people. He loves to help and be involved. He needs to be explicitly taught how to handle most situations, but he’s so bright and picks everything up so quickly. Socially, I can see him having issues because he’s so impulsive and pushy. He can come on VERY strong and many kids get skittish around him because he struggles with taking turns and staying focused. I am seeing the importance of letting him know when he becomes a bit older and more socially aware.  It makes me sick to my stomach to think that other kids will...I don’t want to say “bully” him...I just want him to be happy and loved by more than family.</p></div>		</li>
