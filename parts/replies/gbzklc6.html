			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem; if you're really curious about insects in general and want a great book to dig into, I'd recommend checking out <em>Innumerable Insects: The Story of the Most Diverse and Myriad Animals on Earth</em>. It's a nice mix of really beautiful illustrations and interesting information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly are you talking about when you say disturbed? Like the weather warms up and wakes them? While it varies, of course, most insects can just go right back to the suspended state. I once found some bugs on the wall of an unheated storage room and when I shined a flashlight on them they slowly starting moving again, just from the heat of the flashlight bulb. As soon as I removed the heat source they went right back to their &quot;frozen&quot; state. </p>
<p>It's really only a big problem if it's warm enough to get them fully awake and flying around long enough to exhaust their energy reserves but there aren't sufficient resources for them to stock up again before going back into the torpor state for the rest of the winter/early spring.</p></div>		</li>
