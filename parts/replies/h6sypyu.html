			<div class="markdown"><p>I read about an experiment once, but I don't remember the outcome. Maybe you should try: fart in a glass jar, then smell it after some time. Is it still &quot;yours&quot;? </p>
<p>If yes, next level: two jars, your fart and your gf's fart. Can you tell which one is yours?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I spent a bit of time thinking about the most effective way to fart in a jar. I've never tested it, but I determined that the best way to collect pure, undiluted fart is to do so in a bathtub. Fill up your jar with water to remove any air, then turn it upside down to collect your fart bubbles. Repeat until all water has been displaced!</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my friend's main parenting approach at the moment. He has two rowdy boys that have quickly become immune to any and every parental threat. Their dad occasionally makes a huge deal about how he's working up to an Epic fart (to his sons' endless amusement), and when it's finally time, he makes it a point to fart it straight into a jar as loudly and disgustingly as possible in front of them (to his sons' amusement that's now becoming tinged with worry). </p>
<p>Then he tells them point blank, dead-eyed serious that the next time he has to punish them, he's gonna make them smell the fart jar. </p>
<p>4 months and no serious behavior issues so far, and he hasn't even had to follow through on the threat.</p>
<p>EDIT: 9/10 would fart into jar again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first, but it developed in the first place because of the second (when you were a child putting everything in your mouth and exploring, figuring out causality and developing a sense of self)</p>
<p>Most people recognise scents like memories, so some are a little flawed on the specifics on the  playback but it's mostly all there. Some smells stick in there stronger than others based on level of impact it had and repetition</p></div>		</li>
