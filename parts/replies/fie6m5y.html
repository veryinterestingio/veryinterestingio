			<div class="markdown"><p>Waste chemicals such as Ammonia, Phosphates, Creatinine, Bilirubin byproducts, drugs etc are mainly excreted in urine. This is because the intestines and stomach are a largely one-way system, there isn't a path for toxins in our blood circulation to actually get into the feces.</p>
<p>Comparably, it is much easier to simply filtrate the liquid for things the body wants to keep and then dispose of it. Thus, feces is a bacterial hazard, not a chemical one - unless you've been eating toxins that get stuck in the gastrointestinal tract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do you get this information about bilirubin? I've understood that bilirubin specifically is excreted mainly via the liver-bile-intestine-feces route. Or do you mean something else by bilirubin byproducts?</p></div>		</li>
