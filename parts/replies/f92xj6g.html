			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to be vague, as I'm not in a position to look anything up (hence the vague age range on the comment above), but this experiment was just done with photos of chimps, and they tested babies at a couple of different age ranges and saw the ability to recognize decrease as they aged.  I don't believe anyone has done a follow up to see if you can retain it, but it's possible that it could work that way.  </p>
<p>We go through a process called perceptual narrowing when we learn language that occurs at a similar time (the face thing is another example of perceptual narrowing, but less explored experimentally).  Very young babies can hear the phonemes for every language, but around 6 months or so, they start to specialize in the language they are surrounded by.  This makes them better able to pick up on the language they know, but makes it impossible to discern some sounds from other languages.  This is part of the reason we have accents when we learn a new language, because we actually cannot hear where we are going wrong sometimes.  If babies hear multiple languages very regularly from early on, they can hear the phonemes from each of these.  So, its possible that the perceptual narrowing could be broadened with chimp faces, but I don't think anyone has tested it experimentally.</p>
<p>(pro-tip- don't let your baby go near live chimps).</p></div>		</li>

Chimps can also recognize each other's behinds like we reconize faces.</p></div>		</li>
