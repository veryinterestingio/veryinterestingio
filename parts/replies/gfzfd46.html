<p>So does that mean once you're on the transplant list, you're going to be coming back roughly once every decade for a new (whatever organ) or else presumaby die without it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad had his mother's kidney for almost 40 years. Granted the last 2-3 years of that it's functionality was 0% and it was degrading for 5-7 years before that (though still functional), but 10 years is not the cap on it.</p>
<p>He did need a new donation, but due to other health issues he couldn't get one and died.</p>
<p>However, as a child I remember being scared that when my grandma died he'd die, because the kidney would give out. My parents exlained that's not true, even in the slightest. She died when I was 15 and he died when I was 26.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many factors taken into consideration for transplant, age is just one of them.  If a child is healthy enough to survive the procedure there's no reason for them to not have repeated surgeries to keep them alive until they're very old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone that was placed on the transplant list as a teenager, you know going into the process that you will need to repeat the process. Many factors go into deciding if you are a good candidate for transplant. And when it comes to entering the process the second time, they hugely take into account how you treated the first process. I.E. keeping up with your meds, doctor’s appointments, lifestyle choices. If you make poor lifestyle decisions or don’t keep up with your meds or ignore your doctors appointments, there is a very very good chance you will be denied a second transplant. However, if you were responsible with the first organ, and none of the other factors that they take into account have changed, there is no reason you will be denied transplant.</p>
<p>As I received a transplant decently young, I was told to expect to repeat the process between 3-5 times throughout my life. There’s not really a “once you reach this age, no more.” They essentially will look at how your body will react to surgery and what your outlook will look with a transplant. If your too high risk for surgery or other factors that will result in the transplant not being effective, they won’t do it. </p>
<p>Also, not all transplanted organs are equal. They are graded on a percentile scale of 1-100. When you are younger and need one to last a long time, they will give you a top percentile organ that is super low risk and from a very healthy donor. So like top 25%. When you are older, they will tend to offer you more higher risk kidneys that won’t last as long. Typically 26-75%. The lowest percentile are typically too high risk. Typically people that have led an erratic lifestyle and could have been potentially exposed to serious diseases such as HIV. They tend to not offer them to people that they don’t expect to live longer than a few years. It’s basically a just buying you a few more years with your grandkids organ.</p></div>		</li>
