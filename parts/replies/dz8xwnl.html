			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a hard time believing it was all from the vitiligo. MJ went from having 0 blotches on visible parts of his skin, to be entirely white. I've seen vitiligo spread to cover their entire body, but there are usually still blotches of their old skin color. His skin seemed flawless, at first st least. And then you see his kids who look nothing like their cousins.</p>
<p>You can't tell me there isnt something fishy there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re probably thinking of tinea versicolor! It’s a common skin infection that doesn’t usually itch or hurt, and often makes the skin look paler than the surrounding skin. It’s more common in warm, humid summer months, so many people just think it’s where they’ve peeled from a sunburn.

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be slightly more accurate-- </p>
<p>Vitiligo is not a lack of melanin pigment, it's actually one step further and an autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. </p></div>		</li>
