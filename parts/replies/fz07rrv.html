			<div class="markdown"><p>So holy days (such as days of festivals) for Hindus does depend entirely on the lunar calendar (or whatever calendar tithis are based on), however it would be incorrect to say days of the week don't matter. People do worship particular deity/God on a particular day of the week on top of worshiping the particular planet whom the day &quot;belongs&quot; to. For example people worship Shani/Saturn on Shanivar/Saturday, in addition to Hanuman and probably others. Same goes for other days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by much newer? Hinduism is of course practiced very differently in various regions of South Asia and even amongst different communities in the same region. It's possible we have encountered different flavors of it.</p></div>		</li>
