			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermal depolymerization does look similar to hydrothermal liquefaction - liquid conversion environment, around 350 C. I see that some of the early work in TDP used shale. In our experience, biotechnologies are costly to scale and commercialize. Having additional drivers, such as ecological and economic liabilities, help drive innovation and commercialization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, but this answer doesn't really explain what the differences are between then and now. What are those ecological or economic drivers that you have in mind? Is the idea that the time is right this time around because you expect, for instance, governments to institute carbon taxes or similar that will make your product more economically viable by comparison? Is there somewhere you think the TDP people went wrong that you can avoid? Or is your process simply different enough technically that it sidesteps some of those concerns?</p>
<p>I think you're getting this question a lot because the idea of turning waste into oil is really exciting, but we've been burned by hope before when realities hadn't been thought through or were too sensitive to specific, non-permanent situations. I want to believe, but I also want to understand whether this is something that (right now) works as a tech demo in a lab or something that is a real, scalable process that could plausibly make an impact on society in the next handful of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One always works in the shadow of what came before and the impressive ramp-up of capital and ingenuity that has often led to disappointment. The case history is complex for any project and includes both technical and logistical miscalculations. My understanding with CWT and turkey offal is that it was lipid-centric and there is only so much fat to go around at a specific price. I think that by using the condensed phase of water, avoiding catalysts, and focusing on whole biomass conversion (lipids, protein, and carbs), some of the risk is mitigated. The ecological drivers are that sludge, food, and biosolids disposal is costly and may become more costly if/when regulated for PFAS and other trace organics. The hauling distance (requiring fuel/energy) is increasing for some metro areas to find land for land application, for instance. Some states have organics diversion rules for landfills that make food waste and lawn trimmings no longer accepted at the local landfill, and now an environmental liability and economic opportunity for thermal conversion. We view the remaining challenges as consequential but not insurmountable.</p></div>		</li>
