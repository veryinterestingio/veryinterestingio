			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but in this sub it's really just a figure of speech meaning &quot;keep it clear and simple.&quot; Lots of questions simply aren't possible to bring down to a true 5yo level with any satisfaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but even then some of these answers are far more complicated than is understandable for the layman. I have a degree in a Stem field and am a beginner in Python and even I had a difficult time understanding most of the responses to this post</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the question is about the intricacies of one of man’s greatest and most complex technological achievements. There’s not gonna be a proper eli5 on this one other than “yup, that’s right bud. It’s another language.” But, that doesn’t really help OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making the first programming language was certainly no easy task, but I wouldn’t say it was anything that daunting. I will say that if you were to try to write a full desktop application today in assembly or binary, <em>that</em> would feel like making a hammer by assembling molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. I think the good thing is that OP seems to have got some insight so that’s a win! Everyone should have a base level of knowledge in this area (I think). I just really liked the tool analogy. If could be weaved into the top post to better explain what “low level” means I think many more people would understand. Cheers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just thought of another analogy based on yours. If binary is the idea of rubbing two sticks together, and hex is using a bow to start a fire, then assembly would be the lighter. Maybe C is the torch that made smelting much easier.</p></div>		</li>
