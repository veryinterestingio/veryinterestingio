<p>When I visited in 2017, I had visited the Manchester, UK science museum 3 weeks earlier. They also have working cotton processing machinery and looms there. Manchester was &quot; the cotton capitol of the world &quot; in the 1800s.</p>
<p>But it was funny to see that virtually identical machines were made and patented by Toyoda a few years after the same machines were invented in Manchester... üßê</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. I'll admit my global cotton history is lacking. They also showed how they basically took a Chrysler (i believe) to model their first car after. I think there was some patent sharing or something. I don't  think Chrysler had much interest in the Japanese car market almost a hundred years ago.</p></div>		</li>
