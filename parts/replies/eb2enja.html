			<div class="markdown"><p>By the 1960s the question of having enough material was not an issue (the US and Russia have huge excesses of high enriched uranium and separated plutonium â€” the US, for example, has 80.8 tons of military-grade plutonium today, which is enough for over 13,000 Nagasaki-style weapons, and it has 574.5 tons of highly-enriched uranium). The variance of fissile material with yield is not very much; the 10 Mt Ivy Mike device, for example, probably had less than 30 kg of plutonium in it between the primary and the sparkplug (the big bang came from deuterium fusion and the fissioning of a large, cheap, natural uranium tamper). </p>
<p>The real reason they ended up going for &quot;compact&quot; weapons (they are not &quot;small&quot; per say, with yields in the range of 100-500 kt, they are still many times more powerful than the weapons used in WWII, even if they are smaller than the multi-megaton monsters of the Cold War) is because that's where you get the best &quot;sweet spot&quot; in terms of volume and mass. With relatively compact volumes and mass, you can put many of them onto one missile (MIRVing) or you can do other creative things with the delivery vehicle (e.g., a cruise missile). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right... So you might say smaller arms provide a better return on investment as far as destructive capability is concerned with a more efficient bomb...</p>
<p>Hence the 'more bang for your buck'. Easier to transport, more versatile, and still sufficiently powerful without the diminishing returns of an enormous bomb. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For IxBM delivery, I'd state that as:</p>
<ul>
<li>CEP values for modern reentry vehicles (and their boosters) is much better.  Under 100m (or thereabouts) instead of 2-10km.  The more accurate you are, the more likely to impact really close to the target and the less overkill you need.</li>
<li>A dispersal pattern of seven (or more) smaller devices (equidistant from each other) produces more damage along the ground then a single larger nuke.  The big nuke just isn't as efficient at putting its energy into destroying things on the ground instead of moving atmosphere around.</li>
<li>Cost (smaller packages cost less to launch).</li>
