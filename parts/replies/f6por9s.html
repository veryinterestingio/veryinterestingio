<p>So if you've just come inside on a cold winters day your skin will not be 37 degrees it will be colder, and if you immerse your hand in water that is 37 degrees it will feel warm. The reverse would be true in summer.</p>

<p>It would still feel warm in summer, because the skin temperature would still be below 37 degrees C. That's the only way to keep heat flowing out of the body.</p></div>		</li>

I'd imagine that touching ~30 degree metal would feel warmish if you've just been in the snow without gloves, even if your body temp is still 37</p></div>		</li>
