			<div class="markdown"><p>It will make them loose and then you'll have very short spaghetti that are not as good for the original purpose: if your recipe requires long strands of pasta, you can't use shredded spaghetti for it and there is really no simple, economical way to put them back together so you'll be better off cooking a fresh batch of spaghetti than even trying it.</p>
<p>OP was probably referring to linear polymer molecules, which are indeed long strands of repeated &quot;units&quot; (simpler molecules, called &quot;monomers&quot;) chemically linked between them, with the long strands forming some plastic material. You can make them loose by heating them or by using solvents, and then form them back together in a new shape, but you must understand OP's spaghetti bowl analogy was made at a molecular scale, not at a human scale: you can shred molecules and then they'll form a material with different physical properties (probably inferior) from the starting one, or you can shred the material, with way lesser impact on the single molecules, which is only good if it is indeed made of long strands on a molecular level and you can actually reflow them because they are not strongly bonded between them - some % of the molecules are still bound to be broken by the process though, meaning you can't recycle them indefinitely and that the recycled material will be slightly inferior to the original one (often requiring being mixed with some freshly made material to cover for that).</p>
<p>To give you the exact scale, you'll need 6.02x10^23 single long-strand molecules to have about 192g of PET - the plastic used, for example, to make bottles... That's a really big bowl of spaghetti if converted to a human scale with real spaghetti instead of molecules.</p></div>		</li>

<p>OP didnâ€™t ask about an economical way. He asked if it would be possible if money was no object?</p>
