			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer, this might sound stupid but when it comes to non-essential organs, can you cut around it, like you don't just cut out the tumor but you cut a chunk of the organ as well to make sure you go it all.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also if the cancerous cells don't spread to other organs, you wouldn't die from cancer no matter how big the tumor was in those non-essential areas, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some cancers are amenable to resection while others are less so - even in the same organ.  e.g. Small cell versus non-small cell lung cancers.  Traditionally small cell lung cancer was not resected because of its likelihood of it being widely metastatic by the time it was discovered.  </p>
<p>Death happens because of the spread from a non-vital organ to other vital parts - and this will always happen with cancer if left unchecked.  Certain cancers have a propensity to spread certain organs.  Breast cancer for instance commonly spreads to bone, brain, liver and lung.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the first answer, that's exactly what we do. They remove the tissue around the cancer (called margins) and will oftentimes test that while the patient is in the middle of the operation. They get results within minutes. If the margins are negative (no cancer), then they'll finish. Otherwise, they'll cut some more and test the margins again until they get a negative report. That way they got all of the tumor out.</p>
<p>For the second part, theoretically, sure. (Side note: no matter where the cancer is, if it keeps getting bigger and pushes on other organs, it'll eventually create problems) However, it's REALLY hard for the cancer to not spread, so it's not as simple as that. I've seen patients with melanomas get resections with negative margins, and then they have metastasis to the brain years later that are confirmed to be the same original melanoma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The above is pretty standard practice in cancer removal surgery, yep.</p>
<p>Even if the tumor doesn't spread, it can still cut off circulation, apply pressure to nerves or release excessive amounts of some chemical. For example, you don't technically <em>need</em> all of your lymph nodes, but if you get lymphoma it can result in your limbs swelling up because your lymphatic vessels get blocked by the tumor or in anemia because your old worn out blood cells aren't getting recycled properly.</p></div>		</li>
