			<div class="markdown"><p>To emphasize why we know why the math works: mathematical rules hold up in real life tests that can be predicted and measured. Whether this is working out problems with different variables and getting consistent answers, performing physical experiments, or producing algorithms that produce the solutions that are needed consistently. </p>
<p>As you said, the numbers and symbols and equations are just abstract, often arbitrary, methods of communicating these concepts.</p>
<p>A good example of the arbitrariness of some of the depictions of scientific concepts is the negative charge of the electron. Many people in STEM agree that it would have been much easier to navigate the equations if electrons were considered positive instead. It was just arbitrarily assigned a value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's a bit lengthy but I just wanted to give an overview in case anyone's interested, and for my own enjoyment. One of the things I love about set theory especially is that you see a lot of... allegories I suppose, for philosophical notions. Though the math itself stands for itself also.</p>
<p>I probably should have left a quick note about complex numbers as well: they're simply scaled rotations of the plane, and there's nothing &quot;imaginary&quot; about rotations at all. I wish I could say I realized that earlier in school, but our teachers didn't emphasize the simple geometric connection there. One of the few things I liked about the high school I taught at was their emphasis on transformations and isometries in the plane, which will hopefully inspire more students to delve into complex analysis, or at least give them some motivation for the use of i.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it isn't, maths is only a &quot;truth&quot; in the sense that the axioms we use do not allow for contradiction of themselves. This makes them inherently &quot;true&quot; to themselves. However we have no way of knowing whether the axioms themselves are correct, that's why they are called axioms in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
