			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that animal breeders have already made designer pets - think every breed of dog on earth. All derived from their ancestor the wolf! The traits you allude to e.g. a cat that looks like a tiger are characteristics that are controlled by many genes - think thousands - they are called quantitative or complex traits. To date editing has mostly been used to alter one or two genes for simple or qualitative traits - like polled (hornlessness). We are a long way from understanding the molecular basis of quantitative traits, let alone knowing how to edit them to achieve a desired outcome. The discussions around the morality of editing of an animal's genome are done in the context of animal breeding and the naturally occurring editing (also known as evolution) done by nature. This genetic variation is actually the basis of all livestock breeding programs and is what breeders select when identifying superior parents for the next generation. I always look at the reason for edits, and the tradeoffs of not allowing the use of the technology. For example, if we could develop an animal resistant to a particular disease - how would that help address the disease problem, and if editing was not used what are alternative solutions to the problem, and which solution provides the optimal outcome? In the case of disease  I believe genetics is a powerful tool - and a better outcome than having sick animals that either die or need to be treated with medications to survive. There is a really nice example of the PRRSV-resistant pigs - see here <a href="https://www.drovers.com/article/prrs-resistant-pigs-industry-game-changer" target="_blank">https://www.drovers.com/article/prrs-resistant-pigs-industry-game-changer</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you gene edit the cats to reach sexual maturity much faster which would greatly increase the speed at which we can breed them then after switch change it back,.. okay even I can see how that's a little messed up nevermind</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are gonna have to alter a great deal of traits because it is not a binary characteristic. It will depend on multiple genes, hormones, cellular development and coordination, all factors coming together to make the cat reproductively mature in less time than current breeds. Technically, you could; in fact you could with any species.</p></div>		</li>
