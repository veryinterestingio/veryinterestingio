			<div class="markdown"><p>3000 K has a significant fraction of visible light plus a lot of infrared. When dim enough it appears red (e.g. when you look at a star with that temperature - Antares has 3700 K and looks red), but if you are inside it would appear white as it would saturate all your receptors in the eye. It would also cook your eye, and the rest of your body.</p></div>		</li>
