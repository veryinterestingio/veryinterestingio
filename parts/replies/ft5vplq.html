<p>If dI/dT = 2I where I is infections and T is time then following the general formula for exponential functions from differential equations (which is I = +-Ce^kT) then we’d get I = e^2T (I believe we can ignore absolute values as you cannot have negative infections?). This is an important distinction to make as with the coronavirus there is not a uniform infection rate therefore the it’s very hard to model with a given constant of proportionality. Further, if k is lower than 1 then it will decrease the rate of spread significantly. This also reduces the likelihood of “occasionally experiencing major outbreaks” especially if the majority of the population has a relatively low R0 while approx. 10% appear to have a far higher which appears to be the case at the moment.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: while it’s possible the disease can last forever and occasionally flare up, that’s actually  very unlikely and exponential growth is not as scary as it is sometimes portrayed as when you factor in the constraining factors of the real world outside of a whiteboard.</p></div>		</li>
