			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, for further reading, OP can look up numeric methods. One of my favorites is approximation of integrals by literally evaluating the function at every point separated by an interval h small enough that the solution is basically the same. Then the integral turns into a huge addition which computers love.<br />
There's methods like these for super complicated stuff like differential equations and it's amazing how they turn it into additions and multiplications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super interesting stuff. If you like math and numbers, check out this page if you’ve never heard of this before. I just stumbled on it from the clay tablet and my mind is absolutely blown. Who knew geometry was invented by counting knuckles and the imperial system makes sense? </p>

<p>Regarding geometry, it's fascinating how pythagoras, euclides, etc developed all of that without algebra or written numbers as we know them. It was all line segments and arcs, done with a straight edge and a compass.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I mean that's also a way to <em>define</em> integrals (by taking the limit when h goes to 0, you get the definition of Riemann integrals), so it's more than just a numeric method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's the simplest example I could explain in a reddit comment lol I'm not gonna explain runge kutta </p>
<p>I see what you're saying, and my example was maybe a poor one, but the point was that most of these very complex issues are broken down to additions and multiplications</p></div>		</li>
