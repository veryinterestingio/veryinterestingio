			<div class="markdown"><p>So the ELI5 is that you start off as a blank slate, and by default you will develop into a female unless specifically told to develop into a male. Female is the default, male is a variant applying to roughly 50% of cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, but not really. Depends on how you want to define male or female. Chromosomes or genitalia.</p>
<p>If you have XY chromosomes but the SRY gene doesn't activate, or is missing on the Y chromosome, you will develop female external genitalia, but you won't have functioning ovaries, or a uterus without hormonal therapy. And without that hormonal therapy you won't experience puberty at all either. </p>
<p>You end up with non-functioning gonads entirely that are almost always surgically removed due to a highly increased risk of cancer. So they can't produce estrogen <em>or</em> testosterone. The breasts and uterus will not grow until given supplemental estrogen, menstruation will require supplemental progestin to regulate, the individual cannot produce eggs and cannot get pregnant.</p>
<p>It's called Swyer syndrome or XY gonadal dysgenisis. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_gonadal_dysgenesis" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY\_gonadal\_dysgenesis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY\_gonadal\_dysgenesis</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can i ask why you wont become functionally female as well? why wont protogonads develop into ovaries, mullerian ducts survive and develop into oviducts etc. I was under the impression that testosterone startkicks towards male, and without SRY that kick would never happen. What is functional difference between XX normal female and XY(SRY KO) &quot;male&quot;? Are extra copies on X needed for full functional female?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related, Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.</p>
<p>Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man.</p>
<p>A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus. They have very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics (such as breasts) develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. People with AIS are permanently insensitive to androgens. They will always be women with internal testes and a vagina that ends in a “blind” tunnel: i.e. no cervix or uterus/womb.</p></div>		</li>
