			<div class="markdown"><p>But perhaps birds have a specific feature that allows them to talk too, no? And the it's no longer a question of &quot;why do we have x when no one else has it&quot;, but &quot;why do we have x for y purpose, when birds have z for the same purpose&quot;, which is easily explained that evolution can follow multiple paths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is representative of convergent evolution, where similar features evolve independently from one another but effectively do the same thing. For instance eyes have evolved seperately atleast 50 different times. Birds don't have the same control over sounds as we do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some seem to have far more control than us though. Like some birds can perfectly mimic the sound of chain saws and unnatural sounding heavy machinery, whereas humans aren't great at that sort of thing.</p></div>		</li>
