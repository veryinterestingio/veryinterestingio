			<div class="markdown"><p>Takes about 30-60 seconds for jugular vein compression to have any real impact on neurophysiology. Relative to the G-forces sustained on head-to-head contact, this mechanism could prove much less dangerous. </p>
<p>That said, humans weren't built with the notion of &quot;briefly use the blood pressure in the head as a buffer against collision damage&quot; so it's hard to say what long-term effects the short-term increase in intracranial pressure could have. Could cause strokes, microvascular damage, etc. But we already know head-to-head contact in sports causes those things, so it seems like a good dice roll.</p></div>		</li>
