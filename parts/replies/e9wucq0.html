			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great response - I wanted to add that polymeric superacids include perfluorinated sulfonic acids (e.g. Nafion(R), 3Mion, Aquivion) that make fuel cells, chlor-alkali systems, other electrolyzers/salt-splitters, and some solid-state batteries function. There are also hydrocarbon equivalents, e.g. sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) sPEEK.</p></div>		</li>
