<p>Without good bow sonar, any boat is more or less useless; so the bow must be designed to efficiently and quietly cut through the water, withstand the pressure at depth, <del>survive hitting a seamount at a flank bell</del>, and interfere minimally with that sonar array.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like, just make it tad longer. Oceans got space</p></div>		</li>

<p>You could build on a cosmetic outer shell, but that brings you to the main point:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact is that submarines do use an outer non-pressure shell. Although it is not cosmetic.</p>
<p>For example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_submarine_disaster" target="_blank">Kursk</a> had an inside pressure hull of 50 millimetre steel, and an outside hull of 8 millimetre, that determines the shape. The space in between was filled with for example rubber to dampen noise.</p>
<p>Apparently the contemporary design strategy of western subs is less inside-outside hull strategy, but they also build some shell parts that are only there for the shape - and not for the pressure hull.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their hull shapes are the end result of immense amounts of design work  and testing to produce the quietest ship possible, and a rounded hull  that slips smoothly and <em>quietly</em> through the water must presumably be the best way to go. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quiet ship is mostly a silent ship. If the shape optimally glides through the water and disturbs it minimally, it is likely to also be a fast shape.</p></div>		</li>
