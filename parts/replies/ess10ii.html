<p>The merit of Einstein was realizing that those abstract non-Euclidean spaces were real.</p>

<p>Einy talks about it in his GR and SR pub for the layman. What is 'true?' he writes about. Parallel lines not intersecting, is this 'true'? Show me! It's a mathematical concept but no one can show it in nature; the reality of infinitly long lines not intersecting. Again, we maybe intuit it, but is there any such evidence of it being PYSICALLY 'real'?! Funny thing is when I think about it and compare it to musical notes and infinite sines and how I mentally bridge the gap. Here Einy bothered to ask if there was a better way. Whether geometrically one could mathematically abscond with the mental bridge and direcly 'engineer' the bridge with mathematics. Alas, there was.  </p>
<p>Finally, I actually hate his and many other math notations but until I come up with an overarching impact that trumps them all I have to keep pandering to the audience ;)</p></div>		</li>
