			<div class="markdown"><p>Even so, most insurance companies would rather just admit liability and get it over with than waste years worth of man hours defending a claim that they're ultimately found liable for it in the long run. In fact I know some people who got discounts for having a dashcam, and that will more or less have been because of how much time it will save when assessing liability for a claim. </p>
<p>Plus from a manufacturing point of view, it makes no difference to the manufacturer whether or not the driver of their car was at fault for the accident. Unless they offer their own insurance (which will likely be underwritten by or even just a brand name for a major insurer) they would have no stake in any RTA. </p>
<p>I've worked in/around motor insurance for just over 5 years now, including around 12 months dealing purely in RTA liability - and every time someone sent dash cam footage in you would breathe a sigh of relief and question why it isn't standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that customer opinion is why it isn't standard. Not everyone wants cameras in their car. Some people would never touch a vehicle that creates evidence that could be used to incriminate yourself. Especially if it records audio as well as video.</p>
<p>(I'm not saying I agree or disagree necessarily, just that that's my guess)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look how long it took GPS or rear view cameras to make it from luxury vehicles to common accessory. The motor industry moves slowly with tech like this because cars aren't disposable electronics.</p>
<p>It will absolutely increase in popularity as time goes on and they nail down reliable, cheap product. You'll be able to turn it off, I'm sure. We have cameras and microphones on everything else, I don't see that being an absolute barrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d assume the reason insurance companies give discounts to those with dashcams is because drivers that have them are usually safe drivers. If there wasn’t a positive correlation between good/safe drivers and dashcams, I doubt there’d be a discount</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. They give discounts for lots of things that dont have to do with driving if it helps their bottom line. Auto pay, paying in full, paperless, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh not they wouldn't why do you think they defend them in the first place? Nothing is stopping them from doing that now. They definitely wouldn't rather do that. The only person that wants that is the guy that doesn't wanna do his job and investigate the company absolutely does hence why they have jobs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because they don't know they're going to lose the case. They don't have footage that they can check to know what actually happened, so both sides have to argue it out and investigate.</p>
<p>You think they <em>like</em> wasting time on cases that end up being decided against them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but it'd save insurance companies a lot of money on investigation and legal work. You'd almost never actually go to trial. There'd also be huge advantages for underwriting if you could reliably tell exactly what mistakes a diver made even when they're not at fault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, it opens drivers to being liable when they otherwise wouldn't. Like if you're going 56mph in 55mph zone, you're technically speeding and if there's a video evidence of that, well then you're screwed even if you were not majorly at fault.</p>
<p>It's a thin line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference between a camera being mandatory and a camera being offered in your car. If the latter and you don’t want it, turn it off. My car has a whole host of safety warnings that I turn off to stop them beeping at me all the time - yes, I can tell there is a car ahead of me that is slowing down, no need to beep at me 15 times a day</p></div>		</li>
