			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate. I got in a car wreck a few months ago, the crunch was horrendous as I was at a complete stop and he hit me going about 50mph. I heard this other really weird high pitched strangled sound and realized after a moment that it was me screaming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your concern! I’m ok, I was pretty confused for a few days and yeah I have some back and neck issues that I’m going to a chiropractor for, but nothing horrible. My car did a freakin fabulous job of protecting me. I loved that car...RIP</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've fallen at work twice, once on my face and split my lip, the second time broke my wrist. Both times, I'm told that I screamed, just once, involuntarily, I didn't know it, didn't hear myself do it. I was quite calm after.  And had lots of help. (I work in Surgery, lots of MDs and RNs.)</p>
<p>I'm with the 'warn others of danger' and 'call for help' side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was sleeping in a hammock once while backpacking, in the early morning I’m woken up by a leaf crunching slowly. I open my eyes and see a large tan mass of fur about 30 years from me and moving up the hill slowly towards me. My brain says predator and a loud guttural scream came from within me, totally out of my control. It was effective because I definitely scared off the large, curious Labrador trying to figure what was hanging in between the trees. The dog’s owners didn’t think it was as funny as I did and they scurried off.</p></div>		</li>
