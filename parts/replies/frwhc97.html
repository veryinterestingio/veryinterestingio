			<div class="markdown"><p>This is genuinely out of curiosity and not a dig at all, so hopefully this doesn’t come across as agressive! I’m playing RDR2 on my vanilla PS4 that I bought for about £250 six years ago. I haven’t invested a penny on repairs/upgrades since and I’m not much of an online gamer. I’m guessing that a £250 computer from 2014 would be an absolute potato these days that wouldn’t be much good for anything beyond web browsing, so how can a PC be better value?</p>
<p>And don’t you need to be constantly spending time and money upgrading hardware and software, whereas my PS4 just occasionally announces it needs to install this particular update it’s automatically downloaded before it carries on playing AAA games or steaming netflix or whatever?</p>
<p>Again I’m here to be educated not to score points!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Upgrading the hardware is less like the PS4 installing and update and more like buying the ps5 when it comes out.</p>
<p>My experience may not be typical for PC gamers, but I only upgrade my hardware every few years. Probably more often than somebody on a console buys the next console, but I definitely spend much less than console money.</p>

<p>Up until last year most of my hardware could probably be dated back to 2014. It wasn't anything to write home aboit, but I never really had any trouble running any of the games I was playing at the time at between normal and high graphics settings, depending on the age of the game</p>
<p>As I'm writing this out, I'm thinking to myself the major advantage I'm thinking of here is incremental hardware upgrades. Every so often you'll have to do a big, expensive upgrade because your system is just too old, but once it's there, you really only need to one or two things every couple of years. (As an example, I'm currently looking into buying a new power supply, but the one that I have now I bought in 2007)</p>
<p>If I could just slide in an edit here, one of my favorite things about PC over console is legacy support. One of my favorite games is Diablo 2 which was published in 2000. I don't have to get out any special hardware or my old PC to run it, my current computer runs it fine. Xbox one I think we have a little trouble running at 20 year old game. It's not like Microsoft out here trying to push &quot;PC 2&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just upgraded my hardware that I installed in 2013 last month, so you're not alone. I also haven't upgraded my GPU since then and can still play new games no problem, although i do have difficulty playing them on the max graphics settings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider that a computer is a general purpose machine that can do many more things. You want to program, get a computer. You want to do graphic design, get a computer. That has a base cost but almost everyone today needs one. You can <em>add</em> functionality to your computer to <em>also</em> play your video games. The premium to upgrade your computer from what you have to being able to play RDR2 at PS4-level settings is less than 250 pounds. It is a matter of adding 100 pounds for a graphics card, 50 for a better cpu, and 25 for a bit more ram. That is the basics of what is necessary. That is how when you look at the totality of a computer, it is a better value.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it, you spent 500 pounds for the ability to play games and do general computation. I am saying you could have done that for about 425 if you had done it all in a computer. And there is also potential synergy when you leverage that increased capability in your general computing tasks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A computer only &quot;loses&quot; performance when you install more demanding software on it. A $250 computer will likely be very close to the PS4's performance, but the benefit to a PC is that you can spend a little more to get a lot better performance. Also as others have already said consoles are made in bulk and sold at a loss to hook people into buying $60 subscriptions for playing online that PC players don't need to pay.</p>
<p>Also you don't constantly need to upgrade your computer unless you want better performance and games get updated more frequently because they don't need to pay Microsoft or Sony thousands of dollars per update.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t want to be rude but a $250 computer from 2014 isn’t going to have a 950 let alone the modded 290X that’s in the PS4 which retailed pretty close to the cost of a PS4 on its own, add an I3 and 8Gb of ram and i don’t see that computer making it to 2020. Even my 980ti has trouble with some modern games (though my I7 4790k could take some of the blame). Building a PC equivalent to a console might be possible but it sure as hell will need at least one console priced upgrade before a console cycle is over, but considering consoles now need console priced upgrade to last 8 years (even if it is just an overclock) my point kinda falls flat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>theres way too many YouTube pc builders that think a number is a number, and leaves it at that. it isnt. There is no way you can build a pc that match a consoles performance for the same price. the console is sold at a loss, its hardware has been optimized to run together, and its software is optimized for the console and its hardware. its just not the same at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question wasn't about software or optimization, that's why I didn't address that completely. You can see the part where I mentioned that all the consoles are effectively the same though so I did very briefly touch on that subject, just didn't want to go too much into it as it was outside of the scope of the question. The fact of the matter though is that the youtubers compare real tests to verify that they are actually capable of matching or exceeding the console's outputs. You are right in that computers and consoles are not the same but that does not mean that they are not comparable.</p></div>		</li>
