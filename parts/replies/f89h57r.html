			<div class="markdown"><p>7mmBR wasn't one I was familiar with. Especially in pistol. I was hoping it would be a hot firing autoloader.</p>
<p>But realized it's seems to solely be pistols with a bolt action on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that the Thompson Contender series also held the 7mm BR.  As a side note, the 30-30 in a TC is an absolute hoot to shoot. You take the powder that’s supposed to burn in maybe 25” and only give it 16” to work. The rest comes out as a beautiful 5’ fireball!!!</p></div>		</li>
