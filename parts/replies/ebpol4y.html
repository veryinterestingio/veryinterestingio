			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially yes, highly concentrated because they compete for the same binding site, if you flood the system with oxygen it will out-compete the CO</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you end up with red blood cells more likely to bind with O2 than CO, but what happens to the CO that isn't able to bind like it would otherwise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The treatment for CO poisoning is high concentration O2 as soon as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the CO level is high enough, typically over 27%  they treat people in a hyperbaric chamber. The increased O2 and pressure clears gasses from the blood much faster than at typical atmospheric pressure. Dive medicine can get pretty interesting if you're into that sort of thing.</p></div>		</li>
