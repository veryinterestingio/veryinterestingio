			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth's average distance from the sun is one Astronomical Unit (A.U.). There are about the same number of A.U. in a light year as there are inches in a mile.
In this 1 inch to 1 astronomical unit scale, our nearest stellar neighbor is about 4 miles away.</p>
<p>How close would a star have to be to wreck our solar system? Passing through our Oort Cloud could cause a series of impacts comparable to the <a href="https://www.space.com/36661-late-heavy-bombardment.html" target="_blank">late heavy bombardment</a>. The Oort is thought to extend from 100 to 200 A.U. from the sun.</p>
<p>So if we set radius of Oort Cloud as the size of our ball of destruction the ball would have a diameter of 200 to 400 inches on our scale. Or 17 to 34 feet, a small to large pickup truck.</p>
<p>So now am trying to find a locale that covers 4^2 or 16 square miles. Manhattan is a little bigger -- about 23 square miles.</p>
<p>So it would be more like asking if two pickup trucks would collide if shot into the space of Manhattan. Still unlikely. But it seems like you pulled your image out of thin air.</p></div>		</li>
