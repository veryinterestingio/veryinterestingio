			<div class="markdown"><p>I, too, have suffered from chronic canker sores and after years of personal research I’ve found a solution that seems to work for me. I switched from name brand toothpaste (crest, specifically) to sensodyne and it is amazing the difference it makes. Where I used to get them once or twice a month, I go several months in between and they last much shorter than usual. There’s some active ingredient in most large toothpastes that personally aggravated my mouth, so I empathize with you as well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for me. I belive the ingredient in most toothpastes is sodium lauryl sulfate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium lauryl sulfate is just a foamer - it's in virtually anything that foams, so shampoo, toothpaste, shaving cream, liquid soap, etc. The active ingredient in the large majority of toothpastes is some type of fluoride.</p>
<p>(Also worth noting I <em>just</em> got over a bad canker sore and I've used Sensodyne for years. :P)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fluoride is considered the active ingredient, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strangely, I've found that eating more kiwi have helped keep me from getting them as frequently. I eat a few a week now and I rarely get them. If I feel one coming, I eat an extra kiwi that day and it goes away. I used to get several a month.</p></div>		</li>
