			<div class="markdown"><p>10kg of lead. More dense, lower profile, less drag resistance from the water. </p>
<p>Orrrrr, would it be aluminum because of its larger volume, would displace more water, thus having slightly higher buoyancy?</p>
<p>I suppose it depends on how fast you try to lift them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edit</strong>: originally thought the original comment said 10,000kg, redid it with 10kg.</p>
<p>That much lead would be about 0.00088 cubic meters (assuming no empty internal pockets of air), and that much aluminum would be about 0.00371 cubic meters.  We know that buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced, so we can calculate the buoyant force using these volumes. So, 0.00088 cubic meters of water is 880g, making the total weight of the submerged lead 10kg-0.88kg=9.12g.  The 0.00371 cubic meters of aluminum displaces 3.71kg of water, making it's apparent weight 10kg-3.71kg=6.29kg, almost a 3kg difference.  Since drag resistance depends on the shape and speed of the objects, and I think we can assume they are the same shape which cancels out and let's just assume they aren't being lifted fast enough to cause significant drag force, we can probably assume that these factors won't be significant enough to overcome a difference of 3kg (weight not mass).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you implying this is the answer?  That because nails are denser than cotton, the nails truck actually contains more mass (because more air)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd agree it'd be a pretty silly answer to the question, but maybe what the teacher is going for.</p>
<p>Asking &quot;Which weighs more, 1 kg of feathers or 1 kg of lead?&quot; And coming up with the lead because of buoyancy, would be a stretch for most students.</p>
<p>My question aims to highlight the surrounding, which will hopefully lead to the right line of reasoning.</p>
<p>Whereas OP's teacher's question is ???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a mistake to assume there's a problem with the way the question was framed. Possible that a) op conveyed it incorrectly, since they didn't understand what the question really was, they might have missed information, or b) you don't understand the question as posed by op.</p>
<p>There is at least one glaring possibility - it's the same driver. He drives one truck after the other.</p></div>		</li>
