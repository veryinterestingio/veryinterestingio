			<div class="markdown"><p>There's absolutely no way you can be addicted to nicotine in a way, that prevents you from using any other means of nicotine consumption:</p>
<p>Chewing gum, spray, patch are all available.</p>
<p>And then there's the regular smokeless form: Snus, chewing tobacco, snuff...</p>
<p>Even vaping, although retarded to do on a plane would be an option if you simple hold the vapour in for 20 seconds after inhaling, there won't be any noticeable vapour when you exhale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I agree. When I was a smoker, I’d just use gum on long international flights. Again, there’s some pretty special people out there... I saw a video the other day of a woman letting her child defecate on a newspaper in the aisle on a plane.. so.... I dunno.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The throat burn was the best part of smoking for me.  When I quit, it was the hardest part to get over.  No nicotine was fine after a week, but man I wanted that throat burn again for literal years.</p>
<p>It’s kinda like drinking a very carbonated soda.  Uncomfortable at first, but if you keep drinking it you’ll crave that initial throat burning feeling from the carbonation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've never been addicted to cigarettes have you?</p>
<p>The mental stimulus, the oral fixation, all contribute.  I quit smoking ages ago, no nicotine left at all, occasionally I still really want to engage those aspects of the addiction.  Of course, I don't, because it's an easy slope to fall down.</p>
<p>As for while I was smoking? I went on a trip that had a total of 8(ish) hours of flights with no chance to step out for one (the layovers were too short to get back through security).  I brought the gum.  It made it less hard, but the physical act of &quot;holding something in between cheek and gum&quot; that you do with gum was <em>not</em> what my nicotine addicted self associated with consumption, and was less effective at satisfying the addiction.</p>
<p>It's not <em>just</em> the nicotine.  Don't get me wrong, that's like 90% of the addiction, but there's still the other aspects that you can't just write off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've smoked for a few years and vape now. I stopped smoking the day I bought a cheap gas station vape.</p>
<p>Been doing that for two years now while lowering the nicotine content. Which varies between 2 and 3 mg/l at 4-6 ml a day. And I don't intend to quit, because I actually like it, and unlike smoking there's nearly no I'll effects. It's healthier than drinking alcohol, which I don't do, so I'll keep that vice.</p>
<p>I wrote about the oral fixation part as well somewhere here.</p>
<p>Although I never had a problem not smoking for half a day while I was smoking half a pack a day.</p></div>		</li>
