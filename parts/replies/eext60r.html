<p>Even if you aren't stepping on them barefoot, it's pretty easy for a nail to go through a sandal or a sneaker's rubber sole. It's happened to me a non-zero amount of times.</p></div>		</li>

Some people just don't care though and will leave scraps of trash and nails lying around. Quite unprofessional in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stepped on a nail almost every couple years or so as a kid. Mostly it was from plank fences that we spent a lot of time fixing, replacing, or salvaging. We'd cut them up for firewood and just leave some nails that didn't pull out easily. So between the jobs of tearing the fence down, loading it up, cutting it, stacking it, and then hauling it to the house to burn, there were many occasions to encounter nails sticking up out of wood pieces or just laying on the ground.</p>
<p>I was always current on my tetanus shot. Around 17-18, I got a pair of boots with a plate in the sole, so that was nice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When i was 8 i stepped* on a nail in the middle of my school ground around noon. Socks were bloodied and my shoes was leaking blood. before 4pm the blood stopped and i felt healed. I was so scared that if my mom knew she would probably punished me for being so clumsy. I threw both of my socks(even the clean ones),got home spend the rest of the day as normal.  I never told a single soul that day. 2 days later i was convulsing really hard with 40 degree fever and my jaw started to stiffen. I got rushed to ER that day and told my mom before i passed out that i step on a nail. Up to that day i always get my tetanus shot every 2 years voluntarily.  </p></div>		</li>
