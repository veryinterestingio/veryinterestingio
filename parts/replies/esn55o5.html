			<div class="markdown"><p>Breathing would more to do with the autonomic nervous system than instinct (except maybe in whales/dolphins).</p>
<p>I recently finished a lecture series on behavior, and it deemphasized the notion of instinct. The idea that animals are hard wired to to exhibit a behavior is not quite accurate. Instead the idea of fixed action patterns was introduced. An association that groups certain muscle movements together leads to a tendency towards a certain behavior, if a certain environmental stimulus is present. To use ethological jargon, an environmental releasing stimulus triggers an innate releasing mechanism, resulting in a fixed action pattern.</p>
<p>To put it in terms of natural selection, the salmon that doesn’t happen to have a brain that’s wired to swim upstream during spawning season doesn’t pass on its genes, so the salmon that are pre-programmed with such an innate releasing mechanism will become more prevalent. If that answer isn’t good enough, neuroethology examines innate releasing mechanisms, and is a good place to start finding more details.</p>
<p>To put it in terms a human can relate to, we tend to pay a lot of attention to the noise that other humans make. We have a fixed action pattern to interpret this sound and then try to imitate it. The human brain has an intrinsic tendency to learn the language that it’s exposed to in early life. By random chance, some people don’t (such as extreme cases of autism), but for the most part, human brains have an innate releasing mechanism that tends to pick up on language.</p>
<p>There’s also the notion of prepared learning, which shows that some associations are easier to make than others. For example, classical conditioning would lead you to believe that you’ll have a negative association with an environment that exposes you to a negative stimulus. If you contract food poisoning while watching a movie, however, you’re unlikely to feel sick every time you see the same movie. If you had eaten pizza hours prior, you are likely to get sick every time you see pizza from that point on. Classical conditioning is still at play, but a prepared learning pattern would make you have a tendency to associate gastric discomfort with food, even on a subconscious level.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural language acquisition is an imprint, not an instinct.  </p>
<p>Song birds are a good example of instinct vs imprint. Some species are born knowing their song or call. In other species it is not innate, and must be learned. However, their window of opportunity to learn it is open for a short time. If they don't hear and learn it from their own species, or if they learn the song or call from different species, they will never find a mate.  </p>
<p>Humans have a larger window for learning language, but their most critical time for natural language acquisition is 3-6 months. This is why it is so important for parents to talk to their young babies. Babies cannot understand it or produce language, but their brains are taking it all in as it wires itself for language.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents, and therefore miss out on this critical window. When deaf children of hearing adults learn ASL when they begin school, they quickly adapt, but their English skills often lag because it's difficult to learn a second language when you don't have a first language. Conversely, children (hearing or deaf) of deaf adults who use ASL in the home produce language earlier than children of hearing adults because gross motor skills (signing) develop faster than fine motor skills (speaking). Also, children of deaf adults don't have the same lag in their English skills because they already have a foundational first language, which makes learning a second language so much easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned about one trial learning, which suggests that imprinting is not a rigid as previously thought. For example, a duck may seem to quickly attribute nearby figures as being a parental figure, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t key in on other factors that support its idea. I specifically didn’t call language acquisition an instinct, I referred to it as a fixed action pattern to distinguish it from notions of instinct. My point was that humans have a natural tendency to key into language sounds and therefore learn from their environment.</p>
<p>If some birds really are born knowing their species’ song, then maybe there’s more to instinct than I had thought. Fixed action patterns is supposed to explain that all behavior is triggered by environment in some way, and that they’re not hard wired. A bird being born knowing its song sounds like strong evidence toward hard wired behavior. Maybe I’m a bit off on the idea of a distinction between one trial learning and imprinting as well. I guess the truth is that the world is complicated, and sometimes you need to incorporate seemingly conflicting ideas to accurately describe it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>If you try and force your deaf child to lip read and learn English, he probably won't..</p>
<p>If you teach your deaf child sign language, their brains develop to accept language and English becomes possible later. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a faulty Clifford alarm on my car a few years ago that kept going off all the times with the default multi pattern alarm sweep (through about 10 different sequences of sound patterns). Beside car is large mature trees with nesting birds. After about a year I actually heard entire tree full of birds repeat the exact sequence and patterns of the faulty alarm - a greater than 40 second pattern. I wished I recorded it at the time. Seems they all thought this was the large alpha bird that they all had to copy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't tell the difference between that phrase and my understanding of instinct to begin with.</p>
<p>Is the suggestion you are making that instinct is largely seen a blueprint, and not as a &quot;typical&quot; response? As in, it was once seen as coded to be specific, but you are now seeing it as &quot;coded to respond to X stimuli, the result being typically the same&quot;</p>
<p>I'm confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instinct would suggest that a squirrel is born knowing how to crack a nut.</p>
<p>A fixed action pattern idea suggests that he’s born with certain motor pathways that happen to be useful in cracking a nut. The squirrel’s own experience shapes how it puts these movements together, and therefore shapes how a squirrel learns to crack a nut.</p>
<p>A gazelle isn’t born knowing how to walk, but it is born with the motor control to move its legs in a coordinated manner. Therefore, it can learn to walk within seconds of being born.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, that part just isn’t ELI5 material.</p>
<p>Genetics is complicated. Most headlines that say a certain gene has been discovered really just means that a genetic marker has been associated with a certain trait. A gene that says you’ll be tall in one environment might make you short in a different environment. DNA replicates proteins. There are tons of different proteins in the body. Some of them represent hormones or neurotransmitters. There is still a lot about genetics that we do not know.</p>
<p>Neurology is complicated. Glial cells lay the framework for neurons to build upon. Neurons can fire randomly, creating noise. If a neuron is motivated to be heard by the post synaptic neuron more, it can strengthen its firing, making it better received for that firing. Alternatively, if it decreases its firing strength, it can cause the post synaptic neuron to develop more receptors, and become more sensitive to future signaling. There are hundreds of neurotransmitters, of which less than ten have been studied in depth, and it’s still not completely clear what how the interact with which type of neural network. There is still a lot about neurology that we do not know.</p>
<p>The cerebellum contains information about how to combine certain motor movements. The broca’s area controls motor movement. The basal ganglia is associated with subcortical motor movement. The frontal cortex can inhibit behavior or lead to more complicated motivation behind behavior, but it takes the longest to fully develop. The synapse that triggers movement may come from the amygdala in the presence of a fear response, unless the signal gets inhibited by the septum. There are plenty of other regions the signal may originally come from as well. There’s still a lot about regions of the brain and their interactions that we do not know.</p>
<p>Genes tend to code in fractal patterns. Reductive thinking leads one to believe that knowing the mechanisms behind the components to a system will allow you to know the state of that system. Chaos theory begs to disagree. More precise measurements can show a pattern to be less predictable, rather than enable you to predict it. In other words, it’s not noise, it’s the phenomenon. Emergence can show how simple things like synapses can develop meaningful patterns. Swarm intelligence can optimize networks, and this optimization on a grand scale develops these meaningful patterns.</p>
<p>You’re not asking a question, you’re asking a million questions.</p>
<p>DNA replicates proteins. Proteins play a role in the development of glial cells. Glial cells use swarm intelligence to from networks that neurons then build upon. Neural networks drive behavior based on certain motivations that largely tend to pertain to the region of the brain they are found in, or to the neurotransmitter they release. Lower areas of the brain react in simple ways, while higher areas are more decision driven. If an animal tends to perform a certain behavior, a simple neural network may be hardwired to always react a certain way to a certain stimulus. More likely, the animal will have a set of networks that drive a set of behavior when associated with a certain <em>type</em> of stimulus.</p>
<p>Just because a bird always flies south every winter doesn’t mean it doesn’t decide to fly south.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help to not think about instincts as &quot;information&quot;. When instincts happen, it's not because the brain/animal has any knowledge of what that instinct is or why they do it. Instincts are a <em>mechanism</em>. Think of them like you would a physical appendage. A bird has wings because evolution spent billions of years accidentally tweaking them into existence.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with instincts. Decision-making and behavior is largely a function of brain chemistry^(unfortunately, I think the answer you seek probably lies <em>deep</em> within this bit, and is beyond 5-year-old technical), and evolution has fine tuned our noggin chemistry sets over the same billion years. &quot;Evolution made it that way&quot; is probably unsatisfying, but the details of how brain chemistry holds and handles knowledge isn't something our top scientists even really understand well, so the 5 year olds are gonna need to ask a different question.</p>
<p><em>Parts</em> of instincts can be explained with understood chemistry, but not the part you're asking about, I don't think. Like for reproduction, we understand pretty well how hormones make us horny. But I think you want an answer to &quot;how do we know what to do with our junk once we get horny&quot; which can't really be explained beyond &quot;because the brain is made that way&quot;.</p>
<p>We &quot;know&quot; instincts the same way we &quot;know&quot; how to see or hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t seem that weird to me. Many of our urges around hunger or cravings have nothing to do with learning about how to know when you need certain types of nutrition. The urge just has to make the creature do what it needs, not make the creature know what it’s doing it for or how.</p>
<p>The turtle may not be intentionally going back home so much as fulfilling a reactionary urge based on magnetic sensory input</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what hes talking about is more like when we have cravings for certain foods. People crave high fat/high calorie foods because our ancestors lived with food scarcity. Pregnant women sometimes want to eat dirt because of an iron deficiency. Personally after a few days eating pizza and fried chicken, I crave vegetables (I also crave these when I'm thirsty). I think he was trying to say that sure, hunger hormones are one thing (and I'm not sure we made the distinction between hormones and instincts here, whether the actions they result in are the same or not, being unlearned actions) but craving things you're deficient in is another.</p></div>		</li>
