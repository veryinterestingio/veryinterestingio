			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man I wonder how if you can condition them to contract their pupils by snapping your fingers immediately before turning on the lights</p>
<p>I wonder if you can do this independently for each eye by having radically different amounts of light hitting each eye</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can’t. It takes the input of the parasympathetic nervous system and down regulation of sympathetic nervous outflow to constrict your pupils and snapping your fingers won’t do it. And you can’t independently constrict your pupils. The ophthalmic circuitry in your brain has an intrinsic redundancy to ensure they constrict/dilate together &amp; simultaneously, regardless of single eye stimulus. If one does, something is seriously wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At night if I need to turn the light on, I keep one eye closed or covered. Once the light goes out, the open eye is blinded by darkness, but if I uncover the other eye, I can see.  How does that work if they change aperture simultaneously?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically all you need is a muscarinic agonist or antagonist and you’re good.  Little belladonna in one eye and bam!  But yeah. While biofeedback training can give some people pretty decent control over their sympathetic and parasympathetic as a whole, the two are antagonistic and when one goes up the other goes down and that’s the primary reason for pupil dilation or constriction in terms of “surprise”, or “I like you”.  Most drugs of abuse cause dilation or construction from either increasing or decreasing activity of neurons in pathways that eventually result in pupil dilation or construction... certain cannabinoids also prevent the smooth tracking of our eyes.  But unless the left and right hemisphere of your brain are differentially sensitive (they shouldn’t be) to the neuronal inputs that synchronize pupillary contraction the only way to get one big one small is brain damage or ocular administration of something like belladonna, pilocarpine, or muscarinic mushroom juice....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you can contract independently the pupils. If you hit with light one eye, both pupils contract (at least happens in my case)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely not. There’s something called the consensual light reflex, which is where one eye will dilate when a light is shone in the other eye. If someone presents w/o this reflex it can be a sign of serious neurologic issues. It would be really cool if that were possible though!! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holdup, i just read that both pupils are only partially connected via the same nerve system. Is it possible that there is less of a connection in some peoples brains than in others, so that their pupils dilate and contract more independently from eachother than those of other people?<br />
My pupils contract independently and (as far as i know) i have never sustained any trauma to the general brain area, so this souned logical, but what do you think?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, why not clap first or nearly the same time as turning off the lights?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just make sure the sound happens at roughly the same time as the light so that your brain starts to associate the two.</p></div>		</li>
