			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends a lot on the details of the geothermal system and the plant itself, but many are subject to geothermal degradation, i.e., heat is extracted from the system faster than it can be reheated from the surrounding rock and/or the flow of hot fluids change as a result of heat extraction and/or drilling/pumping/injection. Thus, the efficiency of the system can decrease through time and it requires careful thought about plant design and how much production can be sustained for how long (e.g., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196890416309323" target="_blank">Budisulistyo et al, 2017</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650513000254" target="_blank">Lei &amp; Zhu, 2013</a>, etc). There are likely engineering and material issues as well that limit the lifetime of the wells (e.g., mineralization, corrosion, etc), but that's getting much further outside my areas of expertise or understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating that you can choose how much heat to extract.  I guess it makes sense, as I think about it, but it's counterintuitive at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The well heat may last 30 years but the drilled hole is lined with metal casing and cement for stability. The metal casing and other downhole equipment (that often contain elastomers) have trouble surviving 20 years with these temperatures and corrosive fluids. This is where NREL, DOE are sponsoring R&amp;D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably means that youll need to repair/replace, which will get more costly and/or inefficient per power unit as time goes on, and youll never break even and/or make a profit. If it costs 10 bucks to make, but before you make your 11th dollar, you need to replace something that costs 3 dollars, you dig yourself further in &quot;cost&quot;; if you always need to replace/repair before you see profit, you can easily just keep digging that hole into the red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expected profit margins have a lot to do with this as well. Even if you can make a profit the projects not going to go forward if there are other options that have as higher profit margin investors don't like low yield even if it is environmentally friendly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why if the project is break even, subsidizing it with tax dollars for the environmental benefits should be on the table. </p>
<p>It would be harder to jusitify if the costs are at a loss, but cleaner energy that benefits everyone is comparable to roads. Not everything needs to be profitable when there are other benefits to society</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that’s true, one of the other difficulties for geothermal is that the cost to install solar has plunged beyond anyone’s predictions over the last decade, and is still falling. (Wind has fallen too, but not to the same magnitude.) There’s still a niche where geothermal can be viable, but the conditions are narrowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like levying a tax against things that are more harmful (a total-product-cost approach) would be better than just subsidizing the environmentally friendly option. </p>
