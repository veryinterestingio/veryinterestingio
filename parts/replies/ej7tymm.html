			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want the super simple version, yes.</p>
<p>It's actually a bit more nuanced than that. There are many plants that will die after flowering, and all single-trunk plants will die eventually as they gradually accumulate scars and become unable to sustain themselves. But yes, as far as the cells are concerned, they will live forever given proper conditions. In non-clonal species, this means outside intervention to move the younger tissues closer to the ground so they can put down roots though. <em>Lomatia tasmanica</em> is an example of a species that's been surviving like that for a very, very long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better example would be to look at apple trees.  I'm given to understand that you don't want to grow apples from seeds because only a few combinations produce really great apples.  So virtually all apple varieties are grown from grafting.  </p>
<p>All Granny Smith apple trees, for example, are cuttings from a single tree that was found growing in a compost pile in Australia in the 1870s (I think) by a woman named Smith.  Cross this variety with anything, even itself, and the seeds that result don't produce Granny Smiths. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great example. Also. Bananas are like that. It's why genetic diversity in bananas is so low and why a single disease is capable of wiping ot the world's crop. </p>
<p>In fact, banana flavoring in candy is what bananas used to taste like, before a disease wiped out the world crops of that breed. From there we made the current bananas that we can buy in the store. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually planning on growing some Gros Michel bananas this year (and next, takes 2 years I hear), mostly because I can't find them anywhere and I really want to try one.  You can get them on amazon, and I hear they're pretty easy to grow, with a nice hot, wet summer coming. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and apple trees won't self pollinate either. They usually have a small crabapple tree at the end of rows to pollinate the crop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're saying if two honey crisp trees are next to each other, and the pollen from one gets to the pistil of the other, it won't make a fruit? And this is because they're clones, so essentially they're the 'same' tree and apples one of the plants whose own pollen can't pollinate it's own flowers?</p>
<p>I'm curious about the crab apple pollinating the desirable trees then: does its dna have no effect on the fruit produced by its pollen? The quality of the fruit is completely dependent on the DNA from the host tree and not at all on the DNA from the pollen?</p></div>		</li>
