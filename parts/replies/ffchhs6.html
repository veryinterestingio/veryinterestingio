			<div class="markdown"><p>As a microbiologist have you heard of people in that field going out to collect ice core samples? It just seems an odd practice for any sort of biologists to be involved in, but I guess maybe they can check through core repositories if they want? I’ve learnt about ice core practices through a geoscience degree, so I’m only really familiar with that crowd going out to do that sort of fieldwork, no idea how it works for the bio crowd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! That clarified a lot! If I may ask, how does the multiple displacement amplification work? I mean if I virus is RNA or DNA, but you have not every sequence of his &quot;complete state&quot; there are criteria on what triplets to add, or maybe is a combination or criteria and guess work? Again thanks for the answer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_displacement_amplification" target="_blank">Here's the wikipedia page on MDA for reference.</a> In general, it's mostly amplification, it just makes use of a bacteriophage derived polymerase called phi29 which performs this very interesting debranching method for amplification. </p>
<p>When we sequence DNA/RNA we can't sequence it in a straight line. We have to chop it up into pieces and sequence those pieces. (There are whole molecule approaches not, but there's no guarantee we found a whole genome molecule either way.) A lot of assembly is guess work and we're actively working on techniques to improve assembly of bacteria and viruses derived from the environment.</p></div>		</li>
