			<div class="markdown"><p>But I believe most drug tests don’t test for THC itself, but a metabolite formed when the body ingests THC. Just wondering if that same metabolite would show up from cbd</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I talked to a drug test tech in the aviation/transportation industry just a few weeks ago about this topic. He said one of their biggest issues has been people getting busted with THC presence in their system due to them ingesting CBD oil. He said the CBD oil is fairly unregulated and thought it might be more challenging for the “manufacturers” to remove the THC than not, so people have been unknowingly getting THC from a supposedly “THC-free” product.....or at least that was the excuse told to the drug tester. I believe he told me that they even tested some “THC free” products as a follow up and they failed.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I’m just repeating what this technician told me, I have zero understanding of anything related to THC/marijuana.</p></div>		</li>
