<p>My family is similar. No one really needs an alarm clock and we all sleep just 4-6 hours per night. Even as a kid I have distinct memories of reading under the covers with a flashlight until 1-2am because sleep wasn’t happening at “bed time”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feel sorry for you suckers laying around for half an hour, I pretty much instantly fall asleep as soon as I hit the pillow, though that might have something do with staying up until 12-12:30 and having my alarm go off at 5:45...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite true, sleep cycles range between 90 minutes and 120 minutes, and it varies from person to person, sleep cycle to sleep cycle.</p>
<p>For a person who has a 120 minute average sleep cycle, 7.5 hours is worse than 8 hours.</p></div>		</li>
