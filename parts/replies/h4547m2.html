			<div class="markdown"><p>Our dental troubles actually predate the mass availability of sugar. Our teeth started to decay and have issues when we switched from hunter-gatherers to agriculture, due to the sudden increase in the amount of starches we ate.</p>
<p>Granted, sugar makes it way way worse, and modern day food being so stuffed full of sugar even more so, but my point is that our teeth were rotting out of our heads even before we started eating lots of sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, that is actually untrue. Hunter-gatherer life expectancy is/was so low mainly due to infant mortality. Anthropological studies have concluded that once HG’s survived infancy — and, to a lesser extent, youth — they would go on to live to an average age of around 70, without most or any of the chronic health ailments that often plague modern people even much younger than them — including tooth decay, which most modern people experience early on in life.</p>
<p>HG’s ate high quality whole foods and were very physically active just in their day-to-day survival. It was a necessity for them. They didn’t have the option to sit on the couch and eat cookies, and this healthy lifestyle was reflected in their physical — as well as dental — health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sort of. Its a misconception that we lived much shorter lives back in ancient times. Its a result of people misunderstanding what we mean when we say &quot;average lifespan.&quot;</p>
<p>See, in reality, most people lived well into their 60's or older. The reason why we think of the life expectancy back then as being so low, is because lots of children died at just a few years old, so that brings the <em>average</em> lifespan down. Like, if you have 100 people, and half of them die at age 60, but the other half die at age 3, then the <em>average</em> life span is only 31.5 years old.</p>
<p>But, if you lived past 6 or 7 years old, you could fully expect to live to be 60 or older! Back then, women had <em>lots</em> of children, because it was expected that at least half of them would die in childhood. The ones that survived childhood, however, would live long lives similar to what many people do today.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it <em>is</em> true that we live longer now; people routinely live to be 90+ these days. But the tooth decay typically starts long before then.</p>
<p>You might live to 80 these days instead of 60, but your teeth are gonna start rotting out of your head when youre in your 20's or 30's, so the modern &quot;living longer&quot; thing doesnt really have the effect you may be thinking of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't live <em>that</em> much longer than we used to. The idea that people used to rarely live past their forties is a common misconceptions due to the higher infant mortality rate of the past skewing most life expectancy averages from those time periods.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It actually doesn’t. Ask a dentist and they’ll tell you, the worst food for your teeth is not sugary drinks, but crisps. Sugar dissolves in saliva and is gone from your mouth in minutes - starches stick to your teeth like glue, slowly being broken down into simple sugars by enzymatic action, providing a stable food source for harmful bacteria that can last for hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There needs to be actual selection pressure for changes to occur. Very few people will die and/or fail to reproduce because of their teeth, which means any genes that produce extra teeth (or just more resilient ones) don't offer a significant evolutionary advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It requires more than just selective pressure. The ability for teeth to continuously regenerate throughout life needs to be an inheritable trait that is present within the human gene pool. Even if there is selective pressure for more resistant teeth, that alone won't lead to the ability to regrow teeth. You have to get lucky and hope a mutation occurs that gives us the ability to regrow teeth. Once the trait is present within the gene pool, then selective pressure will lead to the trait spreading.</p></div>		</li>
