<p>One consideration is the ride into space is a harsh one. High G forces and lots of heavy vibration. After that not so much.</p>
<p>Three other considerations are power, altitude control, and communications. Those are must not fail systems and they get a bigger part of the weight budget than everything else. As long as they are still going the thing is technically still alive even if other systems have failed.</p></div>		</li>
