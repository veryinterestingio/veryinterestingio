<p>Disclaimer: I based these numbers on what I remember from the whatsit, paper that's enclosed with your BC pills, from the time I used those. Numbers are thought up as example. Feel free to comment the proper numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not 100% true. It is linked to slightly higher rates, not significantly higher rates, but not because estrogen causes breast cancer.</p>
<p>Our body ends up with irregular cells, or cancer cells, every day. But we have defense mechanisms, specific antibodies, that destroy those cells. When it comes to breast cancer there are types of cancer cells that have estrogen receptors on them. These cancers are made to grow larger by estrogen, but are not caused by estrogen. So when a woman is taking estrogen (whether birth control or on estrogen for treating menopause symptoms) it basically &quot;feeds&quot; those cancer cells to multiply and it becomes bigger than our bodies naturally defense system can handle. It also often makes the cancer grow more rapidly than it normally would,8 leading to it being discovered when the mass is palpable or more advanced. </p>
<p>Source: I'm a mammographer and work in the diagnosis of breast cancer.This is a simplified explanation but if you just look up &quot;estrogen receptor positive breast cancers&quot; you can learn more or get a more detailed explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in a relatively simplified summary, estrogen positive breast cancers have higher survival rates than non estrogen positive ones and are easier to treat. If you're under 40 and you have an ER- cancer, id be worried, even if caught early.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a strange question but I’m taking Spironolactone for acne and it‘s an androgen blocker meaning it blocks testosterone. It’s not an increase in estrogen but it’s an increase in the ratio of estrogen to testosterone and I was wondering if something like that could also affect cancer rates?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been on Spironolactone for a few years for hypertension.  My kidney function is reduced and this has allowed a pretty significant uptick in improvement.  Also, the reduced hairiness is a benefit for me (PCOS) so I get a 2-for.  For other reasons I get checked thoroughly every 6 months and regular screenings.  Everything has been fine so far.  I did not kn ow it was also used for acne but it makes sense that it would work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or just ask to have your Testosterone levels checked. The average man’s T levels decrease about 1% per year after peaking in puberty — many doctors are willing to prescribe small doses that will help you feel more energetic, less depressed, etc. </p>
<p>There are no “pills” (T is toxic to the stomach) but your doctor can prescribe injectable T or a cool gel that you rub into the surface of your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people overlook that testosterone levels in women are very importantly as well (albeit at a much much lower level, of course). Aging and/or giving birth can lower testosterone in women which causes fatigue/lack of sleeping, foggy thinking, short tempers, and lower sex drives. Hormone replacement therapy with testosterone for women is becoming more popular as well. But these medications and ads aren’t relevant to women as far as I understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True but T levels also play into a male's general sense of well-being, for lack of a better word. It boosts confidence and really gives you a &quot;superhuman&quot; or &quot;I can do anything&quot; state of mind.</p></div>		</li>
