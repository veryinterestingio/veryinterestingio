The impermeable rock acts simply as a container for the water flowing in from above, like a tube.</p>
<p>In your example, you place the book on top of your bag of water to create pressure. Then drill a hole and observe the water flowing upwards.  After some time the water bag is empty and you don't have a spring anymore. What's more, the books have fallen down. That's not what happens.</p>
<p>The potential energy should come from the water column, not from the mass of the rock.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, you seen to have studied this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is coming down through percolation, but it's in very small amounts compared to the aquifer below. When it rains a lot of water comes down over a km^2, but that's one event; picture how much water has come down over 10,000 years. A spring is always the highest point of that water source. There might be other streams that start higher in elevation, but A.) That's a different water body; B.) High elevation streams are almost always fed by snowmelt, not rainfall.</p>
<p>Regarding the bag and book, you're quite right, if the water all drained out the books would fall down! This is called subsidence. Now, water doesn't take up a large percentage of the area by volume, there's far more rock and soil. It's still there though, taking up space, so if it all vanishes, the ground slumps. This is happening in the United States Midwest region. The Ogallala (High Plains) Aquifer has been heavily drawndown from irrigation and there starting to be some ground subsidence.</p></div>		</li>
