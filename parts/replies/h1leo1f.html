			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda like how the plague, as it was happening, was believed to be due to cats.  So they killed all the cats.  Turned out the cats had gotten the plague from the rats.  So for decades, if not centuries, it was believed the rats were the cause of the plague, and while they had a hand in it (especially after the cat population was obliterated), it was really fleas biting the rats (and people because of the times) giving everyone plague.  The first move they made effectively turned the plague into an unstoppable pandemic.</p>
<p>Edit:  it’s largely from flea bites, so not direct contact with rats.  The rats were just very good at getting infected fleas near people.  A secondary method of infection is through exposure to contaminated tissue or fluids.  Cats and dogs in modern times have exposed their owners to bubonic and pneumonic plague after eating rodents that had it, this is rare with a few cases each year occurring in the US).</p></div>		</li>

<p>(Holy cow, blaming the cats wasn’t entirely wrong. Eating infected rats does make them vectors, they like to rub our faces, and furthermore many of them like to drop dead mice in our beds.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edited, but there is some human to animal droplet transmission.  This still occurs in rare instances in modern times.  The US gets around 5-10 cases of plague a year.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a sudden drop in temperature that stopped the virus from traveling as easily</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this goes against what I thought I'd learned.  Since viruses aren't harmed by cold or even freezing, and they are destroyed by heat and UV, I thought that cold temps helped their spread, except for the impact that winter weather has on human movements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Environmental factors are where it usually gets complicated.  A virus itself is essentially viral DNA wrapped in a protein shell.  Some have to stay moist, some don’t.  Most have a shelf life outside of the host of a few hours to several weeks.  If people are staying at home, and no one is infected, or everyone already got it and got over it, then the virus can’t transfer.  So yeah, the impacts of temperatures can impact actions and force a soft quarantine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well just randomly commenting, but don't super deadly pathogens usually burn really hot and then disappear completely? Because all the immune hosts don't carry it well and those who are vulnerable quickly get it and die super fast so it doesn't spread? </p>
<p>Thats why e.coli is super good and herpes, it doesn't kill its hosts and just makes them sick but allows it to propagate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s more about time to death than deadliness. A virus that takes a year to kill but does it consistently is still “super deadly” but it could also infect the whole world. </p>
<p>On the same vein, a virus that isn’t deadly at all but had an extremely quick incubation time and poor vector for spreading wouldn’t be effective at all. </p>
<p>It’s a combination of factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth saying that that’s why HIV was so terrifying. It has an incubation period of up to seven years and the mortality rate approaching 100%. Fortunately, it turns out it’s not that easy to catch, in that barrier methods of prevention are extremely effective. If you can imagine it being respiratory disease, it would effectively be an extinction event.</p></div>		</li>
