			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm that does sound a little less appetising! Ok so, theoretically, if you came upon a wrecked space craft, and the hull had been punctured by let's say, an alien attack, would any floating morsels inside the craft be protected from the worst of this bombardment from radiation? Is the dehydration instant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not instant, and the hull would block most of the radiation.  The food is also probably mostly packaged, which may change things depending on how well the packaging handles depressurization.</p>
<p>Closer to the sun the heat from the star helps drive the sublimation of ice and accelerates the drying effect of the vacuum.  Way out there in the abyss things stay <em>very</em> frozen and sublimation will be much slower.</p>
<p>You don’t see much water ice on Mars, the Moon, or the asteroids because it’s too warm even though the pressure is so low.  Further out by the gas giants solid ice can persist basically indefinitely because there’s not enough heat to drive the sublimation at any pressure.</p>
<p>Whether you freeze solid or dry out first will depend on the proximity of the nearest star - or the heat production of the spacecraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be pretty slow. Not like decades or anything but I'm thinking hours/days depending on what it is, how it's packed, and how big it is. It would freeze in hours/days from radiating away heat, probably faster if it's directly exposed to vacuum because of evaporative cooling. After that the rest of the water would probably sublimate away slowly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You just completely altered my view of space in less than one sentence.</p>
