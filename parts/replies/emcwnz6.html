			<div class="markdown"><p>While spoken language evolved, the minority that was able to read and write kept doing so in Latin for a lot. </p>
<p>The result is that most knowledge was written in Latin, so it kind of became the official culture language: sacred texts, science books and such where all in Latin.</p>
<p>A hell lot of scientific terms are heavily based on Latin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Latin is also used in taxonomy, anatomy, and other fields of educated pursuits. It isn't a linguistic connection so much as a cultural connection that dovetailed with institutions that are conservative, largely because they are institutions of power, and conservatism is the position that society should not change much, if at all. When you have power, you want things to stay the same, and when you are powerless you want change.</p>
<p>But why did these institutions and scholarly pursuits have Latin in common to conserve? The Roman Catholic Church had Latin as its native language, and the systems of laws throughout the Western world are all based in large part on Roman law, which was in Latin.</p>
<p>The church and the courts have been historically just about the most powerful institutions around and the most conservative, and also have reason to present themselves with as much gravitas as possible. There's nothing like an ancient pedigree demonstrated in the very language to help with that.</p>
<p>The learned disciplines adopted their shared language at a point much after Latin had ceased as a working language spoken at home and learned naturally by children. Centuries after Rome was gone, Latin (and Greek) were taught to children of upper classes, as part of that conservative, not-changing ethic in part, and in part because it took many centuries for new cultural achievements to eclipse those of the ancient writers, who wrote in Latin and Greek.</p>
<p>So those gentlemen who pursued learned arts before education was democratized all learned Latin, but spoke the various languages of their native cultures: English, German, Italian, etc. When these early &quot;natural philosophers&quot; corresponded, they used a language they had in common: Latin. Latin was also used for pamphlets and books meant to be distributed internationally to a learned demographic.</p>
<p>So the terminology invented by these early scholars was in Latin, and learned disciplines and the entities which buttress and promulgate them are also conservative institutions, trying to conserve the learning that already exists and requiring extraordinary merit of any competing and contradictory claim of fact or analysis. For these institutions, Latin is their heritage if not as a natural language, and retention of it suits their philosophical perspective about heritage and change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not wrong latin at all. It developed from the vernacular latin of the time.</p>
<p>Is just latin as was spoken after the end of roman empire.
Yes, it was pronounced differently respect to the latin spoken by Caesar or Cicero, but it's the same as english was spoken differently by Shakespeare. You don't say that we use wrong english.</p></div>		</li>
