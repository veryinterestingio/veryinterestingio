			<div class="markdown"><p>Picking flu strains for the vaccine is notoriously tricky because you have to decide in spring what types of flu to include in that year’s vaccine because it takes that long to make enough flu vaccines to be ready for autumn when the flu season in the northern hemisphere starts to ramp up. They usually include three (or four) different types. One thing that’s considered is what types were causing most people to be hospitalised last winter, so not necessarily the most common types but the ones that were causing people to be the sickest. The decision time is also about the same point in the year when the Southern Hemisphere flu season starts, so they’ll look at what types are causing issues in Australia and might travel here (and vis versa, Australian vaccine producers will be looking now at what is problematic here). </p>
<p>The problem with viruses in general and flu in particular is how quickly they change. Even if you are exposed to a virus strain that 6 months ago was the same as the one you were vaccinated with in September, it can have changed enough that your immune system doesn’t recognise it. Or you get exposed to a different one altogether, there are far too many to have even one example of  each major type in the vaccine, and that may not protect you from one that’s the same “type” but a different strain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how do flu viruses evolve? for example, if I have the flu and I sneeze all over a subway handrail and then you being a scientist lick the handrail, will the flu that you sneeze out be the same flu I had or would it be slightly different? also, why are viruses so prone to mutation? i should probably read a wikipedia page</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of evolution is fairly random. Things are the way they are because dogs having different proteins didn't cause dogs to all die. So chances are it has nothing to do with protecting against anything in specific. </p>
<p>There would be evolutionary pressure for domesticated dogs not to receive or transmit viruses from humans, so that could play in. Dogs that don't make humans sick would be more diserable than dogs that do. Likewise, we may have domesticated dogs in part because they wouldn't make us sick so there was nothing viral that prevented us domesticating dogs. </p>
<p>My guess (and it is a guess) would be that a lot of creatures have various differences and it's more an oddity that the bird and swine flus DO jump to us, rather than being odd that canine flus don't. </p>
<p>I don't know the hard evidence, just suggesting some reasons. It may be that there's a definitive answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. Evolution is mainly taught as &quot;just-so&quot; stories, i.e. dogs proteins evolved to be protective of influenza, when its really some other indirect pressure or random mutation that simply isn't deleterious and the protection is a by product, i.e. dogs proteins for some indirect or random reason evolved in a way that confers protection from influenza. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cell proteins do all kinds of stuff, including telling other cells which parts are “you” and which aren’t so your immune system goes after anything that isn’t properly labelled. They also act as receptors, for instance a dog’s sense of smell is much better than a human’s largely because of the many different types of cell surface receptors that recognise even very very small amounts of scent molecules. We don’t need to smell in that much detail so we haven’t evolved those receptors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of viruses, and respiratory viruses in particular, are most prevalent in autumn/winter. There’s a few reasons why we think this is. One is that people tend to stay indoors and closer together so more chance of sneezing &amp; coughing on each other without the wind to blow the virus droplets away. The droplets are important too. Viruses don’t remain infectious outside a host forever, particularly if they dry out. So cooler, damper weather means the virus takes longer to dry out and stays infectious longer on surfaces and in the air. All of that increases the likelihood of being exposed to viruses &amp; increases transmission.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that people are more susceptible to all kinds of illnesses during winter because lack of sunlight &amp; vitamin D depress your immune system. So if you’re exposed to a virus, your immune system is less able to fight it off and you’re more likely to get sick</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that colder air holds less humidity so the aerosols containing the viral particles stay small and light so they can linger in the cold air. In warmer air, the aerosol particles get larger and fall due to higher humidity.</p></div>		</li>
