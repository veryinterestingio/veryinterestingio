			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case have you tried using it as a reactant for derivitzation? I'm thinking cellulose and starch chemistry, specifically if you can introduce branching, crosslinking or functional chemistry without negative byproducts (like organic hallides with oxidation). That would involve aqueous reactions, and I read below that it readily hydrates so not sure if that would impact. Note most of those are alkali catalyzed reactions.</p></div>		</li>
