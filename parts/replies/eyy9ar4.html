			<div class="markdown"><p>Inner Oort cloud objects, or transitional objects, are already known. Not many, but they are what astronomers call &quot;detached&quot; - They don't get close enough to any major solar system body to be acted on by it or to have been acted on by it last.</p>
<p>Some refer to these as &quot;Extended scattered disc&quot;, which I really dislike because the Scattered Disc has perihelia close enough to have been acted on by Neptune. 90377 Sedna is the best known example. This, and objects like it with a perihelion above 50 AU, are thought to form a continuum of objects leading out to the Oort cloud, and these are the inner edge of that population.</p>
<p>Detecting them is exceptionally difficult. The Whipple Mission would have monitored background stars, searching for occultations by Oort cloud objects, detecting objects 500 metres across at 20,000 AU distance. How many it found would set a ballpark figure for how dense the Oort cloud is, as well as providing the first direct observations of the main sphere objects. We could do this in the next decade if the will was there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TESS records the brightness of ~15,000 stars in 2-second intervals and adds 60 consecutive images to make 2-minute intervals, I don't know if it has the software to record transits that just appear in one or a few 2 second frames, if yes it might give some nice statistics over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the largest issues is that it's less likely to be a cloud than a random collection of small rocks scattered heavily.</p>
<p>The asteroid belt, for instance, is thought of commonly as some difficult-to-navigate minefield, but the reality is that the total mass of the whole belt is about 3% that of the moon. The average distance between objects is about 100,000 miles. And that's DENSE in space terms.</p>
<p>The Oort Cloud might be comparable in total mass, spread over much more of a sphere than a belt, and it's so distant that the light the objects receive from the sun wouldn't be significantly more than the background star light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Forgive my ignorance, but what are you referring to when you say walking trees?</p>
<p>Also, that was a fantastic explanation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Couple these scattered objects with the ones scattered during plantetary formation, then add in the effects of galactic tides, and their mutual gravity, and we get a slow, but steady, decline in aphelia and rise in perihelia: Their orbits tend to drift toward being circular. This, then, is the Oort cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>would the Oort cloud  a disc shape like  the asteroids or Kuiper belt? I've seen it depicted as spherical but not as a disk.</p></div>		</li>
