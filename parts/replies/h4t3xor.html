<p>Doesn't even have to be that extreme. I'm in NY and people are still warned about the dangers of overheating just shoveling driveways in winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a good point. -30°C if it's sunny out feels a lot warmer than -30°C if it's cloudy. </p>
<p>If its snowing, without the wind blowing too hard, it gets pretty warm. T-shirt weather in Canada is -10 if it isn't windy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true.  At -40f you get super hot if you're working and you start sweating.  Back when I lived in northern MN -40 was a pretty normal morning.  Once the sun comes up, you hit about -20f.  At that point, if you're working hard outside, a vest is plenty.  Once it hits zero-ish you can work in a t-shirt.</p>
<p>The problem is sweat.  You can't let yourself sweat when it's that cold. When you stop moving, the sweat freezes and you die.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, -40f is very manageable.  -55f becomes a challenge.  Once you hit -60f, you're going to die in minutes without good clothes.  Strange how, at those temperatures, 10 degrees makes such a difference.</p>
<p>Now I live in the Twin Cities.  I get whiny at 10 above.  I was tough once, less so now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thats a pretty big one. I tried thinking back to the last time I saw any footage of people wearing white actually working in arctic/antarctic conditions, and all I could come up with was Soviets. So that wasn't very recent footage</p></div>		</li>
