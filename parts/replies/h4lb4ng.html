			<div class="markdown"><p>For a real life example of this, the recent youtube video put out by Veritasium shows a $10,000 about an experimental result.</p>
<p>If you pay really close attention, it becomes apparent that the entire disagreement and bet came about because of the use of a simplified equation that ignores real effects. In the simplified equation, it was possible to end up in a divide by zero condition. </p>
<p>Turns out, the well defined and more robust version of the same equation doesn't have this problem at all and gives perfectly valid results.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good rule of thumb but also notable is that moh's hardness isn't even slightly useful when determining wear, or really anything outside of ceramic relative properties. It's not even the same hardness used in wear calculations, and in wear calculations it is at best a factor, not the final determining number.</p></div>		</li>
