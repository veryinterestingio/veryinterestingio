<p>This is the topic of the book Iâ€™m writing! So yes, I think we can learn a lot from teenagers; and probably we have all experienced moments in our adult lives where we feel like we are back in high school. My goal is to try to develop a theory about those moments, and the conditions under which they arise. Stay tuned!<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone responsible for creating a bullying policy in an activist organisation, I look forward to reading this! We believe that we should be the change we want to be in society and trying to navigate writing policies for how to handle situations where some members may not live up to that, but also where we treat these situations with empathy and compassion is incredibly difficult. I really look forward to reading your book and seeing how I can use your teachings!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dr. Faris,<br />
I am interested in studying the ability of victimized parties to recognize abuse in non-romantic contexts such as workplace/employer abuse, abuse in friendships, and abuse from other authority figures such as teachers, landlords, coaches, etc. I am curious at what point &quot;bullying&quot; becomes abuse, or if you consider these terms relatively synonymous. Additionally, why do you think it is so difficult for people to recognize abuse as abuse (or bullying as bullying) when it comes from similarly socially tiered individuals, or in contexts in which we are not trained to recognize it (as I noted above)?</p></div>		</li>
