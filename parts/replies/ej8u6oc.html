			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't so much a solution but I found exhausting myself helps. Either physically or mentally. I've been programming and that really does it for me. Also picked up a treadmill to have it available.  </p>
<p>Just something to try. (\^.\^)b</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lack of mindfulness may also contribute to this. Most folk are either busy or constantly bombarded with outside stimuli throughout the day that introspective, wandering thought gets backlogged until the late hours of the night, where the introspection turns more to ruinous ruminations. </p>
<p>Then there's the whole &quot;unwinding&quot; process. Late eating, caffeine, blue-light exposure, distractions, ect, keep you wired until it's time to sleep, and you lay there still &quot;on&quot; with nothing but your thoughts, exacerbating the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My approach to challenges has been to ramp up on caffeine or whatnot, and attack the problem.  Sometimes, people are really impressed.  But when it wears off, things can get suddenly horrible.  I’ve been coached to limit my caffeine, stimulants.  That clearly helps.  But I like it so much, find it hard to stay with the program.  Sunday evenings can be particularly challenging as 1- caffeine wearing off, 2- the weekend is over and that’s sad, 3- I neglected some tasks I should have done. 3a- one of those tasks was calling family members.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep going through caffeine cycle. I love cola and redbulls. But I know they are bad for me. So I quit and then it takes a while for my body to adjust back to no stimulants. But then I cave and get back on them and am SO productive for a few weeks while my body is receptive to it.</p>
<p>But then my body gets used to a certain level of caffeine and I am back to the same level of usefulness as I had before caffeine except now I am getting a sugar crash so I am only productive during my caffeine drinking.</p>
<p>I think the best thing is to just quit it all and work on sleep and focus exercises instead of taking more and more caffeine to get that productive high. Any drug you take will require more and more to hit the same level and at some point it will be too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had many packages arrive at my door without knowing that I had bought something. I take sleeping pills (not every night) 1-2 nights a week (Sonata) and, apparently, I buy things when the pills kick in but I never remember buying them. I have never bought anything that I didn't previously think about buying but sometimes they are things that I have decided I did not need at that time. It's like random package Christmas 365 for me. </p></div>		</li>
