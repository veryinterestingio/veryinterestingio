			<div class="markdown"><p>As a doctor, it would be important to know which disease markers differ across populations to avoid misdiagnoses. For example, a study of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy identified a number of genetic variants associated with the disease but it turns out many of these pathogenic variants were benign in individuals of African Ancestry. It is also important to inform patients of non-European ancestry about this issue so that they themselves can be aware of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with Jessica. It's important to know the caveats for some clinically available genetic tests. For example, PGx (pharmacogenomics) can use personal variants to inform metabolism status for certain medications. However, much of the data scientists have this far is Eurocentric. Thus, it's largely not applicable to other ancestries in that if a test comes back negative for &quot;known&quot; variants, it doesn't inform you of the presence of other as of now uncharacterized variants that could alter metabolism status.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with what others have said. I think it's important to not make broad assumptions about diseases or treatments based on studies from a subset only. We know that certain groups respond to certain drugs differently based on their genetics and the function of metabolizing enzymes encoded by the corresponding genes. Therefore, I would encourage you to listen to your patients and pay attention to what they may have to say about their health, response to treatments and medications or any adverse events that they may experience. Not because the majority of people or people from a different ancestry had a certain response, it means everyone will do. Ultimately that's the goal of precision medicine, to provide care that is aware of each individual patient and you can start implementing precision medicine by listening to your patients now.</p></div>		</li>
