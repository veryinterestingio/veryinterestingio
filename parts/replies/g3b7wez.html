			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this was the kind of thinking that came as a bit of a surprise to her. It's often remarked upon how paramedics and the like will show up and not pronounce someone dead even though there's 14 bullet wounds and 8 stab wounds to the torso, or something equally as ridiculous. But it's simply because they literally can't. People pull through and survive the most insane stuff for reasons that defy logic and/or science itself.</p>
<p>If ever in doubt about the insanity that is human survival, Google 'Vesna Vulovic'. Tl;Dr though, she survived a fall of over 10,000 meters after a briefcase bomb caused a plane to crash in 1972.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Sometimes it's just a bit of showmanship for the distraught family or onlookers. Like that dude that shot himself in the head running from the cops recently: he was dead before he hit the ground, but the cops still made it look like they were going to save his life because it looks good and it helps assuage the conscience because they did what they could.</p></div>		</li>
