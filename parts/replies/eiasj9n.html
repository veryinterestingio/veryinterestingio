<p>Slightly unrelated note. But this really made me think that the idea from Hitchhiker's Guide of using The Earth/Humans as a program to calculate something.</p>
<p>If you could design a species that somehow followed a path that would lead to an answer for an NP problem, then in a way we could create a computer to calculate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that somebody conjured that if time machine is possible (creating a closed time-loop that can exist long enough to allow information to flow back), then we can solve any NP or even harder like PSPACE problem in constant time.</p>
<p>But of course, it doesn't help with undecidable problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a plot point in Stephen Baxter's Xeelee Sequence of stories, I can't remember exactly which story the idea was featured in though. The concept was to check if a drone already knew the answer, and if not launch it FTL around a short &quot;time-like curve&quot; while it computed a step of a recursive algorithm. Since the drone arrived before it left, it created a new history where it had already computed the answer. And since the algorithm was recursive, any number of future drones could be used to compute a problem of any complexity in zero time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is absolutely the wrong way to think about nondeterministic polynomial time decision problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey it's not that far off... a TM that gets to branch at every time step effectively ultimately runs exponentially many copies. Details omitted about accept conditions. I see that this is effectively allowing a really high branching factor in the first step, so if you take me literally I've described something more powerful than a nondeterministic TM.... It's true that &quot;polytime verifiable solution&quot; is the intuition I use in practice. I also described it this way to illustrate the notion of &quot;modified machine&quot; more directly.</p></div>		</li>
