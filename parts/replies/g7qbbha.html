			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment section is the first time I learned I'm not all by my lonesome thinking the solid food poops are better.  As if there's a choice between poop up baby's back 3 times a day and actually making it through the day in the same onesie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter sneezed during a change once. </p>
<p>Always lay the new diaper under the old one. The fresh diaper was curled up, and caught the ensuing projection. Literally dodged a bullet with that one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. One time I was changing a diaper, pulled up my kid's legs up and back for a real good back to front wipe and it apparently turned my kid into a shit cannon. There was shit shot about 8 feet away, which is where the crib was. There was shit stream from the changing table all the way across the slats of the long front side of the crib and the slats on the head of the crib and the wall behind that. It would have gone farther if the wall wasn't right there. It took a solid hour to clean up the mess properly, most if which was spent sobbing from delirious and depressive sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>That was the single worst 3am wake up of all time.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention the room is wall to wall carpeted. It was a really shitty situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if they haven’t pooped in a long time, and aren’t on solids yet, BE PREPARED.  Soooooo muccccch liquid poop.  Mine let loose in a huge (touristy) cathedral in Europe, the fart and the grunt reverberated in a hallow building meant to amplify the worlds most beautiful choir voices, everyone in it stopped to figured out what it was, only to see my babies shirt, my shirt and the baby carrier slowly turn wet and yellow all the way up to her hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine didn't poop for about a week (for anyone wondering, this is normal when they get to about 3-4 months old) and when he did HOOOOO BOY.</p>
<p>Imagine guacamole that is starting to go off. Smooth, yet thick, with an off green-starting-to-go-brown color, and seedy bits. Also the smell. And there was just SO MUCH.</p></div>		</li>
