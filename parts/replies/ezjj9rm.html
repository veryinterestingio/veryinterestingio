			<div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum to this, artists are so influenced by the myriad of artists that came before them that there is a very fine line between influence and stealing. It's often quite hard to definitely say one or the other unless it's massively obvious. </p>
<p>That's why you see so many lawsuits between artists in the news - you can hear influence in a lot of songs that come out that can legitimately be claimed as stealing by the people who think they're the influencers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an amateur musician.   So many times I'll create something and go, &quot;Man, that's awesome but it kinda sounds familiar.&quot;  Only to learn I'm just playing a variation on an old song I know but haven't heard in years.  It's incredibly hard to create something that sounds totally new.  Everything we create (music, paintings, etc) is built from what we already know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think music is the easiest art form to risk accidentally copying something. There’s only so many ways to combine 12 different notes, and even fewer ways where it actually flows together properly.</p>
<p>Painting on the other hand, is much harder to copy something exactly if you were to do something from scratch. You can’t accidentally copy the Mona Lisa, it will never look remotely the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably should also be noted that there is a long tradition of artists just completely lifting music (and sometimes lyrics) without attribution. This largely stems from an era when music wasn't an &quot;industry.&quot; 20th century examples are so numerous and common that I won't enumerate. A vast number of Blues, Folk, Jazz, and &quot;Country&quot; standards recorded before the mid-century are wholly or largely lifted from original or traditional works. This wasn't considered plagiarism (at least until sheet music publication became lucrative). Woody Guthrie lifted music all the time, as did Leadbelly, et. al. You might even make a case that Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on Greensleeves illustrates how normal it was to use pre-existing music for &quot;original&quot; composition. Early Rock and Folk superstars like Zeppelin and Dylan grew up on genres where liberal appropriation was the norm and in Zeppelin's case it led to much controversy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Robert Plant was asked how he felt about other artists stealing Zeppelin's music and said that since they did the same thing they really can't complain.</p>
<p>EDIT: shortly after posting this comment the song Failsafe from The New Pornographers album Challenger came up on iTunes. It's a clear ripoff of Zep's South Bound Saurez from In Through the Out Door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite examples of this is that Richard Strauss thought that the music of Funiculi Funicula was a Neapolitan folk song and just used the melody in one of his compositions, which would have been perfectly legal, except that it was actually an original composition that had been done six years before and he was sued by the composer. The same also holds true for words. The poet Robert Burns collected and published many poems and songs that were essentially just his adaptations of the folk songs sung in Scotland at the time but which hadn't received publication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if I really agree with your choice of words; it’s not really “lifting” if you’re not claiming credit for it. Like to my knowledge Leadbelly never claimed he wrote House of the Rising Son or Where Did You Sleep Last Night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id say an interesting sidenote is sampling. One example being &quot;Land Down Under&quot; by men at work. They sampled an Australian nursery ryhme, &quot;Kookaburra Sits In The Old Gum Tree&quot;, thinking it was okay, but later got sued because it had a copyright holder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The women who wrote kooksburra never took issue. After she died a publisher bought the rights them sued and won. So a few business made millions even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the song. It strikes me as pretty much just a scam.</p></div>		</li>
