			<div class="markdown"><p>Also dentist here, I think it's also important to note that in general people are going to cause gingival recession more with a manual toothbrush than with a sonic. I find that it is far easier for my patients to use a sonic properly than to use a manual brush properly. Yes your dentist should be observing your brushing techniques and teaching you but my point still stands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, depending on your gum type, or if you use a hard toothbrush, you can cause gum recession or enamel wear. Usually it’s recommended to use a soft bristle head. Some Oral-B’s has an indicator light to let you know you’re brushing too hard. Your dentist can usually tell if you are or not. It doesn’t take a lot to remove plaque, so go easy. It’s more important to make sure you do it twice a day, especially before bed and don’t eat or drink anything but water after you brush at night. It’s a balancing act between things that protect your teeth vs factors that cause cavities. If one is tipped towards either side than you’ll be susceptible. Things like brushing, flossing, having fluoride, using mouth rinses, drinking sugary drinks only during meals if at all, avoid snacking on sugary or carbs heavy foods vs not doing proper oral hygiene, genetics, drinking and snacking throughout the day, not enough fluoride, etc. everyone’s a little different.</p></div>		</li>
