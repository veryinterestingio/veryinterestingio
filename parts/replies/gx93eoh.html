<p>Is this because the reflection doesn't happen exactly at the surface as it does in metals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Porcelain has a lot of grains and holes althoug it can have a smooth surface. The light will scatter at those spots which leads to a diffuse reflection. Similar to when a mirror has a lot of cracks. It loses then the ability to reflect light specularly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is exactly the reason. In metals light is not allowed to enter deeper into the material and is immediately perfectly specularly reflected.</p>
<p>In materials such as marble, the light enters into several layers of microscopic marble clumps (that together form the whole marble structure) and at each interaction with such clumps has a chance of specularly reflecting. Since these clumps are usually attached to each other at odd angles. The light will reflect in an odd direction, and maybe even interact with another clump again. This is called subsurface scattering.</p>
<p>If it manages to leave the surface again, the direction of the light at that point will be pretty random. Which causes us to see these escaping light rays from every angle, i.e. it is diffusely reflecting :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you are interested and you want to play around with materials, Blender 3D really got you covered.
You'll learn quite a bit about materials, colors lightpaths and why some things look like they do, by simply trying to recreate certain materials in the material nodes editor. It does have a bit of a learning curve to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For clarity, the angle of reflection is ALWAYS equal to the angle of incidence with respect to the surface the light strikes. This is the Law of reflection. </p>
<p>Mirror vs. white surface boils down to smooth vs. rough texture at the scale of the wavelength of visible light. If the surface is smooth, all light is reflected in the same direction, if the surface is not smooth, light is reflected in all directions. </p>
<p>This link has a good illustration. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment you replied to should really edit their response.</p>
<p>To be clear: The law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection) is absolute. A single ray of light (or any other wave) will always reflect at an equal angle relative to the normal of the surface it is hitting. The only difference between objects that have specular vs diffuse reflection is how smooth the surface is, regardless of material. Material will only effect how smooth the surface can typically be and how much of the wave is reflected vs absorbed/refracted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This law is just a way of thinking about things. Actually all light is scattered in every directionâ€”even on a mirror. The reason that it appears to reflect at an equal angle of incidence is Huygens' principle: All of the other reflected angles destructively interfere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do we know why this happens on a subatomic level? Correct me if my understanding is wrong but I thought the way it worked was a photon is absorbed and then reemitted. After its absorbed what prevents the atom from emitting a photon at a different angle? Some sort of conservation of energy thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't happen on a subatomic level.  On a subatomic level, light scatters in every direction, on any surface including mirrors.  The reason that it appears to reflect on a mirror is because of destructive interference, which is Huygens' principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe &quot;mirrors&quot; (as in literal mirrors, not just anything with a mirror finish) are actually blue-green, because they don't reflect all of the colors equally. So if you put two mirrors facing each other, the reflections get more blue-green as they get &quot;deeper&quot;</p></div>		</li>
