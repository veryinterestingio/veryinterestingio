			<div class="markdown"><p>what's really fun is  your limbic system rewarding prefrontal cortex's planning, but not it's execution. Which means you can spend hours planning to do stuff and it your limbic system gives you dopamine like you've already done it, and then you never execute the plan, but your brain is happy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that I think about it, isnt this exact problem super common? There's that meme like &quot;I'm less of a crafter and more of a craft-supply collector.&quot; I know I've been doing this for years with all my craft supplies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep. Essentially your limbic system can't tell the difference between making art and thinking about making art, but making art takes a LOT longer, and isn't as perfect as when you thought about how it would turn out.</p></div>		</li>
