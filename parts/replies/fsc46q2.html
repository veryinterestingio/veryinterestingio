			<div class="markdown"><p>Looked this up, and interestingly enough, the Navajo Code Talkers weren't the first U.S. Code Talkers.</p>
<p>In WWI, they used Choctaw and Cherokee speakers.</p>
<p>And in WWII, they also used Hopi speakers.</p>
<p>P.S. They also used Comanche and Meskwaki speakers in WWII</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other Native American code talkers were deployed by the United States Army during World War II, including Lakota,[3] Meskwaki, Mohawk,[4][5] Comanche, Tlingit,[6] Hopi,[7] Cree and Crow soldiers; they served in the Pacific, North African, and European theaters.[8]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, even English is hard on reddit. People really need context to understand. Many users here use no punctuation, and they don't provide context. It is impossible to understand them, even though I'm a native English speaker.</p>
<p>People need to realize that humour is dangerous when building good relationships, because it isn't always clear who is being made fun of. Is he acting stupid like &quot;them&quot; to make fun of them? Is he making acting stupid like &quot;us&quot; to make fun of us? We need context!</p>
<p>So, I can imagine how difficult it was for the Japanese to decipher.</p></div>		</li>
