			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that precise measurements of G require that you know the mass of the larger mass with a high degree of precision. This is what stops us from using celestial bodies with large masses and sizable gravitational pulls to make these measurements. If we knew the mass of the Earth down to the kilogram, finding G would be easy. Unfortunately we have no way of calculating the mass of the Earth or any other planet/star without using G, so using those masses to calculate G would be circular logic. Instead we have to use objects that we can determine their masses independent of G and that forces scientists to use much smaller masses with much weaker gravitational forces.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm probably misunderstanding, but the experiment mentioned in the original comment calculates G uses Earth's pull, right? If determining G requires to know the mass of the largest object with a high degree of precision wouldn't that create another case of circular logic where we need G to determine Earth's mass precisely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the experiment described, we just need to know the acceleration due to gravity of the Earth at that point, which can be done with precision since it's just a time/distance measurement. The we can measure G by measuring how a known mass changes that acceleration through it's gravitational pull, which requires the precise mass measurement I described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the acceleration in Earth's gravity that you're using to calculate G.  It's how much <em>different</em> it is when you put your own big known weight nearby.</p>
<p>However, &quot;acceleration towards earth mass&quot; and &quot;acceleration towards earth mass, minus acceleration towards big weight we put above it&quot; are going to be very very similar, due to the extreme difference between &quot;Earth&quot;, and &quot;a big thing we put there&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So recently they decided to base the exact weight of a kilogram to be based off a certain amount of atoms of a certain Silicium-isotope, defining the exact weight of a kilogram by that specific number, which in order was based on Avogadro’s constant which was redefined in the same experiment, right? </p>
<p>As the exact weight was already up in the air, wouldn’t it have been easier to first set a value for G, then estimate the kg off of that as closely as possible, and then redefine that exact definition of kg as something based off an exact amount of silicium-atoms? </p>
<p>I feel like this doesn’t work because you’d appoint two constants (the number of atoms Silicium in a kilogram, and G, which is connected to kg somehow) arbitrarily, but I’d like to know for sure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new definition of the kilogram links it to Planck's constant, which was previously known to 9 digits as opposed to G's 4. By basing the kilogram to a fundamental constant, the kilogram inherits that constant's previous precision and the constant becomes exact. Thus it was desirable to base the kilogram on a constant that we could measure the the highest precision possible and Planck's constant was 100,000X more precise than G, hence why it was chosen. </p>
<p>There was a bid to base the kilogram as X number of silicon atoms but it lost out due to being difficult to implement in a lab.</p></div>		</li>
