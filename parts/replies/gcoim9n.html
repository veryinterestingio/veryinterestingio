<p>Both the Sun and the Moon contributes to tides. When they are in line with each other their pull adds up and we call them &quot;spring&quot; tides. When the Moon is at first and third quarter the tides are weakest (&quot;neap&quot; tides).</p>
<p>If there was no Moon we would have tides that were somewhere between &quot;spring&quot; and &quot;neap&quot; tides in strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it would be weaker than neap tides. It would be about the difference of the two types as Neap still follow the moon but the sun detracts form the effect. It would still happen daily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't sure how much impact the sun has on tides, interesting to know it does. So it's like waveforms, addiding or subtracting depending on when they align. So when the sun and moon align (solar eclipse) there would be the highest/lowest tides, other way around (lunar eclipse) is the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also worth noting that as the moon was a lot closer to the Earth, those tidal ranges have been a lot larger in the past. What is a few metres now could have several hundred, if not kilometres.</p>
<p>We like to imagine that the first animals on land took its steps of its own volition, struggling with its own weight to make its difficult journey, a hardy explorer, but they were probably swept in by the tide and struggled to survive for about twelve hours until the tide swept back in again.</p></div>		</li>

Killometer (1000x)meter(1000x) millimeter
Decemeters(1/10 meter) , centimetres(1/100) ect all fit between those scales</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the beginning of the answer - since land-based life either wouldn't evolve or would evolve very differently, life on earth would be vastly different. What exactly the differences are would just be conjecture, so I didn't go into it.</p>
<p>Suppose there's still the first half of the question, but it depends on what you mean by &quot;survival&quot;. If it's just keeping the planet spherical, then no, but keeping it habitable? Very much so.</p></div>		</li>
