			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The best survivors are usually the ones best suited to the environment. It makes sense that certain traits might make their rounds if the conditions are the same for long enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the problem with short hands for evolution. Essentially what is being said is that there was a favorable reproductive benefit (more offspring survived) to looking more like seagrass. So there may have been disadvantages (such as access to food) but on balance ancestors had a net reproductive benefit. Extinction of rivals is not necessary, but it can open environmental niches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't mean to say there is a motivation to be more 'naturally selectable'. I meant, the more you are able to hide in seagrass, the more 'naturally selectable' you are.</p></div>		</li>
