			<div class="markdown"><p>basically the reason we have to eat healthy is because the human body LOVES fatty and sweet foods. Your brain was built to make you seek out and consume those things in abundance because it wants to live.</p>
<p>this is why certain foods are more &quot;filling&quot; than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the average person sits down in front of a bowl of ice cream a piece of our ancestors comes to life in our brain to tell us “you better eat all of that, it’s got tons of calories and taste good, you never know when we’ll find this again, consume now! Don’t stop!” The caveman speaking is thinking about that one fruit tree he found that one time that was delicious and filling and who knows when that tree will bloom again or if I’ll find another so better consume it now and not let it go to waste. </p>
<p>But now we can just go get another gallon of ice cream or a bag of delicious chocolates in a moments notice, hell your ancestor had to climb forty feet up a tree just for a snack. We can press 3 buttons, walk to the door and have food for a week. That’s why we have to be mindful about our diets because we still have that lizard brain telling us to eat it all before the 10,000 pound mega tiger comes back to the area or the terror bird catches us out in the open. </p>
<p>Check out the book “Saipens” by Yuval Harari he does a significantly better job explaining this and a lot of other aspects of human behavior and culture from a high level, spanning across the majority of human history. It’s an amazing read.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you try to eat a pound of fat, you get the same result.</p>
<p>Except, if you eat a doughnut that's equal parts fat and sugar, your hunger <em>won't</em> be suppressed and you'll be able to keep eating. The only thing that'll stop you then will be the thought that &quot;Shit, i'm gonna get fat&quot;. For some people, that thought doesn't really lead to them stopping.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact: when humans started to settle down and start agriculture instead of being hunter-gatherers child mortality actually went <em>up</em> in the beginning. The life of the first farmers was worse than of the hunters. Only with time this life improved because of (iirc) better tools and selective breeding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wasn't this proven to be false and their teeth were just as awful? Vague and it'll be hard for me to actually find a source, but I seem to remember reading about some research or a discovery that said &quot;no, people in older times actually had really unhealthy teeth and their teeth being healthy was a misconception.</p></div>		</li>

<p>100g of wheat flour only has 0.3g of sugar.</p>

<p>I recall a book or article we read back in the undergrad anthropology classes in the early 90s where some one had gone back the the same people in more current times and taken comparison photos of people’s teeth and smiles.</p>
<p>The difference was astounding and really sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Your mouth is a breeding ground for bacteria. Plaque is the buildup of bacteria  and can do serious damage when it becomes tartar. Even wild animals suffer from teeth problems. </p>
<p>Sugar by itself is not bad, its really does damage if you eat or drink alot of it throughout the day instead  of just all at once but sugar cases cavities different problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>not to mention that you basically only needed to live up until you were old enough to raise children.</p>

<p>Well, not <em>exactly</em>...living long enough to be a grandparent has been important for long enough to make an impact on our biology; humans tend to live significantly longer than great apes, and this is true both when comparing them &quot;in the wild&quot; or when both are given access to lots of modern medicine.  Humans either don't age as fast, or at least keep going when aged, better than apes.  Hunter gatherers can live past their 60's or even 70's and age fairly similarly to other people...provided they are fortunate enough not to get killed by something first.</p>
<p>That's the real danger...a diet of natural foods and the exercise you get is quite healthy, but there's a distinct lack of emergency rooms available to them.</p></div>		</li>
