			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: a large part of the work of a body guard is to plan ahead (usually as part of a team) to make sure neither they nor their client are put in a position where anyone has to take a bullet for anyone else. There are plans, fallback plans, and contingency plans for just about everything, but especially focusing on keeping the client moving when they're supposed to be moving, or make sure nobody else is moving if the client is meant to be stopped.</p>
<p>Most of protecting somebody is making sure nobody else gets the chance to cause an incident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the to add: Even when you see something close to the Hollywood clich√© of a bodyguard(s) putting themselves between a client and an attacker it's not (really) about them trying to &quot;take a  bullet&quot; for their client - it's a way of moving their client (and themselves) to safety that minimises the chance of the attacker being able to get a clean shot - the theory being that even if they do get shot they're putting themselves in the best possible position for it to be non-fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even James Brady, who literally took a bullet for President Reagan did so only because he turned around at the sound of the shots to see where the shooter was, not because he dramatically dove in front of the president.  Heres a good news segment on it:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If you have to take a bullet for your client then you have done something wrong earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really only true for heads of state and other clients of comparable wealth.</p>
<p>The Secret Service's operations are pretty massive - entire teams of people planning the president's every footstep weeks or months in advance, controlling the entire surrounding area, etc.</p>
<p>That's not even remotely true for a smaller target, like let's say an entertainer with one or two bodyguards. When Miley Cyrus or Kevin Hart or LeBron James or whomever goes out for dinner, their bodyguards don't have the luxury of securing the area weeks in advance and making sure there are no good sniping positions or whatever along their routes, setting up secure perimeters with screening checkpoints, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It's easier to put yourself in front of a bullet when you are wearing a bullet proof vest.</p>
</li>
<li>A bodyguard also has the benefit of discouraging attacks by their mere presence. Frankly, if I ever get in a situation where I need bodyguards, I'll have them armed with flame throwers, just to really discourage attackers.</li>

<p>This gave me a little chuckle. If you'll indulge me a moment, about 15 years ago I went to Cap D'Antibes in the South of France, it's next to Cannes, the people in Antibe consider Cannes the poor end of the beach.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm there with my friend and we're sailing in his boat when a motor tiller, a very posh one at that came alongside and told us we were sailing in their designated anchor point, they were very polite but very burly and clearly ex-forces, so we sailed away, maybe 10 minutes after that, an abso-fucking-lutely MASSIVE pleasure yacht/ship appeared over the horizon and dropped anchor in the spot where we previously were, besides that were 2 more motor-tillers, so this little flotilla of 4 ships had pretty much taken over the entire bay.</p>
<p>Naturally, their presence created a bit of a stir and the locals wanted to know what these ridiculous penis extensions were doing in their bay. Turned out, it was Abramovich, he'd come to Antibes for the weekend. We learned from the harbour master that he'd requested an exclusion zone around his boats, he also needed the air space above his armada to be declared a no-fly zone and nothing to enter the water beneath his yachts. All this was declined of course but the harbour master learned about some of the defences on that thing, which included former special forces close protection, apparently a submarine of some sort, an armored helicopter as well as various antipiracy defences (none of which he found out specifically what, but he was informed by higher-ups it likely included some surface to air capability, which I don't believe personally).</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, your post reminded me of that and a thought I had at the time: If you need bodyguards then it's a pretty good indicator you've pissed some people off, but who on earth are you running from if you need your own damn navy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When JFK was shot, the body guard that jumped on the back of the car was the Clint Hill.

			<div class="markdown"><p>He did what any bodyguard would do. They were leveraging the accessibility to the president that he wanted due to the election campaign with the security concerns. They reached several compromises. There are speculation that some of these decisions could have made it harder for the assassin. For example a few seconds before the shots Clint Hill were standing on the back bumper of the car which would have partially shielded the President. The car were also driving faster. However the President had requested that the car slow down and the bodyguards back off when they got to crowded areas. The Secret Service did everything in their power to make it more secure. So Clint Hill did what any other bodyguard would do and followed the security protocols in place. But it is understandable that he ended up with depression. He was also close to the President and particularly the First Lady.</p></div>		</li>
