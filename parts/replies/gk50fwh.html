			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the answer!</p>
<p>I was wondering about lighter elements, i.e. not the island of stability. I was curious if perhaps there are isotopes of lighter elements which weren't produced by naturally occurring nucleosynthetic processes. </p>
<p>And I guess the answer is no!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is always the odd process here and there that produces them.</p>
<p>As an example, if you only consider the main fusion processes then you won't see any stable beryllium and boron appearing in them. They are produced when high energy particles hit larger nuclei and split them. They are very rare in the universe, but still common enough on Earth to have commercial applications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A way in which a stable isotope fails to be produced is if it is surrounded by other stable isotopes blocking the decay paths that can lead to the production via radioactive decay. Take tantalum-180 (180Ta). It is too heavy to be produced directly in fusion and too far from the neutron capture paths to be produced directly. The beta decays are blocked because the stable isotopes 180Hf and 180W block the beta- and beta+ paths. 184Re does not alpha decay to it, so it turns out the main production mechanism is the capture of neutrinos on the stable neighbours in the shockfront of a supernova.
The result is that 180Ta is the most rare stable isotope we have on earth at 0.012% of all tantalum (99.982% is 181Ta).  180Ta also has long and short lived isomers, which play a role in these situations and the understanding its production in nature is an interesting current topic in nuclear physics.  </p>
<p>Sidenote: It is also one of only a handful of stable odd-odd isotopes (2H, 6Li, 10B, 14N, 40K*, 50V* 138La* 180Ta* Lu176*. The ones with &quot;*&quot; are in a similarly blocked position)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow, no wonder it's rare!</p></div>		</li>
