<p>This is a great example of what it means in terms of how much sugar goes into the glass. </p>
<p>On the palate, most people wouldn't be able to tell between Extra Brut and Brut Nature. However, if you put a Brut Nature vs Brut next to each other and start with the Nature, you'll notice how much sweeter the Brut actually is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Extra Brut: Even less sugar than that</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note, it's added with the Dosage. Residual Sugar means left over after fermentation, while the Dosage is added after primary and secondary fermentation...so RS is kind of misleading in this case, though the term is still used in traditional method sparkling wines...which have almost no true residual sugar left before dosage. And it's more about perceptible sweetness, as carbonated beverages will show less sweetness, as the bubbles create sweetness gaps on the tongue, so you aren't tasting it all at one time. Let a Champagne go flat and you'll see how sweet it really is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beer yeast can absolutely eat maltose. It's what makes it beer yeast. </p>
<p>Wine yeasts are a different type of yeast and do not have the genetics that allow them to eat and convert maltose to ethanol. </p>
<p>Brut beers also have  little residual sugar, but for a different reason. Typically, an enzyme is added to breakdown long chain sugars into the simplest form to allow 100% consumption by the available yeast. </p>
<p>Brut simply refers to the perceptible levels of sweetness as brut wines typically have less than 12 g/L of residual sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're really fun to experiment with different types of yeast and showcase different hops. Since attenuation percentages are thrown out the window, any yeast can be used to make them, so it's nice to be able to tailor yeast choice to match hop aromas and flavor and still be able to get that bone dry finish. I brew one every now and then using different types of wine yeast for a fruity peachy flavor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and this is because yeast can’t eat maltose</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But maltose is what constitutes the most of the fermentable sugars in the wort, they're the primary source food for the yeast.</p></div>		</li>
