			<div class="markdown"><p>My mistake! I meant to say when the wave gets bigger.
Amplitude and frequency shifts are modulated by the source (operator).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're talking about two signals here. The &quot;baseband&quot; signal is what the radio operator hears.  They absolutely control the volume (amplitude) and the the channel (frequency). The modulating signal is mixed with the baseband signal.  This is &quot;controlled&quot;  by the radio to reconstruct the baseband signal.</p>
<p>AM: The radio is tuned by the operator to say 600kHz. It receives waves at that frequency. If the waves are low in amplitude, that corresponds to bass sounds. If they are higher in amplitude, higher pitched tones.</p>
<p>FM: The radio is tuned to 98.1MHz. It receives waves at around that frequency. 98.10006 MHz corresponds to bass tones. 98.101 MHz would be a higher pitched tone. (It would actually straddle the modulating frequency, but you get the idea).</p>
<p>A transmitting radio will do this &quot;mixing&quot; (modulating) and the receiving radio will do the demodulating automatically based on the operator-tuned frequency (channel).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radio’s job is to <em>interpret</em> the radio wave signal and convert it to audio. So over AM it pays close attention to small amplitude changes to covert to audio, and over FM it pays attention to small frequency changes. The operator is still ultimately in control since they’re the one who <em>encodes</em> the audio</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are related, but they are not the same,</p>
<p>lambda*frequency = c </p>
<p>where c = the speed of light and lambda = wavelength. The speed of light in a vacuum is constant, so if the frequency gets higher, the wavelength becomes shorter, but the SPEED DOES NOT CHANGE. Every electromagnetic wave travels at c, wifi travels at c, light travels at c, ir waves travel at c.</p></div>		</li>
