<p>Secondly, some people use knowledge of tree growth to shape the trees. <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/gavin-munro-full-grown-tree-furniture/" target="_blank">Tree Furniture</a> is another fascinating way to modify growth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;HYPOTHESIS ON THE ADVANTAGES OF THE CANOPY SHYNESS  </p>
<p>The evolutionary sense of the timidity of the glass remains unknown, although botany has launched several hypotheses:  </p>
<p>It allows a greater penetration of light in the forest to perform photosynthesis more efficiently.  </p>
<p>It avoids damaging the branches and leaves when hit against each other in case of storm or gusts of wind.  </p>
<p>It prevent diseases, larvae and insects that feed on leaves from spreading easily from one tree to another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The timidity of the glass&quot;? Is there a typo in there somewhere? (I realize it's not <em>your</em> typo.)</p>
<p>I was wondering if that was some kind of weird archaic term for crown shyness, but a Google search for it turns up only copies of that article and <a href="https://www.tropicalfishkeeping.com/threads/29-gallon-stocking-ideas-built-around-dwarf-neon-rainbowfish.93351/" target="_blank">this discussion about tropical fish from 2012</a>, in which &quot;the timidity of the glass catfish&quot; is mentioned.</p>
<p>EDIT. And I've been busy researching this when all the while there were a couple of replies that explained it. Well, it was an interesting journey. And thanks /u/debriscazzo and /u/Wavara.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word sense itself tends to invoke the idea of sentience on some level when in reality it can be as basic as a binary system. If light is present then the answer is 1 and the next step starts. If light is not present then the answer is 0 and it moves on to the next check. Most insects work this way which is how we can both see them as living beings and unintelligent beings. Their bodies are closer to being an organic robot than anything else which is how flies for example are able to react so quickly. If any of their senses detect either a positive or negative stimuli then the programming to move towards or away from that stimuli is initiated. No thought involved, which is how they can have reactions in a fraction of a second. I have no idea why I decided to ramble on about this and have steered off topic so how's your day going?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the only issue once you start down the &quot;organic robot&quot; line of thought is, in a rather Asimovian sense, at what point does the organic robot reach a level of sophistication to not longer be considered a robot, and how can such a thing be judged?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't it just that, trees that randomly achieved this outcome did better than trees that grew down and away from sunlight, so over millennia, the trees that were more successful became the predominant species?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP was also asking about how they decide the specific points where runners and limbs decide where to spawn along the distribution of the tree. </p>
<p>Is a new branch/limb on the side of a tree formed where these hormones are most concentrated? Or where there’s the highest amount of light on it? Is it random? </p>
<p>How does a tree decide where to send up shoots along a branch? It’s not a linear distribution (1 runner per six inches or whatever) so how does it decide <em>this spot of my limb right here is where I’m going to start growing a new branch</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The growth hormone comes down from the growing tip of the branch and it suppresses the growth of nodes along the way. After passing enough nodes the hormone is used up so nodes are free to grow. This is why cutting the tip off will cause the next nodes down to start growing.</p>
<p>Of course different plants handle this differently. One that favors the tip of the branch more strongly will be more tree like and one that doesn't will be more shrub like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer!</p>
<p>Would it be more aptly called an anti-growth hormone? Or is it called that because it's a hormone involved in growth, as opposed to encouraging growth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t answer the how, but, the frequency of those limbs tend to follow the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<p>There is probably some form of “when chemical Z potency is less than X, where X is based on recursive parent limb length, grow limb”. I think it is the recursive up the parent limbs where the Fibonacci sequence shows up.</p></div>		</li>
