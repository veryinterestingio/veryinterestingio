			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that it so much went over your head.  I mean the current top answer/ thread with car analogy seems to be talking about a GUI and not even an API.  So if you heard talk like &quot;I used an API to do something cool in some app with data from somewhere else&quot;... or if you support a product as a salesperson and get a &quot;do you have an api so I can do something else in some other app&quot;.... whatever,  you just casually hear about APIs a lot.   So now you are consequently wondering what an API even is so you can actually follow the conversation... the top explanation shouldn't make sense to you because it didn't even talk about multiple apps lol. </p>
<p>I would imagine that the context most people need an API to be ELI5 have something to do with multiple apps talking to each other.  If that is the context (and it probably would be), then most other answers in this case have actually been bad lol,  it wouldn't just be that they are going over your head. </p>
<p>It's just an interface that can be used to have apps talk to each other.  So, they can send and receive data to each other without having to make an entirely new third app that combined the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah honestly most don't read like ELI5 (y'know like will a 5 year old get it?) but explain to another adult who doesn't know what an API is or isn't techy. I guess I've just seen other ELI5 threads where Top comments are more ELI5 level or use a very simple analogy. </p>
<p>The car analogy went over my head also because I'm not a car person lol. </p>
<p>Others in here defined what an API is etc but not really explaining. </p>
<p>So yeah this was the first one that I was like ok understand it in a nutshell now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best and simplest answer.</p>
<p>An API is just a set of public methods another app or program is allowed to call.</p>
<p>And important point is that this comment is not specifying who wrote the software, because there are a lot of possibilities. OP's question assumed that it was big companies letting startups use their software. This is not what most APIs are for.</p>
<p>If I write a library (a piece of software that can be used by other programs), the API is the public functions you can call.</p>
<p>If you use a Google Maps widget on your site, the API is the functions you call to make it appear.</p>
<p>If I write a program that runs in a server (say, to store data), and an app that runs on your phone, I'll add an API to the server part that lets the mobile app communicate with it. Only my app will be communicating with my server application.</p>
<p>If you want to store data on Amazon's servers, you pay them some money, get a special key, and then use that key send them data through their API.</p>
<p>In <strong>practice</strong>, people mostly refer to web APIs. Those basically just look like special urls (my-app.com/users/create, for instance), and when you send a message to that url the web server does something, like create a new user.</p></div>		</li>
