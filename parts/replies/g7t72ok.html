			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there are such things as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_(biology\)" target="_blank">satellite viruses</a> that take advantage of other viruses by co-opting the replication genes of another virus that has infected the same cell. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virophage" target="_blank">Virophages</a> take it further by hijacking the replication factories of other viruses to such an extent that the original virus is inhibited, acting as a parasite of sorts. Fun little trivia!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun and a little bit frightening that even viruses have biological ecosystems inside living organisms. So they act as parasites but don't muscle out the other virus they depend on? Like a virus for a virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One example of this is adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is thought to be beneficial to the host in some cases. This virus isn't able to replicate on its own, so its genome hangs out in the cell, not causing any problems (therefore its not truly a &quot;pathogen&quot;) until another virus that has all of the replication genes comes along. Adenovirus is one virus that can kick start AAV (which is why it got the name AAV), but other examples are more pathogenic, like pox or HPV. Once one of these harmful viruses infects the cell, AAV starts replicating and is able to replicate faster than the harmful virus. It kills the cell and releases a bunch of AAV particles before the HPV viral replication is complete. Therefore, its beneficial because the harmless AAV spreads but the harmful HPV doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are indeed fragments of DNA inside our genome that are basically fossils of old viruses.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what else you mean with &quot;old microbes&quot; though. It's not like there are fragments of bacteria still hanging around somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was thinking of something like our skin and our guts being populated by &quot;old&quot; bacteria (that we picked up once during our evolutionary path) that help our immune system fight off threats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, thanks for the link. in essence, an ancient retrovirus gave human bodies the ability to produce a protein that fuses cells together into a wall.. defined as a placenta. Now, I wonder if there are other viruses that can give us more.. particular abilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd bet money that much of the friendly flora in our gut was once mildly dangerous. Random selection did its work and some that survived became benign, even beneficial, and evolved into a new environment that favored them.</p></div>		</li>
