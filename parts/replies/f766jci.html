			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually true. They used to say MPB was passed along from the mom and skips a generation. Firstly of course, it's passed along just as frequently from the father. But secondly it doesn't really skip a generation on the mother's side. They just don't have testicles. If you injected them with testosterone they'd lose hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um no. You can get it from both sides. There also is no single gene so right off the bat that's a ridiculous statement. There are multiple genes involved.</p></div>		</li>
