<p>Some HR departments just write in what they want in an applicant and then expect people just below those requirements to either apply, if they are motivated enough, or not bother trying to apply if they lack that motivation. It winnows out the chaff.</p>

<p>It also makes sure you hire someone who is comfortable lying to you and about the work they do. I have been basically told I did not get one job because I didn't lie in the interview. I was asked if I liked doing paperwork (a small part of the job) and said no but that is what you pay me for. I was told that's why I didn't get the job because the other person said they love doing it. I said you know the other person is lying and they said yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, and I don't understand why companies don't get this. I was a hiring manager for a while, and I <em>never</em> thought &quot;hey, you know what would be great? If I restricted the pool of applicants to liars.&quot; What's the theoretical value there? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks good on the short term for the people doing the hiring and by the time the employees start to fail they've moved on. I'm constantly amazed at how many successful people can't or won't think long term. It's like slash and burn farming, we all know it's the wrong way to do things but it's so easy and quick.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That hit close to home. When I was first looking for a job as a fresh college grad, I was once asked, &quot;if we offered you this job, would you accept it?&quot;  This wasn't a firm offer, and at that point they hadn't told me any information about salary, benefits, or literally anything else, so I told them I was incredibly interested but would like to know more before I outright accepted. I was called up the next day and told that I wasn't chosen because &quot;you only said you're incredibly interested, and everyone else said they'd take it no matter what.&quot;</p>
<p>I've since learned that that company had obscenely low pay, was pretty much circling the drain at the time, and was notorious for shitty hiring practices. Bullet dodged, I guess?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but unfortunately it's rare to find a company that doesn't want you to lie to them. So it's hard to be employed without being a liar since the system is designed by and for liars.</p></div>		</li>
