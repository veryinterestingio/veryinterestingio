			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend works in radiation physics. I have been advised by him that since I have very dense breast tissue, a mammogram is not going to be super useful for me. Since I have zero family history, and do regular self-exams, it would seem that the radiation dose combined with the fact that I have really dense tissue is likely to be worse than doing nothing. Plus, I am only 40. So far I have been ignoring the emails to get it done. I don't want my breast squeezed and irradiated unnecessarily. I would be more than happy to do an ultrasound or blood test, but so far that has not been offered. I may even look into thermal imaging. My tissue is not going to compress much and it is not likely to show much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have dense breast tissue. I'm about to turn 43. Two and change years ago (10/26/16) I had my first ever mammogram. Then an ultrasound. Then a biopsy. Then a lumpectomy. Then radiation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Get your mammograms.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edited to fix how long ago 2016 was. Time flies. BTW, it didn't hurt that much. Definitely more problematic than pain is the extra radiation. Also, I felt no lump at all. It was a routine mammogram.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>ETA: Thanks, kind redditor for the GOLD! My first ever!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a mammographer, this is the worst advice I've ever heard. If you have dense breast tissue you should look for a place that had 3D mammography (also known as tomosynthesis)</p>
<p>Women of average risk (little or no family history or risk factors) are recommended to start yearly mammograms at 40. 8 out of 9 women in the U.S. diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history. </p>
<p>It takes a breast cancer an average of 7-9 years of growing to be palpable. So while self exams are important, they are not the be all end all. We find cancers that are literally sized in mm, not even cm yet.</p>
<p>Do what you want, but you should really get your medical advice from a doctor, not a physicist who doesn't actually treat patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will look up tomosynthesis. Thank you. He is not a random physicist, he builds the mammography machines and said they are not designed to see trough dense tissue. I do usually discuss these things with my doctor, but insight from the machine developer is nice as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hope your friend isn't certified by the ABR (American Board of Radiology) giving advice like that.  We do cost-benefit analysis while considering risk factors to determine when and how to provide a proven benefit to patients that significantly exceeds the cost (including false positives) of performing the screening.</p>
<p>You should have access to 3D/Tomo which is both more sensitive and specific (more correct) than conventional 2d and if necessary Ultrasound or more likely MRI.  False positives are TERRIBLE but not finding a True Positive until it's too late due to poor advice is unimaginably worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been told by my doctor that 2-d is all they offer. I mentioned in my post that I was willing to do other things, just not that. He is not a radiologist, but builds the mammography machines and so does have insight into how they work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. It's all about tissue density: bone density &gt;&gt; tumor &gt; normal breast tissue. The more atoms packed into a certain amount of space, the more X-ray photons can be absorbed. Even if we could compress bone there would be no need because the significant density difference yields a very clear image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know anything about the 3D testing system someone else in this thread was talking about? Apparently that also uses x-rays? Why is it not necessary to squeeze the breast tissue in the 3D machine? If you're familiar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CT scanners use x-radiation as well and they are used to see the brain, lungs, intestines, veins. Itâ€™s all about the density differences (calculated in Houndsfield units).</p></div>		</li>
