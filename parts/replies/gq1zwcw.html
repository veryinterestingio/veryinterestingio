<p>Also, what happens when someone starts talking? Would their voice be cancelled out too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely you could get noise canceling headphones for this. I have tried a few different ones, here's what I've found. I use a $20 pair of passive noise canceling headphones for cutting the grass. They're like the big foam ear muffs that people use for hearing protection at work or at a gun range, just with headphone speakers inside. They work well enough that I can listen to audio books while using a lawnmower, pretty impressive.</p>
<p>I briefly had a pair of Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds after doing a bunch of research and seeing recommendations on Reddit. They use active noise canceling (ANC). They were incredible, they blocked out pretty much any background noise. I mentioned in another comment how I was wearing them at work, accidentally set off the alarm and didn't even notice the siren going off for several minutes. There are also different levels of noise canceling to let in outside sound, including blocking background noise while still allowing voices. You could actually use them to hear people more clearly in loud environments if you wanted. The only reason I sold them was they didn't fit my ears that well and were frequently falling out.</p>
<p>Next I bought the Jabra Elite 85H. They were still pretty good, but the Bluetooth connectivity was glitchy and the ANC would sometimes glitch and I would hear annoying pops.</p>
<p>Finally I got Sony WH-1000XM4 over the ear ANC headphones. Surprisingly they don't block sound as well as the earbuds, but they are still very, very good. They also allow customizable levels of noise canceling with an option to allow voices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't own any myself so I can't speak to specifics but I think air passengers are often a target market for these. Just how much you'll get out of a set is probably going to vary by make and model though. Over the ear big headphones are gonna be more effective than earbuds as well.</p>
<p>And yes, they block people's voices just like any other sound.</p></div>		</li>
