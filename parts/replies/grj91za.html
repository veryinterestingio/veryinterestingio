			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can recover usable fissile material from spent fuel for use in a reactor, you can use that material in nuclear weapons as well.  The U.S. led the way to prevent commercial power technology from being used to produce weapons material: we've historically tried to keep those two technologies separate, and strongly encouraged other countries to do so as well: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty\_on\_the\_Non-Proliferation\_of\_Nuclear\_Weapons" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty\_on\_the\_Non-Proliferation\_of\_Nuclear\_Weapons</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are basically two kinds of &quot;nuclear waste&quot; from fission reactors: transuranic elements/actinides which are produced from uranium absorbing neutrons without undergoing fission, and fission products. The former can sometimes undergo fission from high-energy neutrons. These wastes are very long-lived (half-lives on the order of thousands of years). Fission products, on the other hand, don't have much (if any) capability to undergo fission. No matter what reactor system you use, you'll always have fission products, but the upside is that the major fission products have much shorter half-lives than the transuranics and actinides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is largely a question of politics and economics.</p>
<p>In the USA it is illegal to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. Also, in the USA by law, the long term handling of spent fuel in the federal governments responsibility. The power stations pay a tax to this end. Finally, uranium is very cheap. So there isn't a huge push by the industry to change the laws. Although many individuals in the field strongly believe that we should reprocess.</p>
<p>In contrast, France for example, reprocesses most of their the spent fuel.</p></div>		</li>
