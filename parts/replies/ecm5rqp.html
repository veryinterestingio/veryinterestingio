			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who makes and grows embryos in an ivf lab every day, i can tell you the change from maternal to embryonic occurs at the 8 cell stage in humans. Each species have their own stage, ours is on day 3 post insemination. The embryo then compacts into what we call a morula indicating the embryonic genome has turned on. Its at this stage that patients lose about 40-70% of their embryos due to arresting (age dependant ofc) and bc of this selection process is the reason most ivf clinics culture past day 3 to day 5, the blastocyst stage. Its at this stage we put the embryo back. Majority of clinics would transfer at  the 4-8 cell stage in the early days (primarily bc of poor culture conditions), but with improvements we now do mainly blastocyst ETs which has doubled preg rates. Its bc we select better post embryonic genome activation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the patient is below 35 we usually see a 50-60% blast rate which means we put 1 (or 2) back and then cryopreserve the remaining embryos for later use. Everything is stored for future cycles. Success with frozen embryos is very good now with the introduction of vitrification. Preg rates using fresh or frozen embryos are almost on par if not the same.
In some countries you can store for only 10 years, others for as long as you pay your storage fee!
If you think of a standard cycle anywhere between 10-15 eggs collected, 85% fertilise and 50% blast rate (15 to 12 to 6) then you would use 1 and freeze 5. Of the 6 that make it to blast you might have only 2-4 being genetically normal. Making blastocyst doesn’t guarantee pregnancy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Twins (identicals) occurs at the hatching stage. This is the point where the embryo leaves the shell surrounding it (called the zona pellucida) by hatching out, much like a chicken leaving an egg. This happens on day 6 when the blastocyst has expanded to the point it outgrows its shell. This would also occur when the embryo had finished its journey down the fallopian tube into the uterus where it would implant.
At hatching, the hole would likely be too small and the blast splits in two. A blastocyst is made up of 2 parts, the inner cell mass (which is the fetus) and the trophectoderm (which is the placenta, the sac). It would require splitting of the inner cell mass to give 2 identicals and thus they contain the same genetic makeup. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel that in medicine its very hard to put your opinion into decision making on emotional issues. How can i stop someone doing something that is legal (permitting) bc i dont feel it is the right thing to do. The same debate is with sex selection. Should i intefere and say no just bc i have those set of skills and the ability to do that procedure and thus enforce my opinion on the matter? Its a very tough decision to decide against someone allowed to do it.
That being said i would definitely not be comsidered religious! Given my job.
I just work to get patients pregnant, after that its their decision. but i can say that there are really really some worthy parents to be out there that would do anything for a child, and some that would be terrible as parents and can have them as they wish</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add as well - The oocyte, the egg cell, is huge by most standards and is packed full of strategically located proteins. This is the internal machinery of the cell and it's localization even before fertilization goes a long way towards defining how the daughter cells organize themselves. </p>
<p>So for a very simple example, with the initial cell division, specific proteins called morphogens are concentrated in opposite ends of the cell. When it divides, each daughter cell then contains massively different amounts of these molecules. With each progressive cycle of division, each cells initial internal composition can become increasingly specialized even without external influence.</p>
<p>This is how the zygote works out where to form the head versus the tail, where to grow the early structures of the spinal cord versus the digestive organs etc. The process continues through development and maturity to ensure your cells know where they are and what they are supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>It is known as morphogenesis and was largely a brainchild of Alan Turing. Most of the descriptive mathematics still derive from his contributions. Truely a man of genius who deserves recognition even beyond his role as a giant of Computer Sciences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it's Alan Turings brainchild, but he certainly didn't do any of the research on morphogenesis to be clear. It's kind of an outdated term nowadays anyway, except in the broadest of uses.</p>
<p>Another cool fact is the morphogen gradients the above commenter talked about are part of what are called &quot;maternal-effect genes&quot; because since they only ever come from the oocyte, only the mother's copies of those genes will ever affect the fetus and thus child. A father could have both of his copies of the gene fail completely in his sperm and his progeny would be fine!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turing's 1952 paper <a href="http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf" target="_blank">The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis</a>. You're right, Wolpert is another big name here (among several others), but from what I read during my MSc dissertation anyway, much of the mathematics was initially described by Turing. Prior to that the idea was that the pattern was almost like an exogenous force being applied to the zygote.</p>
<p>I mean its a complex theory in general. I haven't even gotten in to describing the temporal effects here, how these patterns generate new patterns (which is the most important part!), I just wanted to give a quick overview and a nod to a great man who many have heard of but probably don't know of this work of his.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The maternal ancestor of all humans is what is termed Mitochondrial Eve, a theoretical woman living 100k years ago in and around Kenya in a kinship group that shared the exact same maternal mitochondrial sequence that gave rise, in an unbroken matrilinear line, to all humans on earth. </p>
<p>However, just like the genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) undergoes slow mutation that is thought constant. This rate of mutation accumulation is termed the mitochondrial molecular clock. Human mitochondria are thought to acquire these mutations very slowly, perhaps once every 150-200 generations or so because of the immense evolutionary pressure to maintain fidelity of the very small (mtDNA). As you would imagine, since the human diaspora began to occur  around 100k-150k years ago, we have, at most, 30 or 40 point mutations of any person living today when compared to that mitochondrial eve 150k years ago. </p>
<p>This makes mitochondrial lineage mapping inherently imprecice compared to other lineal evaluations (such as Y-chromosome mapping which accumulate mutations once every 10-20 generations ), but it can be done within tolerance, but that at least partially explains why mitochondria lineages have a limit in the diversity of how many variations occur. </p>
<p>Edit: I changed my estimates of mutations (and mutations per generation based on 1 generation being maybe 20 years) an individual might have because the math I did in my head was off by a factor of 10. </p>
<p>One source I used when helping me understand mutational rate was found <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929709001633." target="_blank">here</a> wherein they state</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The substitution rate for the entire molecule was 1.665 × 10−8 (±1.479 × 10−9) substitutions per nucleotide per year, or one mutation every 3624 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>meaning that over 150k years, a single mitochondrial lineage might see roughly 40 mutations over 150k years. Although you can very easily have mutations that occur at the same site because mutations occur in hotspots, meaning that you wouldn't know the actual numbers of mutations a mitochondria has seen if a site changes from an A to a G then 100k years later changes from a G to a T at that exact site. </p></div>		</li>
