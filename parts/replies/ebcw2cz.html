			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because of a phenomenon called physical weathering. The gradual warming and cooling of the rock slowly expands and contracts it, making it fragile and brittle.</p>
<p>So the problem is not only sunlight but mostly the temperature variance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Sunlight is destructive to many mineral specimens. Some specimens will irreversibly turn dark, such as proustite or pyrargyrite, which will become nearly black (on very little exposure – keep these out of sunlight at all times and store them protected!). Vivianite will darken and deteriorate. Realgar too. Many specimens will fade from their vibrant colours to pale ones, or even lose all colour – examples include amethyst, fluorite, barite, celestine, some fluorapatites, topaz… and there are many others. Sulfur, cerussite and other heat-sensitive minerals won’t thank you for sunlight either!&quot;</p>
