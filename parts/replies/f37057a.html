			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, I just wanted to let you know that the entire vertebrate paleo community is heartbroken for you and your colleagues and classmates. The National Museum's collections were amazing, and they are a painful loss to the world. I have been trying to catch people at the meeting to ask for recommendations for you. Two names that have popped up are Annie Hsiou and Hussam Zaher. I will keep asking around and try to pass other suggestions your way as the day goes on.</p></div>		</li>
