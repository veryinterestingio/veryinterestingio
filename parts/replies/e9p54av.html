			<div class="markdown"><p>This year Comcast will make ~$88 billion dollars and pay ~$3.5 billion to their shareholders, which is about 4% of their total revenue.  So no, most of their money is not going to shareholders.  Believe it or not maintaining telecommunications networks is expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair you're not accounting for retained earnings. Money to be reinvested into the company to increase future value. That's also equity which goes &quot;to the shareholders&quot; but not directly, but as a promise/goal of increasing the value of their investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you actually look at their 2017 financial report, about 16% of their revenue went into &quot;Capital Expenditures&quot; which include infrastructure maintenance and expansion. With your 4% to shareholders estimate, that leaves 80% of their revenue on the table.</p>
<p>They spent twice as much on stock repurchases as they did on shareholder dividends and I can guarantee with Trump's new tax breaks they'll have bought back even more in 2018.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And what has Comcast's stock price done in the <em>many, many</em> years since they <em>actually</em> paid for their infrastructure?</p>
<p>When you make money you don't actually need to run the business (ie. further profit), that increases the value of the company, which absolutely &quot;pays&quot; shareholders.  It doesn't require literal dividends for investors to benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Look at the infrastructure now (US anyway). There is almost no upkeep except for bare bones. That's why we don't have fiber yet even though the physical cables are already installed in some places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got fiber... I also pay 108 a month for 50/50 and cable, but if I pay 120 I could get 500mbps and for 150 I can get gbit.  Obviously I'm paying some type of base that's annoying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am skeptical of your statements. Upkeep is CERTAINLY a large expense. Some dick cut all the internet cables on my roof a few weeks ago. There was a technician outside my house before I even called. Do you think his salary is nothing? Also, the reason we don't have fiber varies by location. In my city it is partially because of an agreement that AT&amp;T had with the city that locked out other vendors. Are you just making all that up or do you have something to show me to make me eat my words?</p></div>		</li>
