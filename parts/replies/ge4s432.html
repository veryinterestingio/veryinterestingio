<p>Orgasms are a convenient sleeping aid sometimes. But that's just a body function. I don't want company when peeing either. Something the dog can't understand at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just realized that I'm aesthetically romantically and sensually attracted to some guys. I thought that if I thoughts and guys were hot that that meant I was bisexual but I've never actually considered having sex with them so I was really confused about it.</p>
<p>Also I have a best friend who didn't seem attractive at first but once we became really close I suddenly found myself very attracted to them aesthetically romantically and sensually. </p>
<p>Still it's so really strange sensation to be attracted to do with the fact that the guys that I am attracted to do look kind of feminine. Also it's very very few guys I've ever seen that I've been attracted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since romantic attraction and s=%ual attraction are different, you could just be biromantic and heterosexual, meaning wanting to date 2 (or more) genders while only being s=%ually attracted to people only of the opposite gender. Now if it turns out you're also attracted to the same gender, then you'd be both bisexual and biromantic, then you could just shorten it to bisexual.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an ACE, but this is more or less how I have gotten it explained to me by. If you have a hard time grasping this explanation, just replace &quot;sex&quot; with any other activity (e.g. &quot;dishes&quot;, &quot;exercise&quot;, &quot;cleaning&quot;, &quot;riding a rollercoaster&quot;). Sex has been placed on a weird pedestal in our society...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to recognize though that Sex being treated differently than other activities isn't purely a social construct. Society didn't just place it on a pedestal - it is fundamentally different. We have a huge amount of biological and cerebral machinery specifically tailored to dealing with sex. It's the most important selection factor that directed the evolution of our brains and bodies. </p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that someone would have difficulty suddenly treating sex like any other nonsexual activity, or understanding how that could be done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't work at all. Sex and love and romantic feelings are natural things, governed by hormones and neurotransmitters and sensors on the body. They evolved to happen and the vast majority of people experience them and it's difficult to understand that some people don't.</p>
<p>It's nothing like whether you like/want to do the dishes. A better analogy would be hunger. Hunger and eating are controlled by hormones and neurotransmitters and sensors inside the body. If you haven't eaten in a while, the body releases hunger hormones and suppresses fullness hormones. The smell and look of the food is appealing, and makes you think about eating, and also causes saliva to be produced and the stomach to prepare itself for food. The action of eating itself is pleasurable and rewarding (the brain releases dopamine to tell you good job, you did the thing you need to do), and there is a whole cascade of other processes in the brain and body.</p>
<p>It's the same for sex. It's a set of automatic reactions that evolved to try to get you to reproduce. The body reacts to stimuli, primes itself in various ways (sexual arousal). A male and female human who grew up wild in the woods without human contact would end up having sex because of these natural processes that are built in to us.</p>
<p>Perhaps in some people those processes are absent for some reason. Obviously, low libido or impotence is a separate issue to asexuality, but there is probably some overlap. Having no interest in sex and having no libido are essentially the same thing, and it's usually from hormonal deficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nnnnot really. </p>
<p>- Sexual attraction isn't a 'drive' like hunger. You won't die if you don't get it. It's just a dopamine reward system, like most of the internal forces that influence our actions. It's equally 'natural' to seek out, say, a tree to climb, or to dive into cool water on a hot day. Or, well, a rollercoaster. Naturally, not everyone is wired to enjoy rollercoasters, and not everyone is wired to enjoy sex. It's just a cultural Thing that we tend to set sex apart, acting like it's the pinnacle of human activity. (she said, rolling her eyes so hard they come up natural 20s.)</p>
<p>- Trying to fit human sexual behavior into dawn-of-history speculation tends to be overly reductive at best and falling into 'social Darwinism' pseudoscience at worst. We really can't know what our distant ancestors' attitudes toward sex, attraction, gender identity etc. Is sex just for procreation? Well, it certainly hasn't been for a long ass time. That ought to be enough.</p>
<p>- Attraction and libido aren't the same thing. You can experience little to no attraction but still have plenty of libido - I go through spells where I spend some time with Miz Buzzy several times in a week, pardon the TMI. I think where you're getting confused is that 'having no interest in sex' <em>does</em> map to 'having no libido,' but that's <em>not</em> the same thing as 'having no interest in sex With A Particular Person', which is our working definition of attraction.</p>
<p>- You probably don't know this and I don't mean to get on your case (much), but suggesting that lack of sexual attraction is due to 'hormonal deficiency' or there being something wrong with us... that's aphobic. Like people actually use that as a justification to invalidate our identities and/or inflict violence on us. :\ FYI although there are conditions that supress libido, there's no such thing as a disease whose <em>only</em> symptom is lack of interest in sex.</p>
<p>Okay, I think that covers it.</p></div>		</li>
