			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Rain would probably reduce ambient noise some too if not for the overbalancing sound of the drops hitting the ground.  Just having stuff in the air is going to muffle sound somewhat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although that happens in the spring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other way around.</p>
<p>Damps and dampen are both the correct term to use for making something wet, changing intensity of something ie. sound is dampen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the air.  It's not particularly high density, but the very air that that sound has to travel through also has these flakes continuously scattering and attenuating the sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's more because a pile/layer of snow is really a jumble of a bunch of little things (ice crystals) and air. The surface is rough and porous, so instead of just bouncing cleanly off of it, the sound waves that hit it get more absorbed and scattered in random directions, which weakens the noise level. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated to temp; it's because snow is filled with air pockets where the sound vibrations get trapped, rather than bouncing back off the comparatively solid ground or pavement. </p>
<p>As a loose example, imagine tossing a cup of water against a wall, then doing the same thing with a big hunk of foam on the wall. There will be much more splashing back at you in the former scenario.</p>
<p>*My ELI5 understanding; please correct if inaccurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it's physically occupying space where sound would usually bounce and echo back, snow is lots of tiny angles and surfaces so the sound (which is just vibration) gets absorbed by bouncing around in the snow and the spaces in between instead of bouncing off ground surfaces and making it to your ear. </p></div>		</li>
