			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I've been getting the flu shot every year for the last 17 years, am I significantly more protected against new mutations that might show up in the future?  Or is it useless against those?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read only the last 10 years worth of vaccines will provide protection (though everyone is different). But if you got vaccinated for an influenza strain within 10 years and are exposed to it you should have some protection. As for future mutations, probably not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this foot with the research showing that flu vaccine effectiveness declines by ~5-10% every month and is very low at around 6 months after vaccination, and also the finding that the decline in effectiveness is more pronounced in people who got the vaccine the year before?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really know much about the details, but it's quite variable and depends on a lot of stuff. Ex. If you're older or younger the vaccine might not take as well as if you are an athletic 20 year old. Or perhaps your immune system doesn't take to it for some reason. Regardless, some protection, even if it wears off, is better than no protection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the more people that don't get the vaccine, the more chances it has to mutate and evade the vaccine.  If more people got it, it would make next year's flu vaccine easier to predict. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds logical but is super incorrect due to the way influenza re-assorts and and how antigenic drift occurs. Everyone getting the vaccine just gives more room for the influenza to change strain for the following year. You cannot predict that strain change and you have very little time to react to it seeing as the final decision is made 7 - 8 months before vaccine season. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the UK our vaccines will often only change 1 or 2 of the strains because the circulating main strains are still the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is somewhat true, it’s usually not a year out but is based on seasons of the virus that take into account the northern and Southern Hemisphere so not completely a year out. But as a physician the flu shot is at best an educated guess. Yes that sounds like fodder for antivaxxers but honestly it’s what it is. It’s based on flu present in South America during North American summers and the most recent data from the region.  If we want to be clear about vaccines the yearly flu shot is not comparable nor should it be to things like varicella and mmr, comparing them in quality only discredits our effective vaccines and causes people to believe vaccines are an educated guess. The flu vaccine has no ground on polio mmr and pox vaccines. We should never ever tout it as the same as it causes discredit to the wonderful vaccines we have. It is, ultimately an educated guess: the others are a certainty if anything</p></div>		</li>
