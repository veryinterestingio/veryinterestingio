			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a metrologist (not meteorologist) which means I calibrate test equipment, including thermometers. The process you describe is called traceability, and people who calibrate these types of equipment ensure that every measurement made is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (or your country’s national equivalent) who maintains the highest level of accuracy in their equipment.</p>
<p>These high accuracy devices are then used to calibrate slightly less accurate equipment, which are in turn used to calibrate even less accurate equipment. By the time OP uses his vehicle’s thermometer, the tolerance is almost laughably wide.</p>
<p>That being said, the weather station would be using equipment that is MUCH higher in the chain of traceability, but it’s worth noting that NO measurement in history has been made without <strong>some</strong> level of uncertainty. Generally speaking though, the closer you get to the top of the chain, the less uncertainty you can expect to find in your measurement analysis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah man... I don’t usually tell people I’m a metrologist. I usually say “calibrator” or “precision measurement technician” for this exact reason. Idk why, but it’s infuriating after 3 or 400 times lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, after studying engineering, we’ve learned that <em>no</em> measurement is trustable without an uncertainty tagged onto it. Its statistically improbable to ever get the measurement exactly correct. Even if it <em>is</em> correct, every tool — digital or mechanical — has inherent random imperfections in its measurement capabilities. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty#Simplification" target="_blank">For those interested, this is what we were taught to use to calculate experimental uncertainty</a>. “s_x_i” is the labeled tolerance of the tool. For digital or DAQs, this would be the standard deviation of the random noise measured without inputs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your needed accuracy. While there is always an uncertainity, it does not have to be of an order where it matters for the info. E.g. i dont need to know if it has 30°C or 30.001°C a rough order is enough . So you wouldnt have to add the uncertainity obviously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story, i had learned about uncertainty and propogating the uncertainty through calculations in my physics class before taking my chem 1 class in college. First chem lab, we did a dry run to measure avogadros number using beads. Well i included the uncertainty even though the directions said not to. Well as you might imagine, the uncertainty ended up being quite large, and i ended up having the correct number within my uncertainty range, while we were supposed to get the wrong number as a way of showing us the lack of precision in our measurements. The TA failed my lab report since i got the right answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am meteorologist (not metrologist). The calibration is normally a very small part of the uncertainty budget for temperature observations outside the laboratory. Although with the huge uncertainties mentioned by OP this may be a reason.</p>
<p>It is hard to measure the temperature or the air with a contact thermometer, where the sensor of the thermometer first has to obtain the temperature of the air, because air is a very good isolator. Thus small energy flows can quickly lead to errors.  </p>
<p>More import is normally how well the thermometer is protected from the elements, how much solar radiation gets onto the sensor, how much infrared radiation the sensor emits, whether the sensor is wet and cooled by evaporation, whether the current flowing through the sensor heats it. Ventilation reduces these errors, so how well the natural or forced ventilation works is also important.</p>
<p>Next to this also the surrounding of the thermometer can be a problem. In this case the thermometer does measure the actual air temperature, but this temperature is not representative for the larger region.</p>
<p>Temperatures mentioned in the media are unfortunately not always the high quality measurements of weather services. The meteorological department of the University of Bonn has a weather station in the garden to be able to show the students how the equipment looks like. But this garden is surrounded by buildings and high trees and not suited for precise measurements. The local media still use these values. We have often complained about this, but  they do not care.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that why, growing  up, the weather station always cited what the weather was like at the airport? Because it was a giant open area? </p></div>		</li>

<p>with the huge uncertainties mentioned by OP</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a side note - most common temperature sensors are only accurate to +/- 2F. As in the sensor itself can at best be reliably within 2 degrees of the actual temperature <em>after calibration</em>. You can double the cost of your sensor to get to +/- 1F, or multiply it a few times to get better than that. </p>
<p>Actual uncertainty and the type of uncertainty (bias vs. Gaussian or uniformly distributed noise) depend on the sensor type. OP's range (call it +/- 3 or 4F) isn't great but it's by no means &quot;huge&quot; for standard precision sensors</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;NIST-Traceable&quot; is the keyword to look for if you want a device that meets its accuracy spec. Substitute NIST for your favorite standards organization as appropriate.</p>
<p>The chain of traceable calibration terminates at a primary standard that ultimately ties the measurements to the definition. IIRC for temperature the definition involves absolute zero and the triple point of water. You could probably approximate that yourself quite well, but the metrology rabbit hole runs deep, and if you're not careful you might learn the hard way a dozen reasons why this measurement is more complicated than it appears.</p>
<p>Here are some primary temperature standards. Is anyone here brave enough to request a quote?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually you’re better off reading the certification and looking for the relevant endorsement logo. “NIST-Traceable “, and other country specific NMI names, get used all over the place. Many don’t mean a damn thing for the item you’re looking at.
The term could be used correctly, or it could be used because one of their tools had a calibration by something that was certified. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The thing to look for is an in-date calibration certificate produced by a facility that is ISO 17025 accredited and that specifies the actual standards the instrument was calibrated against. For critical applications you really need  the whole set of such certificates from when the instrument was produced, so that you can make sure that it isn't suffering excessive measurement drift.</p></div>		</li>
