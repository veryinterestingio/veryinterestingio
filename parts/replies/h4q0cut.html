			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more addition, the evaporation is called Hawking radiation, named after Steven Hawking who discovered it.</p>
<p>Basically two opposite forms of matter + and - pop into existence and normally collide and go back out of existence because their opposite. But if the black hole “swallows” the - then the - will destroy a + in the black hole and a + will be left outside the black hole, seeming as if it radiated. If it does the other way, leaving the - outside, the minus will most likely collide with another + somewhere and then the black hole cant use it</p></div>		</li>
