			<div class="markdown"><p>what's actually happening in bourbon is that they didn't up production enough 8 years ago so now there's a huge illegal secondary market that the FBI is getting involved with, people are paying $350 for $45 bottles, and liquor stores are charging 5x-25x MSRP for bottles making the distilleries look bad lol. When distilleries try to raise prices they don't just go for an incremental 10%, they try to match that secondary and double prices overnight so people boycott them for creating false scarcity (looking at you Beam). Any whiskey you see at 3-for-2 on a shelf is probably only good for cooking these days</p></div>		</li>
