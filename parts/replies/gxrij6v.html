			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not really? From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Tulip petals are edible flowers. The taste varies by variety and season, and is roughly similar to lettuce or other salad greens. Some people are allergic to tulips.[64][65]</p>
<p>Tulip bulbs look similar to onions, but should not generally be considered food. The toxicity of bulbs is not well-understood, nor is there an agreed-upon method of safely preparing them for human consumption. There have been reports of illness when eaten, depending on quantity.[66] During the Dutch famine of 1944â€“45, tulip bulbs were eaten out of desperation, and Dutch doctors provided recipes.[67]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Starvation is a hell of a drug. When you haven't eaten in 3 weeks, everything starts to look pretty tasty.</p>
<p>In addition, most humans, especially once we started forming into hunter-gatherer tribes, learned that you can find out if a new plant is poisonous by eating very tiny amounts and gradually increasing if it doesn't hurt you. </p>
<p>Poisonous things aren't lethal until you hit a certain threshold. If you don't eat enough to kill you it will just make you sick, so you can experiment quite a bit with potentially poisonous things when you have a tribe to take care of you while you're laid up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jane Auel's Earth's Children series (Clan of the Cave Bear etc.) are great novels for getting a feel for what this might have been like. They're not super historically accurate (the main liberty being that the main character invents like 10 major pieces of technology that would actually have been separated by millennia), but they're strongly grounded in science and try to paint a picture of what life would actually have been like. Answers such questions as &quot;how did we figure out what's edible&quot;, &quot;how did we figure out how making babies works&quot;, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also you can rub them on your skin and if you react its poisonous. If not, it might be safe to eat. It's not a foolproof way to tell if something is safe, but it is foolproof to tell if something isn't. If you get a rash, you can't eat it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main way humans learn whether or not something is food when in an unfamiliar environment is by watching animals and what they eat. Doesn't translate perfectly every time, but it's a good way to stay alive if your tribe walked to a new ecosystem and suddenly don't recognize the flora.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medicine men in different cultures. They learned through handed down knowledge. One technique that has been found is that that go walk, find something different in a certain stage of its life cycle, then first rub it on sensitive skin like your wrist, then later or a different day, on their lips, then gums, then eventually eat a little bit.</p>
<p>So basically careful experimentation and handed down knowledge.</p>
