			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that last part is because they have already done all the color correcting necessary, which is possible because they have built the set ahead of time and already know exactly what everyone is going to be wearing.  basically they just did the color correcting work once, probably years before you saw that episode taped, and they did not have to do it again because that would have just been reinventing the wheel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BBT is probably unique even among sitcoms though in the sense that virtually nothing changes. It is the same handful of characters (often with no extras in an entire episode) and how many episodes take place solely within the apartment building (Sheldon/Leanard's living room space, and the stairs to penny's apartment) often with little to no outside...well anything besides two characters talking to each other MAYBE a third walks into the scene and joins the conversation</p></div>		</li>
