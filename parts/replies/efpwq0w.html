			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding a bit to this correct answer:</p>
<p>What causes the air you let into the fridge to chill in this case is not the electrical &quot;chilling&quot; effect of the fridge itself, it's all the already-cold items that are in the fridge. Warm air contacts all that stuff and instantly gets robbed of its heat, causing it to shrink and decreasing its relative air pressure. So you get a little less atmospheric pressure INSIDE than OUTSIDE, and all that extra pressure gets added as &quot;weight&quot; of a sort to the door, until you crack the seal.</p>
<p>The effect is even more pronounced for freezers, either chest or upright. When they're full of cold food, any air entering the freezer chills a lot, and almost immediately to, so their suction can be very strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Same thing happens to our -80c freezer. Super hard to reopen after closing it. Can be kind of a pain actually if you close it and immediately remember you forgot to grab something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooooh, that would be a fun cold weather experiment! </p>
<p>Two balloons. One hot, one cold. You blow up both inside in the heat, but only tie off one. Both are the same size for now. You pinch off the untied one, take it outside. Watch it shrink. Unpinch, blow it up some more, pinch it, let it cool. Repeat until they are both the same size, but one is cold, the other is hot. </p>
<p>Then bring the cold one inside, check if they drop at different rates, and wait until the cold one explodes!</p>
<p>It would be a good way to explain how heat makes small things bounce around. </p></div>		</li>
