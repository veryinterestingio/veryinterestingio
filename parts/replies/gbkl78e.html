<p>yea! i was just thinking this. anesthesia is a miracle of modern medicine, its amazing - but at the same time.. </p>
<p>i think a lot of people don't understand how insane anesthesia actually is. shits like wading in the river styx. you aren't just <em>asleep,</em> you're probably about as close to being dead as you're ever going to be without actually dying, and the longer you're under..the deeper you're wading, really. its just hard on the body, especially if the person is already ill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually have dreamless sleep, but when I got anesthetized for an exam I woke up feeling so rested, but with sore throat die to the test; that is the best sleep I've ever had and long for my yearly checkup to do it again, I have a lot of trouble sleeping and resting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a non 0 percent chance you just won't wake up after anesthesia and they still don't really know why or who it will happen to. I had surgery 4 times last year for cancer and you have to sign paperwork every single time to say you know you might not wake up. Not the greatest headspace to be in before surgery, but that's the reality of what's happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an anesthesiologist and I dispute that anesthesia is particularly dangerous. Risk of death from an Anesthetic is about 1 in 100,000. It's not zero, but it is extremely unlikely. We are trained to take into account people's medical conditions and would not give an Anesthetic if the risk of death is too high.</p>
<p>For comparison, risk of a car crash when travelling 1000 miles is 1 in 366, but we don't think twice about getting in a car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only painful side effect of the chemo I had over 20 years ago was neuropathy in my feet, and it's still there today because the nerves were permanently damaged. Not much that anesthetic can do for that.</p>
<p>Im glad OP asked this because it seems to have informed a whole bunch of people about what chemotherapy is and how it affects people. I got chemo weekly for 6 months and I never saw anyone else in the chemo room (ward? clinic? Club lol?) at the hospital getting the same drugs (some of them are strikingly colored, like one of mine which looked like I was being infused with cherry Kool-aid.)</p></div>		</li>
