			<div class="markdown"><p>The dehydration can also cause that &quot;shake&quot; as it makes it harder for connective tissue to transmit signals.</p>
<p>Think of it as your brain delivering the signal to your muscles and connective tissue as part of the road the truck with information from your brain takes. As you become dehydrated it deteriorates the condition of the road so the car will have a harder journey, maybe over a bumpy road, which means some of the instructions fall off the trailer and your muscle doesn't know how to react with the strange instructions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it’s pretty common knowledge that lactic acid builds up but it’s actually something called lactate which is pretty different but has a similar name. To be honest I sounded pretty sure in the first comment but my source is my exercise physiology class so that doesn’t make me an expert. </p></div>		</li>
